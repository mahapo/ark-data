Perhaps it still exists. But if it does, it is well hidden, carefully guarded by a descendant o f the man who stole it from ...and killed its right ful owner. Its rightful owner, however, left a widow. And a so n. His widow married a close friend of her deceased husband one of only a handful of men in the entire world wh o had a copy of the original manuscript, which the English translation had been made. And so, despite the fact that his father’s copy had disappeared, the “widow ’s son” inherited the manuscript and passed it on to his de scendants. And then by a series of coincidences, the chains th at bound the secret was broken. The chain of succes sion was broken when one of the descendants bequeathed the manuscript not to his son’s son, but to his daughte r’s son. The chain of ideology was broken when one of the de scendants was converted by his Christian wife. The chain of silence was broken when one of the descendants t ranslated the manuscript into French—and sought oth er linguists who would translate it and publish it in other languages. And so it went from French to Arab ic to Spanish to English. The secret association, conceived in the mind of an other “widow’s son more than 19 centuries ago, is n o longer secret. Was it coincidence? Or was it the hand of G od?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 DEDICATION of Awad Khoury (translator of the work from French to Arabic) to all the Masons of the World Dear Brothers: Before presenting this History, I extend my greetin gs to you from the depths of my heart. To whom, mor e deserving than you, could this History be dedicated ? Who, other than you, has a greater right to read it and to have it? Who, other than the owner of the house, is the one who should investigate what happens in the house, good or ill, beneficial or harmful and which is und er his roof? And, if someone knows nothing of his parents, would it not be his duty to investigate who they are, to know their origin and ancestry? Wouldn’t one be ignorant who takes a beverage witho ut finding out its ingredients? One who wears a sui t, should he not determine if it is clean or if it is contaminated with contagious bacteria? All these al lusions pertain to the case of a member of an association w ho knows nothing of its origin, its past, its found er, the history of the foundation and the principles of the association. Who is that member who is ignorant of what he should not be ignorant? We are THE MASONS, who for 19 centuries have not kn own the origin or the past of our association! The Founders hid that secret with rare cunning, in the cloaks of the occult, as you will see. They hid it from their own “brothers” from the beginning to the pres ent, in spite of the endless investigation of histo rians. Guided by God, 1 have found this History. And since this is a discovery so longed-for by the seekers o f historic truth, it would not be gallant to leave it in obscu rity before you in particular and the rest in gener al, forbidding you its benefits. I consider its concealment a betr ayal, an act of cowardice, a crime. This is my reason for translating this work to the Arabic lang uage and for publishing it. To serve history, science and the readers themselves, especially you, dear “brothers,” not doubting that this action of mine will find among you, the wise and the rest of the people , looking beyond all your religious and political d ifferences, the value it deserves. I call on you to read this H istory with discernment and meticulousness, with conscientiousness and an open mind, offering you my fervent greetings.

In the year 1863 he acquired t he title of Doctor of Law. In 1864 he was elected a member o f the council of Piracicaba. In 1867 he was a membe r of the Chamber of Deputies of Sao Paulo. In 1885, on J anuary 9 th , he was elected Deputy of the 8 th District of Sao Paulo. On December 3 rd ,1889,he was named by the Provisional Government of the Republic, Governor of Sao Paulo until October 18 th , 1890, the day on which he was appointed Senator. On November 21 st of the same year, he assumed the Presidency of the Constituent Assemb ly with 146 votes opposed to 80. In the first days of March of 1894 he triumphed by a smashing majority in the presidential elections, assuming the Presidency on November 15 th , 1894. He was an example without precedent in self-sacrifi ce and justice, attaining the friendship, good will and trust of all the people and all the politicians of the na tion. He died December 13,1902. Résumé of the Autobiography of Awad Khoury I was born in Chiah (Beirut), Lebanon in January of 1871. I received a Christian education through my parents, the orthodox priest Yousef Antun Garios EI Khour y and Naila Mansur Fagale. I studied in the local elementary school, acquiring the title of teacher of Arabic and French, after h aving finished my secondary studies in special courses. M y students were numerous, some of them being outsta nding personalities, as, for example, Prof. Wadih Naim, w ho came to be president of the College of Lawyers o f Lebanon. Spurred on by my aspirations to a brilliant future, that I could not attain by means of the profession of teacher, I journeyed to France to study Pasteur’s system of ra ising silkworms; my studies ended, I became an indu strial merchant in that profession. Seeking a better futur e and perhaps by the natural instinct of my adventu resome race, I abandoned everything and journeyed to Brazi l, where I had the opportunity of meeting Dr. Prude nte de Moraes, President of the Republic of Brazil, who co mmended to me the task of recoding the private affa irs of the Presidency, from February 15, 1896 until Septem ber 12, 1897. During this period the President intr oduced me to the owner of this History, as will be seen in the following pages. For reasons of health I journ eyed to France. My health regained, and at the repeated ins istence of my parents, I returned to Lebanon. I jou rneyed to France again and, on returning, met in Istanbul, Mu zaffar Pasha, who appointed me his secretary. We jo urneyed together to Beirut, where, because of a royal intri gue and the discovery of my affiliation with the As sociation, “Young Turkey,” from which I had two decorations of merit, I renounced my charge. At that time an attempt was made to integrate Leban on in the Turkish Congress, “Mabhuthan.” Such an at tempt provoked my reaction, and I published a book with r espect to this, entitled, “Lebanon in Danger.” My n ame was inscribed on the black list, and I was persecuted b y Jamal Pasha, a governor more merciless than the I mperial Ottoman, which obliged me to take refuge with my fa mily in the vicinity of a convent of religious unti l the end of the World War. My encounter with the owner of this History Do not be surprised, dear reader, if I declare fran kly to you that I was one of the extraordinarily nu merous seekers and investigators eager for the History of the foundation of the Masonic Association and of th e principal reason for its foundation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 All my efforts toward that intention were in vain. Many times I had serious discussions with my “broth ers,” after having become an affiliate in the association . I struggled terribly to penetrate its secrets throu gh the high degrees that I could scale through my a ctivity. I arrived at nothing. My destiny was similar to the d estiny of thousands before me, whose search ended i n failure. I almost forgot the objective that I had dreamed of so because the journey was so long. On that long j ourney I arrived at one point that I could not pass: the poi nt of resignation before that hermetic secret. The secret of the foundation of Masonry. My political occupations, es pecially, obliged me to neglect that objective, now , for me unattainable. And one day, providentially, I met Mr. Lawrence, so n of George, son of Samuel, son of Jonas, son of S amuel Lawrence, thanks be to God and to Dr. Prudente de M oraes, President of Brazil, who introduced him to m e. Mr. Lawrence is the owner of this History (the Hebr ew manuscript) that I present to the reader transla ted into Arabic, and he is, at the same time, the last heir of one of the nine founders of the association (The Mysterious Force), as will be seen later. Within a short period of time, we forged strong cha ins of growing friendship. We agreed to translate t he manuscript to Arabic and Turkish, directly from the French version, one of the languages in which it w as written. I would make two copies, one for Mr. Lawrence, and the other would remain in my poss ession, so it could be published in Arabic and Turkish countries. In these countries I would have exclusive rights o f translation, reproduction, editing and publishing i n the two languages. Before finishing the reading of the History, and be fore signing the agreement, in one of the meetings held with Dr. Moraes and my new friend, Lawrence, I asked the President: “Every history has its proofs or eviden ces on behalf of impartial historians; in our history, on what evidences or proofs can we rely besides those of its owners?” Behold the answer given. by Dr. de Moraes, confirme d by the owner of the manuscript: “What proof will a history such as this have, one that was hidden amon g nine men and their respective successors, known o nly to them, the first and only one of its kind, if no one saw it or read even the least part of its contents , except the nine? From whence and from whom can come the proofs to which you allude? The proofs, then, are: their testimony, the events that happened until our days, and the detailed investigations of wise historians who worked in vain to explain its secret. Moreover, as every history, the first and oldest of its kind, re quires the investigation of subsequent historians who confirm its texts after having seen and read it, but this H istory . . .who read it? Who saw it, except the nine founders and their respective successors? We, you and I, unt iring readers and investigators of the origin of Masonry, have this manuscript before us. I, who have read a nd analyzed it; based on my studies and investigations , assert its veracity and recommend its translation and publication. Dr. de Moraes’ answer inspired confidence in me and awakened my enthusiasm to carry out the work commended. I began to work eagerly, spurred on by t he thought that my new friend would cease being so, and would not persist in his agreement. Despite Mr. Law rence’s requirement that the translation (from Fren ch to Arabic) be realized in his own house, the developme nt of the work was carried out to perfection, in tw o copies, as he asked. The work being concluded in the year 1897, one copy remained in Mr. Lawrence’s possession and the othe r in my possession. I considered it an indescribable tre asure and an invaluable relic. In the year 1898 I r eturned to my country, Lebanon, taking the aforementioned copy with me."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 Comparison of this History with prior knowledge of Masonry Once in Lebanon, I began a series of studies, inves tigations and comparisons, making use of everything published with respect to this. These tasks of cons ulting the different authorities concerning the mat ter took long years. The war from 1914 to 1918 occasioned an obligatory recess. The conflict ended, I renewed t he investigation requesting, through correspondence, f rom Grand Orients, institutions of high rank and im portant newspapers, details concerning the existence of a h istory that treats of the date of the foundation an d the origin of Masonry. I sent letters to London, Paris, New Yo rk, Cairo, Berlin, Madrid and Rome, obtaining the f ollowing scant replies: From the prestigious newspaper, “EI Mukattam:” “The oldest historical evidence of the history of Mason ry dates, according to some, from 1217. According to o thers, from 1390. Ancient Masonic authors claim tha t Masonry dates from the era of Moses. We have no con firmation of this. Our cordial greetings.” From the Egyptian National Grand Orient: “We do not possess any confirmation of the date of the founda tion of Masonry. The only thing we know is that, in the yea r 1917 a booklet was published, entitled: (Two Cent uries of Freemasonry).” Knowing through later references that this booklet is one of the most important documents on which the Masons depend, I began to seek it, finding it in th e Library of International Masonic Affairs in New C astle. From the Grand Orient in London: “We lack certain d ata concerning the date of the foundation of Masonr y. We do know that it already existed in the year 1717.” From the rest of the cities mentioned I received no reply whatever, from which I deduced: their silenc e indicated their ignorance concerning the mystery. Then, on the basis of all the previous studies, in the light of the events that happened in the last t wo and a half centuries to date, a lapse characterized by a perma nent conflict between Masonry on the one hand and Mohammedanism on the other, and in view of the text s of this History we present, all substantiated by the documented booklet, “Two Centuries of Masonry,” the re is no doubt concerning the authenticity of this manuscript. My Intentions Aided by Providence which guided me miraculously to ward this discovery, I have decided definitely to p ublish this History. On doing so, I am not moved either by personal interest or by the hope of profit; if so, I might not have waited more than a quarter of a century. My intentions are: To keep the promises and the agr eement made. To dissipate the darkness that, for ni neteen centuries has enveloped a humanity that is wavering in doubt. To reveal this mystery tothe eyes of men to alert them before this cruel danger. I must point out, as well, that I was inspired by t he exclusively Christian intentions of de Moraes, i n accord with one of his declarations that states thus: “With thi s action of ours we extend to the Christian religio n a great benefit, eliminating the forces of evil that attack it, from this fantasy encrusted by the absurd. And you, especially, with your task in the Turkish Empire, w ill extend another great service to the Muslim reli gion.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 I pray to God that this work may be a beacon for al l in general, and in particular that it may illumin ate the minds of the reduced number of heirs who successively gua rd the monopolized manuscript.

And Mr. Awad Khoury of Chich (Lebanon) near Beirut-Syri a, at present a merchant in Rio de Janeiro and char ged with the private affairs of His Excellency, Dr. Pru dente de Moraes, President of the Republic of Brazi l. The following has been agreed upon: Mr. Lawrence, last heir and sole proprietor of the History, THE MYSTERIOUS FORCE (ancient Hebrew manuscript) says: My father and grandparents, who h ave bequeathed this History, apparently have not considered that the Arabic and Turkish languages ar e two rich and important languages; and that Arabia and Turkey are two immense countries and in all their r egions Freemasonry is now widespread. Therefore, I have considered it necessary to propag ate our History, mentioned above, in said countries , translated to Arabic and later to Turkish, so that it will be published there and known as much as pos sible by all those who speak and understand said languages. Having just had “the honor of meeting Mr. Awad Khou ry; and considering the good intentions of my fathe r and his ancestors, and according to their Wills succes sively made for the propagation of our History: I agree with Mr. Awad that he should translate to A rabic and later to Turkish our History, print it an d propagate it in Arabia and in Turkey, reserving to himself al one all the rights of translation, reproduction, ed ition and publication in those two languages. I prohibit him, as my father has prohibited me, to augment, omit or change a single word of the Histor y; he is engaged to translate it word for word, in such a wa y that it remains textually as it is. All of this c omprises my great obligation to formally carry out the intentio ns of our ancestors, the principal proprietors of t he History they have left to us successively from the origin t o my father and me. My acquaintance with Mr. Awad Khoury was brought ab out by His Excellency Dr. de Moraes who merits my gratitude for that introduction. Mr. Awad says: I accept, with full consent the clau ses in this agreement and I bind myself to carry th em out textually when circumstances permit it, when no obs tacle impedes me. This agreement was drawn up in private between the two of us, in the presence only of Dr. de Moraes an d with his most excellent advice. The two of us have requested him to permit the ment ion of his honorable name in the History; he has re plied thus: “If you succeed in printing it during my life , there is no need to mention my name; but if I die before the appearance of this History, no obstacle will impede your declaring the details of this historic audien ce and the mention of my name; in any case, whether living or dead, mentioned or not mentioned, I wish you all pr ogress and pleasure, equaling mine, with respect to this H istory.” Mr. Lawrence is bound, finally, so that from now on he will not be able to engage anyone, nor authoriz e anyone other than Mr. Awad Khoury to translate this Histor y to Arabic and Turkish."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 Finally, we invoke the kindness of God so He may gr ant to our agreement His most exalted and divine protection.

The other part pertains to some of my ancestors, wh o inherited and bequeathed this History. How many learned men and historians who carried out lengthy investigations to come to know the. histor y of the foundation of the Masonic association and its t rue origin arrived at no conclusion. Their efforts were in vain. Some believe that the origin of the Masonic associa tion goes back to Adam, others believe that it goes back to Moses, others to David, others to Solomon, others t o Christ, etc., etc. Innumerable are those who spent their time in the s earch without coming to realize their longings. The number of investigators who, together with their relatives , friends and helpers, met their downfall in this w ork is incredible. To the aforementioned are added all the heads of the religions of all the world, especiall y in Europe, Turkey, Egypt and America. Whom else should I add? I would add the Masonic family itself, including th e Presidents of the Grand Orients, the Presidents of the Lodges, and the affiliates who hold high degree s; except the Nine Men who have, respectively, inherited from their corresponding ancestors, the secret of the f oundation of the Mysterious Force. I would also add kings, nobles and governors, wise men, discoverers and investigators. Historians, aut hors; writers and poets. Orators, legislators and journal ists. Lawyers, judges, doctors and pharmacists. Mer chants, industrialists and sportsmen. Even the illiterate t o whom this investigation would not belong. All the se mentioned, integrated in the different classes of t he community, Masons and non-Masons, form a true ar my that pursues the secret. I divide these investigators into three groups: 1. The historians who spend their days and nights in s tudy and reading trying in vain to come to know the secret of the true history of the foundation of Mas onry. 2. The learned authors who try to establish something about the secret. All in vain; yet they continue wi th their studies without having reached their goal. 3. The associates and their collaborators who have not gotten anywhere in spite of their efforts."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 It is deplorable. All the investigations come to no thing, they have not achieved any result! The numbe r of those investigators, from the foundation of the associati on up to our days (the end of the 19 th century) can be estimated in the hundreds of thousands. I received these truths from my father, who in turn received t hem from his father, and he from his father, retrospectively to the origin of the lineage: the Nine Founders in the year 43 after Christ. Thus it is that I, Lawrence, son of George, son of Samuel, son of Jonas, son of Samuel Lawrence, of Ru ssian origin, the last descendant of the descendants of o ne of the owners of this History, say: I inherited from my father a manuscript composed by our ancestors in the Hebrew language and translate d by one of them to the Russian language. Another of the m translated it to English. Our ancestor, Jonas, introduced in the manuscript a series of events; this History, thus, being produc ed by him and his ancestors. Jonas arranged it and divided it into two sections. He wanted to publish it, but va rious obstacles impeded it: health, economic means and po litical events. He and his wife, Janet, conceived t he idea of the publication of this History; on finding themsel ves incapable of doing so, they commended its publi cation to their son, my grandfather, Samuel. Jonas died witho ut seeing his longing fulfilled. My grandfather, Samuel, the son of Jonas, who was t he son of Samuel Lawrence, here addresses his words to his son, George, my father. Samuel said to his son, George: Son: Here you see these introductions headed by a l ist of names. These names correspond to the success ive heirs of this History since the renewal of the asso ciation (The Mysterious Force) when it changed its name to “Freemasonry.” They include: Joseph Levy. Joseph Levy is one of the renewers of the associati on. He is a Jew and an heir of the History from his ancient ancestors who, in turn, inherited it from Moab Levy , one of the nine founders. It was our ancestor, Joseph, who conceived the idea of changing the name of the association (The Myste rious Force) to Freemasonry and of reforming the statutes . Here you have the details: He was sent to London wi th his son, Abraham, and a friend named Abraham Abi ud, all Jews, descendants of the heirs of the History a nd very well financed. 1 They had made efforts to enter another city and, not having success, they headed f or London. There they met two influential and knowledgeable persons who served as suitable elemen ts to accomplish their purposes. They are: John Desaguliers and a companion called George. 2 After having strengthened the friendship among them selves, Joseph Levy revealed the name of the associ ation, “The Mysterious Force,” and related to his two frie nds, in synthesis and with discretion, some parts o f the History, concealing its fundamental secrets. He als o made it known to them that for a long time it was inactive, almost dead, needing for its renewal the change of name and the reform of the statutes in such a way t hat the new statutes and the changed name might attract man y members. Thus it would grow.   1 The manuscript does not mention who sent and financed th em, nor the place of their departure, but it is understood that their country was Russia. Nor does it mention why they chose London; It is thought that they selected it because it was one of the la rgest capitol cities. In London they met Desaguliers, an ambitious man and one with definite and special goals, as will be seen. 2 In the Hebrew manuscript and its French version, Abra ham Abiud said: I believe that George is his first name. Desa guliers always called him George. Our arrangements were with Desaguliers, but he was always present at the meetings and participated In t he discussions"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 With eloquence and cleverness, Joseph Levy succeede d in convincing his two friends, Desaguliers and Ge orge, of the necessity of reviving the association. Havin g achieved this initial success, they separated on condition that they would meet again, each one of them bringi ng three names appropriate for the new association, from which the specific name would come. The next meetin g was held ten days later. Each one presented his n ames, the one approved being one of those proposed by Jos eph Levy: FREEMASONRY. It was August 25, 1716. Abraham, son of Joseph Levy, who had witnessed the two sessions, said: This name had preference over t he others for two reasons. First, because it is the sa me name that some Italian architects adopted in the 13 th century (Freemasons). And second, because it was a suitable expression of the ancient signs and symbols used i n the association, The Mysterious Force; symbols that per tained to construction and to architecture, propose d by Hiram Abiud, one of the founders, for the purpose o f concealing the origin of the Association, attribu ting it to epochs prior to Jesus. In the Second Section surpri sing details concerning this matter will be seen. D esaguliers approved the words of my father, adding: “In the third place, present-day architects and bui lders have associations, syndicates and lodges wher e they gather to fortify and dignify their profession. Wit h this name, then, we can gather all in a single as sociation without anyone’s knowing our purposes.” And fourth , these two terms, ‘Masonry,’ (Construction) and ‘Mason,’ that are encountered since antiquity, will be a thick veil over the secret of the origin of t he foundation; and, besides, without doubt, they will increase the prestige of the Association. Our ancestor, Abraham Levy, before his death, added : 3 “Desaguliers specified that those people who joine d the lodges before 1717 in London were masons, 4 in the sense that they were engineers, architects, builders, apprentices, but they had no connection with the As sociation, The Mysterious Force, that began true Ma sonry.” For that purpose five men met: Levy, Desaguliers, and the companions mentioned above and they approve d the addition of the term, “Free,” thus unequivocally co ncealing the date of its foundation from the rest o f the people in general and the members and associates in partic ular. John Desaguliers and his companion began to demand that Levy show him the History. Levy had made it known to them that it was translated into English, that three of the inherited manuscripts had been lo st recently, four had been lost long ago, and there remained onl y his manuscript and one other. 5 Such declarations excited Desaguliers and George extremely, the reason why th ey insisted on the need for a suitable copy so that with said copy it would be much easier for them to form the n ew statute. They showed themselves so faithful to t he principles, desires and doctrines of Levy that they succeeded in convincing him to deliver a copy to t hem. It was delivered to them. A time passed during which they read it. The five met again and decided to summon some frien ds on the pretext of establishing a “Unitive Associ ation.” The true purpose was the renewal of the Association , the Mysterious Force, its resurrection with the n ew name agreed upon by the five and the restoration of the first Principal Lodge (Jerusalem). Thus Levy wanted it. 6 On March 10, 1717 they invited several architects a nd acquaintances. The invited were presided over by a wise man named Dr. James Anderson, who was a friend of D esaguliers. After lengthy discussions they reached an accord and designated June 24, 1717, to realize a g reat meeting. 7   3 Each one of the heirs, owners of the manuscript, added what happened in his epoch. 4 Mason: an English word that means stoneworkers. 5 It Is the manuscript of Abraham Abiud. It is the one whose translation we have on hand. 6 Abraham Levy said: \"My father was determined to found several lodges with this name, and to spread the mission of the As sociation throughout the world. Desaguliers demanded to accompany him but my father refused, making it known that his only c ompanions would be his son and his relative.\" 7 It is the anniversary of Masonry. Ridiculously the monop olizers of the secret declare that they celebrate the feast of St. Joh n."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 15 Meanwhile Levy was preparing his son, Abraham, for the great events of the future. Days later Abraham Levy journeyed to Portugal accompanied by Abraham Abiud, his relative. 8 The latter is the descendant of Hiram Abiud, one of the founders, and owner of this copy. Between March 10 and June 24 a great conflict was b egun between Levy and Desaguliers and George becaus e of their refusal to return the copy. (This conflict ended with the assassination of Levy and the disap pearance of the aforementioned English copy, the Hebrew copy an d all Levy’s papers. The details of this event are recorded in the Second Section of this History, where the pr incipal motives for the assassination of our ancest or, Joseph Levy, are made known.) Abraham& Joseph Levy said!: “The meeting was realiz ed on June 24, 1717, and the first Lodge was founde d after a violent discussion (as some of those who we re present at the meeting related to me on my retur n from Portugal) during which my father insisted energetic ally that it be called the Lodge of Jerusalem, in a ccord with the agreement established between him and Desagulie rs and George. Some applauded it, but the majority decreed that it be called the grand Lodge of Englan d. Nevertheless, for a short period of time it was called the Lodge of Jerusalem, 9 but at the insistence of the majority it was defin itively changed to the Grand Lodge of England. There was another conflict over the dispu te for the Presidency between Levy and Desaguliers; Two months after that meeting, Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud returned from Portugal. His surprise was indescribable and his weeping unrestrained on his b eing informed of the disappearance of Joseph Levy i n such an absurd and hidden manner. (We will see the detai ls later.) Here it is necessary to mention the names of the su ccessive heirs of this History, from our ancestor, Joseph Levy, the re-newer of the Association, down to me, Lawrence.

This Hiram is not Hiram Abiff, the ancien t Syrian architect who built the Temple of Solomon, as some of the “mysterious ones” and later their su ccessors, the Masons, believed. 11 (More details in the second section.) 3. Moab Levy, our first ancestor. The names of the other Founders are recorded in the Second Section, with the exception of one whose na me is illegible, almost erased in the Hebrew manuscript. My grandfather, Samuel, again addresses his words t o his son, George, my father: “My son, you have observed that I am interested in the publication of this History. You have witnessed my agreement with the owner of the print shop that wil l be in charge of editing it in the Hebrew language . “That man is exposed constantly to death. ”Your grandfather could not fulfill his desires to publish this book because death took him by surpris e. But he had already recommended that I publish it. Now, I s ay to you: If I am not able to have this satisfacti on, or if I begin the publication and do not finish it, I charg e you to give this History the great importance it merits. The History that I will deliver to you before dying. Th us I will comply with the obligation for its succes sion. “But; son, I must demand one condition of you in or der to be able to deliver the secret to you. You mu st collaborate with me with all serenity and absolute discretion. “Now, listen: in the first place you must dominate the English and French languages, and later transla te this History literally to those languages. It will then be written in four languages: Hebrew and Russian by our ancestors, English and French by you. The copy in E nglish that existed disappeared with Levy, as you s aw. Put all your attention into its publication in the lang uages mentioned. If it is not possible for you to d o so, you will be able to ask the collaboration of whoever may hav e financial resources. By whatever means, you must utilize all the means within your reach to be able to achie ve the publication of this book in all the world, i n accord with the desire of your grandfather, Jonas, and the will of your grandmother, Janet. “Son, you must know that I inherited this History f rom my father and he from his parents and grandpare nts in a manner contrary to the hereditary law legislated by the nine Ancestor Founders of the Association, as will be seen below. “The Copy was inherited with indescribable reserve and caution, in absolute secrecy. The father bequea thed it only to one of his male children, the one who disti nguished himself among his brothers for his wisdom, seriousness and judgment. And if the father had no male child, the most serious and responsible of the direct and close family members inherited it, without goin g beyond the second degree of consanguinity. That i s: the heir must be male, a son, nephew or cousin (on the father’s side), and no farther, so this secret migh t be hidden among just nine men, descendants of the nine Founde rs. “My father inherited the manuscript from his mother , and not from his father in accord with the abovementioned law. Then, in this respect, our inhe ritance is contrary to the tradition that obliges t he successor not to bequeath it except to male children. Joseph Levy is my ancestor on my mother’s side as we have already seen.”   10 Members of the Association, \"The Mysterious Force.\" 11 Note of the Translator to Arabic: And as I believed before di scovering this History."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Here you have the enumeration of the successive hei rs of this History from the renewal of the Associat ion, 1716-1717, down to us. The ancestor renewer, Joseph Levy, lacking the tale nts of an historian, copied synthetically, with the collaboration of Abraham Abiud the two manuscripts inherited by him and that of his own respective anc estors from the year 43 after the “Impostor Jesus,” 12 the year of the foundation of the Association. The two manuscripts were, logically, exactly the same. After the return of Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud from Portugal, the former, accompanied by Abiud, addressed himself to Desaguliers and George, asking about his father. These two made it known to him t hat they had not seen him for a certain period of time and they believed he had gone to Portugal. Abraham Levy, after that interview, dedicated himse lf to investigating the conspiracy. From the earlie r relationship between his father and Desaguliers and George, Abraham Levy inferred that they were the assassins. He decided then to take revenge by his o wn methods. He began to cultivate the friendship of Desaguliers and George, making it known to them that he wanted to enter the Association to fill the post of his fathe r, who, with their knowledge, had been preparing hi m for it. The friendship, on each occasion, increased: the strate gy was successful. When an opportunity arose, Abraham Levy and Abraham Abiud invited George to take an outing through the suburbs of the city. There they killed their enemy, the event remaining an hermetic secret. This crime was kept concealed, like the crime whose victim was Joseph L evy. They decided later to assassinate Desaguliers, the principal actor in the murder of Joseph Levy, and f or that reason, he began a zealous vigil, awaiting the mome nt to realize his goal. A short time later, Abraham Levy died, a victim of tuberculosis, two years after his marriage to Esther. From his son, Nathan, who was quite small at Abraha m’s death, we have inherited the History in the fol lowing manner: Abraham Levy’s widow, Nathan’s mother, married Abra ham Abiud, the companion, associate and relative of her dead husband. Abraham Abiud cherished Nathan as if he were his own son, especially because he had none. Abraham Abiud and Nathan, his wife’s son, were then the only heirs and possessors of the only known He brew manuscript 13 , the one from Abiud’s descent, because the other, from Levy’s descent, disappeared with Joseph Levy. Nathan grew up and married. He had only one daughte r to whom he gave the name Esther, his mother’s nam e. 14 Nathan arranged for the marriage of his daughter, E sther, to Samuel Lawrence, who was not of his (Levy ’s) descent. Not having male children, nor close family members, Nathan delivered the History to his grand son, Jonas, the son of Esther and Samuel Lawrence, as le gal heir. This is the illegality in the inheritance , because Jonas is not a descendant on his father’s side, as the law requires. This Jonas is my father and the o ne from whom, naturally, we have received this History.   12 We leave the term \"Impostor\" as it is, making it clear that we d o not use the term; it is rather that of the ancestor founders . 13 That is the copy we have on hand. 14 See the list on page 23."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Our inheritance is legal, indeed, and we received f rom him another inheritance: the Christian Religion , because he married a Christian Protestant named Janet, the daughter of John Lincoln, and converted to Christia nity. Jonas was the one who translated this History to Po rtuguese, 15 dividing it into two Chapters and adding confirmed truths and the revelations of investigati ons. From him I inherited the History just as you s ee it. He and Janet, his wife, conceived the idea of publishi ng it. As events impeded his publishing it, he urge d me not to spare any effort to do it. He told me once: “If the events that impede my publishing the History persi st, you, Samuel, must do whatever is possible to print it an d publish it.” I, too, oh such bad luck! have had misfortunes beca use of my illnesses, as you see. If I am not cured, I ask you as your grandfather asked me. On you, George, on yo u alone depends the fulfillment of the testimony. From the text of this History, you now know that yo ur grand father, Jonas, was not of the descent of t he founders of the Association. We deduce, then, that the violation of Jonas of the right of inheritance of this book and his adoption of the Christian Religion were the reasons for his assassination and disappearance be fore fulfilling his desires. Our efforts to find out how he died were in vain. It is a secret. Our original sect, the Jewish sect, on the whole, w ould know nothing of this secret, nor of the secret of the foundation of the Association, nor of its founders, except the nine men mentioned who descended from t he first nine men who bequeathed the respective copies with the secrets since the year 43 after Jesus. We must be grateful for his having made us heir to this precious History, through which we have learne d that the Masonic Association was founded with the name o f the Mysterious Force in the year 43 after Jesus a nd that its founders are of our original sect, 16 men of extraordinary cunning, as you will see and will admire. They gave it that name because, as they believed, t he force was born with it and would remain conceale d in it, growing little by little, until the time of its rev elation. At that time it had two goals: the first, to impede the apostolate of Jesus’ men and to combat their p reaching. The second, to preserve political influence. But that Force did not grow so much due to its terr ible name. It prospered for a while within its magi cal occultism, and disappeared in another age as a resu lt of a criminal act committed by it, mysteriously, against one of its members, with no one ever knowing anythi ng of the unhappy one who disappeared, nor how it w as concealed; the family members did not know the leas t detail and were ignorant of whether or not he wer e a member of the Association. Who knew that? Only the members. And of these, who would dare to reveal the secret? No one, because whoever did so paid with hi s life. That was their law, the strict law of savagery and occultism. 17 For the least contradiction or for the slightest doubt, a member was condemned to death. A tribunal of three judges determined the sentence of the accu sed, and in the greater number of cases by a simple rumo r concerning his conduct. The accused knew the accu sation and the sentence at the moment of his assassination . That savagery in all its method and significance, i nstilled in that strict law, has as its principal p urpose the combating of Jesus’ men and the opposition of their preaching. Another very important goal existed: to fortify   15 A lost version. 16 Jewish. 17 Comment by Jonas: That law of such terrible occultism of the \"Mysterious Force\" still exists in Masonry. In it, the son enters as a robber, without the knowledge of his parents. He eats, d rinks, sleeps with them, under the some roof, while he is their political and religious enemy. He tries to impose his corrupt principles in the home; if he does not succeed in it he reacts by cau sing suffering and finally the collapse of his own home."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 the Jewish element and to return the world to Judai sm 18 according to the very words of some ancient heirs. One of them pertains to the heir-successor, Haron Levy, at the end of the third century after the “imposto r” Jesus. Another text is recorded at the beginning of the se venth century, after the “impostor” Mohammed, found er of the Mohammed religion, who “claimed” to prophesy as did the “impostor” Jesus. This text, that pertains to Levy Moses Levy and that is recorded in this book, manifests the “great disorder that the appearance o f Mohammed caused among the mysterious ones themselve s and the irrepressible hate toward his men and followers.” It says also: “While the successors of King Agrippa insisted on the battle to crush the religious doct rine of Jesus in order to convert the world to Judaism, the cunni ng Mohammed appeared and fell over the Jews, especi ally over the nine monopolizes of the secret, like a bol t of lightning.” We see then that the declaration of our ancestor, J oseph Levy, in the first quarter of the 18 th century, several years before the changing of the name of the Associ ation, coincides exactly with the declarations of h is ancestors mentioned in this book, passing from cent ury to century to Jonas, my father, who was convert ed to Christianity. We see then, in all the texts of this History, t hat the fundamental principles of the Association a re opposed to Jesus and His men, and later opposed to Mohammed an d his men, its purpose being: to protect and to pre serve only the Jewish religion. 19 Lawrence said: “All those texts coincide in that th e principle purpose of the Mother (the Ancient) Mas onry is to annihilate Christianity, to destroy its foundations and to elevate the prestige of the Jewish religion . Today, in spite of its evolution, it preserves the same purpo se.” Here Samuel again writes: Our ancestor, Joseph Levy , on seeing that those barbarous systems were imped ing the attainment of the indicated objectives, and for the benefit of the progress of the Association, pr oposed the idea of changing its name to a very wealthy contemp orary Jew, who embraced the idea and promised his monetary aid. The two of them agreed to erase from the Copy the text of that intention so no one would know it except them and the nine heir-successors. Levy, together with his son, Abraham, and his relat ive, Abraham Abiud (all descendants of the nine fo unders) journeyed to London, where they made an agreement w ith Desaguliers and George, and thus, after a long process, the renewal of the Association was complet ed, with its new name, FREEMASONRY, on June 24, 1717. “Freemasonry,” a word composed of a noun and an adjective (Free—Masonry), proposed by our ancestor, Levy, and approved by the collaborators o n August 25, 1716. From June 24, 1717, the Association suffered import ant evolutions and changed its barbarous aspect; bu t, in what pertained to Occultism, it become much more st rict.   18 Words of' Dr. de Moraes: Based on my great experiences I am convinced that it was Masonry that diffused the spirit of extremist liberty, the fountain of corruption. Extremist liberty was what crushed educational order, corrupted the human community and ignited the fire of political passion in every territory. From it were born the sources of prostitution and immorality. Mas onry, wanting to appropriate to itself the first fruits of the words, Li berty, Fraternity, Equality, exaggerated In their explanatio ns. Words originated by Christ Himself, who founded with them the three pillars of Humility and Love, to liberate the slave from his slav ery, because men are all brothers in humanity, being sons of a single Father a nd they are equal in rights and in justice. Christ wanted t o preserve the prestige of these three words and not leave them to the disposition of those with evil intentions and the extremists who exp lain them for their own purposes. 19 With respect to this Janet said in 1818: \"I believe that Laici sm has It. origin in the Association, the \"Mysterious For ce,\" and is nothing but a branch of it.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 After reading this History and knowing all the hate unleashed against the two religions: the Christian and the Moslem, the fact that it was solely Jewish was conf irmed to me, because to the present It has not been heard that Masonry combats the Jewish religion. In the two worlds: the Christian and the Moslem we see that the Ma sons affiliate themselves at the be ginning with all occultism. We see them, after receiving th e fundamental secrets, denying their Masonic affili ation and less faithful to their religious creeds. Is there a ny doubt, then, that Masonry is the mortal enemy of these two religions’? The Masons, observing the general mistrust toward t heir Association, create a fal se front, establishi ng common Associations with other names but with the same end s to which they have join those people fearful of t heir name, for the purpose of snaring men and their mone y, thus fortifying Masonry. The members of these common Associations then go on to be members of Masonry. The origin of all these deceits is Jewish, to revive Jewish principles. Her husband, Jonas, said, confirming it: “The Assoc iation of Freemasonry is the same Association as th e ‘Mysterious Force’ or ancient Masonry, Laicism bein g derived from it; Masonry and Laicism, then, desce nd from the Association, the ‘Mysterious Force.’” In this way the Association progressed in a form co ntinued until it came to change the face of the wor ld. With respect to the conversion of your grandfather, Jonas, to Christianity, I will tell you that his f iancée, the Protestant girl, Janet, whom he “dearly loved, refu sed to contract matrimony with him before his conve rsion to Christianity. You will see in the corresponding Cha pter more details with respect to this. After concluding the translation of the History to Portuguese, 20 and while making efforts to reveal it to public opinion, he journeyed suddenly, for an urgent reaso n, to Russia. He left, at that time, the History, i n the care of my mother and me. His journey did not last more tha n one year, and on returning, he involved himself i n political affairs that took from him the time and t he will to continue the printing of the History. A little while later, he had to make another voyage, from which he did not return. He died there, in the year 1825. N o one knew anything of his death. We received the History in two versions, one Hebrew and one Russian. My mother always insisted on my publishing the Hist ory and one day she said to me; “Samuel! Samuel! In spite of the fact that your father died a victim of his C onversion to Christianity, and perhaps a victim of this History, I make known to you my unqualified desire of continui ng your father’s task in order to publish this extr aordinary work. You must determine to realize your dead fathe r’s and my will. “You know that there are nine orig inal copies, in accord with the number of Founders who b equeathed them to their successors down to our time . Three of the original copies were robbed and have d isappeared, according to the texts of the History. The rest of the copies would be in the possession of the respec tive successors, whom we do not know. But we posses s one of them. It is this one we have in our hands. You, Samuel, m ust preserve it zealously to comply with the will o f your father..and mine to publish this History for religi ous, cultural and humanitarian benefit. No doubt th e majority of the people will rejoice for the appearance of th is History, even the members themselves of the Maso nic Association. The entire world, above all the differ ent religious and political groups, will have indes cribable joy.

These words are for them: “Woman! Since Creation you enjoy the greatest affec tion and respect in the world.

To convince men that it was Masonry that made the pillars of nations totter, that demolished the powers, that rejected religion. It was Masonry that shed rivers of innocent blood with its Jewish cunning. I t was Masonry, Masonry! “Know that every event contrary to Religion has its origin in Masonry. . “By the monstrous exaggeration of the interpretatio n of the words: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, the reins of human morals were loosened. It was Masonry that dif fused disobedience to their duties in women, with t he purpose of spreading extremism, corruption and pros titution. These are the purposes of the Mysterious Force and its daughter, Masonry. “Any contact with a Mason inspires in us, in one wa y or another, if not the despising of Religion, col dness toward it. “Here is the example: in the countries w here Masons abound, spirituality, honor and virtues diminish. It is a frightening danger that threatens Humanity. The consequences will be disastrous for your daugh ters and sons and for the entire world. “You must, then, my friends, diffuse the facts in t his History at each meeting, in every home, because religion is the foundation of all virtue, honor and justice.” Thus ends the most valuable collaboration and Janet ’s message to women, the valuable communication of our ancestor, Janet, that will be heard for centuries. Let us return again to the conversation of my grand father Samuel, with his son, George, ,my father, co ncerning the matter of the printing of the History. Samuel said: George, my son, I have exhausted the h ope of my cure and I feel a foreboding that my fata l day is near. How much I lament not having been able to car ry out the will of my father and mother in regard t o the printing of the book. Based on this, I repeat my Wi ll to you: “Make the maximum effort to translate th is History to the French and English languages and to other la nguages if it is possible. I leave in your care wha t your grandfather, Jonas, and your grandmother, Janet, or dered me to do, to publish the Book in whatever lan guage I could. “You must not be frightened, George, by the details of the assassination of our ancestor, Joseph Levy, or of your grandfather, Jonas, because this History will be of great satisfaction for the Masons, who will k now the origin of their Association and the reason for thei r being deceived. It will cause them immense joy, a s your grandmother, Janet, said. “The entire world will celebrate this discovery and will applaud it, after having seen the greatest st udies crumble when faced with this mystery."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 “Come closer, dear son, so I may kiss you, bless yo u and bid you farewell because my hour approaches.” A few days after this Will, Samuel died, grieved at not h aving been able to carry out the will of his father and mother. Here I, Lawrence, return to add: My father, George died in 1884 (one year after the death of his fathe r) of tuberculosis. During that year he translated the Hi story to French only three months before his death. He gave me the History to translate to English because the English copy disappeared with Joseph Levy, its owne r. Behold his Will when he gave the History to me (I w as 15 years old): “My son, Lawrence, I give you thi s History, hoping you will guard it zealously. You ar e now the last one who has the obligation and respo nsibility of realizing all those wills whose owners died but whose wills will not. You must carry out those will s in the printing of this History in any language possible. This History, buried alive, must be resurrected for the good of humanity. Now I make known to you my affection and tenderness, I bless you and I wish you all good for yourself and all of yours.” My father died at the age of 44, no less grieved th an his father and grandfather. I continued studying English until I mastered it, in order to translate the Book to that language, always thinking of carrying out the desires of my father and ancestors, of publishing it in every language possible. Thus, I hold the hope that this sole and valuable w ork may dissipate the darkness that has covered the eyes of Masons and non-Masons for long centuries. I hold th e hope that this History, revealed, may put an end to the discussion concerning the secret of the origin of M asonry, this secret mysteriously kept among nine el ders and their successors consecutively, including our ances tor Joseph Levy, by whom the secret was transferred to my ancestor Jonas and from Jonas to me through my pare nts. I see that the hour for the revelation of this Book has come. For that reason, God willing, I will beg in to translate it and publish it in every language possi ble. I end my words asking all the readers of this Book to render homage to those who conceived and recommende d the idea of its publication and diffusion: Jonas and Janet. Comment of Awad Khoury concerning the Supplement The importance of the supplement that we add at th is point is extraordinary because of its resume of the most important Masonic History published up to the present and because it is a valuable argument in favor of t he accuracy of this secret History. It incorporates a sincerity that confirms the exact coincidence between ancient Masonry, “The Mysterious Force,” 21 that was founded in the year 43 A.D. and its daughter, modem Masonry, t hat is called Freemasonry, born in the year 1717. From the text of the following supplement, the elim ination of the last drop of the sea of doubts conce rning the origin of Masonry is obvious.   21 Khoury: The learned man, Valette, author of this booklet cal ls ancient Masonry, \"Masonry before the year 1717.\" He does n ot call It by Its original name, \"The Mysterious Force,\" because, it seem s, he 's not an heir of the secret, and consequently does n ot know the truth."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 SUPPLEMENT “A” 22 In the beginningof the booklet, the learned brother s, Alf. Ls. Jacot and Ed. Ouartier la Tente say: . “Every person who joins an association, is interested in k nowing its origin and past.” The author then regist ers the opinion of some historians concerning this point, s aying: The Masonic authors of the 18 th century recognize that the investigation of the history of the foundation of “Masonry is difficult. Dr. Anderson, 23 in his historic discourse in the year 1723 on the fundamental statutes, indicated that ancient Masonry began with Adam. Brother Briston said in th e year 1772 that Julius Caesar, who diedin the year 44 after Christ, was a Mason. The Druids 24 were Masons and Masonry began with Creation itself . Dr. Oliver, on the other hand, went even farther when he said: “An cient Masonic legends say, and I am of this opinion , that our Association existed before the creation of the terrestrial globe and that it was spread through th e planets of the solar system.” Then Brother Michel did not go s o far back as those above; rather he concentrated h is investigations around the construction of the Templ e of Solomon. Other brothers, with greater knowledge, such as Bro ther Harder, sought its origin among the heretics o f the Middle Ages, especially the followers of Peter Wald o, declared a heretic in the year 1179. Other historians presume that Masonry was founded a mong the Chaldeans. Father Grandidieux attributed i t to the German association, “Steinmetzen. Brother Nicol ai attributed its origin to the “Rosicrucian” socie ties. Others to the “Templars.” An infinity of authors, historians and investigator s offer theories but none are certain of the origin of its foundation. On other pages of the booklet we see that associati ons of masons (construction workers) who held their meetings in four locations, existed in London. 25 On page 26 we see a photo of an eating place with t he name of “The Roasted Duck,” in which the masons gathered on June 24, 1717 and unified their associa tions, 26 giving it the name of Freemasonry (free masons) an d commissioning Anderson with drawing up the fundamen tal laws. The four locations mentioned were called Lodges, an d these are their names, according to a list on pag e 27 of the booklet. The first Lodge: “The Roasted Duck” (Eating place i n the district of St. Paul Churchyard}. The second Lodge: “The Wedding” (Eating place in Pa rker Lane, near Drury Lane). The third Lodge: “The Apple” (Eating place on Charl es Street, Covent Garden). The fourth Lodge: “The Big Cup and the Grape Cluste r” (Eating place on Chandler and Westminster).   22 Synthesis of the booklet; “Two Centuries of Freemasonry.

Some authors consider that in 1717 the direction wa s changed and it “marched” in the path of “progress ” that all the Community, Masonic or not, must follow. A more extensive plan was drawn up when, in the yea r 1721 (September 29), the Superior Lodge considere d that the ancient Statutes were not complete, necess itating giving them another better, and more modem, form. 27 On page 29 of this booklet, the distinguished Broth er Robert Freko Gould, historian of Masonry, says t he following: “The renewal consisted of the three following aspec ts: 1. The utilization of new terms such as ‘fellow crafts man’ and ‘entered apprentices.’ 2. Not to declare the degree of ‘master’ except in the Superior Lodge. 3. The abolition of the Christian religion, as the Mas onic religion.” 28 Th. G. G. Valette comments: the third renewal is of extraordinary importance because it sets a limit o f distinction between the Association of Masons (Cons truction workers) and Masonry itself. The learned Brother Albert Mackay said in this resp ect: The Association of Masons (the Masonry of Professional Masons) has never been tolerant nor po pular because its principles have always been Chris tian, ecclesiastical, even to the point of fanaticism. The rebellion of many Masons 29 against that renewal (the one manifested by Gould) does not surprise us, then, although it was considered by us, the English Broth ers, as acceptable as the elimination of every reli gious phrase in the French Grand Orient. 30 “That is what Anderson put in the fundamental statu tes, where our doctrine was strictly defined for us , a doctrine of good and faithful men, of honorable and upright men, who have left behind the bitter past sealed by Christian fanaticism that, lamentably, lift up wall s of division even now. “But our association is not to be understood as an attacker of the Christian religion. Many times it i s said and we repeat here, that these things do not interest Maso nry; it does not intervene either in politics or in religion. 31   27 Khoury: This coincides perfectly with the Hebrew manuscri pt in that Anderson and Desaguliers drew up new laws. It is evident, also, that Masonic authors consider the four lodges (eating p laces) as places to extend the reach of architecture and construct ion, not knowing the other diabolic goals. 28 Khoury: Gould’s intention has the clarity of noon-day. H e means that in Masonry the Christian religion is not necess ary. What religion does he want? The Jewish! 29 Khoury: It is evident here that the brothers who manif ested themselves as against such a renewal were Christians or C atholics, faithful ones who did not accept the abolition of the Ch ristian religion in Masonry. Great numbers of them abandone d the Association on knowing that intention. 30 Khoury: His name is not mentioned. Behold the summary o f what is published on pages 30 and 31 of Valette’s book let, where his photograph and signature appear: “We can say with all certainty that one of our great learned men in the Masonic Association acknowledged that, in 1723, the Christian religion ceased bein g obligatory in Masonry. From this it can be noted that the Jewish influence prevailed over the influence of Desaguliers and Ande rson, who, with their Jewish companions, modified the f undamental ancient statutes, as will be seen in the second section. 31 Khoury: Only an idiot would believe this. Permit us to call Mr. Valette’s attention to the fact that Anderson and D esaguliers put that text in the public statutes only to confuse, being believed by the people and by the Masons of recent affiliation, as i t was by the inferior mysterious ones in ancient Masonry. But on unders tanding that civil and religious revolutions sprang from the fountains of Masonry, that text must be consi dered aboli shed and it is necessary to delete it from the Masonic statutes so no one i s deceived."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 “We must also say, with all precisian, that the opp ression and rigor attributed to the Christian canon s in the 18 th century, obligated many men to seek refuge in the l odges, which increased admirably. In the interior o f the lodge the man was free of every religious chain whi ch is nothing more than the fountain of corruption. “For that reason, Masonry in the 18 th century, began to permit tolerance, in accord with the text of the principles established by Anderson in the fundamental statute. The distinguished brother Portig in Prussia said: ‘Masonry is at its greatest prestige,’ because truly Masonry in 1723, with Anderson’s statutes, reached the pea k of its prestige.” 32 The Hague, March 1917 (Signed): G.

On page 33, the author speaks of Masonry since 1717 , what he calls “New Masonry,” detailing the lodges established in England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, etc., with extensive explanations with respect to their manner of being established, the rapidity of the spread of new Masonry, the number o f lodges in each city, etc.   32 Khoury: It Is understood from what we foreknow that De saguliers and Anderson were of those Protestants character i zed by their profound hatred of Catholicism and their greatest interest w as in attacking it. Nevertheless, they used the phrase, “the ab olition of the Christian religion. This phrase was motivated by the foll owing: first, the agreement between Desaguliers and Joseph L evy obliged the former to accept it at the latter’s insistence. Second, it will be seen in the second section that the wealthy Jew, Adoniram, succeeded Levy, imposing more conditions than Levy on Desaguliers, obliging him to accept them. Anderson, being an instrumen t and servant of Desaguliers could do nothing but express that phrase: “the abolition of the Christian religion as the Masonic one,” no t being able to specify “Catholicism” as was his preferred intention. 33 Khoury: This man could be a relative of the great Desagulier s, the companion of Joseph Levy in the renewal of the Associ ation, or it could, be the same man himself, due to on error in the pri nting of the initials of the name. We know that Desaguliers was the one who had on argument with Levy over the presidency of the Firs t Jerusalem Lodge and because of his refusal to return the t wo manuscripts, the Hebrew and the English, with this conflict leading to the assassination of Levy and the confiscation of all his doc uments. Abraham Abiud, the owner of the original Hebrew of this Histor y, gives us these valuable details in the second section, as well as the fact that Desaguliers did not attain the presidency, that the first lodge kept the name of Jerusalem from June 24, 1717 until September 17, 1719 when it was changed to the Superior Lodge of England. We do not know if Mr. Valette knows these truths and hides them. But it is presumed that he is ignorant of them because it seems he is not one of the heirs of the history."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 On page 50 the photo of Desaguliers appears with a résumé of his life, indicating that he was born Mar ch 12, 1683 and died in the year 1744; it indicates that h e was the only man who distinguished himself by his fervent zeal in the revitalization of the Association in th e beginning of the 18 th century. He merited the title of “Father of the New Masonry.” The existence of the grand Lod ge of England is due to his effort alone. From page 21 it is deduced that, notwithstanding th e indication of the name of Anderson as the one who established the first edition of the fundamental st atutes of the new Masonry, its forger and original observer was Desaguliers. If Anderson composed it, it was Desagu liers who believed it and dictated the fundamental themes and basic ideas. 34 On page 52 the author says that. the last days of D esaguliers were dark and enveloped in sadness and p overty. Brother Feller says in his book, “Cabal Interpretat ion,” that Desaguliers went mad in his last days, w earing his clothes inside out, dying in that lamentable state of madness. Brother Cutron said in the “Moral Poem: The Vanities of Material Joys,” that Desaguliers reache d the depths of poverty before dying. 35   34 Khoury: Here there is complete agreement with our History; it is the fact that Desaguliers took from Levy the Hebrew an d English copies in order to “adapt” the old statutes, as he deceived him .. But it is certain that those two copies served him as a C onstitution. With the collaboration of Anderson, he implemented the new statutes, correcting and modifying the old until they were converted into the “absolutely new,” according to Desaguliers and Anderson. According to them, also, they left nothing of the ancient excep t the fundamentals: the 33 degrees; the two columns, Booz and Jachi n; the passwords; the three steps, the three hammers, the occu ltism, etc., In accord with the solemn promises made by Desaguliers to Levy and his successors, the heirs of the manuscript. 35 Khoury: It will be seen in the second section that the fou nder, Herod Agrippa, was blind in the lost days of his l ife and spent a long time in misery, suffering and unhappiness, dying in th at disastrous state."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Second Section CHAPTER ONE Narrative of the events in the successive Sessions transacted in the court of King Herod Agrippa, 36 that blossomed, culminating in the foundation of the Mas onic Association. Session of June 24 of the year 43 after Christ: How Hiram Abiud, Counselor of the King Hero d, conceived the idea of founding the Masonic Association, proposing it in the Court of Jerusalem . On that date Hiram presented himself before King He rod, expressing himself in the following terms: Majesty, when I saw that the impostor Jesus’ men an d their followers increased in number and endeavore d to confuse the Jewish people with their preaching, I d ecided to present myself before Your Majesty to pro pose the foundation of a secret association whose principles might attack those confusers with all the means wi thin our reach to bring their corrupt and corrupting works t o collapse and to eliminate them, if it is possible . The King heard him, pleased, and said to him: Speak, Hiram! Majesty: It has been confirmed before Your Excellen cy and before all, that that Impostor, Jesus, has c aptivated, with his teachings and his acts (both deceptive) th e hearts of a part of the Jewish people, your peopl e; and how it is obvious that his partisans are multiplied day by day. It is evident, also, that since his appearance unti l and including his death, and from his death until today, we have not known how to attack efficiently those whom we should call “our enemies’” nor have we been abl e to eliminate all that is inculcated in the simple hear ts of the people, all the teachings opposed to our religion, which are corrupt and false. We must recognize, although it may grieve us, that the multiple persecutions realized against that Imp ostor, and notwithstanding. submitting him to justice, sentenc ing him and crucifying him: the result has been fut ile. Without effect our fathers battled tirelessly. We b elieve in their having conquered in the battle, but we have not obtained nor perceived even any sign of success. We contemplate, confounded, that the more arduous our battle is against his partisans, the greater is the number of his followers, and the number of sympathizers w ith the religion established by him increases. It seems tha t there has been a hand, a force, secret, mysteriou s, that punishes us without our being able to offer resista nce. It seems we have lost all our strength to defe nd our religion and our existence itself. Majesty, based on the evidence that there is no eff icacious means of incorporating our ideas, nor firm hope of attacking that force, undoubtedly mysterious; there is no other path than to establish a Mysterious fo rce, similar to that one (to attack mystery with mystery, in mys tery). I have come to the conclusion that it is our unavoidable duty, unless you have a better idea, to establish a n Association of a greater power so it may assemble the Jewish   36 Herod Agrippa Is king of Judea from the year 37 to the year 44 of our era.

It is f itting that no one know anything about its foundati on, its principles and its actions. Only those whom Your Ma jesty may choose as founders will know the secret o f the foundation. Only the active associates will know the important decrees. The central see will be this palace and we will found affiliates in all the centers that might be i nvaded by the preachers of the teachings that the I mpostor published with such audacity. Therefore, Majesty, w hat do you think of the creation of this longed-for force, with which we will attack and eliminate that hidden but real power that threatens our existence? Speaking then, the King said: You know, oh Hiram, t hat your idea is glorious, it is worthy of your pri vileged intelligence, it could not have come except from yo ur heart, ardent with religious zeal, oh, genius of profound judgment! We must realize this project as quickly as possible . We must ask the opinion of Moab. 37 Then we will choose the men who will participate in the foundation with us. Summon Moab tomorrow. Do not let him know anything. I will inform him.   37 Moab Is the first counselor of Herod Agrlppa."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 CHAPTER TWO The second meeting King Herod held with Moab Levy, his first counselor, and Hiram Abiud, on June 25 of the year 43 of our era. King Herod spoke first and said: What happened and what continues happening, my two companions, since the appearance of the impostor Jesus, deserves to occup y our attention. We must find a means to help us attack that sect of people that, in spite of their small number, confu ses the people with their false teachings. Moreover, those who adopt those falsities not only conform themselv es by their adoption, but practice them devoutly and, to fill the measure to overflowing, they publish them courageously, without any fear, wherever they go. Let us note that the propagation of such teaching i ncreases day by day. Let us recognize that their fo llowers, now perfectly identified with the cause, have separ ated themselves from our religion. Let us not doubt that those who waver today will soon fall in the snare of the deceit. To avoid this danger, no other alternative remains to us than to establish an Association whose object will be to incorporate secretly the spirit of the Jewish Natio n and to be able thus to crush that mysterious and criminal hand that directs that movement, and to silence its propaganda. If we do not succeed in this intention , many people, inclined toward the lies preached by that d eceiver, will fall under his influence. Before the problem worsens, my dear friends, we mus t give it the importance it deserves. Let us now se lect the companions who will collaborate with us in the foun dation. These must be possessors of proven honor, profound discretion, great activity and immense zea l for the protection of the Jewish religion. I offer you, Hiram, our appreciation, for having be en the suggester of this idea: to found this Associ ation for such a noble purpose. Speaking then, Hiram said: Ma y God prolong the age of Your Majesty the King. All the merit belongs to Your Majesty; from your noble orig in the entire nation takes grace; all the good the Nation possesses redounds from your blessing. I beg your Majesty the King to select our brothers and companions to form the Association. Then Herod named nine men, ordering Moab and Hiram to record their n ames, that is: The King, Herod Agrippa, Hiram Abiud , Moab Levy, Johanan, Antipas, Jacob Abdon, Solomon A beron, Adoniram and Ashad Abia."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 CHAPTER THREE The Foundation of the Association, “The Mysterious Force” 38 The founders named, just mentioned, were summoned and they met, presided over by King Herod Agrippa. He began the session with the following discourse: Dear Brothers: You are not the King’s men and his c ollaborators. You are the support of the King and o f the life of the Jewish people. Until now you have been his f aithful followers. >From this moment on you will be his brothers. I give you this title of Brothers so you may evalua te my sentiments toward you and the tenderness you wrest from me for the purpose that has brought us togethe r here in this important session I give you this ve ry affectionate title to demonstrate to you that, in s pite of being your King, I am your brother in the J ewish nation, in the Jewish religion, for which my heart overflow s with love and devotion. All reasons that oblige m e, from now on, to help you and be faithful to you. Above a ll we need to be brothers in order to begin properl y the undertaking for which I have called you and which w ill be of great benefit for our country. Each one of you knows, without doubt, the obligatio ns towards one’s brother. From this moment on, I wa nt you to know that I have linked myself to you with the o bligations of a brother. These obligations are grea ter than those of a King toward his subjects, for the betray al of a King is not improbable, but the betrayal of a brother impossible. Let us all understand then, and let us not forget, that this fundamental meeting realized by this new group is based on Brotherhood. On this Brotherhood we will b uild our edifice; and that title of tenderness, “Brotherhood,” will be the cornerstone of our edifi ce until the end of time. My Brothers: The aristocracy as well as the common people have perceived the spiritual and even politi cal revolt that the appearance of the Impostor Jesus ha s caused among the people, and especially among our Israelites. Since that man arose, preaching those false teachin gs and inculcating that spirit that he pretentiousl y called the “divine spirit,” numerous persons whose spirits are confused and corrupted are joining him. He attribu ted divinity to himself. Being nothing but an indigent, he disputed with us over the Kingdom. We have note d a great power in him, which he left as an inheritance to that group he called disciples. He founded an A ssociation that he called a religion, it being called that by them as well. This supposed religion is at the poin t of overturning the foundations of our religion and dem olishing it. Being nothing but a humble one and an impostor, he adopted the name, “Jesus of Nazareth, ‘King of the Jews.” He claimed to have been conceived by a divine power and born of a virgin, one who remained a virgin ev en after having given birth. He exaggerated in this de ceit and fraud until affirming that He was God, the Son of God, and the One sent by God, doing everything that God does. He attributed to himself the gift of prophecy and t he power of performing miracles. He claimed to be t he hoped- for Messias of whom our prophets announced the comi ng; not being anything but a vulgar man like the re st of the people, devoid of any feature of the Divine Spi rit, withdrawn to the extreme from the rectitude of our firm Jewish doctrine, from which we are determined not t o deviate in even one point.   38 This name. was suggested by King Agrippa for the purpose of attacking the Divine force, mysterious according to them, with a similar force, but how different is the Divine from t he human!"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Never will we recognize such a person as the Messia s, nor will we recognize his divinity. We know that the hoped-for Messias is not yet among us, nor has the time of his coming arrived. Nor has any sign been e xhibited that might indicate his appearance. If we commit th e error of letting our people follow him and be dec eived, we convict ourselves of an unforgiveable crime. He was submitted to justice and sentenced to the maximum penalty. He was chastised and injured like the grea test of criminals. He bore all that with extraordin ary patience that astonished everyone. Finally, we crucified him , he died and we buried him, leaving guards who wat ched the tomb. But it was claimed that he was risen, res urrected! Abandoning the tomb. We did not find out how his “resurrection” happened, nor did the guards. No one doubted the loyalty of those posted at the tomb be cause they were from among his enemies. He disappeared in an unknown manner, in spite of the zealous vigilan ce and the security of the closure. His followers later claimed to have been with him ( living), as he was before his death; that is, with his body and spirit. They spread the news, then, that he ascende d to Heaven and that he will come on the day of Fin al Judgment to judge the living and the dead. His leav ing the tomb, my friends, was a decisive blow for h is rivals; it was a powerful means that encourages his men to continue spreading his teachings and to prove the confirmation of his divinity. Brothers: that was a severe blow that our fathers s uffered, demolishing their force and ours as well. His partisans dispute with us over religious authority and temporal authority; with the first to attack ou r religion and with the second to take the Kingdom from us. We will not recognize, on any point, a religion oth er than ours, the Jewish religion that we have inhe rited from our ancestors. Duty calls us to preserve it until t he end of time. That blow had never been expected. That mysterious force had never been dreamed of. Our fathers attack ed it and we continue attacking it. In spite of everythin g, astonishing! Their number increases. Observe wit h me how the son is separated from the father, the brother f rom his brother, the daughter from her mother, all alienating themselves to join that group. This affair encloses a great secret. How many men, how many women, how many entire families have abandoned the Jewish religion in order to follow those impostors, those partisans of Jesus. How many times they were threatened by the priests and authorities, in vain! Brothers: there is something that we must not ignor e. Since that impostor Jesus began his teaching and preaching years ago - I beg you to consider this am ong the secrets we must keep he spoke to the people like a man, in spite of his youth. Our fathers asserted it , having been witnesses present. Our fathers gather ed in the corridors of the temple, they deliberated and discu ssed what would have to be done to destroy that dan ger that threatened the Jewish religion. They did not omit u sing even a single means to serve, in that way, the Jewish religion and nation. If this enthusiasm had not int ervened, the number of Jesus’ partisans would be mu ch greater. Now then: if our fathers have triumphed partially i n impeding the people from following the confusers, they have done so without any association, without a spi rit of unity, without a strong official league. How successful will it be, then, if we found this Association? Wil l it not be astonishing? I swear by my life! I swear by Reason! That we will attain a ll our desire, we will attain our longing s, not only of impeding the Jews from following that confusing force, but of crushing that force and its leaders. Although we may not reach that ultimate phase, that of final triumph, we will at least liquidate that terrible current that threatens our nation; thus we will sav e its existence, and the name, Jew, will not be blo tted out."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 It would be fatal if we did not imitate the enthusi asm of our fathers, for if we do not persist in the cause opened by them, know from this point on that the Jewish na tion will be blotted out and not a single trace of it will remain. We cannot tolerate our silence, being the l eaders of the destinies of the nation. Would we, by our silence, commit a crime against ourselves, against our children, against our grandchildren and against all our descendants? Then. brothers, in order to exchange i deas and reach an agreement about the foundation of an Association that endorses the intention mentioned a nd explained, I have called you to this meeting of a private, political and religious nature. We will strike, thu s, the first of our blows at all those followers of the imposter, especially those outstanding in the villages, who e xcel in deceit; for in each one of those villages a n affiliate of the Association will function. We will not be able to diminish them without a gene ral league that unites us all and to make the forma tion of that league possible it is necessary that the princ ipal center be here. Let us not have the slightest doubt that our Associ ation will be of very great importance and of invin cible power, with which we will cast to the ground that m ysterious force and every thing built by Jesus, his disciples and his partisans. I have chosen you and called you from among my peop le, demonstrating the confidence I have placed in y ou; if it were not so, I would not have attempted this sec ret. I ratify my hope that you will unite your hear ts, bodies, words and acts with mine. This is my faith in you; this is my adherence to the religion and to the nat ion. I believe you value my confidence in this affair. How do you respond to what I have told you? You must keep the secret! Adonirom arose and speaki ng for all those present before the King said: Maje sty: because of the great emotion that seizes me, I take upon myself the privilege of speaking in my name a nd in that of my brothers, my present companions. I do not dou bt that the loyalty of these brothers toward the na tion is any less than yours or mine. If our desires and lon gings are united, then our hearts will be as well. Thus, we have a single heart in several bodies. To this hear t we will unite thousands of other hearts and we wi ll incorporate them to it. How can this not be carried out if Your Majesty has already placed the first s tone in this edifice, if he has placed the cornerstone on a foun dation as firm as “Brotherhood?” A marvelous title, as is its suggester. Majesty, we salute you and we salute the Jewish nation incarnate in your person. Who among us does not offer his service to these ideals, on hearing y our so certain and sweet words? Who among us does n ot rise like a lion to attack those defrauders, to kill the m and to kill their partisans, even though it may b e one of our sons? We are all hopeful that the league alluded to by Yo ur Majesty will spring from our Association. From i t will be born a very great force with which we will eliminat e that magic power of the Impostor and we will defe at his partisans. Thus we will save our Kingdom which will be prolonged until the end of the world. Then Adoniram, directing his glance toward his comp anions, said to them: What is your reply?” To which they all cried as one: We approve everything that you ha ve said. Then King Agrippa said: I am grateful to y ou; I appreciate your enthusiasm; I appreciate your zeal. The confidence you have placed in me pleases me a great deal. Let us meet again, then, the day after tomorr ow, to found the Association and to take the oath o f sincerity and fidelity. We will begin our work immediately. Hiram, who was entrusted with writing what was mani fested in this session, said: Majesty, dear Brother s: Because of his great courtesy, His Majesty has attr ibuted to me, his faithful servant, the merit for t he conception of the idea of founding this Association. It is my duty to offer my gratitude to His Highness and dear Majesty.

I bind myself not to divulge any of the secrets pres erved among us, the nine; either among outsiders or among the affiliated members. “If I commit perjury and my betrayal is confirmed i n that I have revealed some secret or some article of the decrees preserved among us and heirs this commissio n of eight companions will have the right to kill m e by whatever means available.” The King repeated the reading of the Oath three tim es so that all might understand it well before its being recorded. Hiram said: My Lord, the King: the text of this Oat h is solely for us, the Founders; therefore, there must be another formula for the affiliates. For as Your Maj esty has said, no one other than we must know the s ecrets of the foundation. The King replied: I know all this, Hiram; this Oath issolely for us. On finalizing the foundation we w ill prepare the general Oath. You must know, moreover, that all those who are our heirs must bind themselves with our Oath. The King continued. Brothers: you have seen that th is Oath is horrifying, frightful. Each one of us mu st mediate on it before taking it, for oath binds the Founder with chains of steel. It chains him to the brotherh ood, it chains him to the fundamental principles whether they be i nnocent or corrupt. It chains him with obedience to the orders and decrees of the commission and with the f ulfillment of everything decreed, good as well as b ad. It obliges him to attack the Impostor’s men and to kil l them in any way possible. It obliges him to be a perfect guardian of the decrees of the Association, even in front of his own sons, except the one who will be the trustee as heir to the secret. Just as he is obliged to car ry out orders to kill, so also he is obliged with r espect to the divulgence of something prohibited, that the Associ ation judges expedient for the preservation of the Jewish religion. He is even obliged to sacrifice everythin g dear to him to serve its principles."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 That is why, I repeat to you, because we must media te on this because this Oath is not only for us, bu t also for our sons, our grandsons, our descendants A proposal of that, I want to reveal to you one of the secret s of my father and of my grandfather, Herod the Great. They gave secret orders to kill all those they could of the partisans of the Impostor. My father informed me th at all those who carried out the orders were punish ed in their property, in their health, in their children, with all kinds of illnesses and with a horrible de ath. I inform you of all this so you may know that, afte r taking the Oath, we are all bound in such a way t hat we will not be able to release ourselves, repenting for wha t is committed being of no avail. And do not forget , Brothers, that we and only we, the nine will be the “Chained Ones,” and the ones responsible because the Interna l Law that we will sanction tomorrow will be known only b y us and will be the patrimony of our heirs only, w ho will receive it successively until the complete eradicat ion of the impostors.

Let each one of us copy the formula and take it to study it before taking the Oath. Let It be known th at the first stone of our edifice will be this frightful Oath. Y ou may leave and the day after tomorrow you will co me to decide if the Oath will have these terms or if the text is to be changed."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 CHAPTER FIVE The horrifying oath of the founders The nine founders being present, the King declared the session open and asked the opinion of all conce rning the Oath. It was accepted unanimously and recorded. Imm ediately they agreed to take it to complete the fou ndation of the Association. The King took the Bible, placed it on a table and s aid ,Do as I do. He placed his right hand on the Bi ble, everyone imitated him, beginning with Moab Levy, Hi ram Abiud, etc. Then each one of them held in his o ther hand the paper with the text of the Oath. The King was the first to take the Oath; Moab followed him, then Hiram, and the others until the last. The Oath taken, each one returned to his place and the King gave the following discourse: Brothers: No w our Association, “The Mysterious Force,” is founded. It s force, acts, principles and goals will be mysteri ous forever. Thus we will be able to eradicate the fall acies of Jesus and his followers. We have- now made ourselves brothers. We must form a true brotherhood , different from that which the Impostor claimed to form, a brotherhood of deceit and witchcraft. Our brotherho od is truthful, it is the foundation and the backbo ne of our Association. Now that we are chained and bound to t he chains, let each one ofus prepare himself for th e work; the work consists in killing by whatever means poss ible the disseminators of the teachings of Jesus. T his is our noble intention, this is our religious and politica l goal. Now that we have confederated our hearts here, let us trust that we will attain the formation of the N ational League that will unite us and dignify our Jewish ex istence and essence. Only with this league will we defeat our enemies and crush their forces, those forces that c laim to nullify our religion in order to perpetuate the deceits inherited from the Impostor, their Chief. In short, I tell you that the foundation of our acts must be : fidelity, discretion and the cruel courage to eliminate them. On delivering these secrets to our sons, let us in culcate these principles in heritage. They, in turn, will bequeat h them to their sons so that our principles and sec rets will continue in an hereditary and sound manner from one century to the next, and thus forever. We know that the impostor Jesus attributed to himse lf the performance of miracles. He said that he was the Son of God, that he himself was God. Could there be gre ater impudence? Besides, he has spread many other f alse concepts, which, faced with, we cannot nor must not keep silent; for example, his manifesting himself as King of the Jews. Do you not see in that claim imprudenc e, impudence and unqualified insult? Thus our fathers judged it. That is why they attack ed him; that is why they persecuted his partisans. . And that is what inspires us to establish an Associ ation that may continue the battle. For, without an association, some of them succeeded in attaining great and unfor gettable triumphs in that field. Two villages that you know, where they killed three followers of Jesus, served as an example to the re st. With the fate of those three, not a single inhabitant of those villages and their vicinities dared to follo w those preachers. Up to the present we have no knowledge o f anyone’s having joined the impostors or of their having returned to these villages. Such a measure being cr owned with such great success without a league or association behind it, can you imagine the magnitud e and the benefit that will be attained with the fo undation of our Association? With the will of God, we will blot them from the ea rth, one by one. Thus we will escape the danger of the teachings of their Chief, the Impostor. Brothers: I would not have revealed these secrets t o you if I had not had the will to ratify my great confidence in you. But I want to reveal to you the profound convi ction of our faith in the frightful oath we have ta ken.

In this course I will be the example so that from today on we will be a single s oul and a single heart. Each one of you, in turn, must be an example for ev ery affiliate. And now, let us rejoice in the inaug uration in order to march with gravity and diligence on the pa th of great success. Brothers, it is the duty of each of us to have a co py of all that has occurred and been written to dat e and hereafter. Thus each one will have a history of our acts which, although limited, will be the inherita nce that he will pass to his son from generation to generation; it will last with the advancing of days and the pa ssing of time as long as the followers of Jesus the Impostor exis t on earth. The King stood, followed by the eight; he said: Now let us toast ourselves with a smiling face and a p ure heart. Let us toast our brother Hiram with preference; let us applaud and exclaim three times: Long live our principles! Long live our Association, until the end of time! A ll the others exclaimed: Long live our King! And th e King cried: Long live the Jewish religion, long live the Jewish nation! Then he. said: The next session will be held six da ys from now.

Mine will be written by Hiram."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 CHAPTER SIX Foundationof the first lodge, called the “Lodge of Jerusalem” The nine Founders presented themselves. The King, a s President, inaugurated the session, saying: Dear Brothers: Each association must have a private see where its active members meet. This hall, wher e we have realized our fundamental meetings, will not se rve for our secret meetings. We must install a see that will be called the Lodge of Jerusalem. This Lodge must b e located in a hidden corridor where no one will se e us nor hear our decrees. I take this opportunity to call y our attention to an affair of utmost importance. We have said that we must increase our Association until thousan ds of people join, thus increasing our strength. Bu t if it should come to be known that this Association has b een founded at this time, it will cause fear and re action, and consequently, the alienation of a part of the peopl e, especially in these critical times in which the revolution of that Impostor continues increasing its strength. We nineare the cornerstone of this splendid edifice w hich is “The Mysterious Force.” Let us consider, then, the instruments for the construction of this edifice. L et us saturate ourselves with the grandeur of our mission in this political and religious work that would no t exist if it were not for us, for without masons and instruments there is no edifice. Obviously, we are the reason for the existence of this edifice. I desire, and I ask that you accept with me, the making of this edifice the most magnificent of palaces. And how? With Occultism. An d what does this Occultism mean? Listen: The best means of making our association, b esides grand and important, exciting, is to hide th e date of its foundation, the names of its founders, our name s, from every affiliate, whoever he may be. These s ecrets will be guarded by the nine of us and each one of us wil l pass it on as an inheritance to one of our sons, the most serious, the most secretive, when he reaches 21 yea rs of age. His own brothers must know nothing. What we must say, then, to the affiliates is that t his Association is very ancient, no one knows anyth ing about the date of its foundation, nor of its founders; it was dissolved and dead until a little while ago. A s there will certainly be opposers, we will satisfy. their doubt s telling them: King Herod found in his father’s tr easury ancient papers that indicate the existence of a mos t ancient association, said papers containing signs and laws. And it pleased him so that he wanted to revive it; and truly he revived it, in accord with what was wr itten in the documents. With this legend we will hide the date of the found ation and the goal of the Association. This will be our principal weapon. Occultism will be a disguise even for our brothers although they reach the highest o f degrees; in regard to these degrees, I must let you know bef orehand that with brothers Moab and Hiram we will m ake different degrees for the associates and, once in o rder, we will make them known so you may give us y our opinion. What’s more, we will hide all the decrees issued by us nine. Besides, it will not escape your profound discemment that the absolute concealment will prov oke the desire to enter our Association, to know th e occult. There will be other secrets, secondary ones, that the brother will only be able to know after taking the General Oath, the text of which we will study in the next s ession. The Oath will oblige him to keep the secret ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Chapters 7 to 19 CHAPTER SEVEN The General Oath On August 10 th the nine founders met, presided over by the King, who opened the session saying: Dear Brothers: We, the founders, have outlined our fundamental mission, We have evaluated our responsi bility faced with the horrifying and private Oath that we have taken. Now we must study the text of the oath that those who desire to join our Association must take. I wil l read its text and if you approve it, we will decr ee it and record it. It will be called the general Oath. Text of the General Oath that every affiliate must take “I, John Doe, son of John Doe, swear by God, the Bi ble and my honor that, since I have been accepted a s an affiliate and member in the Association, ‘The Myste rious Force,’ not to betray my brothers (its member s), in anything that might harm their persons or malign th e decrees of the Association, to fulfill in everyth ing what its active members decree and not to reveal anything of its secrets to anyone. If I betray this oath, my t hroat will be cut and any type of death will be permitted for me. ” Brothers: If the affiliate is Jewish we will make t he truth known to him, that is, that the goal of th e Association is Jewish union; and if he is not a Jew we will not permit him to understand anything, but then we mus t have assured ourselves that we are not dealing with a sp y or partisan of our enemies. As he progresses up t he scale of the degrees of the Association, he will be advanced little by little in the knowledge of the primordia l goals and at an opportune moment it will be revealed to him t hat the fundamental goal is to kill the partisans o f Jesus and to preserve the Jewish religion. Then there will be no need to oblige him, for he will do so with all enthusiasm. Let us not forget that the greatest of the fundamen tal secrets, hermetically guarded, is the date of t he foundation and the names of the founders. If they ask us .we m ust hide the truth, lie, lie in the interests of th e Association, the Jewish religion and the Jewish nation. Thus we must answer. “In a room in the palace of King Herod the Great papers were found that contain ancient Egypti an laws, signs and symbols with mysterious words concerning this Association. Said papers were inher ited from our remote ancestors of a date impossible to know. Do they date back to Solomon, David or Moses, or to earlier epochs? We do not know.” How does this reply seem to you? Will you approve i t? Yes, they all said; and it was recorded. It Is cle ar here that the goal of ancient Masonry was solely the preservation of the Jewish religion. The new Masonr y, that Is, after the year 1717, tripled Its goal: one port (the Jews) preserved the ancient principles; the second group embraced the principles of Desaguliers, that is, to attack Catholicism; and the third group adopts the principles of naturalism and nihilism."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 CHAPTER EIGHT The manner of joining Hiram said: King Herod Agrippa, Moab Levy and Hiram Abiud agreed on a special form for those whom they wish to join the Association. They hold that the fo rm of affiliation should be different from and supe rior to that of all associations, companies or brotherhoods—this being done for the purpose of creating prestige am ong the affiliates, who, besides attaching great importance to it, will have to fear it. We will make this obj ective easier, saying we have inherited this form mentioned, we ha ve found it among the papers found by King Herod in the coffers of his father. And that is how we wish to p reserve the memories of our ancestor founders of th is Association, also we will preserve the rest of the relics that remind us of their zeal for the Jewish religion and people; preserving all these memories we will fulfi ll our Jewish religious and civil obligations. This version, Majesty, must be anther of the secret s known only by us, the nine founders. What do you think of this, my Lord? The owner of this Manuscript. Your idea is commendable, Hiram. My opinion is to b andage the eyes of the postulant so he may see abso lutely nothing of the temple until after the oath. While outside, his eyes will be bandaged; the porte r delivers him to the sponsor, who, in turn, conduc ts him toward the President, telling him in his ear to tak e three steps, beginning with the right foot. Then, he makes him pass between two columns. This act symbolizes t hat the outsider, the stranger, the foreigner is, b efore entering, in darkness, and joining us and taking th e oath he is transported from darkness to light, th e Jewish religion being represented by the light. The president calls him and makes him swear to the oath. The president will have in his hands a sword whose blade will be over the neck of the postulant. In fr ont of him and in the hands of the sponsor will be the Bible (Torah). The oath taken, the bandage is removed and he finds himself with a sword held over his head and in fro nt of his eyes the Bible and a light. Then the sponsor puts a small apron on him that sym bolizes his affiliation with us to participate in t he construction of the walls of our edifice, which is the fortification of the Jewish religion and the pr otection of its existence. His explanation finished, the King said to his two companions: Do you approve this? They answered in the affirmati ve. On the following day the nine founders were summoned and informed about the manner of joining, the lecture effected by Hiram. All approved it, it being noted in the record."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 CHAPTER NINE In the interior of the Temple Designation of the tasks of the Founders King Agrippa said: We all know that our edifice is constructed on the foundations of brotherhood. In s pite of the fact that brotherhood and trust are our emblems , each one of us will have his specific-mission whi ch he will carry out with all fidelity, with all zeal. I believe we must begin by assigning a commission t o each one of us who will accept, confirming in tha t way their adherence to the principles of the Associatio n and submitting to any sacrifice for its service. Each one must, before his colleagues, demonstrate to be imit ated, two qualities: humility and conformity, so al l may know that there is no room in his heart for envy. T hat is, each one will accept his commission without envying his colleague; thus your abnegation will be proven. When you will know your respective commissions, if anyone has any objection, he must reveal it; or, if he does not, we will record his approval. • President: King Herod Agrippa • Vice President: Hiram Abiud • First Secretary: Moab Levy • Second Secretary: Adoniram • Observer: Johanan • First Assistant: Abdon • Second Assistant: Antipa • Sponsor: Aberon • Porter: Abia All approved the distribution of the commissions, i t being noted in the records of the Association. J ohanan proposed that the name of the meeting place be Temp le, claiming to Immortalize the Temple of Solomon. In 1717 it was changed to the name of Lodge. In the n ew Masonry, the title of Assistant was changed by Desaguliers. Note also that at the beginning no mon ey was required because there was no treasurer. Th e member who is in charge of the affiliation of those who solicit entry. The King said: You already know that we must make e veryone believe that our Association is very ancien t. And so there may be no doubt about the legend of th e “found papers,” we will place in our temple Symbo ls from ancient times, such as those Solomon used in h is Temple. We will erect two Pillars as Solomon did in the Tem ple. We will call the first BOOZ and the second JAC HIN. One will be to the right; the other to the left. We will say also that our brother, Hiram Abiud, is Hi ram Abiff, the Great Syria1 Architect called by Solomon for the co nstruction of the Temple. These two subterfuges mus t be noted in the general principles of the .Association . We will reinforce this deceit with the use of the i nstruments of construction that the architect Hiram utilized in the construction, such as the Square, the Compass, the Trowel, the Scales, the Hammer, etc., all of wo od as Hiram Abiff had them. It is fundamental that the front of the Temple must face the East, a point that I will explain to you later. I believe also that we must adopt symbols inspired by the fir mament, such as the stars, the sun and the moon, sy mbols that remind us more of antiquity. We will also util ize other symbols to recall the impostor Jesus, the images of which we will select so they may be adopted by our sons and grandsons who inherit this History togethe r with the administration of our new Association."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 This is what I wanted to consult with you with resp ect to the form and aspect of the temple we have fo unded and the responsibilities we have thus acquired and decreed in this blessed week, blessed week!

This indicates that we have no envy, t hat we have no pride. Alleluia! 39 We have. completed, thanks be to God, the task of the foundation of the Temple, and we have, in principle, agreed on the c hoice of symbols, overcoming all disagreement and all envy. Alleluia! We have prepared some symbols in conformance with w hat was decreed in the previous session. Here are t he two pillars: Booz 40 and Jachin. 41 Here also are some builders’ instruments that are made of wood in order to verify that our Association dates from Solomon’s Te mple or perhaps earlier, because the instruments ut ilized in the construction of Solomon’s Temple were all of wo od. Let us erect the two pillars, one at the right and the other at the left. Let us bless them. We bless thes e instrument and we also bless these various symbol s of Jesus 42 that represent, ironically, some episode of those t hat the Impostor spoke of during his preaching in h is instructions and blasphemies, such as the cock, the sword, the light, the darkness, the hammer, becaus e of its being the instrument that was used to nail his hand s and his feet, and with it we will open all the se ssions, emphasizing this irony. Every session will be opene d by striking three times consecutively with this h ammer; thus we will remember eternally, through the centur ies, that we have crucified him and that with this hammer we have fixed the nails in his hands and feet, kill ing him. These three stars you see symbolize the th ree nails. We would be able to change them for three points th at VI have the same significance. Among our symbols will be the three steps, ridiculing with them this blasp hemy: God is Father, Son and Holy Ghost, with his c laiming to be the Son. Within our Association, we will make degrees, as we have mentioned previously. These will be thirty-th ree, symbolizing the age of the impostor. We will give a name to each degree and we will create other simil ar symbols. All these things were my idea and those of brothers Moab and Hiram. The meaning of these iron ic symbols must not be perceived; it must remain among the nine of us. For the other brothers or affiliat es it is enough to make them see the utilities and instrumen ts so they may believe that the Association was fou nded in the times of Solomon or earlier than this. Any brot her can propose a new symbol. What do you think and observe, brothers, concerning what I have presented to you. The six men 43 approved without objection, everything being recorded. Then the King said: Let us rejoice! Let us begin the mar ch on the path to triumph! Let us take our first three steps! Let us strike three times with this victorious ham mer,with the symbol of death for our enemy the Imposter, the sym bol of the establishment of our honorable principle s that we fix with the nails of brotherhood and union! Let us all exclaim with joy: Onward to Victory!   39 Praise God. 40 Symbol of strength. 41 Symbol of firm establishment. 42 Referring to Jesus, but not conceding the word ‘Christ. ’ Translator’s note. 43 The King, Hiram and Moab being the ones who conceived t he Idea as of the symbols."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 CHAPTER ELEVEN The First Session and the First Temple On November 4 of the same year, 43 A.D., the first official session was realized in the first temple o f Jerusalem, which was a basement in the Palace of King Agrippa. The nine founders began their works preparing the i nstruments of construction made of wood and creatin g a new symbol: the apron that symbolized the protectio n of the clothing from the mud; all this to conceal the true purpose and to assure the affiliates of the antiqui ty of the Association. The King-President said: I, with my authority as Pr esident (And not as King) grant each one of you the 33 rd degree, the highest degree in our Association. From now on, each of you will enjoy this high degree. B ut I want to mention something to our brother, Hiram, hoping you may ,agree with me. I wish to make the 3 rd degree special, and call it Hiram’s degree, because he is the one who merits the distinction, the gratitude a nd the immortalization for being the first who founded the idea of founding this Association. He is the creat or of this glorious idea. I grant him also the title of Master , because I consider, and you will consider it so w ith me, that Hiram is the Master. He is the one who deserves the title that the Impostor Jesus falsely attributed t o himself. We will call this third degree, “the degree of Mast er Hiram.” And since our brother Hiram is orphaned of his fath er since childhood, knowing no one other than his w idowed mother, I propose to call our Association, “The Wid ow,” asking your approval. From now on the name of the founders will be “The S ons of the Widow.” Each member of the Association w ill call himself a son of the widow until the end of ti me because we believe that our Association will liv e until the end of time. For all that we honor our brother Hira m, we will not succeed in esteeming his grand favor . We must honor him still more. But the title of Widow a grees with the object of our Association because th e widow always needs help and aid, this title being the sym bol of the co-operation and help among us, besides recognizing Hiram’s work. Do you’ approve all this? Everything was approved and recorded."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 CHAPTER TWELVE Preaching to attract affiliates The nine founders, with the exception of the King, 44 began the campaign for the inscription of affiliat es in the Association. They dispersed primarily in the city of Jerusalem, noting the names of the solicitants, taking them to the Temple and making them inscribe without making known to th em the real purposes of the Association (to attack Jesus’ men). After having taken the oath, they informed th em of the true goals. They inculcated in them that this Association, “The Mysterious Force,” existed since the most remote antiquity, being revived at the wil l of the King so it might be the one powerful means of defea ting the enemies of the Jewish religion who were di spersed everywhere and with great activity. Hiram said: We let any person affiliate at no cost. In that way their number increased rapidly and we began to attack Jesus’ men with all energy, impeding the peo ple’s following them. Many times we have caught the m in our nets with traps and deceit, killing those of th em that we could. They fled from us like Iambs befo re ferocious wolves. But they grew firmly in the faith of their new religion in the measure in which we p ersecuted them. They increased in number and in firmness. It seemed as if they did not fear us. It was obvious t hat a hidden force sustained them in spite of our persecu tion. For that reason we consulted among ourselves, we renewed our forces and we strengthened our Associat ion because it was the only means of realizing our objective until the last phase. Based on this and o n our solemn oath it was inevitable that we face th e force that at the beginning, we believed to be weak. We decide d to face death if it were necessary. We dedicated ourselves to increasing our forces, increasing the number of inscribers. Within two months we achieved 2000 brothers, bearer s of the title, Mysterious Ones. 45 We began to found affiliates in several places, dependent on the prin cipal Temple.   44 His royal position Impeded his preaching. 45 Members of the Mysterious Force."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 CHAPTER THIRTEEN The Foundation of Secondary Temples in Judea Hiram Abiud said: If it were not for our firmness i n the protection of the Jewish religion, all Jerusa lem might have fallen from our hands into the nets of the Imp ostor Jesus’ preachers. Because the preachers of hi s teachings, after his death, despite their boorishne ss, were going about bewitching the people. That fi rst successful campaign of ours incited us to establish affiliates everywhere, before the expansion of Jes us’ preachers might increase and before those inclined toward him might increase. We divided the founding commission in two: one part remained in Jerusalem, resuming the sessions under the presidency of the King, and activating and enthusin g the affiliates. The other part headed for differe nt points in Palestine, one in each direction, preaching the pri nciples of the Association, making known the hatred against Jesus and his followers among the people and threat ening with death whoever would permit himself to be influenced by those impostor preachers, and warning especially the leaders of the villages, pressuring them to expel from their regions those men (Jesus’ men) who entered to preach. At times we found some men faithful to the Jewish r eligion who helped us in our proceedings. Other tim es we encountered strong resistance. And the majority of times the fire of discussion was ignited among fami lies and close relatives, coming to enmities and division. Some continued following those teachings, adopting them. Others followed us, opposing their deceived relatives, battling with them to death. Many of the se faithful enthusiasts killed their relatives for having followed the impostors. Such was the plan of each o f us founders: the establishment of Temples and aff iliates, persecution of the false preachers. With our action we impeded the fall of many thousan ds of persons into their hands. We established fort y-five temples from the day of the foundation to date, tha t is, fourteen months. Never have we taken a single step backward in our battle, in spite of the sorrow that is caused us by the fact that many of our people w ent with Jesus, giving in to the first followers and to the pagans who adopted his teachings. It caused us grief to see our relatives going to th e hands of our enemies, without our having succeede d in convincing them. We sacrificed our money, our time and our blood; we expelled them, we persecuted them and we killed those we could. If it were not for this b attle they might have dominated our Jewish nation, they might have eliminated our Jewish religion and we ourselve s might have inevitably fallen just like the others who fell in the chasms of the deceit and in the snores of th ose impostors. Thus we recommend to our sons, grandsons and descen dants who continue our action, not to be discourage d and to continue on the path we have outlined, armed with the “Mysterious Force” that we have founded, that it may continue battling that diabolic force 46 until the end of time as long as it exists and as long as it has imposter partisans. We commend to you, oh descendants of ours, you who love your religion and your people! We commend to you the task of not letting die what we have revive d, for your life and your religion. We commend you exceedingly with the defense of the religion until death as your emblem and sentiment, We commend you not to deviate from our line, a line of heroes that we hav e outlined for you with our blood, with the sweat o f our brows, with our money and with our time; with which we have saved our religion, defeating our enemies and killing a number of them.   46 The force of Jesus Christ Is referred to."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 If this number had given in to their companions, th e impostors might have defeated us, our religion pe rishing.

But, vain were our efforts to impede a great number from falling into his nets. Vain were the threats of death to recall them to our path. They had deaf ears. Our ar guments, even the most extreme, were worth nothing to counteract the force of that doctrine. Nor was it p ossible for us to impede our Jewish people from ado pting its principles. However, we must not forget the activit y and zeal of our brothers, the founders, who perfo rmed miracles when faced with that current and in awaken ing thousands of our nation, directing toward us ha nds of moral and material collaboration.

With the valuabl e counsels of those rich and benevolent men who offer ed us their moral and materiel help without joining the Association, we have achieved a new system: the est ablishment of similar associations with another nam e, because according to information, many members are afraid to belong to the Association, “The Mysteriou s Force.”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 CHAPTER FOURTEEN The establishment of Associations affiliated to our s, but with other names 47 After having obtained unexpected results by our act ion and after having erected our works on firm foun dations and subjecting the affiliate temples to the orders of the Principal Temple, we all returned to Jerusal em and held a meeting in the presence of the nine founders, dur ing which each one of us gave an account of the ext ent of his journey and mission with, reference to the foundati on of affiliate temples. This success pleased King Herod exceedingly. He was even more pleased by our valian t attitude in front of the impostors and he was tremendously impressed to know that we succeeded ex tremely well in killing a great number of them with all the means within our reach, blocking their efforts, destroying their preaching and making their snares useless. With this we prevented people from attending their meetings. Some simple elements that were obstinate we considered of no importance because they belonged t o the lower class. In the course of the meeting the proposal of some w ealthy enthusiasts, in regard to establishing affil iates of our Association with other names (different from “The M ysterious Force”), but having nevertheless the some principles, was put forth. This proposal achieved the agreement of the King an d the members and was recorded. The names of the affiliate associations is the resp onsibility and choice of their founders or leaders, under the elementary conditions that they must have the same principles as the Mysterious Force, except in what concerned the degrees, the signs, the instruments a nd the other characteristics of our Association. Th e symbol of these must be two hands interlocked: Union and Coll aborator. The oath of these brotherhoods must be synthesized in the following text: “I, John Doe, Son of John Do e, swear by God, my creed and my honor, to unite myself to m y brothers of the Association (whatever brotherhood } with everything they desire to realize, to collaborate w ith them and to be as one heart with them until dea th.” . With this decree we ended the session, each one of us obtaining a copy of the aforementioned oath. Eac h one of us left then, in his respective direction, resuming our work without neglecting our original, first ta sk. Such was our march in the path of the battle, rapid ly establishing several brotherhoods with different names: “The Jewish Brotherhood,” “The National Union,” “Th e Religious Collaboration,” “The Religious Obligati on,” etc. These brotherhoods made great progress thanks to the will of the leaders whom we selected as foun ders. These were the only ones who knew the relationship existing between the brother- hoods and our associa tion. In the ,majority of cases, they were wealthy men. With their material aid, the number of affiliates in th eir brotherhoods increased and their number surpassed o urs. We appreciate them immensely, in the name of religion and in the name of the nation. Their name and ours will be immortalized in History until the end of time.   47 It Is obvious that this record Is not only Hiram’s, b ut also that of all the brother founders who scattered th roughout Palestine."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 CHAPTER FIFTEEN The death of Herod Agrippa, founder of the Associat ion The member founders fulfilled their tasks everywher e. They received orders from King Agrippa to battle , to sacrifice themselves, to disseminate the doctrine, to increase the number of Temples and Brotherhoods, to battle strictly the preachers of the Impostor. This campai gn was arranged by the two great men: King Agrippa and Hiram Abiud, who will be remembered gloriously unti l the end of time, because with this Association th ey revived an entire nation, surpassing their ancestor s in the defense of the religion. Those (the ancestors) persecuted and killed the Imp ostor, crucifying him, but these two great thinkers created a work that never crossed the mind of any man. Those killed some of Jesus’ men; these, on the other hand , performed great marvels by their secret efforts and by their strict orders, killing hundreds of those confused confusers. At this height of our battle, while we, the nine, a nd the other members of the central Temple and the other Temples were at the peak of the fighting, our presi dent, the King, contracted an illness in his sight, and became blind within five days. Then he was attacked in his body, and became completely paralyzed. But in spit e of his sufferings he did not relax in reanimating our spir its to persevere in the battle. I being the closest, 48 the King, during his agony, entrusted to me his fi nal secrets and his final will, addressing these last words to me in a passionate tone: “Keep the secret! Continue the Action! Work untirin gly! Destroy everything that...!” Here he caught hi s breath, and his soul left. This was in the year 44 after th e Impostor. For me, these phrases are my greatest joy and my gr eatest honor. I incorporate them in my discourses a nd they will be cited in the private and public meetings as a sacred verse. “Keep the secret! Continue the Act ion! Work, untiringly!” I desire that these phrases be the pri ncipal foundation of our works, to construct on the m our success with the extermination of the preachers of the Impostor Jesus.   48 This being the copy of Abraham Abiud, the heir of Hiram Abiud, it is understood that the one who speaks here is Hiram, one of the nine founders."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 CHAPTER SIXTEEN Hiram succeeds King Agrippa in the Presidency of th e Association After the death of King Agrippa, Hiram was designat ed as president of the Central Temple of Jerusalem and President General of the Association, “The Mysterio us Force,” in a legal election realized by the eigh t founders, achieving the unanimous vote of the seven. In place of the King, Agrippa was named as a member ; he took the terrible oath and knew the secret. Ou r brother Hiram deserved the testimony of the King an d ours as a true founder. All has been done thanks to his intelligence and will. One of his ideas during the succession was the suggestion of giving another nam e to the “Temple of Jerusalem,” that of “The Great Eastern S tar.” He wanted to signify by this that the true li ght that illuminates and orients is this star and not the on e that the Magi Kings claimed to have oriented them when they come from the East to visit the infant Impostor. Then Hiram ordered that the star be drawn in the ba ckground of the Temple, behind the head of the Pres ident, on the upper port, and that it was to be surrounded by the words, written in purple: “The Great Easter n Star.” He also ordered that the same thing be drawn above the interior door. The president began a campaign to establish affilia te temples in the north of Palestine, delegating th e presidency to Moab Levy, going himself to the different parts of the country, founding temples, disseminating hat e for the Impostor in the hearts of the people and stating th at the teachings of his preachers were lies. Hiram, in his lengthy journey, arrived at Sidon, 49 persecuting Jesus’ men, causing fear in the hearts of the simple folk who followed him. Seeing that the numbe r of Jesus’ followers increased enormously he asked the collaboration of his own companion founders. Moab s ent him two: Adoniram and Agrippa. The three resume d the persecution against the impostors wherever they went, arriving even earlier in the respective vill ages in order not to leave them time or opportunity to prea ch.   49 A city In Lebanon."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Hiram’s disappearance The three missionaries dispersed in the eastern par t of Sidon, penetrating the lands of Lebanon. A sho rt time after the meeting of Adoniram and Agrippa with Hira m and the departure of each one in a different dire ction, Hiram disappeared without his companions’ taking no tice. Informed, Agrippa exclaimed: “Hiram disappeared! Ou r President has been killed! What a disaster! I saw him last in Sidon!” When the news reached Jerusalem all the member founders except Johanan, who was sick, left for the region of Sidon. They began the search for their Brother and President, without finding traces . Tobalcain, Hiram’s nephew, who accompanied the memb ers from the Temple, commented that, based on some information from the inhabitants he could have been a victim of wolves; a rumor was circulating among the inhabitants that wolves had devoured a dervish 50 and several other persons in those cold days of fu ll-blown winter. For that reason they hastened the search, s eparating among themselves, but each little group accompanied by the residents of those areas, with t he hope of coming upon Hiram’s body if it were true that he had died. Adonirom and Tobalcain, searching in the southeast direction, observed from afar three large birds gat hered over an object under a tree. Approaching it, they s aw a body lacerated by the birds and other beasts, devoured for the most part. They recognized it immediately a s Hiram’s body, by its clothing and especially by h is silver ring with the hammer engraved on it. The birds they saw were vultures. They gathered up his remains, his clothing, the rin g and some branches of the tree in whose shade the body was and went back to Jerusalem. (We do not know of what species that tree was, but we believe that it is o f the type called “Acacia.”) Having arrived in Jerusalem they presented everything to the Temple.His nephew, Toba lcain, succeeded Hiram; he took the Oath and received the secret. Moab Levy was elected President. The first of his o rders was to cover the Temple of Jerusalem and the other affiliate temples with black letters as a sign of m ourning for our brother Hiram. Then he ordered a ma gnificent wake only among the “Mysterious Ones” 51 in all the temples on the same night. He also ordered that the commemoration of this wake be revived as long as the Association exists. As w e read here these orders were recorded. Later the transfer al of the first secretariat to Adoniram and the sec ond to Johanan was decreed. King Agrippa had given the Third Degree the name of Master Hiram. Completing the homage to the Master, Moab Levy ordered that the wake be realized every t ime the Third Degree was granted to a member. The member must represent our dead brother, Hiram, thus to keep his memory alive.These orders were recorde d, becoming a part of our Fundamental Laws. In the following session I suggested the following: 52 I have an idea that, without doubt, will be the “b est backbone for our principle that indicates moving ba ck the date of the foundation by thousands of years . I beg you, Brothers, not to accuse me of exaggerating the fame of my uncle Hiram with this idea. This is not my purpose, no. Listen to me: One of the principal dec rees that I have read in the texts of our History i ndicates the   50 We dressed ourselves as dervishes: says Tobalcain. 51 Translator’s note: members of the Mysterious Force. 52 It is obviou s that from here on the one who records in the copy Is Tobolcoin Abiud, Hiram’s nephew."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 hiding of the date of the foundation of our Associa tion from all the people, including from our brothe rs in the Association, so they remain completely ignorant of its origin. My opinion is the following: We must make known to the Mysterious Ones that the wake of homage mention ed is made in memory of Hiram Abiff, the Syrian, the A rchitect of the Temple of Solomon, killed by the th ree workers. With this deception we affirm before every one the antiquity of this Association, the secret b eing kept forever. With this event, the nine of us immortalize the mem ory of my uncle, the martyr of the Association. The general and public remembrance will be for Hiram Abiff. And so the mysterious ones do not understand anything of this, and to fortify the belief in the antiquity of the Association, we must make the date of the firs t order decreed by the Central Temple for the realization of the wa ke be the date of the creation of Man. We must add this principle to our others and note it in the records; thus, linking our true date with that of the begin ning of creation, we will increase the preoccupation, the d oubt in the world. Do you approve what is proposed, Brothers? All made known their delight in this idea , recording it with appreciation to Tobalcain for h is wisdom and timeliness. Adoniram added: It is not fitting t o realize the homage of the wake on the same night, as the President said, especially at this time nor is it f itting to inform the temples for their participatio n with us. Listen to my arguments: As the news of the death of our brother Hiram is al ready known it will not be easy to convince the mys terious ones that the wake will be for the soul of Hiram Ab iff, the architect of the Temple of Solomon. The ni ne of us alone must realize the wake for the soul of our bro ther Hiram Abiud, without making it known to anyone . Then we will keep it in reserve until a time passes duri ng which the people’s recollection of the memory of our Hiram will be erased. We, the nine, and whoever succeeds us through the c enturies, will not forget it. How can we forget it if there will be a copy of this History in the hand of each one of the nine? And thus we will complete the dece ption in such a way that none of the mysterious ones will su spect that the wake of the third degree corresponds to our brother, Hiram, president and founder of this Assoc iation. And everyone will believe that the wake of the third degree is for Hiram Abiff, the architect of the Tem ple of Solomon, it being impressed in the mind of t he people that the origin of the Association is prior to Solo mon. Thus no one will know anything of the date, th e purpose, the place and the founders of the Association. Will you trust me Brothers, to prepare the text for thi s proposal? We approved it and assigned Adoniram to do so."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Plan for the wake held as homage in honor of Hiram Abiud, founder of the Association The task assigned to Adoniram completed, we held a session to discuss that matter. During the session our brother Adoniram read the following: Each one of us values Hiram as highly as King Agrippa, and we kno w that the King decreed that the third degree be deno ted, “The Degree of Master Hiram.” To dignify even more this degree and in homage to the King as well as to Hiram, I believe that what I read to you should fo rm part of the rites of the Third Degree. I say: 1. Place the remains of our brother Hiram in a hidden room, with the door open. We will place in it his mantle, clothing and ring, and besides, a branch of those that accompanied his remains. 2. Two of us will go around, seeking the remains and r eturn lamenting on not having found them. 3. Then five will go around, for the same purpose, ret urning, crying for not having found them. 4. Then we will all go about and seek separately here and there until finding his remains in the hidden room. 5. Having prepared then a coffin and a black mantle, s ome of us will return and, bringing the remains and Hiram’s articles, we will place them in the coffin and cover them with the black mantle. 6. We will carry the coffin to the temple and over the mantle will be written the words, “dead,” “living. ” Then we will begin the mourning, each one crying an d pronouncing phrases of sorrow and lamentation. 7. We will light three lanterns: two over his head, wh ich will be directed toward the “Eastern Star,” and the third lantern over his feet. This is the symbol of the three nails with which we nailed Jesus. 8. The President will read some prayers for his soul, pointing out his character, his works and the grace s attained for the good of the Association. He will r ecall that he was its founder and that he died a ma rtyr to religious duty. That is why he is living, becaus e he lives forever in us and in these symbols I hav e mentioned. 9. We will uncover the coffin and look at the remains as if he would speak to us. Then the President will say: “Speak,Hiram! Inform us about your battle and who killed you! We have heard that you did not perish by a natural death. 10. The President will kneel near his head and say the following discourse, representing Hiram. “I sought you, dear brothers, during my battle and in the las t moment of my life I found no one! “Indeed, I have not died a natural death; a hand ki lled me; the hand of the enemies or their followers ! “ I have died far from you! But my memory will live among yo u until the end of time! Keep my memory and my principles always! Fight as I have fought, attackin g the Impostor’s men who divided our religion! Do n ot fear nor lament for me! I am not dead! I am among you un til the end of time! Do not renounce the mission of uniting our religion! I will help you wherever I am; my sou l prays for you, my eyes watch you forever! Fight k eeping the secret of my indestructible principles! “To you I deliver the instruments, the implements w ith which I constructed this hidden edifice. “To you I give a name and a memory that will live f orever. “Attack your enemies, the Impostor’s men. Increase and grow. I am here watching your acts. In the fina l encounter I will pass judgment on you when I hear y ou say to me: ‘You remained living among us, oh Hir am!’ “Brother founders, I call you from this desolation, I greet you, asking life for you and your Associat ion. Death to your enemies!”"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 After the President finishes, kneeling, his discour se, as if Hiram himself had spoken, we will carry H iram’s remains to bury them in the tomb we have prepared a t the side of the Temple. From now on, the first of the conditions that the a spirant to the third degree (that of Hiram) must fu lfill, is that of representing our dead brother; suffering the ins ults and the bitterness’s that Hiram suffered in hi s battles on behalf of the principles of the Association. The as sociate must accept being placed in a coffin repres enting the corpse of Hiram. The coffin is left with the gradua te in a dark room representing Hiram in the desolat e field where he died. Then it is to be carried to the Temp le and placed between the two columns: Booz and Jac hin. You must know the importance of the following matte r. he who reaches the third degree must not relate its secrets to one who is lower, so the latter may not know its rites until his graduation. Before finishi ng Adoniran said: What do you think of what I have proposed to you? To which we answered that we approved the prec ision of his opinion; then it was recorded. On the following day we buried Hiram in accord with the approved norms. After burying the remains, the nine of us completing the wake in homage, Adoniram said: Brothers: These symbols are exclusively for the nine of us and those who succeed us. Thus it will continue as a memory and secret among the nine successors. N one of the other Mysterious Ones must know that the homage is for our brother, Hiram Abiud, for on knowing it they will know that our Association was founded recently to combat Jesus’ men. This would be troublesome fo r us because it would alienate many who desire to join. In order to fulfill our purpose and to make the sec ret more hermetic, we must add to these symbols, ot her objects and symbols pertaining to Hiram Abiff, Solo mon’s architect. I will prepare them and explain th em to you. Thus the mysterious ones will believe that the graduate represents Hiram Abiff and they will be c onvinced that the Association is most ancient, from remote t imes. 53 You must remember that this degree is one of the mo st important traditional degrees.   53 Jonas: These were the ridiculous legends of our ancestors an d that was their fanaticism. They Insisted that these symbol s remain in th e Association as long as it existed. The first condition that our ancestor Joseph Levy, imposed on Desaguliers was to preserve those symbols and legends, as was noted in the first section of this book."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 CHAPTER NINETEEN The signs of recognition and the norms for entering the Temple Adoniram said: We have taken the symbols for our As sociation from the stars, from the implements of construction and architecture, and from what the Im postor said and did. We must now, brothers, create general signs that may be known by all the mysterious ones, not only by the nine of us. The purpose of this is so they may recognize one another wherever they meet. Here I read to you what I have prepared: 1. He who desires to enter the Temple officially, may not do so until the Commission of the Temple is certain that he is a mysterious one. It will be kno wn if he answers properly with the secret word that they will know. 2. On entering he must take the three steps that we ha ve so disposed in such a way that with the third st ep he may arrive at the center of the space bound by t he two pillars. Then he greets the President in the following manner: the right hand is placed over his head; then he lowers it and places it, open, over his breast, below his neck. He will repeat his greeting three times; 54 The President stands and strikes three times with the hammer, lifting it over the head of the visitor, as if to threaten him. Then the presid ent sits and the visitor, too. These movements signify that the visitor repeats the oath that he took when he w as accepted as a member, that he is firm and active in the service of the Association, that he is sincere and that he will never betray it. The movement of the p resident symbolizes his threat with death if he bet rays it. 55 3. The mysterious one carries out these movements befo re whomever he wishes in order to make himself known, on the condition that he does not make the s ignificance understood. 4. In case of danger or to ask help, the mysterious on e will lift his clasped hands above his head. If th ere are mysterious ones near him they will offer him as sistance. 5. Recognition with the eyes. Looking first at the for ehead, then turning the eyes toward the left should er, then toward the right shoulder. If the other one is a mysterious one he must do the same, thus realizi ng the recognition. 56 6. Recognition by touch. It is indispensable. It must be carried out in the following way: when the greet ing is effected by the pressing of hands, the mysteriou s one will exert light pressure with his thumb over the first joint of the index finger of the one greeted. If the latter is a mysterious one, he will respond with the same movement, realizing immediately the recognitio n. 57 7. Recognition by speech. I believe that it is fitting to have a “key” word and that it be sacred for us. I suggest that this word be BOOZ. When one asks the m ysterious one, Are you a mysterious one? He will answer, “B;” then the other must say “0.” The first will say “0.” And the inquirer will complete it, “ Z.” Then they will recognize one another. 58 8. Recognition by age. Mocking Jesus, his acts and his teachings with everything that was in our reach, w e made the Degrees of our Association be of the numbe r 33, symbolizing ironically his age. I think that the age of the mysterious one should be in accord w ith the following points: a. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 1 st to the 3 rd degree be: three years, mocking thus the belief of the Impostor’s men that he was three days in the tomb. b. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 4 th to the 30 th degree be: 33 years, mocking the age of the Impostor.   54 Jonas: It was made clear to me that modem Masonry has evolved somewhat with respect to these signs, as will be seen in my s tudies of the new Masonry. 55 Jonas: This is changed In the new Masonry. 56 Jonas: This is changed in the new Masonry. 57 This greeting exists in new Masonry thanks to our ancest or Levy who insisted on preserving It because It was one of the first princlpa1 movements. 58 Modified in the new Masonry."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 c. Let the age of the mysterious one from the 31 st to the 33 rd degree be unlimited, ridiculing thus their claim that the Impostor arose from the tomb a nd ascended to Heaven and that he lives for ever. 59 d. We consider the age of our Association from the beg inning of human creation, One, asking the other, What is the age of your widowed mother? The other must answer him, As old as Creation. The widow is our association, Thus King Agrippa, ou r first President, named it, reviving the memory of our brother Hiram, the son of the widow. Thus you must recognize yourselves. You must preserve these principles until the end of tim e.

Tobalcain Abiud said: Some years after the death of my uncle, Hiram Abiud, I felt the obligation of carrying out the will of King Agrippa and our earlier decree s, giving orders to the other temples of the Associ ation so they might consider the third degree, the degree of Master Hiram, as a legal and canonical degree. I m ade my opinion known to my eight companions who approved i t. Our brother, Adoniram, had already prepared, according to his promise, the necessary supplements that would indicate Hiram Abiff, the architect of the Temple of Solomon and that would be attributed to h im. With reference to this Adoniram said: When any brother ascends to the third degree, all the rites that we, the nine, have performed in the wake for o ur brother Hiram Abiud, must be realized in him, but in the fo llowing concealed manner: After transferring the coffin from the dark room to the temple, ending with all the rites, includin g the president’s discourse, representing Hiram, the mart yr of our religious battle (we must not neglect the act of eliminating from this specialized rite for all the temples, all reference to our brother Hiram, changi ng them for those that indicate Hiram Abiff), the aspirant is m ade to arise from the coffin and, with his eyes blindfolded, 60 the President leads him to a closed door of those o f the temple where he says to him: “Enter after kno cking on this door three times.” The aspirant knocks. A memb er of the commission opens the door from within whe re he receives him with the hammer of the Impostor Jesus, 61 striking him on the back of the neck, 62 and asking him: “Where were you and where are you going?” to which the aspirant will answer: “I was in idleness and no w I go to fight.” The member replies: “You are lost, march by another path.” The designated guide leads him t o another door, knocking three times. The door is ope ned by another mysterious one, receiving him with a blow of the hammer on his forehead, asking him as the fi rst one did and receiving the same reply. Then the mysterious one will say: “You lost the way for the battle, you must follow me, knowing the path is dif ficult and dangerous.” He conducts him to a third door or to t he same door but via a most difficult trip, during which he encounters many obstacles and suffers several falls . Once he will fall over thorns or rocks; another t ime he will go down or up a hill. All these obstacles will be p repared in the temple for this purpose. On arriving at the third door he knocks on it. The door is open, where a mys terious one gives him blows on the upper part of hi s head with a hammer. Immediately the aspirant’s guide thr ows him to the floor as if he had died. Then they c arry him, place him in the coffin and cover him with a mantle , leaving him with his eyes blindfolded. Immediatel y the President or another member of the commission reads the following discourse:   60 Jonas: It seem s that in ancient Masonry the eyes of the my sterious one were blindfolded only when he ascended to the t hird degree (the degree of Master Hiram). 61 That Is, the hammer with which Jesus was nailed. 62 The blows are light because they are symbolic. In new Mason ry the site of the blows was changed."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 “Brothers, you have seen in this traditional cel ebration, several spectacles that symbolize an exal ted goal that cannot be attained without bearing suffering, fatig ue and bitterness. Said goal is the departure of th e man from death to life, this being impossible without his ex posing himself to the greatest hazards of death. Th ese sufferings that a new brother must suffer are the s ymbols of what I have just made known and also the historic symbol by which the new brother represents Hiram Ab iff in his arduous task of constructing the Temple of Solomon. Thus it is that by exaggeration in the gua rding of the secrets of his profession, architectur e, he was persecuted by three workers 63 who, after having imported heavy punishments and s ufferings, killed him at the third door. All this makes us understand that the p ath of the battle is difficult and dangerous. Never theless, we must not fear it nor deviate from it. We must conti nue in the path of courage to achieve our goals of fortifying the principles of our noble Association.” On ending his discourse, the president whispers in the ear of the aspirant that he is to rise from the coffin, standing between the two pillars where the blindfol d is removed. There the president will say: “Brothe r Aspirant to this sacred degree, you have heard what I have read when you were lying in this coffin whi ch is the symbol of the struggle. You represented boldness an d courage. You represented Hiram Abiff with his sec recy that he did not want to reveal, even to death. Look at these two columns that Hiram chose and erected in the back of the Temple of Solomon, Be as they are, stro ng in will and firm in principles.” After this, the aspirant will say the following words: “I am no more than force, will, decision and firmness. I will keep the secret of all that I have seen and he ard before men and even before the other mysterious ones who are below my degree.” Thus the new brother in the third degree will be lieve that during the rituals he represented Hiram Abiff, without having the least idea that that homage was a memorial act for our brother, Hiram Abiud, founde r of our Association, and therefore, he will not know either that it was founded recently and that we, the Nine , are the founders. Thus, Brothers, we will revive the memory of our brother, Hiram Abiud, with none of the mysterious ones or those outside our Association being informed of the intention of the nine of us, that is, the immortal ization of Hiram, the founder of our Association, its fountain and father to whom we owe all zeal, enthusiasm and gratitude. Do you approve what I have read to you, in order to read then the text of the order we must send to all the temples? Adonirom’s opinion was approved by all of us; we recorded it, and then we sent the order to t he affiliated temples for their knowledge of the norms of the third degree and for its execution with all meticulousness and secrecy.   63 Jonas: In the Masonry of our ancestors (The Mysterious Fo rce) the names of the three workers who “killed” Hiram were n ot mentioned. In new Masonry their names are: Jubilo, Jubila and Jubilum."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE The text of the order sent to all the temples of th e Association. The confirmation of the Third Degree: the Degree of Master Hiram and the Rituals of the Act From the central Temple in Jerusalem to all the oth er Temples: Brother mysterious ones, president and active members of the Association, The Mysterious Force, g ive glory to God. 64 Because our Association is of a most remote epoch and of unknown origin, we have tried t o satisfy our desire of knowing that secret but, unfortunately, it was as impossible for us as it wa s for our fathers and ancestors. All that we have obtained was a document among the papers of King Herod Agrippa, the president of our temple, whose text is as follo ws: “Since Hiram, the architect of the Temple of Sol omon, enjoyed the respect of his lord, and due to t he great favor he did in the foundation and construction of the Temple and the administration of its works, we decree that the third degree of the Association is to be t he one that bears his name: the degree of Master Hi ram; and that this is to last forever.” This found document is not signed by anyone, and obeying the will of the owner of this order, whoev er it may be, we order, in turn, that the Third Degree be den oted by the name of Hiram from today on. As we did not find among the papers, as we had expected, rituals perta ining to this degree, with the collaboration of the brothers, the members of the central temple, we have conceive d rituals that you must respect without neglecting anything in the act of a mysterious one’s ascending to the t hird degree. The norms that we have decreed are: 1. Reserve in each temple a very small and dark room. The brother of the second degree is taken to the room with his eyes blindfolded, before being admitt ed to the temple. The blindfold is removed and the door is closed. A coffin is prepared and a black m antle with the words, “living, dead” written on it. The two columns and the President’s table only are cove red with black cloths. 2. One of the members is sent to seek the mysterious o ne and returns saying that he has not found him. Two others are sent, returning and saying the same. And then four are sent who find him in the dark room. 3. The members of the commission walk toward the dark room carrying the” coffin and the mantle, where the aforementioned brother lies in the coffin with his eyes blindfolded, and they cover him with the mantle, placing over it the branch of acacia.

For they have won innumerable pagans, no less than those the impostors won with their magic force . Those two temples surpassed this temple of ours 67 when they killed Peter and his brother, Andrew, deservin g to perpetuate their memory in the pages of time. The dangerousness of those two preachers was noteworthy in their marvelous sermons, in their power of attr action and in their indescribable eloquence, in such a way that if it were not for the battle of those two te mples thousands of our nation would have been converted t o the Impostor’s religion. The two great temples mu st be glorified by every mysterious one, just as Hiram hi mself. May God protect them! They crucified Peter a nd Andrew just as the Impostor was crucified. They fri ghtened the people and paralyzed the movement of Je sus’ (followers) for a long time. We must follow the eff ective plan of those two temples to attain our goal , that is, the life of the Jewish religion; and woe to us if we fa ll back, for our works will be lost without our ach ieving our purpose. “For that reason I suggest the distribution of a general publication among all the temples, applaud ing the work of the temples of Rome and of Achaea, ordering all the mysterious ones to take them as an example. And in order to immortalize their memory we will make the day, November 30 of each year, the day of those two temples, celebrating it with all joy for its having been the day on which Andrew the Impostor was cruc ified.” Antipa’s proposal was approved. The publication was written and distributed. The day decreed for th e Temple of Achaea was recorded for their having killed Andr ew, this death being the fruit of the battle of tha t temple. 68 Jonas: (At this point there are some details tha t we omit from the translation, referring to the ma ssacres the mysterious ones committed against many of their bro thers who abandoned them and followed Jesus’ men, f or fear the,’ might reveal the Association’s secrets.)   67 The temple of Jerusalem. 68 Samuel, son of Jonas: Our ancestor could also have recorded June 29 as another feast of Masonry because it was the day of t he crucifixion of Peter, through the plot of the temple of Ro me.

So great was the success of his effort s that in his epoh, the numbers of the partisans of the Impos tor decreased. He conceived several ideas that offe red great benefits to the Association. He solved a great conf lict incited among the members of the principal tem ple. He created names for some decrees, after the degree of Hiram, of utmost importance. These are: • Degree 7: The Guide • Degree 9: The Elder • Degree 12: The Triumphant One • Degree 15: The Scientist • Degree 18: The Talented One • Degree 21: The Preacher • Degree 24: The Little Master • Degree 27: The Little Philosopher • Degree 30: The Kadosch • Degree 31: The Cross • Degree 32: The Great Architect • Degree 33: The Living Dead 70 Then Misraim gave this order. “To all the dear brother members of the affiliat e temples: Degree 33 being the symbol of the end of the, life of the impostor Jesus, we have decreed that the aspira nt to the Degree mentioned must wear a shirt of a p urple color with a cross of white fabric sewn over the br east, over the cross must be drawn the four letters INRI. 71 These letters will then be a sacred word of recogni tion for the degree mentioned, like the word BOOZ. And, as the secret word must be changed every six months, w e authorize the presidents of the temples to select the word they desire. Continue the battle to serve religion and the prestige of the Association. May union and occultism be our emblem.” April 19, 4115 President Misraim Aberon Aaron Abiud, one of the heirs of this manuscri pt, said: “After the destruction of Jerusalem and o ur dispersal, we installed our new temple ‘Jerusalem’ in an unkno wn place where we remained for several years, our h eirs as well, issuing orders without anyone’s knowing of ou r location, not even the affiliate temples themselv es.

We arose, attacking his claim s, raising our voices to make his men and his follo wers understand that he and his followers are impostors and false as Jesus was an impostor and false. Never theless success was not with us. Day by day the number of t he followers of Mohammed increased, as did the foll owers of Jesus. With the sword and terror they attracted the people and even many of our Jewish nation. Then they used tolerance and deceit, succeeding in accelerati ng their growth. We attacked them like the follower s of Jesus and they increased even more, until we succeeded in impeding our people from converting to them. The J ews that were inclined toward them were simple ones, li ke animals. Nevertheless we could not impede the pa gans’ following them in spite of our battles. We ordered the Jews to attack the two religions, th at of Jesus and that of Mohammed, as a consecration to our Jewish religion. I have said religions, while I mus t say associations. For that reason we ordered all the temples to abstain strictly from considering those two asso ciations as religions. There is no religion other t han the Jewish.

That temple achieved great triumphs that fortified the Association to such a d egree that it incited the nine heirs to establish o ther temples in other kingdoms. The heir-descendant of Moab Levy was sent to Rus sia. The heir-descendant of Adoniram (my ancestor) was sent to Gaul. The successor of the Abiuds to German y. This happened in the middle of the eighth centur y. In those Kingdoms they began to establish temple s, some dependent on the Central Temple of Jerusalem and ot hers dependent on the Temple of Rome, which was, in turn, an affiliate of the Central Temple. In the eighth century, after seven centuries of continual battle, when the Temple of Rome was in it s glory, the following temples existed: in Russia, four; in Gaul , four; and in Germany, three. Then the number of t emples in the capitals of the kingdoms mentioned increased; o thers were founded in other capitals and also in th e interior. The temples in each kingdom depended on the princip al temples in its capitol. Those of the capitols de pended on the Central Temple, “Jerusalem.” This situation continued until the 12 th century. In said 12 th century the great progress achieved by the temple of Rome and its great services inspired the commission of the Central Temple with the idea of a bdicating in its favor, according to a decree recor ded on June 5, 5166. 73 By this decree the temple of Rome had the right t o preside over all the temples in the East. The temple of Rome with its new and powerful authorizat ion insisted on occultism and reduced the meetings of the mysterious ones only to those temples hermetically hidden and subterranean. At that time the members o f the underground Temples left with their faces painted b lack to make it appear as though they were working in the coal mines. These were same of the stratagems our a ncestors carried out to hide the truth of their act s. This system was followed until the end of the 18 th century, or until 80 years after the changing of t he name of the Association to the name of Freemasonry. In spite of the fact that new Masonry establishe d its lodges above ground and in spite of the modif ication of its laws, and not withstanding its callings to civi lization, the strict occultism exercised by our anc estors provoked fear and alienation in the people. Even ma ny members trusted it for a certain time, many even took the oath, but soon abandoned the Association.

Jonas said: .Here is the explanation of a series of similar events, of struggles that we abstain fr om translating because of their little interest. The state of thin gs did not vary until the end of the 17 th century when the struggle disappeared and the Association entered its agony.

In the previous chapter we saw that at the end of the 17 th century it was almost dead. Also, I came to the conclusion that the reason for this degeneration an d retreat was the spirit of envy, pride and corrupt ion that dominated us. I decided then to lift the Association from this fall. Its name, “The Mysterious Force,” had come t o provoke apprehension and fear among the people. For that re ason I thought, in the beginning, to change the nam e, but in what manner? With the power of money. I exerted mys elf with that power and I achieved success, togethe r with my major collaborator, our brother, Abraham Abiud. We were both descendants of the nine founders. We communicated in person and by correspondence with our brother heirs of the same manuscript, the idea being approved. From then on, Abraham Abiud and I b egan the task of carrying out that longing, succeed ing in winning the sympathy of a rich man from among the a ctive members of the great mysterious ones, who supported our undertaking and provided us with a la rge sum of money. We went to Germany where we had no success. We w ent to Italy and France, always stumbling over obst acles that demolished our efforts in all those kingdoms. Not obtaining support to carry out our intentions w e returned to Russia to inform the man of fortune who had supp lied the money to us, of what had occurred. That ma n, 75 with admirable zeal and will to regain the glory of the Association, was working with enthusiasm to el evate the prestige of the Jews and to preserve and dignify ou r nationality and our religion. After encouraging u s, he sent us to London, the capital of England. We were three: Abraham Abiud, my son Abraham and I. We judged it fitting to communicate with a man named John Desaguliers and a disciple or companion with the name, George, not knowing his last name. A fter studying his character and religion, we contracted a strong friendship with him, explaining the plan t o him. Desaguliers found in the plan the opportunity to re alize his own religious purposes. He supported Levy and promised him all the help he needed, reaching the p oint of saying: “We must demolish the Catholics, 76 we must not regress until annihilating them.” Levy felt con fidence in his new friend, without, however, coming to know very well the true intention of Desaguliers. Jonas said: I do not believe it is necessary to repeat here what we have seen in the first section concerning the accord realized among the five: Levy, Desaguliers a nd their companions. Their meeting, the deceit of Desaguliers, his taking from Levy the English manus cript, how they agreed on naming the Association: Freemasonry, on August 25, 1716, the united meeting realized on June 24, 1717,. with the associations of architects and builders in London with its new name , the origin of the discussion and aggravation of t he conflict between Levy and Desaguliers for his refusing to re turn the manuscript and the conclusion of the confl ict with the disappearance of Levy and the confiscation of a ll his papers.   74 Jonas: The one who is writing here is my ancestor, Joseph Levy. 75 Abraham Abiud said: That rich man did not permit his na me to be mentioned in this History. 76 Desaguliers belonged to the Protestant sect that held the gr eatest enmity against the Catholic Church; thus his Intenti ons of destroying Catholic Church are understood."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE Details of Joseph Levy’s assassination and what occ urred later Jonas continues narrating: Our two ancestors, the t wo Abrahams 77 said: ‘What was said by Abraham Levy: Of the fundamental conditions between my father and De saguliers there were, that the presidency would be Levy’s and that the first Lodge would be called, “The Lodg e of Jerusalem,” 78 as a remembrance of the principal Temple. Desaguliers accepted these two conditions; nevertheless at the great meeting on June 24, 1717, the majority were on the side of Desaguliers and Anders on; 79 as a result both conspired against Levy, assassina ting him and robbing his papers. We did not have proof against anyone, but we dec ided to wreak vengeance on Desaguliers and his disc iple, George. We killed the latter. We did not succeed in killing Desaguliers because one of us, Abraham Abi ud, become ill. Jonas said: Here there are details read in the f irst section for which there is no need to repeat t hem. Here is the narration of the other successor, Abrah am Abiud, the owner of this manuscript: After the d eath of Abraham Levy, which happened almost immediately aft er the death of his father (as we have seen in the family tree of ancestors, from Joseph Levy to Lawrence) I did not renounce the task of avenging myself on Desaguliers. But I felt alone and weak to carry out the idea; and as I did not want to die without sat isfying my longings for revenge, I sought another path. I soug ht the path of moral vengeance that had perhaps gre ater effects than a bloody revenge. Another of the desce ndants of one of the founders, whose name was Adoni ram David, a descendant of the first Adoniram, was livi ng with us at that time. He lived in France and was the possessor of great wealth; he possessed the Hebrew manuscript from his ancestors. I visited him and re lated to him the details of the events. We decided to denoun ce both to Justice for the assassination of Joseph Levy and the theft of his documents and to protest personall y before Desaguliers. We threatened him, advising h im that Levy was our companion and one of us nine heirs of the nine founders. We pointed out to him that we we re basing ourselves on the fact that the nine manuscri pts, including mine and that of David Adoniram, bel onged to a single history, and that Joseph Levy was a descen dant of Moab Levy. We accused Desaguliers directly of the confiscation of Levy’s manuscript with its translat ion into English. We warned him that we had decided to sacrifice everything in our power to preserve the s ecret of the Association in our hands in accord wit h the recommendations and desires of our ancestors. Desag uliers gave in when faced with Adonirom’s material and moral power, and the threats caused great fear in h is heart; as a result he obeyed Adonirom’s requirem ents.   77 Abraham Levy and Abraham Ablud. 78 Jonas: On June 24, 1717 the name Temple was changed to Lo dge. 79 It is understood that Anderson was an intimate friend o f Desaguliers, who showed him the confiscated manuscript, fr om which they adopted the new laws of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 CHAPTER THIRTY Conditions and requirements Adoniram imposed on Des aguliers Adoniram speaks: 1.

The Association will preserve a memory of Adoniram, consecrating his na me among the sacred words, or a ritual may be formed in his name. Thus his name and that of his a ncestor, Adoniram, the founder, we will immortalize. David Adoniram replied: Then I ask tha t a ritual be specified 81 with the name of Misraim, one of the ancient ancestors, who accomplished grea t achievements in favor of the Association. 7. A function in the Association will be given to Abra ham Abiud, according to his capacity, because he is a descendant of one of the founders. 8. For the first, or superior, lodge, the name “Jerusa lem” will be reserved as Joseph Levy asked, in memo ry of the first principal temple. 82 9. All movement in the Association is suspended. All e lection will be held for a principal commission of five Chiefs of wealthy Jews, according to article o ne. 83 10. The decrees of the Association will not be in force before they are signed by the commission mentioned or the majority of its members. This is so when the decrees are sanctioned here in London, but if the number of lodges increases and the Association spre ads, the signatures of the commission will be necessary only for important matters. Special and l ocal ones may be approved by special commissions, elected for that purpose. 84 11. It being one of our moral obligations to revive the memory of those who benefited the Association by their works, among the founders, ancestors and succ essors, I ask that the name of Tobalcain, nephew of our ancestor founder, Hiram Abiud, be recorded toge ther with the word Booz, as another of the Association’s sacred words, as long as it exists. All these requests were fulfilled and recorded; the leadership of the Association thus remaining in our hands. 85 Abraham Abiud said: The mishap that the efforts of Desaguliers suffered caused great emotion in my heart and in that of Adoniram. We considered it as a grea t revenge for Joseph Levy and a great general conso lation for all our Jewish people.   80 Jonas: The laws Imposed by Desaguliers and Anderson were, in fact, approved by Adoniram. After his death, they suffere d certain a mendments and additions. 81 Samuel, son of Jonas: To this day several rituals created in the Association exist. 82 Samuel, son of Jonas: After the death of David Adoniram th e name of the principal lodge was changed to the “Grand Lodge of England,” by Desaguliers and Anderson as they had insi st ed on June 24, 1717. 83 The manuscript does not mention the names of the members of the commission, except the name of David Adoniram. 84 Samuel, son of Jonas: These commissions grew in all count ries, especially where there is a majority of Protestants belon ging to the sects with the greatest hate for Catholicism, and where there is Jewi sh influence. 85 Jonas: The primary leadership continues being in the hands o f Jews and the secondary in the hands of fanatical anti-Catho lic Protestants."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 Jonas said: We end, thanks be to God, the fulfil ling of our mission of making known the secret of t he History concerning the origin of Masonry, founded by our an cestors, and detailing its events in accord with th e preceding chapters.

God inspired me to adopt the religion of Jesus on m y marrying a Christian woman to whom I attribute gr eat gratitude for the revelation of these secrets and f or my conversion to Christianity. We have both seen that we will not obtain any benefit without comparing the M asonry of our ancient ancestors with the new Masonr y. To achieve this, I found myself obliged to join it. I entered with all enthusiasm and with the decision to follow an active life and one of zeal. In the A ssociation I was not only a mere member, but also an observer an d studious investigator. Nevertheless, on ascending in its rituals, the norms, words, utensils, signs, steps, touches, movements, etc. did not surprise me, becau se in essence they continued being equal to those of the Masonry of Agrippa, and of the new affiliates. When I presented my petition they required no prior requisite of me. The main thing, it seemed, was to pay the price of the inscription without exposing oneself t o an investigation. They blindfolded my eyes and to ok me to a room illuminated by a weak light. Then they took th e blindfold off me. The sponsor said to me: “Wait h ere and think of Eternity. Here you have the human skeleton , the skull, the verses, etc.” 87 I then thought that the new brothers, it seems, have perfected themselves in su bterfuge until surpassing our ancestors. My sponsor then returned and asked me: ,”Are you re ady to face the afflictions of bearing the dangers? ” I answered: “I was born for all this.” He took from m e what I had of money and some metallic items and l eft. Another member presented himself and took my jacket off and rolled the trouser of my left leg up to th e knee. He bared my right arm. He opened my collar and (exp osed my) chest and tied a rope around my neck and withdrew. My sponsor presented himself again, he closed my ey es and led me a certain distance, making me stop. I understood by the conversation of the men of the co mmission around me, that I was in front of the door of the lodge. I heard some phrases referring to my leaving darkness for light, and that now I was oriented on the path of reason. I observed that many scandalous rituals were added after the death of Adoniram. Then they drew me to the door and I felt a sword ov er my neck. 88 Someone said to me: “What do you feel over your neck?” I answered: “It seems to be a sword.” T he President said: “Understand, you who join us, th at this sword threatens you If you are not disposed to pres erve the secrets. If you betray us we will kill you with this sword.” 89 After these and other ridiculous movements that it is not worth mentioning, they took me on three cons ecutive trips during which I heard murmurs of anguish, crie s of fear and blows with the sword. They asked me s everal childish questions. Then they made me drink vinegar . The vinegar is not in the texts of our History. B ut, as the reason for the foundation of the Association was th e appearance of Jesus, the symbols utilized were to ridicule   86 Samuel, son of Jonas: My father did not make clear with which name he entered Masonry, with Jonas or with James, which h e adopted after converting to Christianity. 87 These are new additions.

After the three trips, always blindfolded, they led me, by the rope, to a door where they ordered me t o knock three times and ask to be one of the “Sons of the W idow” and to be with them to sustain her. Then after having asked me some tiresome questions, they “cleaned me,” in their manner, of impurity, w ashing my hand. Again they “purified” me with an inflammab le substance. They passed a scissors over my arm as if to make me bleed and an iron bar as if to burn me. Wit h this they symbolize my distinction with the Mason ic seal. 90 Jonas said: It is known that the three trips symbol ize the three journeys our ancestor founders realiz ed searching for their president, Hiram Abiud. No one knew this truth other than the nine founders and also Desagul iers and Anderson, who confiscated Levy’s manuscript but wer e obliged to hide it. All the Masons after these continue believing that the three trips have as their significance the thre e journeys of Hiram Abiff, and what he had to face in the three d oors of the temple of Solomon. When I finished the three trips the President order ed me to approach the “temple.” 91 They took me closer. The President taught me to make the first sign, in whi ch they realized a change. Instead of putting the h and over the head and then lowering it, open, to the throat, etc ., it is begun now, by placing the hand over the th roat, etc., etc. They moved my feet, forming on angle. 92 They made me walk forward three steps. 93 They made me kneel with my knees in the form of on angle. 94 ’Then they made me take the oath that, after having ascended to the high degrees and having met with g rand Masons, I found out that no one gives it importance . Its text and the rituals varied in the majority o f lodges, and no mention of God is made in it. I have confirmed t hat many of the non-Masons know the majority of the se signs and symbols through the declarations of the g rand Masons who abandoned the Association, denounci ng its scandals and declaring their rancor against the monopolizers of those secrets, whom they mock as “ brothers,” the other Masons. 95 They mock all the Masons without fear or shame, f rom the greatest elder down to the illiterate. The oath ended, the President read some warnings to me. They opened my eyes and untied the rope around my neck. Immediately they ignited inflammable material s that blinded me. Then I saw that all the brothers took out their swords and extended them over my head and pla ced their bayonets against my chest. I thought: Wha t benefit springs from these insignificant things tha t they added to this ‘history?’ I kept silent until the end. They taught me the “touch for greeting.” It was the same one that my ancestors in ancient Masonry used:.

Instead of the. three blows there are six , also the trips, the drawings, the symbols and other things t hat would bore the reader of this history if they w ere to be published. For this reason I will indicate the ritu al s of this degree in synthesis. When I ascended in the profession of the Masons and passed from “apprentice” to “fellow craftsman,” I congratulated myself, but my brothers congratulated me more, especially the treasurer, who increased t he payment and (surely he congratulated the treasury i n his heart) for the joy, the congratulation and al l the pleasures converge on money, on gold! They showed me, as a resume of the spectacles, a st ar they call the “Luminous Star.” I remembered then the “Eastern Star” in the Masonry of our ancestors th at symbolized the star of the Magi. That is why in the new Masonry the name of the “Grand Orient” was given to each Masonic club in each country, and also the Presidents council in the lodge is noted “Directora te of the East.” All this was preserved in new Mas onry in homage to the founders, by David Adoniram, Desaguli ers and Anderson, in accord with was written in ear lier chapters. While I was talking with the Brother Guide, I tried to test him with the following question: “Can you tell me about the founders and the authors of these instruc tions, signs, symbol s, instruments, etc.?” He responded: “How come you are asking me who found ed Masonry? It is unknown to this day.” I smiled. H e said to me: “What makes you smile?” I answered him: “How can one be in a society withou t knowing its president and founder?” Then he said to me: “Come with me to ask the President of the Lodge.” I went with him and we asked the President. He respo nded: “This is a question a fellow craftsman like you mus t not ask.” To this I replied, with pretense: “This fellow craftsman must know one day what is unknown and wil l make it known to the others, is that not so?” To which he said to me: “Try, then, to ascend.”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 Dissipation of the Darkness Origin of Freemasonry Chapters 33 to the end of the book CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE Jonas’ ascent to the Third Degree: the Degree of Ma ster Hiram Jonas said: This is the major degree, from the hist oric, symbolic, imaginary and tragicomic point of v iew all at the same time. We have understood that its true history, together with the secret of the foundation of the Associatio n, is monopolized among the nine founders and their succe ssors or heirs. All Masons, ancient and modern, pre sent in this Degree an ironic drama and all believe they re produce the death and the wake of Hiram Abiff, the Architect of the Temple of Solomon. But the truth is that the y reproduce, without the least knowledge, the death and wake of Hiram Abiud, the founder of this Association. Th ey introduced in the rite the most ironic and depre ciating acts toward the death of Jesus and his resurrection . Notwithstanding the knowledge of what I was going t o suffer with the nature of the examination and the scam to which they were going to submit me in ascending to this Degree, I decided to petition for it, with the purpose of completing this “History,” because the new Mason ry (that of the year 1717) is nothing but a complem entary part of the ancient Masonry, that of our ancestors; it is like its daughter, as we had anticipated. My petition was accepted. To detail the movements, events and sayings of the ritual would require more than ten pages, for which I prefer to omit them, for it would bore whoever might write , read or witness it. It is verified, then, that the movements, touches a nd terms composed by our ancestors, Herod Agrippa, Hiram Abiud and their seven companions, still exist in th e Association. But many scandalous rites were added , for example: the act of stopping me, tying me with a ro pe, leading me walking backwards, threatening me wi th the points of swords against my chest , disrobing me before the brothers while they looked at me, mocking me, as was done to them in their turn, asking me innumerab le and subtly deceptive questions, etc., etc. The strange thing was that later all of us were lau ghing at these fallacies, saying to each other: “Th eir authors must be very clever, what a pity we cannot know the m!” I was silent. and laughed to myself interiorly. To make a comparison between ancient and modern Mas onry, I carried out several investigations about th ese rituals in several lodges, finding out that the rit es, although apparently different, were the same in their fundamental: all masking cunning, fallacy, irony an d mockery."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR Jonas’ ascent to the following Degrees, to to the 1 8 th We did not see in our Hebrew history any name for t he degrees from 1 to 33. Only 15 of them had titles , the other 18 were untitled. We saw that our ancestor, Misraim, one of the ancie nt presidents, and his eight companions, establishe d those titles for the purpose of mocking Jesus. The chiefs of modern Masonry, that of the year 1717 , who were three Jews and three Protestants, establ ished other titles, additions, variations, attractions an d curiosities that made my wife, Janet, and me thin k that the Protestants that guided the new Masonry were more c unning and aggressive against Catholicism than the ancient Jews themselves. I verify this with the fac t that in Protestant countries the leadership of th e lodges is more in the hands of Protestants, than in those of Jews. I ascended to the degrees mentioned rapidly, paying . the corresponding price without complaining, for the purpose of completing this History. I am sure that no one will reproach me for the omission of the det ails of those fallacious rituals that do no more than waste my time. This is not my purpose. We are satiated w ith the fallacies of our ancestor founders and their succes sors. Their fanaticism and lies, their cunning and deceit; the confusion of the members of their Association, the mysterious sons of the widow and the other sons of the original sect are sufficient for us. Why do they not reveal their true purpose, which is to attack Jesus? Would it not have been more noble for them to fight openly, armed with their principles, against the Christian religion? Without doubt, they themselves knew their principle s were not noble."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE My ascent to the 18 th Degree, or that of the Rose Cross 96 I decided to complete my march until achieving my w ife’s and my purpose. I preferred to be up to date on the secrets of this degree because it is called the “Rose Cross,” whil e its name in our History is “The Talented One,” the, “Cross” bei ng the name of the 31 st degree. I paid the price of the ascent and solicited the de gree, my petition being accepted. How great my joy was! I prepared myself to ascend that ladder of “glory,” o f “honor,” of heaven!” I received the secrets of the degree, the signs, th e symbols, the norms and the type of vestments corr esponding to it. Being now one of the bearers of the cross, I lifted it on my shoulder and marched with them. 97 I began to count the extras that the new chiefs added to the o riginal. My forces were exhausted before counting all of them. There are innumerable fallacies there. There are laughable acrobatics. In this degree I did not find what our ancestors did except the four letters,” I N R I ,” that signify, “Jesus, Nazarene, King of the Jews ,” that they adopted from the cross of Jesus when his crucifiers wanted to mock Him. This phrase was one of those i mposed by Levy and Adoniram in their agreement with Desaguliers. All that I saw in this degree was a new fallacy add ed to an ancient fallacy. The lodge to which I belong had almost all its memb ers from the Protestant partisans of Desaguliers an d Anderson, that is to say, from the Protestant sect with the most animosity toward Catholicism. I notic ed this truth in the meetings where several suggestions and decrees were presented to attack the Pope and his collaborators. Nevertheless, those suggestions divi ded us into two bands, some in favor and others aga inst. I felt that there was a wave of enmity against religions. The majority of the members disseminated the anti-r eligious spirit and mocked religion and religious. Meanwhile , some members, I among them, formed a group, altho ugh small, of resistance. Considering that my conversion to Christianity was effected by the intercession of my wife, and knowin g that she is of a moderate religious nature, not fanatica l, I asked her opinion about these secrets. Her opi nion and counsel s are recorded in the next chapter.   96 Samuel, son of Jonas: It is understood that the ones w ho continues narrating here is my father, Jonas. 97 Jonas: I felt an interior voice say to me: Take up your cro ss and follow them!"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX The counsels offered by Janet to her husband James (Jonas) so he would no longer associate himself with the enemies of the Ch urch of Rome Before beginning with her words, my wife required m e to relate to her all the efforts and conspiracies that the Masons devised against Catholicism. I told her how, through my permanent contact with t he grand Masons, I discovered that there are three groups of them in the lodges: Some of them attack Catholicism . Others attack all religions. The third, composed of men from the first two groups, battle in politics for t he purpose of coming to dominate temporal authority . Here is what my wife said to me: “James, your affil iation with the new Masonry was not to support the enemies of religions, nor to support any religion, but, as we have resolved from the beginning, to study it an d compare it with the Masonry of your ancestors for the purpose of completing this History. “We have both understood in the texts of this Hist ory the upset produced when your ancestor Levy chan ged the name of the Association, together with Desaguliers. In accord with what you relate to me, there exists among us Protestants a sect united to the Jews (your relativ es) whose goal is to demolish what our Jesus, may H e be glorified, and to crush Catholicism and the Roman C hurch. Such are the principles of Desaguliers and Anderson. “My parents and I, dear James, are not of that sect. Yes, we are Protestants, but we are fo r from the intention of crushing the Roman Church. Listen to w hat I tell you: We believe tat Jesus Christ is the one who built it and He said that it will not fall. You mus t have our faith in spite of our traditional revolt that we inherited from our parents against the authority of the Pontiff. In our hearts we conceal a firm faith that the Chur ch of St. Peter is the original Church of Jesus. Ne ver have we thought, neither my parents nor I, of associating w ith the enemies of the Church. You, who are now con verted to Christianity through my intercession, must adapt the principles I nave inherited from my parents. Be careful in collaborating with those two sects : the one that attacks Catholicism in particular an d the other that attacks all religions in general. Be careful t hat you do not fall into their traps. Since you obe yed me and converted to my religion, you loved me and married me, I desire that you always continue firm with me in your Christianity, firm in your promises, and in your ne w principles. Continue then in the path of completing the studies for which you entered the new Masonry, to succeed in satisfying our longings to reveal truth and to deno unce evil, in order to dissipate the darkness when later the doors of light will be opened before the blindfolde d eyes so they may orient themselves in the path of truth. And there on the peak of the solid mountain of reality the light will be irradiated that will guid e each confused person and each confuser.”"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN My ascent to the other degrees, from the 19 th to the 33 rd Jonas said: I have known throughout my studies that the ascent to the high degrees require s, above all, the payment of the price of the inscription, a price that varies according to t he degree, but it also requires activity, zeal and services on behalf of the principles of the Association and the realization of its purposes. I discharged the duties within my reach to make a false show of my activities and I saved, at the same time, wha t was necessary to pay the respective inscriptions. I solicited the ascent, paying the dues for the 11 degrees, from the 19 th to the 29 th inclusive. My petition was accepted with pleasure. Being one of the holders of the 29 th degree, I knew the secrets, vestments, terms, movements and signs corresponding to all those degr ees. All the rituals are of no interest, for they a re similar to those of the earlier degrees in their falsity and r idiculousness. I saved the amount necessary to attain the 30 th degree. I solicited it and attained it. I did not delay much in attaining Degrees 31, 32 an d 33 in the same way. Here my age become infinite; I remembered then what was recorded by the ancestors of my mother, Esther, who tried by that definition ‘to mock the Resurrection of Jesus, His Ascension and H is eternal life. Thus I completed my ascent to the maximum degree of “elevation,” reaching the “gates of Heaven.” Thus I come to be considered among the ranks of the chiefs of “liberty!” Despite the superiority of my high degre e, I did not know from whence come the superior orders. The president himself of our lodge did not know the ir origin. I saw that all the presidents of the lodges were subject to those orders that came mysteriousl y. For example: “Carry out the exalted order as we hav e carried out ours, executing the following.... “ Another example: “By a superior order we must make every effort to do such-and-such a thing; comply wi th it and begin... “ Another example: “By orders, the knowledge of whose origin is prohibited by Law, you must initiate a subscription to collect (such-and-such a sum of) mo ney that will be destined to expand the capacity of the Association and its interests.... “ All the orders were of this nature. Then 1 remembered the cunning of our ancestor found ers and their successors and noted that the nine successors improved considerably in the art of fall acy and cunning. I deplored the word “free,” which should be omitted from the dictionaries of languages with that meani ng, to use rather the meaning, “those who claim to be free and are nothing but slaves ordered by their masters to do good or evil.” Nevertheless, the slave knows his ma ster, but we, on the other hand, do not know who or ders us, and we obey blindly. How much I congratulate my wife, Janet, for her poe m in which she laments the liberty of the Masons wh o obey blindly and reproaches the nine founders and t heir successors for the monopoly of the secrets and the hidden principal leadership."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT The delivery of the secrets on the part of James, o r Jones, to his son, Samuel George, the grandson of James, said: We saw, in wha t was recorded previously, that the secrets of the History are passed from the founders to their present succe ssors, the most intelligent and serious of their so ns. This was their traditional law of succession. A law of conte mptible and blind religious fanaticism. But when we see the importance of these secrets and that terrible oath that the nine founders establis hed, taking it themselves and imposing it on their successors i n the act of receiving the secrets, when we see tha t strange and terrible requirement of hiding those secrets, t hat blind belief that whoever opposes the fundament al laws or violates a single word of the oath will die horribl y and will be “punished by God,” when we see all th is, the obstinacy of our ancestors with their fundamental l aws filled with barbarism, fanaticism and foolishne ss does not surprise us. We see now my grandfather, James, delivering the se crets to my father, Samuel, his only son, by his fi rst wife, as we will see. The will of my grandfather was to c omplete this history, completing the relationship b etween the Masonry of our ancestors and its daughter: the new Masonry. For that purpose he joined the Association to study its history and secrets in the light of this manuscript. His extensive studies were divided by h im into 22 investigations. First Investigation James, addressing his son, Samuel, and the readers of this History, said: Before my conversion to Chri stianity I was following the plan of the ancestors of my mothe r, Esther, from whom I inherited this History, pres erving its secrets and believing in the truth of its doctrine. Thus I continued until destiny wanted me to fall d eeply in love with Janet, the Christian. She, too, professed a gr eat love for me and agreed to be my .wife on condit ion that I would convert to Christianity; I converted and we m arried, then Samuel, my son by my first wife, conve rted too. Before completing one month of our marriage, my new wife had already known of this History, reviewing it. She reacted in such a way that she began to form in me a spirit of indignation toward the “History” an d its heirs and to encourage me to publish it for the good and the salvation of the Christian religion, first, and all of humanity, later. She insisted so that she convinced me. Before beginning its printing we had to understand some fundamental secrets of modern Masonry, without which the benefits of this History would not be com plete. We wanted to know, especially, if the secret remained with Desaguliers, Anderson and his companions or if they got in touch with others of the successors, o wners of these Hebrew manuscripts. In search of that, I ente red the new Masonry and ascended in it to the highe st degree. Because of my coming journey to Russia on a mission , I fulfill my duty on delivering to you, my son, t his History and its secrets, for fear something might h appen. Your mother, Janet, will be your collaborato r and administrator in all that is related with this Hist ory. Second Investigation James, to his son, Samuel, said: Son, you have here a History more precious than diamonds. When you re ad it you will understand its extraordinary importance.

After your conversion to Christianity with me, you will not ob ey that injunction. 98 Know, Samuel, how great is my love and respect for your mother Janet. Know, too, that I loved her more because she adopted you as affectionately as if she were your own mother. You must then, love her, obe y her and serve her in homage and memory of your true mot her, whose soul at present is comforted on seeing t hat you find affection in this mother. We must, moreove r, love her, in acknowledgment of her kindness in converting us to Christianity and for having encour aged me to publish this “History.” I have seen indescribable virtues in her. I have se en in her love, purity, integrity, intelligence, tr ue faith and authentic piety. I have seen self-denial that your dead mother did not possess. I have seen in her eco nomy and generosity together. I have seen in her a deeply-ro oted sentiment of love for duty. But the major fact or in my infinite love for her is her affection with you. Sh e gave you, Samuel, a virtuous education. Without h er you would not be able to have these virtues. She is you r mother, your educator and your Christianizer. On e of your most sacred duties is to love her and to discharge your duty toward her. I know her to be, in my prese nce or absence, faithful and a collaborator. Above all, I desire that you do nothing without consulting her. She, in turn, will give you counsels related to this History and to your other actions. This meeting of ours must be added, with all that w e have spoken, to our History; let us record it. Now, Samuel, review this History and delve into it becau se, before my journey, I want to tell you a secret of great importance. Third Investigation Samuel’s surprise when faced with the Secrets and t he cunning on reading the History After a week the three, James, Janet and Samuel, me t. James said to Samuel: I believe, son, that you read this History completely, with great avidity. You h ave spent many hours in its study, but it does not matter. So it happened to me when I received it from your gra ndfather, Samuel (whose name you bear), because it contains e verything that can surprise, affect and elevate the heart of the reader, filling it with joy and pleasure for kn owing its secrets. Perhaps the illiterate, those of poor mentality and the incredulous may not have these feelings. Ho wever, I do not believe there are people who are no t interested in these secrets. Samuel said: Father, when I read this History I for got everything and became inebriated on seeing its secrets, its wickedness and its cunning. Secrets that, if they c ome to be published, will cast the Masonic states i nto catastrophe; secrets that will make the entire worl d tremble: the Masons and the leaders of all religi ons, especially the Christian, when they know the conspi racy against them. James said: Record, Samuel, in synthesis, what we h ave said. I, for my part, will write the following that I, too, will record. The elements of this study will thus r emain organized.   98 Translator’s note: The difference between the character of Jam es (the Christian) and that of his ancestors (the Jews) i s impressive."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 Fourth Investigation Synthesis of the Comments about the superior and an ti-religious Orders that James revealed to his son, Samuel The Intended Erroneous Interpretation of the three words: Liberty, Fraternity and Equality You see, son, that I entered the new Masonry to com pare it with the Masonry of our ancestors, “ The Mysterious Force.” Because the modern is a compleme ntary part of the ancient, because of the complete ignorance of the secrets and occult foundations of this Association on the part of the Masons, and bec ause of the joy it will produce in wise men and historians on t heir knowing the cornerstone of that foundation, yo ur mother Janet and I decided I would enter the Association. She told me: “I will call this History: The Dissipa tion of the Darkness. But the darkness will not be dissipated if you do not enter the Association in order to be up to date with the innovations that happened in it af ter Levy changed its name.” That was when I joined the Assoc iation and studied its secrets, thus achieving my o bjective. Behold my studies: All that I had expected to see i n it I saw with ample time for thought. I saw that its general public statutes were taken from the same ancient st atutes. But Anderson and Desaguliers gave it a scie ntific aspect and a general style suited to all readers, M asons and non-Masons. There is no doubt that David Adoniram collaborated with them, as you observed in his “conditions.” I d id not get to see the internal statutes, nor can anyone el se, because the statutes are monopolized by the pri ncipal chiefs, heirs of the nine founders. 99 I saw that superior orders were distributed from ch iefs unknown to their executors. Those chiefs, in t urn, obey a supreme and completely unknown authority whose orde rs must be carried out blindly by them. I saw that in ancient Masonry only the Jewish relig ion was preserved. In the modem I saw an anti-relig iosity of extensive contours, but concentrated against Christ ianity and particularly, against Catholicism, an an ti- religiosity inspired in absolute nihilism. I saw the chiefs of ancient Masonry were cunning Je ws who attacked Jesus’ men. The chiefs of modem Masonry, the successors of Desaguliers and Adoniram are, on the other hand, an amalgam of mercenaries: Jews who attack the Christian religion and Protestants w ho attack Catholicism. The new chiefs are no less cunning than the anci ent ancestors. They have in their hands the reins o f all the Masons. They play with them at will. And finally, I saw disasters and catastrophes advan cing on humanity. So you will see it, too, Samuel. In this History you see that the Masonry of our anc estors was built on lies, fallacies, fanaticism and corruption. From this lying were born the ancient symbols and t he instruments of architecture and construction wit h which they armed themselves. With this lying Herod “found ” ancient papers in his grandfather’s chest, etc. a s we saw earlier. They created all those lies to conceal the secret o f the date of its foundation, achieving success in their deceits for many centuries.   99 Jonas: I, as one of the heirs, was working with the same s tatutes."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 You see, too, that in the modem, the same deceit ex ists, used by the heir chiefs among the mass of the Masons. These, ,just like the ancient mysterious ones, beli eve that no one knows the origin, time, place or go al of this Association. 100 The mother Masonry threw all her intention in a sin gle goal, which was the battle against Jesus’ men. The daughter Masonry, surpasses that limit by great dis tances. It acts for the demolition of thrones and t he abolition of authorities, spiritual and temporal, so it may h ave absolute domination of the world. It adopted th e same emblems as Jesus: liberty, fraternity, equality; bu t this adoption proves to be very contradictory to the true. The liberty of Jesus was moderated, benevolent and fruitful. The liberty of the Masons is extremist, w ithout limits, liberty of blasphemies and deceits, destruc tive of characters, religions, wealth, lives and fa milies. The fraternity of Jesus was pure and human; it p reaches brotherhood among people. It imposes mutual love on them and alienates them from hate and from evil . M asons, my son, practice a brotherhood full of egois ms and privileges. Personal love prevails among them, the love of revenge, divisions and endless conflicts. I see that betrayal, aggression, robbery, pride, profanation a nd nihilism reign among them. The equality of Jesus’ is just and legal before the law and religion. In Masonry, “equality” signifies the disappearance of all order, With this supposed equa lity the reins of liberty are beyond all order, wit h everything falling into confusion and with the loss of true va lues. Fifth” Investigation ”MUTUAL AID” Behold, Samuel, my studies of the “aid” in the daug hter Masonry. 101 This word was nothing but a net cleverly tended by the successors, founders of the new Masonry and the secondary chiefs in order to snare young solicitant s. Our “History” does not mention this term, “Mutua l Aid,” among the mysterious ones except in what is related to attacking the Christian religion. The cunning o f Desaguliers and Anderson inspired them with the cre ation of this net for the purpose of attracting peo ple to the Association, knowing that every brother, with regar d to aid, is needy and needs it. For that reason th ey put in their general statutes the term “Aid.” If, at the beginning, some brothers were benefited by some aid, later, with the increase in the number of affiliates in the lodges spread throughout all coun tries and territories, that aid was dissipated unti l disappearing. We have heard many complaints from brothers about t he neglect of the chiefs, especially when aid was g iven only to the wealthy brothers. The aid was sold and bought. The discontented ones increased in number demanding the application of Anderson’s law of “Mut ual Aid.” Finally they made this stipulation: . Eit her Anderson’s law of Mutual Aid be applied or it be re vised in this way: Whoever pays more, receives more aid. I knew many who lost their jobs in commerce, govern ment, industry and other occupations, it being impo ssible for the chiefs to offer them aid, and they remained without work. I also know many br others who intentionally burned down their own businesses, expecting Masonic aid that they never r eceived.   100 Awad Khoury: Review the translation of the booklet, “Two Ce nturies of Masonry,” in this same work, page 36 where it mentions Dr. Oliver, who said: “Our Association existed before the cr eation of the terrestial globe and was spread through the pl anets of the solar system.” 101 Samuel: It Is understood that the mother Masonry is the ancient, “The Mysterious Force,” from the year 43 after Christ until 1717. The daughter Masonry is the new, from June 24. 1717 on."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 Sixth Investigation The secrets and the Principal Leadership Son, I believe that Desaguliers, the Protestant, be queathed the secrets to his successors, the Protest ants; and that David Adoniram bequeathed them to his successors, t he Jews; the inheritance proceeding, without doubt, from Desaguliers, who had robbed the manuscript from Jos eph Levy, the grandfather of my mother, Esther, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, Adoniram’s own ma nuscript that undoubtedly would be in the possessio n of his successors until today. As we, too, possess thi s manuscript of Abiud. But the chief successors of those two groups (those of Desaguliers and those of Adoniram) continue inh eriting the same principal secrets and bequeathing them, in turn, monopolizing and mocking their brother Mason s. Seventh Investigation Mother Masonry, her Daughters and Granddaughters The Masonry of our ancestors, “The Mysterious Force ,” was called the “widowed mother” in honor of Hiram who was orphaned of his father. Hiram, therefore, w as called the “widow’s son.” The mother grew monstrously. If it were not for her the Jewish religion would have disappeared. But it did not succeed in its longing to annihilate the Christian religion. It did, however, increase enormously. Lat er, oh surprise! it ended in dissensions and disturbances. Disturbances that dragged it to death; it was read y for burial at the beginning of the 17 th century. After a time it began to revive slowly. In silence and without pain a daughter was born: Laicism. This creature felt itself weak and retarded in its growth. It ask ed its mother to give it a sister to aid it. Then N ew Masonry was born, thanks to the work of Joseph Levy and John De saguliers. The two sisters grew, united by a great love. From them two groups were formed: one Jewish, the o ther Protestant. The first group, the Jewish, prese rved the principle of the mother Masonry, which is to attack all Christianity. The second, the Protestant, spec ialized in attacking Catholicism. Then they arose united and began the war against th rones, destroying a great number of them and castin g royal authority to the ground. Over those ruins they esta blished fictitious “republics, “ whose evil was muc h worse than that of the thrones. The dilemma was greater b ecause instead of being merely democratic republics , beneficial to the people and the country, they were intentionally based on confusion and injustice, di screditing the two authorities: Spiritual and Temporal, and li quidating values, respects and rights. Know, then, that the offspring of those wicked prin ciples have not yet been stopped. In the course of centuries other daughters and granddaughters will be born of them. Eighth Investigation Socialism Know, my son, that the new Masonry, responding to t he demands of the enemy of humanity and fulfilling orders to increase the daughters of corruption, gav e birth to Socialism. This granddaughter came to be evil worse than earliest evils. I predict to you, Samuel, that all these creatur es will grow and give birth, by Satanic spouses, to other creatures of wickedness, corruption and destruction . They will be multiplied and they will scatter their seeds over all the earth, corrupting it and how p oisonous will be their fruits! Each one of those creatures will f orm a party and each party will look out for the in terests of its"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 mother, aggravating the evils of confusion, civiliz ation disappearing, eliminating religion and educat ion degenerating. Then the trumpets of grief and disast er will blow. This prophecy of mine will be fulfilled and will ha ve a great echo. 102 Our descendants will see infernal generations. Men will remember me, after my death. They will testify to this opinion of mine that all the corrupt descendants will be daughters and granddaughters of mother Masonry. How fitting this is, with respect to this: Evils beget nothing but evils. Ninth Investigation Masonic Education Thus, son, you understand that modem Masonry preach es exaggerated liberty to attract the people. Man i s, by nature, inclined to absolutism. The father Masons inherited this style of life from their fathers, expanding it, generation after gene ration, until reaching, little by little, “Nihilism.” The father Masons create in their sons the love of easy object ives. They educate them in the love of the worldly and they in culcate in them disbelief in punishment for wickedn ess and in reward for good works. Thus the sons are reared in extremist liberty, corrupt character and avid de sires. It is necessary to mention those few Masons who, kn owing that terrible evil, impede their sons from jo ining Masonry, giving them a correct education. Tenth Investigation Masonic Teaching All that I have recorded in my investigations about the foundation of new Masonry and what we see in t he new human community is confirmed in the Masonic laical (anti-religious) institutions. These institutions, Samuel, on increasing in number , will be a disaster for religions, because whoever is bred and educated in the principles of “No Religion,” wi ll grow, marry and have children without their know ing a religion that leads them to God and to follow the p ath of reason. The parents, sunk in worldly joys, cannot do anythi ng but bring their children up according to this sy stem. The laical institutions, my son, will be a rude blow fo r religions. You will see the certainty of my proph ecy. What horrendous sin those first ancestors bear! Eleventh Investigation The Responsibility of the Corrupt Clergy This, son, is an investigation on which I should no t comment because we are still new in a religion th at is an enemy of Masonry. But, inspired by my firm purpose of per fecting this History, I take this investigation upo n myself, not without first gathering firm and profou nd proofs. Among those whom God created to be the mirror of vi rtues, an example of purity, a fountain of correcti on, veracity and justice, the pride and center of socia l gatherings, the prototype of kindness, the pillar of piety and reason; among them, I tell you, there is a small nu mber who, corrupt, avoid their duties and spatter t hemselves   102 George Lawrence: The prophecies of my grandfather, Jonas, ha ve been fulfilled, for the most part. Those evil creatures produced worse creatures. Nihilism, Bolshevisms, Communism and So cialism. And we will see many such examples. May God free us from what will occur!"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 with the mud of diverse sins. ! do not specify any religion; in accord with my experiences and investi gation to complete this History, I noticed corruption in the religious of all religions. This corrupt element was an important pretext in th e Masons at the beginning and the recent Masons. It was a useful weapon for them, used to attack all religion s, without considering their virtues. They have con demned the good as well as the evil and the pure as well as the corrupt. They have inculcated in the people the spirit of rancor, rebellion and scorn with cries of: “Corrupt ion embraces the clergy!” “The clergy conceals deli nquency, lies, crime, rancor, pride, envy, disturbances, dru nkenness, degeneration, etc., etc...!” Son, you will certainly find among the clergy some men with these characteristics, but you must not ju dge all by the sins of some. Nevertheless, we are not justi fying the works of those corrupt ones; they must be warned and reproached, they must be expelled, they must be eliminated like the weed from the good seed. Twelfth Investigation Masonry and the Woman Jonas said: When my wife, Janet, read the narrative of my investigations and reached here, she asked m e to let her write this part because of its relationship to the woman. Janet said: it is understood that the mother Masonr y is the mortal enemy of Jesus and that it was esta blished to attack him. It ridiculed all his works and ironical ly imitated all his kind teachings. The heirs embra ced these principles. They wanted to imitate Jesus in his affection for t he woman, do not believe that their affection is pu re as was that of Jesus. Jesus loved the woman with his divin e affection, obliging the man to treat her with jus tice and obliging her to obey him, the women’s leader. Jesus wanted to give the woman that divine affection bec ause she is the soul of the education of her children, its f oundation and its strength. He traced for her the p ath of correction to teach her children the virtues and go od behavior. If all the people followed this pure s tyle and gave the woman what Jesus specified for her, the result would surely have been virtuous children. Masons gave the woman a different affection, a disf igured affection, an ignoble affection. The imitati on of Jesus on the part of the Masons is, in this sense, false and evilly intended. It is different from the pure will of Jesus. They do not define affection as Jesus did. T hey liberated her from all rules and conditions, ha ving as a result the degeneration and misery of the woman. Ou r descendants will witness horrible spectacles born of the misery of the woman. The woman, with this exaggerated affection, was falsely exalted, fraudulently cultivating her pride without advising her of the irreparable loss that would be produced in her. With extremist liberty, the woman lost her temporal and eternal happiness, she lost her educat ion, she lost her life and even more, she made the world lose family, social, educational and procreative order. If she took comfort in this easy and voluptuous lif e, the result of this joy was misery and mourning, mourning and m isery for all the world. Samuel said: After finishing the recording of the p revious investigations, I wanted to explain an idea to my father. It was midnight in the month of March of 1822; I put down my pen and said to my father: I have reco rded all your investigations up to the twelfth. Now, in spit e of my youthful age 103 I dare to suggest that the rest of the investigations are not so indispensable for this Hi story.

Looking then at his wife, he said to her: I fulfilled your sacred will, dear Janet. I fulfilled my mission and my duty; I dissip ated the darkness, as you asked me to. I justify my attitude before science, history, religion and I am content . Now the history of my ancestors is in your hands and those of my son, Samuel. Soon I will be traveling and you will have the right, if I do not return, of giving to th is manuscript the destiny that God will inspire in you. Janet said: After those events my husband traveled and died in a foreign land in the year 1825.

I, pg. 496: “W ith respect to the origin of Masonry, nothing, absolutely nothing concrete and indisputable can be affirmed prior to the transformation and evolution of the year 1717, whic h is the true rational and demonstrable origin of t he Order.” Salvat Encyclopedic Dictionary (9 th edition), vol. 6, pg. 127: “Freemasonry. Secret As sociation in which are used several symbols taken from masonry; such as sq uares, levels, etc. History. FREEMASONRY claims to be an association of men who are dedicated to the pers onal improvement of their members and universal brotherhood, based on a claimed religious tolerance and with principles of humanitarianism. It is a se cret society, whose goals are known entirely only to tho se who have reached the highest degrees of initiati on and that conceals its activities under symbolism appare ntly derived in great part from the occupation of m ason and from the art of architecture. !In regard to its ori gin, it is the almost general opinion today that it was born of the ancient guilds of English masons, four of whom, und er the initiative of one of their leaders, Anthony Sayer, founded the first Grand Lodge in 1717, having edite d, then in the early years of its existence, the st atutes of the Order, of which, for the first time, the “ancient d uties,” that are still in force today, formed a par t. This FREEMASONRY, called Anglo-American, so it seems, do es not have the anti-religious spirit that characte rizes the Roman or Latin. The latter, subject to the infl uence of the Grand Orient of France, does not requi re of its members the belief in the Great Architect and in th e” immortality of the soul and has been marked alwa ys by its anticlerical position. The first French Lodge was founded in Dunkirk in 17 21, under the influence of English FREEMASONRY, from which were derived also the first lodge of Spa in (1728) and that of Portugal (1735). In 1925 Fasc ism dissolved it and in 1934 Naziism continued its exam ple. In Spain, by a law of March 1, 1940, it has be en condemned and it is considered a form of crime to b elong to it. In France, the government of Petain al so prohibited its officials forming part of it. The Church prohibits belonging to FREEMASONRY under pain of excommunication under Canon 2335 of the Corp.Jur.Can. Earlier Clement XII (1738). Benedict XIV (1751), Pius VII (1821), Leo XII (1825), Pius I X (1846) and Leo XIII (1884) had already hurled their anathemas against it. In 1934, 4½ million Masons existed in the world, of which 200,000 pertained to the Eur opean continent, 479,000 to Great Britain and 3,260 ,000 to the United States. Universal Illustrated Encyclopedia. Espasa. Barcelona. “Masonry...Origin and Developmen t of Masonry (pg. 733) Vol. 33.... There are three principal Theories : 1. That which attributes the origins of Masonry to the Knights Templar. 2. That which supposed it was born of the battle launc hed by the popular classes to free themselves from the pressure of feudalism, taking for its base the organizations of the societies and guilds. 3. That which attributes its foundation to the Jews. T irado- Rojas claims to harmonize these three opinio ns, saying: ‘that symbolic Masonry, up to Degree 13, co rresponds to the Ancient Age; to Degree 30, to the philosophic; and sublime Masonry, to the Modem Age. ’ ...Without going into details about these diverse o pinions, we observe only that the one that still en joys the most credit is that which makes Masonry a continuation a nd transformation of the ancient corporations of ar chitects and builders of buildings, in which the artesans we re making room for more learned members, with whom they began speculative discussions, until coming to tran sform itself into modern Masonry “   105 References gathered by the translator to Spanish."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 James Oliver in his book, “Antiquity of Masonry:” “Masonry was practiced in other planetary systems b efore the formation of the Earth.” Alberto J. Triana in h is book, “Masonry .. History of the Brothers Three Points ,” pt. II: “With respect to ancient Masonry great obscurit y reigns; which gave place to the invention of nume rous hypotheses, many of them improbable, absurd and rid iculous; such as those like for example, the making of its dating back to our first father, Adam. the Order be ing initiated by the Eternal Father in the Earthly Paradise; to Lamech, the killer of Cain, who killed his brother, to Zoroaster, supreme head of the Magi and founder of Mazdaism (religion of the Persians, contained in th e sacred books of the Zend-Avesta); to Confucius, f ounder of the religion of the Chinese; to Pythagoras, Greek p hilosopher and mathematician, founder of the sect o f Pythagoreans... Numerous concurrences exist betwee n Judaism and Masonry. On the other hand, the obscu rity of its origin is a tactic that the Masons employ in order to make difficult the investigation of its u ltimate goals. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that historicall y such origin has not been able to be demonstrated, it is a fact that Jews as well as Protestants easily accommodate themselves to the purposes of Masonry; because mod ern Judaism suffers the same crisis in its religious be liefs as Protestantism; “and because everything tha t is directed directly against Christianity, protects, in a simil ar manner, Judaism.” Mariano Tirado-Rojas, converted Mason, states—accor ding to Triana—that the Order was founded after the “Diaspora” or dispersion of the Jews, on Jerusalem’ s being destroyed by the Romans in the year 70; tha t it always subsisted hidden; that it made use of the as sociations of medieval artesan builders for its pur poses; and that it succeeded in conquering members among the k night crusaders in the Holy Land. Joseph Lehman, Catholic Priest. wrote the following : “The origin of freemasonry must be attributed to Judaism, certainly not to Judaism as a whole, but at least, to a perverted Judaism.” Nicolas Serra-Caussa states: “The inventor, foun der or introducer of the Masonic system, if he was not a Jew by circumcision, was as much a Jew at heart as the best of the circumcised, for Masonry breathes Judai sm through its four sides.” The rabbi, Isaac Wise, wrote in 1855: “Masonry is a Jewish institution, whose history, degrees, assign ments, signs and explanations are of a Jewish nature from beginning to end,” The Jewish historian, Bernard Lazare, wrote: “It is evident there were only Jews, and cabalistic Jews, in Masonry’s origin.” And finally Hertzel, the founder of Zionism, in 1897 in Switzerland, said: “Masonic lodges established all over the world offered to help us a chieve our indendence. Those pigs, the non-Jewish M asons, will never understand the final object of Masonry.”"}]
