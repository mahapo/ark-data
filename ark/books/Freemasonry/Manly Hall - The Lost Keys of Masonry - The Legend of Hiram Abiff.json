Most of its legends and allegories are of I a sacred nature. Much of Masonry is woven into the structure of Christianity, We have learned to consider our own religion as the only inspired one, and this probably accounts for a great many of the misun- derstandings existing in the world today con- cerning the place occupied by Masonry in the spiritual ethics of our race. A religion is a di- vinely inspired code of morals. A religious per- son is one inspired to nobler living by this code. He is identified by the cede which is his source of illumination, Thus we may say that a Christian is one who receives his spiritual ideals of right and wrong from the message of the Christ, while a Buddhist is one who molds his life into the arche- type of moral status given by the great Gautama, or one of the other Buddhas. A11 doctrines which seek to unfold and preserve that invisibIe spark in man which he has named Spisit, are said to be spiritual. Those which ignore this invisible ele- ment and concentrate entirely upon the visible are said to be material, Ther)e is in religion a 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE LOSTKEYS OF MASONRY wonderful place of balance-where the materialist and spiritist meet on the plane of logic and reason. Science and theology are two ends of a single truth, but the world will never receive the full benefit of their investigations until they have made peace with each other, and labor hand in hand for the accomplishment of the great work-the libera- tion of spirit and intelligence from the three-di- mentional graves of ignorance, superstition, and f ear. That ‘which gives man a knowledge of himself can be inspired only by the self-and God is the self in all things. In truth, He is the inspiration and the thing inspired. It has been stated in Scripture that God was the Word and that the Word was made flesh. Man’s task now is to make . flesh reflect the glory of that Word, which is within the soul of himself. It is this task which has created the need of religion -not one faith alone, but many creeds, each searching in its own way: each meeting the needs of individual people: each emphasizing one point above all the others. Twelve Fellow Craftsmen are exploring the four points of the compass. Are not these twelve the twelve great world religions, each seeking in its own way for that which was lost in the ages past, and the quest of which is the birth- right of man ? Is not the quest for Reality in a 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION world of illusions the task for which each comes into the world? We are here to gain balance in a sphere of unbalance; to find rest in a restless thing; to unveil illusion ; and to slay the dragon of our own animal natures. As David, King of Israel, gave to the hands of his son Solomon the task he could not accomplish, so each generation gives to the next the work of building the temple, or rather, rebuilding the dwelling of the Lord, which is on the Mount Moriah. Truth is not lost, yet it must be sought for and found. Reality is ever-present-dimensionless, yet all-prevailing. Man-creature of attitudes and desires, and servant of impressions and opinions -cannot, with the wandering unbalance of an un- tutored mind, learn to know that which he him- self does not possess. 1 As man attains a quality, he discovers that quality, and recognizes about him the thing newborn within himself. Man is born with eyes, yet it is onlv after long years of sorrow that he learns to see clearly and in har- mony with the plan. He is born with senses, but it is only after long experience and fruitless striv- ings that he brings these senses to the temple and lays them as offerings upon the altar of the great Father, who alone does all things well and with understanding. Man is, in truth, born in the sin of ignorance, but with a capacity for understand- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE LOST KEYS OF MASONRY ing. He has a mind capable of wisdom, a heart capable of feeling, and a hand strong for the great work in life--truing the rough ashler into the per- fect stone. What more can any creature ask for than an opportunity, a chance to prove the thing he is, the dream that inspires him, the vision that leads him on? We have no right to ask for wisdom. In whose name do we beg for understanding? By what authority do we demand happiness? None of these things is the birthright of any creature; yet all may have them, if they will cultivate with- in themselves the thing that they desire. There is no need of asking, nor does any Deity bow down to give man these things that he desires. Man is given, by nature, a gift, and that gift is the priv- ilege of labor. Through labor he learns all things. Religions are groups of people, gathered to- gether in the labor of learning. The world is a school. We are here to learn, and being here proves our need of instruction. Every living creature is struggling F to break the strangling bonds of limitation-that pressing narrowness which destroys vision and leaves the life without an ideal. Every soul is engaged in a great work -the labor of personal liberation from the ruts of ignorance. The world is a great prison: its bars are the Unknown. And each is a prisoner, until 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION at last he earns the right to tear these bars from their moldering sockets, and pass, illuminated and inspired, into the darkness, which becomes lighted by that presence. All peoples of the world seek the temple where God dwells, where the spirit of the great Truth illuminates the shadows of human ignorance, but they know not which way to turn, nor where this temple is. The mist of dogma sur- rounds them. Ages of thoughtlessness bind them in. Limitation weakens them and inhibits their footsteps. They wander in darkness seeking light, ever failing to realize that the light is in the heart of the darkness. TO a few who have found Him, God reveals Himself. These, in turn, reveal Him to man, striv- ing to tell ignorance the message of wisdom. But seldom does man understand the mystery that has been unveiled. He tries weakly to follow in the steps of those who have attained, but all too often finds the path more difficult than he even dreamed. So he kneels in prayer before the mountain he cannot climb, and from the top of which gleams forth the light, which he is not strong enough to reach, nor wise enough to comprehend. He lives the lrtw as he knows it, aIways fearing in the depth of himself that he has not read aright the flaming letters in the sky, and that in living the letter of 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE LOST KEYS OF MASONRY the Law he has murdered out the spirit. Man bows humbly to the Unknown, peopling the shadows of’ his own ignorance with saints and saviors 9 ghosts and specters, gods and demons. Ignorance fears all things, and falls, terror-stricken, before the passing wind. Superstition stands as the monument to ignorance, and before it kneel those who are realizing their own weakness; who see in all things the strength they do not possess; who give to sticks and stones the power to bruise them; who change the beauties of nature into the dwelling places of ghouls and ogres. Wisdom fears no thing, but still bows humbly to its own source. While superstition hates all things, wis- dom, with its deeper understanding, loves all things, for it has seen the beauty, the tenderness, and the sweetness which underlie Life’s mystery. Life is the span of time appointed for accom- plishment. Every fleeting moment is an oppor- tunity, and those who are great are the ones who have recognized life as the opportunity for all things. Arts, sciences, and religions are monu- ments standing for what humanity has already accomplished. They stand as memorials to the unfolding mind of man, and through their avenues man passes to more efficient and more intelligent methods of attaining prescribed results.

Those who give man the things he needs are seldom appreciated in their own age; but are later recognized as the saviors of the h uman race. Masonry is a structure built of experience. Each stone is a sequential step in the unfolding of in- telligence. The shrines of Masonry are orna- mented by the jewels of a thousand ages; its rit- uals ring with the words of enlightened seers and illuminated sages. A hundred religions have brought their gifts of wisdom to its altar. Arts and sciences unnumbered have contributed to its symbolism. It is more than a Ifaith: it is a path of certainty. It is more than a belief t it is a fact. Masonry is a university, teaching the liberal arts and sciences of the soul to all who will attend to its words. It is a shadow of the great Atlan- tean Mystery School, which stood with all its spIendor in the ancient city of the Golden Gates, where now the turbulent Atlantic rol!s in un- broken splendor.

Masonry is, in truth, that long-lost thing which all peoples have sought in all ages. Masonry is the common denominator and the common divisor of human aspiration. Most of the religions of the world are proces- sions: one leads, and many f I1 o ow. In the foot- steps of the demigods, man follows in his search for truth and illumination. The Christian follows the gentle Nazarene up the winding slopes of Cal- vary. The Buddhist follows his great emancipator through his wanderings in the wilderness. The Mohammedan makes his pilgrimage across the desert sands to the black tent at Mecca. Truth leads, and ignorance follows in his train. Spirit blazes the trail, and matter follows behind. In the world today ideals live but a moment in their purity, before the gathering hosts of darkness snuff out the gleaming spark. The Mystery School, however, remains unmoved. It does not bring its light to man: man must bring his light to it. Ideals, coming into the world, become idols with- in a few short hours, but man, entering the gates of sanctuary, changea the idol back to an ideal. Man is climbing an endless flight of steps, with 20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION his eyes turned toward the goal at the top. Many cannot see the goal, and only one or two steps are visible before them. He has learned, howeSer, one great lesson, and that is, that as he builds his own character he is given strength to climb the steps. Hence a Mason is a builder of the temple of char- acter. He is the architect of a sublime mystery- the gleaming, glowing temple of his own soul. He realizes that he best serves God when he joins with the Great Architect in building more noble structures in the universe below. All who are at- tempting to attain mastery through constructive efforts are Masons at heart, regardless of sects or religious beliefs. A Mason is not necessarily a member of a lodge. He is any person who tries every day to live the Masonic life, and to serve in- telligently the needs of the Great Architect. The Masonic brother pledges himself to assist all other temple-builders in whatever extremity Iife may unfold, and in so doing he pledges himself to every stick and stone, to beast, God, and man, for they are all temple-builders, building more noble shrines wherein to worship the universal God. Th e M asonic Lodge is a mystery school, a place where candidates are taken out of the follies and foibles of the world and are instructed in the mys- teries of life, relationships, and the identity of that 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE LOST KEYS OF MASONRY germ of spiritual essence in them, which is, in truth, the son of God, beloved of his Father. The Mason views life seriously, realizing that every wasted moment is a lost opportunity, and that Omnipotence is gained only through earnestness and endeavor. Above all other relationships he recognizes the universal brotherhood of living things. The clasped hands of his Lodge reflect his attitude toward all the world, for he is the comrade of all created things. He realizes also that his spirit is a glowing, gleaming jewel which he must enshrine within a holy temple built by the labor of his hands, the meditations of his heart, and the aspiration of his soul. Masonry is a religion which is essentiaIly creed- 1 ess. It is the truer for it. Its brothers bow to truth regardless of the bearer; they serve light, instead of wrangling over the one who brings it. In this way they prove that they are seeking to know better the will and the dictates of the In- vincible One. No truer religion exists in all the world than that all creatures gather together in comradeship and brotherhood, for the purpose of glorifying one God, and of building for Him a temple of constructive attitude and noble char- acter. 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"HE average Mason, as well as the modern student of Masonic ideals, little realizes or understands the cosmic obligation which he takes upon himself when he begins his search for the sacred truths of nature as they are concealed in the ancient and modern rituals. He must not lightly consider his vows, and if he would not bring upon himself years and ages of suffering he must cease to consider Masonry as merely a social or fraternal order. He must realize that the mystic teachings as perpetuated in the modern rites are sacred, and that powers unseen and unrecog- nized mold the destiny of those who consciously an.d of their own free will take upon themselves the obligations of the craft.

Only those who see in it a cosmic study, a life work, a spiritual inspira- tion to better thinking, better living, and better act- ing, with the spiritual attainment of enlightenment as the end, and with the daily life of the true Mason as the means, have gained even the slightest insight into the true mysteries of the ancient and accepted rite. The age of the Masonic school is not to be cal- culated by hundreds or even thousands of years, for it never had any origin in the worlds of form.

Creedless and religionless he stands, a master of all faiths, and those who take up the study of Masonry with- out realizing the depth, the beauty, and the spir- itual power of the thing they are analyzing can never gain anything of permanence from their studies. The age of the mystery schools can be traced by the true student back to the dawn of time, hundreds of millions, yes, billions of years ago, when the temple of the Solar Man was in the making. That was the first Temple of the King, and there in the dawn of time were given and laid down the true mysteries of the ancient lodge, and it was the gods of creation and the spirits of the dawn who first tiled the Master’s lodge. The initiated brother realizes that his so-called symbols and rituals are merely blinds built by the wise to perpetuate ideas incomprehensible to the average individual. He also realizes that few Masons of today know or appreciate the mystic meaning concealed within these rituals.

In the work we are taking up it is not the inten- tion to dwell upon the modern concepts of the craft but to consider Masonry as it really is to those who know, a great cosmic organism whose true brothers and children are tied together not by spoken oaths but by lives so lived that they are cap- able of seeing through the blank wall and opening the window which is now concealed by the rub- bish of materiality. When this is done and the mysteries of the universe unfold before the aspir- ing candidate, then in truth he discovers what Masonry really is; its material aspects interest him no longer for he has unmasked the mystery school which he is capable of recognizing only when he himself has spiritually become a member of it. There is no doubt in the minds of those who have examined and studied its ancient lore that Masonry, like the universe itself, which is the greatest of all schools, deals with the unfolding of a threefold principle, for all the universe is governed by the same three kings who are called the builders of the Masonic temple. They are not personalities but principles, great intelligent ener- gies and powers which in God, man, and the uni- verse have charge of the molding of cosmic sub- stance into the habitation of the living king, the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION temple built through millions of years of first un- conscious and then conscious effort on the part of every individual who is expressing in his daily life the creative principles of the three kings. The true brother of the ancient craft realized that the completion of the temple he was building to the King of the universe was a duty or rathc:r a privilege which he owed to his God, to his brother, and to himself. He knew that certain steps must be taken and that his temple must be built according to plan, but today it seems that the plan is lost, for in the majority ‘of cases Masonry is no longer operative but is merely a speculative idea and must remain so until each brother, reading the mystery of his symbols and pondering over the beautiful allegories unfolded in his ritual, realizes that he himself contains the keys and- the plans so long lost to his craft and that if he would ever learn Masonry he must unlock its doors with the key filed from the base metals of his own being. True Masonry is esoteric; it is not a thing of this world; al1 that we have here is a link, a door- way, through which the student may pass into the unknown.

All of the great mystery schools have hierarchies upon the spiritual planes of nature which are expressing themselves in this world through creeds and organ- isms. The true student is seeking to lift himself from the exoteric body upward spiritually until he joins the esoteric group which, without a lodge on the physical plane of nature, is still greater bv far than all the lodges of which it is the central fi re. These spiritual instructors of humanity are forced to labor in the concrete world with things comprehensible to the concrete mind, and there *This is a term used by the ancients to designate the esoteric side of their religious ceremonials.

The true Mason realizes that the work of the mystery schools in the world is of an inclusive rather than an exclusive nature, and that the only lodge which is broad enough to express his ideals is the one whose dome is the heavens, whose pil- lars are the corners of creation, whose checker- board floor is composed of the crossing currents of human emotion, and whose altar is the human heart. Creeds cannot bind the true seeker for truth. The Mason, realizing the unity of all truth, also realizes that the hierarchies laboring with him have given him in his varying degrees the mystic, spiritual rituals of all the mystery schools in the world, and if he would fill his place in the plan he must not enter this sacred study for what he can get out of it but that he may learn how better to put more in. Masonry has concealed within it the mystery of creation, the answer to the problem of existence, and the path which the student must walk in order to join those who are really the Iiving powers be- hind the thrones of modern national and interna- tional affairs.

In ancient times many years of preparation were required before the neophyte was permitted to enter the temple of the mysteries. In this way those who were shallow, the curiosity seekers, the faint of heart, and those unable to withstand the temptations of life were not chosen, but automatic- ally withdrew themselves from a price which was greater than they would pay, and he who did pass between the pillars entered the temple realizing his sublime opportunity, his’ divine obligation, and the mystic privilege which he had earned for him- self through years of special preparation. Only those are truly Masons who enter their temple in reverence, who are seeking not the passing things of life but the treasures which are eternal, whose one desire in life is to know the true mvstery of the craft that they may join as honest ‘workmen those who have gone before as builders of the uni- versal temple.

He likewise well knew and believed in the true God. It has been believed since several ages that Cham, one of the sons of Noah, is the author of this monument of antiquity. A very ancient author, whose name is not known, who lived several centuries before Christ, mentions this tab- let, and says that he had seen it in Egypt, at the court; that it was a precious stone, an emerald, whereon these characters were represented in bas relief, not engraved. ’ He states that it was in his time esteemed over two thousand years old, and that the matter of this emerald had once been in a fluid state like melted glass, and had been cast in a mold, and that to this flux the artist had given the hardness of a nat* ural and genuine emerald, by art. (Alchemical art.) The Cananites were called the Phoenicians by the Greeks, who have told us that they had Hermes for one of their kings. There is a great relation between Chiram and Hermes. CAiram is a word composed out of three words, denoting the universal spirit, the essence whereof the whole creation does consist, and the object of Chaldean Egyptian and genuine natural philo- sophy, according to its inward principles or prop- erties. The three Hebrew words Chuma, Rauch, 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE LOST KEYS OF MASONRY and Majim, mean respectively Fire, Air, and Water, while their initial consonants, Ch, R, M, give us Chiram, that invisible essence which is the father of earth, fire, air and water, because, al- though immaterial in its own invisible nature, as the unmoved and electrical fire, when moved it becomes light and visible; and when collected and agitated, becomes heat and visible and tangible fi re; and when it associates with humidity it be- comes material. The word Chiram has been meta- morphosed into Her,mes and also into Herman, and the translator; of the Bible have made Chiram by changing Chet into He; both of these Hebrew word signs being very similar. In the old word Hermaphrodite, a word in- vented by the philosophers, we find Hermes changed to Herm, signifying Chiram, or the uni- versal agent, and Aphrodite, the passive principle of humidity, who is also called Venus, and is said to have been produced and generated by the sea. We also read that Hiram (Chiram) , or the uni- versal agent, assisted King Solomon to build the temple; no doubt as Solomon possessed wisdom, he understood what to do with the corporealized universal agent. The Talmud of the Jews says that King Solomon built the temple by the assist- ance of Schamir.

The solving of the mystery of ether, or, if you prefer to call it such, vibrant space, is the great problem of Masonry.

In the divine soli- tude he labored, no voice to cheer, no spirit to condemn; alone in the boundless all with the great chill of the morning mist upon his brow, but his heart still warm with the light of the Master’s Word. It seemed a hopeless battle: no single pair of hands could mold that darkness; no single heart, no matter how true, could be great enough to send the pulsing cosmic love into the cold mist of oblivion.
