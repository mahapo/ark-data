A proper administration of the various ceremonies con- nected with its RITUAL, is of the first importance, and worthy of our serious consideration. The rites and ceremonies of Freemasonry form the dis- tinctive peculiarity of the institution. In their nature they are simple — in their end, instructive. They naturally excite a high degree of curiosity in a newly initiated brother, and create an earnest desire to investigate their meaning, and to become acquainted with their object and design. It requires, however, close application and untiring diligence to ascertain the precise nature of every ceremony whiqh our ancient brethren saw reason to adopt in the formation of an exclusive"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"system, which was to pass through the world unconnected with the religion and politics of all times, and of evtry people among whom it should flourish and increase. In order to preserve our ceremonies from the hand of innovation, it is essentially necessary that every officer should be thoroughly acc|uainted with them, and that a firm determination should exist among the craft to admit no change. A few words here or there may not in themselves appear of much consequence, yet by frequent allowance, we become habituated to them, and thus open the door to evils of more serious magnitude. There is, there can be, no safety but in a rigid adherence to the ancient ceremonies of the Order. The ceremonies and regulations are fixed by the rules of the order similar to those governing affairs in social life. Every Freemason is required to bring his portion of good ideas, and contribute to the perfecting of the cere- monies and symbols ; and to the edification of Truth, the universal anci eternal temple which will one day inclose all humanity within its precincts. THE LODGE AND ITS GOVERNMENT. 1. The room in which a certain number of Freemasons assemble, for business connected with the institution, is called a Lodge. The assembly or organized body of Free- masons is also called a Lodge, just as the word Church is expressive both of the congregation and the place in which they meet to worship. A Lodge of Freemasons, to be legally constituted, must be in possession of a charter, granted by the Grand Lodge in whose jurisdiction it is sit- uated ; the Book of the Law ; Square and Compasses ; the Book of Constitutions ; a code of By-Laws ; its Officers and a sufficient number of members, (in all not less than seven), to perform the ceremonies pertaining to the Order. 2 The constitutional officers of a Lodge are the Wor- shipful Master, Senior and Junior Wardens, Senior and Junior Deacons, Inner Guard and Tyler, to which, for the better regulation of the private concerns of the Lodge, are to be added a Treasurer and Secretary , a Chaplain, Direc- tor of Ceremonies, Organist and Stewards may also be added . 3. A Lodge ought to assemble at least once a month for work and instruction, 4. A Lodge has the right to do all the work of Ancient Craft Masonry ; to be represented at all the Communica- tions of the Grand Lodge, (if they are not twelve months in arrears for Grand '' -^-^Ige dues) to elect and instal its officers ;"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to increase its members by the admission of new members, and no member can be forced upon a Lodge without its con- sent, and by a favorable ballot ; to make By-laws for its government; to exclude a member, on cause shown, tempor- arily or permanently ; to levy tax on its members ; to appeal to the District Deputy Grand Master from the decision of its Master, and if not satisfied with his decision, then to the Grand Lodge ; to exercise penal authority over its own members, and over all unaffiliated Masons living within the limits of its jurisdiction. 5. A Lodge under dispensation is a temporary and in- choate organization of Freemasons, acting under authority from the Grand Master ; is not entitled to representation in the Grand Lodge until warrant has been recommended to be issued by Grand Lodge ; can not elect or in«;tall officers ; is without power to frame By-Laws or adopt a seal. QUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES. The qualifications which are essential in those who apply for initiation into the mysteries ol Fremasonry, are two kinds, Internal and External. The Internal qualifications of a candidate are those which lie within his own bosom, and are not known to the world. They refer to his peculiar dispositions toward the institution — his motives and designs in seeking an entrance into it. Hence they are known 10 himself alone; and a knowledge of them can only be acquired from his own solemn declaration. The external qualifications are those which refer to his outward fitness for initiation, and are based on his moral and religious character, the frame of his body, the constitu- tion of his mind, and his soci?! position. A knowledge of these is to be acquired from a careful examination by a committee appointed for that purpose. The person who de.^ires to be a Mason must be a man, believing in the exiF*'*nce of a Supreme Being, and of a future existence ; at le. ivventy-one years of age ; of good m(»ral character, temperate, industrious, and capable of earning an honest livelihood ; he must come of his own free will and accord, uninfluenced by mercenary or other im- proper motives ; be of sound mind and body ; capable of reading and writing ; not deformed or dismembered, but hale and sound in his physical conformation, having his right limbs as a man ought to have. l^"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES. By the regulations of the Fraternity, a candidate for the mysteries of viasonry cannot be initiated in any regular lodge u-ithout having been properly proposed at one regular meetini'^ ol the lodge, and a committee has been appointed by the W. M., or the petition referred to the K. C, to make the necessary enquiries into the character of the candidate. His name, age, addition or profession, and place of abode shall have been sent to all the members in the summons for the next regular meeting, when, after the committee have reported to the lodge in his favor, he must be balloted for, and if approved, he may be admitted to the first degree of masonry.

In all regular assemblies of men who are convened for wise and useful purposes, the commencement and conclusion of business are accompanied with some form. In every country in the world the practice prevails, ana is deemed essential. Ceremonies, when simply considered, it is true, are little more than visionary delusions ; but their effects are some- times important. When they impress awe and reverance on the mind, and engage the attention by external attraction to solemn rites, they are interesting objects. These purposes are effected by judicious ceremonies when regularly conducted and properly arranged. On this ground, they have received the sanction of the wisest men in all ages, and consequently could not escape the notice of Masons. To begin well is the most likely means to end well, and it has been properly remarked, that when order and method are neglected at the beginning, they will be seldom found to take place at the end. The ceremonies of Opening and Closing a Lodge with solemnity and decorum, is therefore, universally admitted among Masons ; and which differ in each of the degrees, — but differ so slightly as not to affect their general character. They must, therefore, be considered in reference tothesevv al purposes which they are designed to accomplish. To conduct these ceremonies with propriety ought to oe the peculiar study of every Mason, especially of those who have the honor to rukT in our assemblies. To persons who are dignified, — every eye is naturally directed for propriety and behaviour, and from them, other brethren, who are less informed, will naturally expect to derive an ex- ample worthy of imitation. From a share in these ceremonies no Mason can be exempted. This is the first request of the Master and the prelude to all business. No sooner has it been signified that the lodge is about to be opened than every officer repairs to his station and the intent of the meeting becomes the sole object of attention. OPENING.

THE WORKING TOOLS OF AN E. A. MASON. The Twetity-foiir Inch Caiig^e^ Common Gavel and the Chisel. The Twenty-four Inch Gaui>e is the first implement put into the hands of the workman, to enable him to measure, and ascertain the size and extent of the work in which he is about to engage ; thus to compute the time and labor it may cost. The Common Gavel is an important instrument of labor, and highly esteemed as an implement of art. Though re- cognized by vari.?us artists under different appellations, it is vet admitted by them all, that no work of ^nanual skill can be completed without it. The Chisel is a small instrument, though solid in its form, and of such exquisite sharpness as fully to compensate ior the diminutiveness of its size. It is calculated to make an impression on the hirdest substance, and the mightiest structures have been indebted for their fine polish to its aid. Rut as we are not operative, but rather Free and Accepted or speculative Masons, we apply these tools to our morals in this sense. From the Twenty Four Inch Gauge we derive a lesson of daily admonition and instruction ; for as it is divided into twenty-four parts, it recalls to our mind the division of the day into twenty-four parts, and directs us to apportionate them to their proper objects, namely, prayer, labor, refresh- ment, and sleep. From th** Common Gavel we learn that skill without exertion is of little avail, — that labor is the lot of man ; for the heart may conceive, and the head devise in vain, if the liand be not prompt to execute the design. From the Chisel we learn that perseverance is necessary to establish perfection ; that the rude materia! receives its fine polish, but from repeated efforts alone, that nothing 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"short of indefatigable exertion c?n induce the habit of virtue, enlighten the mind, and render the soul pure. From the whole we deduce this moral ; that knowledge grounded on accuracy, aided by labor, and prompted by perseverance, will finally overLome all difficulties, raise ignorance from despair and establish hap,Hness to the paths of science. ^'^ference is made to the Charter. Book of Con., and By ^. .vs are presented. By Laius of the Lod^e is signed by the Bro. LECTURE ON THE TRACING BOARD. The usages and customs of Masons have ever cor- responded with those of the ancient Egyptians, to which they bear a near afi^nity. Their philosophers, unwilling lo expose their mysteries to vulgar eyes, concealed their par- ticular tenets and principles of polity and philosophy under hieroglyphical figures, and expressed their notions of gov- ernment by signs and symbols, which they communicated to their priests or Magi alone, who were bound by oath not to reveal them. Pythagoras seems to have established his system on a similar plan, and many orders of a more recent date have copied their example. But masonry, however, is not only the most ancient, but the most moral institution that has ever existed, as every character, figure, and emblem depicted in the lodge has a moral tendency, and tends to inculcate the practice of virtue. Let me first call you attention to the form of the lodge, which is of an oblong square : in the length from east to west, in breadth between north and south, in depth from the surface of the earth to the centre, and even as high as the heavens. The reason that a Freemason's Lodge is repre- sented of this vast extent is to show the universality of the science, and that a Mason's charity should know no bounds save those of prudence. Our lodge stands on holy ground ; because the first lodge was consecrated on account of three grand offerings thereon made, which met with divine appro- bation : first, the ready compliance of Abraham to the will of God, in not refusing to offer up his son Isaac as a burnt offering, when it pleased the Almighty to substitute a more agreeable victim in his stead ; second, the many pious pray- ers and ejaculations of King David, which actually appeased the wrath of God, and stayed a pestilence which then raged among his people, owing to his inadvertently having had them numbered : and thirdly the many thanksgivings, obla- te . I"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IS"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"•^p"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"tions, burnt sacrifices, and costly offerings, which Solomon, King of Israel, made at the cr.mplction, dedication, and consecration ot the Temple of Jerusalem to God's service. Those three did then, have since, and I trust, ever will, render the ground work of Masonry holy. Our lodge is situated due east and west ; because all places of divine worship, as well as Masons' regular, well-formed, and con- stituted lodges are, or ought to be, so situated, lor which we assign three Masonic reasons : first the sun, the glory of the Lord, rises in the east and sets in the west ; second, learning originated in the east, aid from thence spread its benign in- fluence to the we&t ; a third, last, and grand reason, which is too long to be entered upon now, is explained in the course of our lectures, which you will have many opportuni- ties of hearing. Our lodge is supported by three grand pillars. They are called loisdoin, stre)ii^th and beauty. Wisdom to con- trive, strength to support, and beauty to adorn. Wisdom to conduct us m all our undertakings ; strength to support us under all our difficulties, and beauty to adorn the inward man. The universe is the temple of the Deity whom we serve — wisdom, strength and beauty, are both his throne and pillars of his work ; tor his wisdom is infinite, his strength is oninij)Otent, and beauty shines through the whole of the creation. In symmetry and order, the heavens he has stretched forth as a canopy ; the earth he has planted as his footstool ; he crowns his temple with stars, as with a diadem ; and his hands extend their power and glory. The sun and the moon are messengers of his will, and all his law is concord. The three great pillars supporting a Mason's Lodge are emblematical of those divine attributes, and further represents Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram King of Tyre, and Hiram Abiff. Solomon, King of Israel for his wisdom in building, completing, and dedicating the temple at Jerusalem to God's service; Hiram, King ol Tyre for his strength in supporting him with men and materials ; and Hiram Abiff for his curious and masterlv workmanship in beautifying and adorning the same. As there are no noble orders in architecture known by the name of wisdom, strength, and beauty, we refer them to the three most cele- brated — the Doric, Ionic, and the Corinthian. The covering of a Freemason's Lodge is a celestial canopy of diverse colors, even as the heavens. The way by which we, as Masons, hope to arrive at it is by the assistance of a ladder, in Scripture called Jacob's ladder. It is com- posed of many staves, or rounds, which point out as many moral virtues.* Three are principle ones — Faith, Hopc^ and Chanty. Faith to the great Architect of the universe ; hope 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"in salvation ; and to be in charity with all nien. It reaches to the heavens, and rests on the volutne of the sacred law ; because, by the doctrines contained in that holy book, we are taught to believe in the wise dispensations of Divine Providence, which belief, strengthens our faith and enables us to ascend the fiist stef). This f.iith natuially creates in us a fiope of becoming partakers of the blessed promises there- in recorded, which hope enables us to ascend the second step. But the third and last being charity, comprehends the whole ; and the Mason who is [possessed of that virtue in its most ample sense, may justly be deemed to have attained the summit of his profession, figuratively speaking, an ethereal mansion veiled from mortal eye by the starry firmament, emblematically depicted here by seven stars, which have an allusion to as many regularly made Mason s without which number no lodge is perfect, nor can any candidate be legallv initiated into the order. The interior of a Freemnson's Lodge is composed of ornaments, furniture, and jewels. The ornaments of the Lodge are the Mosaic pavement, the blazing star, and the indented or tessclated border. The mosaic pavement is the beautiful flooring of a Freemason's Lodge : the blazing star, the glorv in the centre ; and the indented or tesselated border, the skirtwork round the same. The mosaic pave- ment m^iy justly be deemed the beautiful flooring of the Lodge, by reason of its bein^ variegated and chequered. This points out the diversity of objects which decorate and adorn the creation, the animate as well as the inanimate parts thereof. The blazing star or glory in the centre refers us to the grand luminary of the sun, which enlightens the earth, and, by its benign influence, dispenses its blessings to mankind in general. The indented or tesselated border refers us to the planets, which, in their various revolutions, form a beautiful border of skirtwork round that grand lumin;iry the sun, as the other does round that of a Freemason's Lodge. The furniture of the Lodge is the volume of the sacred law, the compasses and the square. The sacred writings are to govern our faith. On them we obligate our candidates for Masonry. So are the compasses and square when united to regulate our lives and actions. The sacred volume is de- rived ^-om God to man in general. The compasses belong to th ^rand Master in particular, and the square to the whole craft. The Jewels of the Lodge are three moveable and three immovable. The moveable jewels are the square, level, and plumb rule. Among operative Masons, the square is to try and adjust all irregular corners of buildings, and to assist in 18"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ed of )f the d the is the star, elated f^ave- the ;ed. and mate fers the s to ers n a the ,?e. aw, to for to de- )ng the xe nd ry in bringing rude matter into due form ; the levels to lay levels and prove hortizontals ; and i\\\\^ plumb- riiieio try and adjust all uprights while tixed on their uioper basis. xVniong free and accepted Masons, the square tci.ches morality, the level equality, and the plumb rule ju;itness ard uprightness of life and actions. Ihey are called moveable jewels bec:uise they are worn by the Master and his Wardens, and are transfer- able from t' em to their successors on nights of installation. The Mastei is distinguished by the square ; the Senior Warden by the level ; and the Junior Warden by the plumb- rule. The immoveable jewels are the trachii^ boat d -Awd the rough and prrfrct as/i/rrs. The tracing board is lor the Master to lay lines and to draw designs on. The rough ashler for the entered apprentice to work, mark, and indent on ; and the perfect ashler for the experienced crafisman to try and adjust his jewels on. They are called immovable, because they lie open for the brethren to moralize upon. As the tracing board is for the Master to lay lines and dr.uv designs on, the better to enable the brethren to carry on the intended structure with regularity and f)iopriety, so the v^olume Oi the sacred law may justly i)e deemed the spiritual tracing board of the great Architect of the universe, in which are laid down such divine laws and moral plans, that were we conversant therein and adherent thereto, they would bring us to an ethereal mansion not built by hands, but eternally in ihe heavens. The rough ashler \\s a stone, rough and unhewn, as taken from its quarry, till by the industry and ingenuity of the workiiian it is modelled, wrought into due form, and rendered tit for the intended building.

In all regular, well-formed, constituted lodges, there is a point within a circle round which a Mason cannot err. This circle is bounded between north and south by two grand parallel lines, and one represents Moses, the other King Solomon.

CHARGE, FH^ST DEGREE. As you have now passed through the ceremonies of your initiation, allow me to congratulate you on being admitted a member of our ancient and honorable society. Ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial, and honorable be- cause, by a natural tendency it conduces to make all those honorable who are sti ictly obedient to its precepts. Indeed, no institution can boast a more solid foundation than that on which Freemasonry rests — tJie practice of social atid moral virtue, and to so high an eminence has its credit been ad- vanced, that, in every a<,'e, monarchs themselves have been promoters of the art ; have not thought it derogatory from their dignity to exchange the sceptre for the gavel ; have patronized our mysteries, and have joined our assemblies. As a Mason, I would first recommend to your most serious contemplation the volume of the sacred law, charging you to consider it the unerring standard of truth and justice, and to regulate vour actions by the divine precepts which it contains. Therein you will be taught the important duty you owe to God, to your neighbour, and to yourself.

As a citizen of the world, I am next to enjoin you to be exemplary in the discharge of your civil duties, by never proposing, or at all countenancing, any act that may have a tendency to subvert the peace and good order o*^ society ; by paying due obedience to the laws of any state which may for a time become the place of your residence or afford you its protection ; and, above all, by never loosing sight of the allegiance due to the Sovereign of your native land ; ever remembering that nature has implanted in your breast a sacred and indissoluble attachment to that country from which you derived your birth and infant nature. As an individual, I am further to recommend the prac- tice of every domestic as well as public virtue. Let pru- dence direct you ; temperance chasten you ; fortitude support you ; and justice be the guide of all your actions, and be especially careful to maintain, in their fullest splendor, those truly masonic ornaments, benevolence and charity. Still, howew r, as a Mason there are other excellencies of character to which your attention may be peculiarly and forcibly directed ; among the foremost of these are secrecy, fidelity and obedience. Secrecy may be said to consist in the inviolable adher- ence to the obligations you have entered into, never im- properly to reveal any of those Masonic secrets which have now been, or may at any future time be, entrusted to your keeping, and cautiously to shun all occasions which might inadvertently lead you so to do. \\QViX fidelity must be exemplified by a strict obiervance of the constitutions of the fraternity ; by adhering to the ancient landmarks of the order ; by never attempting to extort, or otherwise unduly obtain the secrets of a superior degree, and by refraining to recommend any one to a parti- cipation of our secrets, unless you have strong grounds to believe that, by a similar fidelity, he will ultimately reflect honor on our choice. an"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"So must your obedience be proved by a. close coMfonnity to our laws and regulations ; by prompt attention to all si^ns and suiniuonses ; by modest and concct demeanor whils' in the lodj^e ; by abstaining' fiom every topic ot religious or political discussions; by ready ac(|uiesence in all votes and lesolutions duly passed by the biethren, and by perfect sub- mission to the jnaster and his wardens whilst acting in the iiicharj^c ol\" their respective offices. And, as a last general recommendation, let me exhort you to dedicate youi self to such pursuits as may enable you to become at once respectable in your rank of life, useful to mankind, and an ornament to the society of which you have this .day been admitted a member ; that you will more especially devote a part of your leisure hours to the study of such ot the liberal arts and sciences as may lie within the compass o. your attainment, and that without negKcting the ordinary duties of your station, you will consider yourself called upon to make a daily advancement in Masonic knowledge. From the very commendable attention which you ap- pear to have given to this charge, 1 am led to hope that you will duly appreciate the excellency of Freemasonry, and im- print indelibly on your mind the sacred dictates of truth, honor, and virtue.

The F C's weie paid their wages in specie. At the porch of the Temple stood two great pillars. That on the L was called which denotes ; that on the R which denotes , and when conjoined, for God said in strength v.ill I establish this my house. The height of these pillars was eighteen cubits, the cir- cumference twelve, the diameter four. Being formed hol- low, the outer rim or shell was four inches, or a hand's breadth in thickness. They were made of molten brass, and were cast on the plains of Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeradathah. The superintendent of the casting was H A B. Those pillars were adorned with two chapt< rs, ' each five cubits high. The chapters were enriched with net work, lily work, and pomegranates. Net work from the connection of its meshes, denotes loiity. Lily work from its whiteness, denotes peace, and pomegranates from the exuberance of their seeds denotes //^'w/y. These pillars were placed at the entrance of the Temple as a memorial to the children of Israel of the miraculous pillars of fire and clouji which had two wonderful effects — the fire gave light to the Israelites during their escape from their Egyptian bondage ; while the cloud proved darkness to Pharoah and his followers when they attempted to overtake them. King Solomon ordered them to be placed at the entrance of Temple as the most proper and conspicuous situation for the children of Israel to have the happy deliverance of their forefathers continu- ally before their eyes, while going to and returning from Divine worship. After our ancient brethren had passed those two great pillars, they ascended a winding staircase consisting of three, five, seven or more steps.

CHARGE. Brother, — Being advanced to the second degree of Masonry, we congratulate you on your preferment. The internal not the external qualifications of a man are what Masonry regards; as you increase in knowledge, so you will consequently improve in social intercourse. It is unneces- sary for me to recapitulate the duties which, as a Mason, you are now bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the neces- sity of a strict adherence to them, as your owr experience must have established their value. It may be sufficient to observe, that as your past behaviour and regular deportment have merited the honor which we have conferred, in your new character it is expected that you will not only conform to the principles of the Order, but steadily persevere in the practice of every virtue. The study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education, which tends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration — especially geometry, which is established as the basis of our art. (Geometry or Masonry originally synonymous terms, is of divine and moral nature, enriched with the most useful knowledge so that while it proves the wonderful properties of nature, it demonstrates the more im- portant truths of morality.) as"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"As the solemnity of our ceremonies requires a serious deportment, you are to be particularly attentive to your behaviour at our regular assemblies. You are to preserve our ancient usages and customs sacred and inviolaiJe, and induce others, by your example, to hold them in due vener- ation. The laws and regulations of the Order you are strenu- ously to support and maintain. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of the brethren, but in the decision of every tresspass against our rules, judge with candor, ad- monish with friendship, and reprehend with mercy. As a craftsman in our private assemblies, you may offer your sentiments and opinions on such subjects as are legu- larly introduced in the lecture under the superintendence of an experienced master, who will guard the landmarks against encroachment. By this privilege you may improve your intellectual powers ; qualify yourself to become a use- ful member of society ; and like a skilful craftsman, strive to excel in what is trood and grt at. You are to encourage industry and reward merit, supply the wants and relieve the necessities of brethren and fellows to the utmost of your power and ability, and on no account wrong them or see them wronged, but ap{)rist^ th'-m of ap- proaching danger, and view their interests as inseparable from your own. Such is the nature of your engagements as a craftsman ; and these duties you are now bound, by the most sacred ties, to observe. MASTER MAS'OrS BEGRE SYMBOLISM OF THE DEGREE. We have seen the type of man complete in moral worth and intellectual culture— not left to acquire knowledge, but 29"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"I I first prepare d to use that kr.ouledj^e well when it shall have b en obtained. What more is left? Coiiiuuinion with our Maker. The mere knowledge of the Deity, as given us heretofore, is that of an august Creator whom we are to reverence, and in whom alone we are to place our trust. But we have not yet seen him walking upon the earth, and hold- ing open communion with the sons ot men. Man lias not yet been ennobled by personal contact with the All- Holy. Let us imagine a conception perfectly in accordance wiih the ideas and opinions of our early brethren, \"Who has at any time seen Ood and lived?\" \"Adam, our first pro- genitor.\" \" IJut only in the days of his innocence. Since the day when all mankind was corrupted by his fall, no living man has looked upon the face of the Almighty.\" Now, what would be the natural opinion of our ancient brethien as to the means of securing God's actual presence. We know that, for a thousand years, men labored to find the true name of Jehovah, which they believed would be talis- man, givnig them power over all the secrets of the Universe. Union, of the most unselfish naturt,', formed the grand characteristic of our fraternity. Ambition, d( sire for fame • — every passion which appeals to the self-love of man, was merged in the perfect union engendered by an adherence to the tenets of the Order to such a degree, that the names even of our great architects have not come down to us, though their works still stand to attest their excellence. All was the work of brethren, and each was allowed his share of the glory. Now, with this perfect union, and with the knowledge that the belief existed that it was through the weakness of man only that he could not endure the presence of his Creator, what so natural as to suppose that if three brethren be found as types respectively of moral, intellectual and physical perfection, and they be joined together in holy fellowship which should ma'<e their very souls as one, they might, in mystic union, call upon the great and sacred name of the Deito, and receive an answer to their prayer? Th?<- this idea did prevail we have suf^cient proof, and it is to this, rather than to any more utilitarian views, that we are to look for the rule which, in a purely speculative institutior , so sternly. demands physical, as well as moral and intellectual integrity. We know that the wise and good of the days of Solomon regarded his idolatry as an evidence that the countenance of the All-Holy had been darkened to him— that he no longt r held the interviews with the Only Wise God, through which they deemed that his superhuman wisdom came. And in- 30"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ID' deed it would seem to them a thing monstrous and wholly unnatural, that the being whose intellect had been illumi- nated from above, and to whom Jehovah had promised wisdom beyond that ot men, shhuld grovel in adoration be- fore false gods, did they not also believe that it was only throu'^h direct and constant communion with the Almighty that this wisdom could continue ; and now that he no longer sought that presence, he was given over to the blind guid- . ance of his passions. This degree is a ty[)e of the conmnmion of man with God. Long before the incarnation of that great Being, was the hope entertained ol seeing him with mortal eyes, and no exertions were deemed too great to ensure that consumma- tion. With us these ideas are but a type, for we have that realization so longed for by the brethren of old. And yet, as a type, how interesting it is in looking back u[)on their struggles, to look forward into what is now bright and clear. The practical lesson is to be found in the full exposition of the * * * Like the * * * they require us to be complete in (^ur duty to our neighbor before we can venture to direct him. Step by step, mounting from the lower to the highest, we must prove to o'lrselves that we would serve him — pray for him — sympathize with his inmost feelings, and sustain him from falling,', pcfore we can venture to coun- sel him even to his good— far less, dictate to him. We now find man complete in morality and intelligence, with the stay of religion added to ensure him of the protec- tion of the Deity, and guard him against ever uoing astray. These three degrees thus form a perfect and harmonious whole ; nor can we conceive that anything can be suggested more, which the soul of man requires. THIRD LECTURE. Ereemasonry in every degree, as before remarked, is progressive. A knowledge of it can only be attained by time, patience and application. In the first degree, we are taught the duties we owe toGod, our neighbor and ourselves. In the second, we are more thorou'^hly inducted into the mysteries of moral science, and learn to trace the goodness and majesty of the Creator, by minutely analyzing his works. But the third degree is the cement of the whole. It is cal- culated to bind men together by mystic points of fellowship, as in a bond of fraternal affection and brotherly love. It is among brethren of this dct^ree that the ancient Landmarks of the Order are preserved, and it is from them that we de- rive that fund of information which none but ingenious and expert Masons can supply. 31"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"It is also from brethren of this degree, that the rulers of the craft are selected ; because it is only from those who are capable of giving instruction, thet we can reasonably expect to receive it.

Your admission amon^ * * in a state ot helpless indigence, was an emblematic representation of the entrance of all men upon this their mortal existence. It inculcated a useful lesson of natural equaUty and mutual dependence. It instructed you in the proper exercise of universal bene- ficence and charity, to seek the solace of your own distress, by extending relief and consolation to your fellow creatures in the hour of their affliction, it enabled you to free the soul *rom the dominion of pride and prejudice, and to look be- yond the narrow limits of particular institutions, whether civil or religious, and to view in every son of Adam a brother of the dust. But above all it taught you to bend with humility and resignation to the will of T. G. A. O. T. U. and to dedicate your heart, thus purified from every banetul and malignant passion, and fitted only for the reception of truth and wisdom, as well to His glory as to the welfare of your fellow creatures. Proceeding onwards, and still guided in your progress by the principles of moral truth, you were led in the S. Deg. to contemplate the intellectual faculties, and to trace them from their development through the paths of heavenly science, even unto the throne of God himself. The secrets of nature and the principles ot moral truth were then unveiled to your view, — you learned a just estimate of those wonder- ous faculties with which God has endowed the being formed after His own image; and feel the duty whiv-n he has thereby imposed on you, of cultivating this Divine attribute with the most diligent and unremitting care and attention; that you may be enabled to show forth His glory and render yourself useful to the happiness of mankind. To your mmd thus moulded by virtue and science, na- ture however presents one great and useful lesson more, The knowledge of yourself. She prepares you by contemplation for the closing hour of your existence, and when by means of that contemplation she has conducted you through the intricate windings of this your mortal state, she finally in- structs you how to die. Such, my brother, is the peculiar object of this degree. It invites you to reflect upon this awful subject, and teaches you to feel that to the just and virtuous man death has no terrors equal to the stain of falsehood and dishonor. Of this great truth the annals of F. M. afford us a glorious example in the unshaken fidelity and noble death of our G. M. H. A., who was slain just at the completion of K. 8.

At the moment of carrying their conspiracy into execu- tion twelve of the fifteen recanted, but three of a more deter- mined and atrocious character than the rest persisted in their impious design in the prosecution of which they placed themselves, respectively at the S.

His fear3 being awakened for the safety of the chief A he selected fifteen trusty F C's and ordered them to make diligent search after the person of our G M to find if he were yet alive or had suffered death in the attempt to extort from him the secrets of his exalted Degree. Accordingly a stated day having been appointed for their return to Jerusalem they formed themselves with three F C Lodges and departed from the three entrances of the T. Many days were spent in fruitless search ; indeed one class returned to J without having effected any discovery of importance, but a second class was more fortunate for on the evening of a certain day after suffering the greatest privations and personal fatigue one of the breth- ren who had rested himself in a reclinig posture to assist him in rising caught hold of a shrub that grew near, which, to his surprise, came easily out of the ground. On a closer ex- amination he found that the earth had been recently disturbed he therefore hailed his brethren and with their united efforts succeeded in re-opening it and there found the body of our G M very indecently interred. They covered it again with all respect and reverence, and in order to distinguish the spot stuck a spritT of accacia at the head of the grave, thev then hastened to J to impart the afflictine intelligence to K S who, when the emotions of his grief had subsided, ordered them to return and raise the body of our G M to be interred in such a sepulchre as became his rank and exalted 30"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"talents.

It only remains to account for the third class, who had pursued their researches in the direction of J and were medi- tating their return to J, when accidentally passing the mouth of a cavern, they heard sounds of lamentation and regret. On entering to ascertain the cause they found three men answering the description of those who were missing, who, on being charged with the murder and findingall chance of escape cut off, made a lull confession of their guilt. They were bound and led to J where K S sentenced them to that death which the heinousness of their crime so justly merited. Our G M was ordered to be interred as near the S S as the I laws would permit, there in a grave three feet E, three feet W, three feet between N and S, and four feet or more perpendicular. He was not buried in the S S because nothing common or unclean was allowed to enter there except only the H P once a year, and he rot even then until alter many washings and purification against the great day of expiation of sins for by the Israelitish law all flesh was deemed unclean. The same filteen F C's were ordered to attend the funeral clothed in white aprons and gloves as emblems of their innocence. 37"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Secret IVork. TRACING BOARD. The ornaments of a M. M's Lodge are the Porch, Dormer, and Square Payment. The Porch was the entrance to the Sanctum Sanctorum, the Dormer the Window that gave light to the same, and the Square Pavement for the High Priest to walk on. The High Priests office was to burn m- cense to the honor and glory of the Most High, and to pray fervently that the Almightv through his unbounded wisdom and goodness, would be pleased to bestow peace and tran- quility to the Israelitish nation throughout the ensuing year.

U. will make no distinction of persons in the distribution of his benificence, but will give alike to all who endeavor to obey his Divine commands. Even so Masonry regards the internal not the external qualifications that recommend a man to be a Mason, no matter what his work, the humblest craftsman has a right to as great a reward as the highest, provided he has faithfully performed the task set before him. The nature of our institution ordains this, for the youngest member may in reality be more earnest in his researches than the oldest, and be rewarded with more light in Masonry '\"^ consequence. He, who like the young craftsman so recently represented by our brother, having made a discovery in Masonic science, renders more benefit to the institution than a member who, though of long standing, has learned nothing but the simplest 46"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"/, routine of the degree ; just as the Key-stone was of much greater importance to the building than the ordinary stones. It is not the length of time you have been a Mason, but the proper use of that time, that will entitle you to the wages ot wisdom and knowledge. Remember that the Key-stone found by our brother at the eleventh hour, although at first rejected by the builders, became the chief stone of the corner, while you who had wrought in the quarries from the earliest hours, exhibited only specimens ot the skill of the ordinary workman.

It was finished in the short space of seven years and six months, to the astonishment of all nations, and the Cope Stone was celebrated by the fraternity with great joy. The Tabernacle of Moses and its holy relics, were lodged in the Temple. King Solomon in a general assembly, dedicated or consecrated it by solemn prayer, and costly sacrifice praising Jehovah, upon fixing the Holy Arch in its proper place, where the Lord was pleased to fill the Temple with a cloud of glory. When the magnificent edifice was completed. King S(. lomon determined to bestow some distinguishing mark upon the skillful, and zealous builders who had been engaged in the construction.

Early one mornin?, upon repairing to our labors, we discovered a pair of pillars of perfect symmetry and exquis- ite workmanship ; proceeding onwards we discovered five other pairs of equal beauty ; these, from their situation, appeared to have supported the roof of a subterranean 52"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"passage communicating with the Most Holy Place. Our progress being obstructed by the fraj;ments of the roof of the former structure, we cleared them away and arrived at what in the first instance appeared to be a solid rock. But upon accidentally striking it with the crowbar, I remarked a hollow sound. My Brother laboring with the pick loosened the earth for some distance, when he with the shovel cleared it away, when we perceived that instead of a solid rock there was a series of stones in the form of a dome. Aware who was the architect of the former structure, and imagining that no part of it had been constructed in vain, we determined to examme it, for which purpose we removed two of the cope- stones, when a vault of considerable magnitude appeared in view, and we determined on a descent. All being equally anxious we cast lots ; the lot E. Sir fell upon me, and lest any noxious vapor or other circumstance should render my position hazardous, my companions fastened a cable tow or life-line round my waist, by means of which they could lower me into the vault, or raise me out according to the signal which I should give my R. or L. H. Comp. In this manner I descended through the aperture which we had made, and on arriving at the bottom I gave the signal agreed on, when my companions gave mc more line, which enabled me to encompass the vault. I then discovered what appeared a pedestal of a column and could also feel figures or characters engraven thereon, but for want of light was unable to discover what they were. I also laid hold of this scroll, but from the same cause I was unable to read its contents. Therefore securing it to my person and giving another signal, I was drawn up, and having covered the aperture we have come as in duty bound to report, and are now ready to state what we have found. They presented the scroll and were informed *' That the want of light should remind them, that man by nature is the child of ignorance and error, and as such, would have forever remained under the darkness of the shadow of death, had it not pleased the Almighty to call him to light and immortality by the revela- tion of his most Holy Will and Word.\" * * * « ik In the beginning God created the hea7>en and the earth and the earth was without fonu and Toid and darkness wcis upon the face of the deep ; a?id the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters ; and Cod said let there be light and there was light. Being requested to read the scroll, they were informed that such were the first words of that Sacred Vohone^ which 53"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"I i contained the treasure of God's revealed IVi/l and IVord, and were exhorted to praise and magnify his A/ost Holy Name, for the knowledge of himself which he had vouch- safed to them, and to worthily walk in that light which he had shed around them. They were anain directed to retire and prosecute their researches, with the same strict caution as before. The discovery of the precious treasure stimulated our further search, we on rcFuming our labor increased the aper- ture by the removal o' the third copestone, and I again descended into the vaulted chamber. By this time, the Sun having gained its meridian altitude, darted its rays immedi- ately into the aperture, and I perceived in the centre of the vault a pedestal of pure white marble, in the form of an altar of incense, that of a double cube. On the plinth were engraven certain n ystic characters, and the initials of our Three Grand Masters who (presided over the Seeond or Sacred Lodge ; whilst a veil of curious workmanship covered the face of the altar. Approaching with reverential awe, I lifted up the veil and beheld there a plate of pure gold, on which were certain letters forming words, which I humbly conceived to be the Sacred V^ord itself. Having made this discovery, I re-veiled the pedestal and was again raised up out of the vaulted chamber by my companions, and (with their assistance) closed the entrance, we as in duty bound now make report to your Exc's. in Council. Being desired to communicate the word he had discovered, he refused, stating that according to Jewish law, it was not lawful for any one to pronounce the Sacred and Mysterious name of the Most High, excepting the High Priest, and then only once in the year, when he entered the H. of H. and stood before the Ark of the Covenant to make propidation for the sins of Israel.

A.^ in the bosom of the Holy Mount Moriah^ upon the very centre of the place wheron the Sanctum Sanctorum was afterwards erected. The Third ox Grand Royal Lodge was opened at Jeru- salem, A.L. 3469, after the return of the Israelites from the captivity in Babylon, under Zeruthabel the Prifice of the People and Governor of Judea, Haggai the Prophet^ and Joshua the son of Jozadak the High Priest. Then it was that the kingly power was restored in the person of Z. of the Royal House of David, and the Princely tribe of Judah ; nor was it again effaced until after the de- struction of Jeru\"^ -lem by the Romans under Titus, in the 70th year of the p. .ent era, thus verifying the prediction of the Patrip.rch Jacobs \" that the sceptre shall not depart from Judah i\\ox a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh comes.\" The three Principals represent Z. H. /., whose names they bear. The S. represent E. N.y the expounders of the Sacred Law ; and attendants on the Sanhedrim, by whose names they are also designated. And the three Sojourners represent those by whom the S * * * oi the Royal Arch were discovered and for which they were honored with a seat in that august assembly, composed of the Rulers and Princes of the people represented by the rest of the Companions. SYMBOLICAL LECTURE. The forms, symbols and ornaments of R. A. M., as well as the rites and ceremonies at present in use, were adopted by our predecessors at the building of the second T., and are continued by us to preserve in our minds the providential means by which the great discovery was effected, and also to impress upon our hearts those lessons of exalted mortality, which we as members of this S. D. are bound to practice. The form in which the Companions of every R. A. Chapter are arranged, approaches as near as circumstances will permit to that of a true Catenarian Arch, whereby we preserve a memorial of that vaulted shrine in which the S.W. was deposited ; for as the subordinate parts of every Catena- rian Arch nsXMrBWy gX2iv\\\\.2L\\.e towards the centre or Cope- stone, so are we taught to look up with reverence, and sub- mit with cheerfulness to every lawfully constituted anthority, whether Masonic or civil. The Copestones are represented by the three P's. of the Chapter. S7"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"In this decree we recognize six lights. Three greater and three lesser. The three lesser represent the Li§;hts of the Law and the Prophets, and by their rturnber allude to the Patriarchal, Mosaical and Prophetical Dispensations. The three greater represent the S, IV. itself. The three greater lights are placed in the form of an equilateral triangle, the three lesser intersecting the lines formed by the three greater, thus geometrically dividing the greater triangle into three lesser triangles on its extremities, which by their union form a fourth triangle on the centre, all of them equal and equilateral, emblematical of the four divisions ot Masonry, viz., E. A., F. C, M. M., R. A. This symbolical arrangement corresponds with the mysterious T or Triple Tau, which forms two right angles on each of the exterior lines, and two others by their union in the centre, for the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles. This illustratrates the Jewel which distinguishes the Companions. The Ribbon worn by the Companions is a sacred emblem, denoting light, being composed of its two principal colors, purple radiated with crimson, with which the veil of the Temple was also interwoven. The Ensigns which the C. bear on the staves were the distinguishing bearings of the twelve tribes of Israel. The four banners represent the standards of the four divisions of the army of Israel, and unitedly bear a device of an angelic nature, under the combined figures of a Man^ a Lion, an Ox and an Eai^le. A Man to represent integrity and understandings a Lion to personify strength and power, an Ox to denote patience and assiduity, and an Eagle to typify promptness and celerity. The bearings on the sceptres used by the Three Princi- pals denote the Regal, Prophetic and Sacerdotal offices, which are and ever ought to be conferred in a peculiar man- ner accompanied with the possession of certain S.

MYSTICAL LECTURE. The mystical knowledge of this S. D. comprehends the form and exi)lanation of the S., the nature and mport of the ineffable W. and the manner to be observ in sharing and communicating our secrets. There are * * * * j^ Royal Arch Masonry * * * * corresponding in number with the * * * * of fellowship, in which the M.M. is instructed, and as they have reference to our duties, toward each other, Svy do the * * * * of a Royal / ch Mason mark, in a peculiar manner, the relation w\\. >ear to the Almighty., as the frail creatures of the dust, offending against his most holy will and word, yet the adopted chiicf- ren of his mercy. The * * * * of Royal Arch Masonry are I. The * * * * marks our * * * * and reminds us of the fall of Adam, and the dreadful penalty entailed on all his posterity ; that the stiff neck of the disobedient shall be cut off from the land of the living by the judgment of God, even as * * * * by the sword of human justice, to avert which we are taught by the 2 * 5k * * to bend with resignation, beneath the chastening hand of the Almighty, and to engrave his law on our hearts. And Moses adopted this S. when the Lord appeared to him in the B.B. on Mount Horeb * * * * which was afterwards accounted to him for righteousness. This is also the S. of Salutation. 3. justly denotes the fervency of heart and mind, without which our prayers and oblations of praise would not be acceptable at a throne of grace. In this humble posture did Adam first * * * * before Al- mighty God to bless the Author of his being ; thus did he bend with contrite awe before the face of his offended Judge, to avert his wrath, and supplicate His mercy, and he has thereby transmitted this sacred form to his posterity forever. * 4. '^ '^ -~ * reminds us of the weakness of human nature, unable of itself to withstand the power of darkness, unless assisted by that power which is from above. There- fore we adopt the manner of our ancestors and the atoning •9"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"mrrsrr- Eriest of the Temple, by this outward form of contrition and umility. 5. * * * * admonishes us that we should throA' our- selves upon the mercy of our Creator and Jud^e, looking forward with holy confidence to his gracious promises, by which we hope to pass through the ark of our redemption into the presence of Him who is the Great I Aniy the Alpha and Oine^a^ the first and the last, the beginning and the ending. TRIANGLE WORK. The 7yianjr/(j was, in the days of Pythagoras, esuemed the most sacred of all emblems, and when any oath was re- quired, it was always administered thereon. This Supreme degree is the climax of Masonry, and is^ intimately blended with all our affairs, human and divine ; having virtue for its aim, the glory of God for its object, and the eternal welfare of man being considered in every point and letter of its ineffable mysteries. It is founded on the name of Jehovah^ who was from all eternity, is now, and shall be the same forever. The ceremony of closing a R. A. Chapter is very im- pressive, and should be remembered by every newly exalted Comp. It teaches them where the First or Holy Lodge ; Second or Sacred Lod^e, and the Third or Grand and Royal Lodge were held and who duly presided at each. It also puts them to the test of that peculiar method to be observed m sharing and communicating the secrets, &c. CLOSING PRAYER. O Almighty and everlasting God, whose servant David thus prophesied, \" Hlessed are they who fear the Lord and walk in his ways.'' — may we walk in Thy ways and follow in the paths of righteousness ; and, ever considering whose Representatives we are, may our hearts rejoice — may the Spirit of Peace guide us in all our ways, and raise our eyes to that holy and spiritual temple, where we shall praise and glorify Thee, O God of Israel, for ever more. Amf.n. In the name of Jehovah, the M. H. the Architect and Creator of heaven and earth, the R. A. Chapter is then closed. GENERAL CHARGE HY Z. Companions — We are about ^o quit this sacred retreat of friendship, and to mix with the outside world. Amidst all its care and employments, forget not the sacred duties that 60 -4"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"dv ^ have been so frequently inculcated, and so strongly lecom- mended within the precincts of this Chapter. Therefore be ye prudent, discreet and temperate, ever remembering that around this altar you have voluntarily and solemnly promised to befriend and relieve with unhesi- tating cordiality so far as may be within your power, every worthy brother who shall need your assistance ; that you have promised to remind him in the most gentle manner of his failings, to aid his reformation, to defend and vindicate his character whenever wrongfully traduced, and to suggest the most candid, palliating and favorable circumstances, even when he is justly liable to re{)rehension and blarr^e. Thus shall the world sea how dearly Masons love each other. But my brethren and companions, you are to extend those noble and generous sentiments still further. Let me impress upon your minds, and let it be instilled into your hearts, that every human being has an undoubted claim to your kind ofifices. We therefore strictly enjoin you to do good to all, while we more particularly recon;mend to vour care the househ' M of the faithful ; that by diligence and fidelity in the duties of your respective avocations, liberal benevolence and diffusive charity, constancy and sincerity in your friendship; and being kind, just, amiable and virtuous in your intercourse with your fellow creatures, you will demonstrate .0 the world the happy and beneficient effect of our ancient and honorable institution. Let it not be supposed that you have labored in vain, and spent your time for naught, fov your work is with the Lord, and your recomfjense is with your God. Finally, my Brethren and Companions, be ye all of one mind, live in peace, and may the God of love and peace de- light to dwell with you and bless you for evermore. 61"}]
