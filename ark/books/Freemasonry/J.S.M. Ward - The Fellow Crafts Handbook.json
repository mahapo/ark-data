[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE FC'S HANDB OO K by J.S.M. Ward PRE FACE Those who have read the first volume of this s eries, which deals with the E.A. Degree, will realize that our ceremonies have a deep inn er m eaning and teach profound spiritual lessons s eldom realized b y the average Mason. In the second volume we are dealing with the degree of Life, in its broadest sense, just as in the first degree we were dealing with the degree of birth, and as life in reality is educational for the Soul, we are not surprised to find that through out the whole degree the subject of education is more or less s tressed. We should, however, realize that each of the degrees builds on the one which has gone before, and the ingenuity with which the lessons inculcated in the first degree are carried forwa rd and d eveloped in the succeeding degrees is one of the most striking characteristics of our Masonic ritual. This is true not only of the obvious exoteric moral instruction conveyed in the ceremonies, but even more of the deep mystical and spiritual less ons which lie hidden beneath the surface. For example, in the first degree we perceived that the st....s which led the initiate to the Ped. when combined with that which we found thereon symbolically produced the Name of God, and in the second degree the m ain lesson is that the Brn. discover the name of God in the M. Ch., while the mann er of approaching the Ped. gives us the Divine name, written with the five letters which denote that the Creator has become Messias, the King. Thus among other lessons we lea rn that the second p erson of the Trinity comes forth from the first. When we come to the book which deals with the M.M. we shall perceive that t hat degree likewise builds on what has gone before. In the first few years of my Masonic c areer I utterly faile d to realize the tremendous importance of the second d egree, and used glibly to say that, while the first and third d egrees impressed me greatly, and had valuable lessons to impart, the second d isappointed me by its lack of depth and mystical teaching. Man y brethren h ave said p ractically the same thing to me, but I have come to the conclusion that those of us who think this are mistaken. The truth is that the real inn er teaching of the second d egree is less obvious than that of the first and third, but ever y whit as important, and until one has grasped its full significance one has no conception of the wonderful symm etry of our Craft rituals. In short, the interpretation of the second d egree form s the key to the full interpretation of the third. It is to im press this fact on my Brn. that I have written this book, and in particular have laid so much stress on the mann er of approaching the M. Ch., and the full Kabalistic meaning of the Name there discovered. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It must never be forgotten that while there are mea nings within meanings in the Craft ritual, all of which are important, the great lesson of our system is the Mystic Quest after God, and the journey of the Soul towards union with its Creator.

Chapter 3 The S ..... ts............................. Chapter4 Conclusion of the Ceremony ............... Chapter 5 The Tracing Board ........................ C hapter 6 Closing Ceremony ......................... INTROD UCTION By THE HO N. SIR JOH N A. COCKBURN In this little volume W. Bro. Ward justly emphasizes the importance of the 2 degree. In form er times it was no mere passing stage of a Mason's c areer. I n the Fellowship of the Craft lay the whole body of Masonry. An Apprentice was regarded as a brother but not as a member of the Lodge; while a Master Mason was merely, as we still state in the ritual, an experienced Craftsman selected to preside over the L odge in the capacity of Master. The ceremony of Admission to the Fellowship of the Craft has been abbreviated and shorn of some of its c haracteristic features; for example a \"Mark,\" which, placed on the stones wrought by a Craftsman, entitled him to his w ages, is now"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"no longer allotted to him. Nevertheless it is in the 2 d egree that the e ssential elements of the Craft are revealed. The degree is founded on that symbol which is the basis of Masonry, and is regarded as the test of rectangularity in the mater ial, as well as of rectitude in the moral, world. The candidate is now enlightened as to the meaning of the \"Hieroglyphic bright which n one but craftsmen ever saw.\" He learns that it represents the ineffable names of the G.G. as written in the four letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, to which attention was s pecially directed in the M. Ch.. It is as a craftsman that he becomes cognizant of the second P ...r placed at the porch way of the Temple and he is taught that stability can only be attained b y the significa nce of both p....... rs being conjoined. Herein is c ontained the Mystery not only of Masonry but of all the religions; viz., the Union of Heaven and Earth and the Mediation between God and man. As an Apprentice he has been taught to walk uprightly in the s ight of God: his mind has become imbued with moral Principles: he now has to address himself to the much more difficult task of applying these principles in his everyday relationship with h is fellows. The lesson of the J.W.'s plumb has now to be blended wi th that of the S.W.'s level. Spirit and Matter, theory and practice, with their inn umerable analogies, have to be reconciled in solving the problems which are constantly encountered in life. In the tables of the law one column contains the comm andments re lating to o ur duty to God, the other our duty to o ur fellow men. The Fatherhood of God involves as a corollary the Brotherhood of man. Therefore it is manifest that a stage in the progress of a Mason that lays s tress on applied religion demands close atten tion. Although on the surface the ceremony of passing may appear less attractive than that which precedes and that which follows it, a close study will convince the reader that the 2 d egree contains many lessons of priceless value which will well repay the labours of investigation. J.A.C. CHAPTER I PRE PARATION, P.W., AND O PENING CERE MONY The questions which are put to the C. are really a test of the lectures, which to - day, unfortunately, are hardly ever given in open Lodge. The system as c odified at t he beginn ing of the 19th Century was really a most efficient method of educating the c., and had b een carefully arranged so as to make sure that only when h e was properly prepared should he come forward to be passed to the second. degree. After having passed through the ceremony of initiation a summ ary of its main tenets, illustrated as it were on the blackboard, was given to him in the form of a lecture on the Tracing Board. The Tracing Boards were originally drawn in sand on the floor of the L., and theref ore correspond closely with the pictures and d iagrams used among primitive savages in the initiatory rites of a boy into manh ood. These primitive tracing boards are still drawn on the e arth by means of specially prepared and consecrated flour, and are an e ssential part of the ceremony. To - day the Masonic tracing board has degenerated into a somewhat crude painting on"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"canvas s tretched on a wooden frame, and its original purpose is therefore apt to be overlooked b y the C.. This is peculiarly so in the case of the first degree tracing board, since the lecture on it is v ery seldom given. In the second d egree, as will be shown later, the tracing board still plays a very important part, and we shall have occasion presently to consider it in full, but the conn ectio n of the tracing board with the questions must be grasped - hence this s hort preamble. Under the old system, at the next meeting of the L. the W.M. went through the lecture proper. He asked the S.W. a sort of catechism, which the latter had to answer. This w ould take well over an h our, or, in other words, as long as the ceremony of initiation. This c atechism gave the e xoteric meaning of most of the ceremony, together with a fair amount of traditional history of real interest. Undoubtedly much of it was allego rical, and although the bulk of it was 18th Century work, nevertheless it contained several very striking reminiscences of the Ancient Wisdom. For example, the question \" Whence come you ? \" A. - \" From the W.\" Q. - \"Whither directing y our feet?\". A. - \"To the E . in search of a M.\" Here we have something of deep symbolical meaning, and of peculiar significance in view of a slightly different, though cognate, phrase in a later degree. As, however, we are not attempting to interpret the meaning of these lectures i n this book, we must pass the matter by, with the hope that our r eaders will make a point of obtaining a copy of them (purchasable at any Masonic furnishers) and study them at their leisure. But t he point which must be realized is that, while the tracing board is a summ ary of the first degree lecture, the questions asked of a C. are on that lecture itself. In short, the C. has to pass an oral examination, and the last question, namely, \" These are the usual questions, I will put others, etc.,\" although to - day practically meaningless, had originally an excellent object. It indicated that the C., and also the other m embers of the L., had heard the full lecture and that the form er m ust be prepared to answer any question on it. In the North of England it is v e ry usual, in addition to these questions, to ask the C. to repeat the whole of his O., and if he is unable to do so his passing is deferred until he can. Turning to the questions themselves, it will be noticed that great stress is laid on the fact that th e C. must be properly prepared. It is probably little known to most brethren, but well worth bearing in mind, that the Ancient Kabalists had a secret interpretation of the Old Testament, and one of the keys was to read backwards the Proper Names c ontained in those books. Now, if the words dedicated to the first and second d egrees are read b ackwards, instead of the official interpretation given, they produce the phrase \" Being fortified b y the practice of every moral virtue, we are properly prepared.\" The si gnificance of this in relation to what has gone before, and also to what will follow, is s elf - evident. The inn er m eaning of the mann er of preparation h aving been given in the E.A. \u0000 s Handbook, it is unn ecessary to write further on the subject, but of cours e if any"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of our readers have not seen that book they should certainly g et it, as otherwise they will fail to understand the importance of these e arly questions. We now come to the question which is rigidly term ed a paradox. The explanation thereof, thoug h ingenious, is obviously somewhat Jesuitical. The truth of the matter is that in Operative days lodges were held at mid - day, and probably on a Saturday, which h as always been the time when the workmen receive their wages. The Speculatives, for their own c onvenience, changed the time to the e vening, a fact which was resented b y the old Operative members. In the first quarter of the 18th Century, at York, Operative Lodges c ontinued to meet at mid - day, while the Speculatives met in the e vening. To - day, with t he disappearance of the Operatives, a Bro. may well wonder why this untrue statement is s till l eft in the ritual. The fact that it is there warns the careful student that some deep symbolical meaning must be attached to the time. The full significance of the phrase is only revealed towards the e nd of a Brother \u0000 s s ymbolical career in the Craft, and a detailed d iscussion must therefore be postponed to another book, but it is perm issible to point out the following facts : - The sun is at its full strength at No on; in h is open pomp and glory; vested, as it were, with h is full regal powers. What more suitable time then for a solar cult to hold its meetings? And we must remember that Freemasonry is distinctly solar in its s ymbolism. Again, we were told that the J.W . marks the Sun at its meridian, and we have seen that this officer represents the body, hence our m eetings are held while the body is at its full strength, and in possession of all i ts faculties. Thus it is peculiarly significant that this question is put to the C. in the first degree, which degree deals with the \"Natural\" man. If the \"Natural\" man cann ot protect himself at high n oon against possible dangers, he is c ertainly helpless at any other hour of the day. We may therefore say that one meaning of th is phrase is that the c. enters Freemasonry at the time of his greatest strength and p hysical well being. That this is not a fanciful interpretation is proved b y the insistence that a C. must be perfect in all his parts. In the old d ays no man who was blin d, maimed, halt, etc., could b e made a Mason, and in S cotland a Master of a L. still has to take an Ob. not to admit such a man. The reasons for this are both practical and symbolical. As an Operative Society Masonry was like a modern benefit society and h ad to maintain sick Brn. and the widows of those who had d ied. It is obvious therefore, that they were justified in refusing to admit a man, not yet a Mason, who might easily become a burden to the society. Also, symbolically, every Mason is a sacrifice, a nd the Old Jewish regulations laid d own explicitly that the ram offered for sacrifice must be without blemish, and p erfect. These points must suffice for the moment, except that it is well to bear in mind that Christ was hung on the Cross at 12 noon, and o ur r eaders would b e well advised to ponder over that fact and correlate it with Masonic tradition. The next question and answer have misled many thoughtful Bm. as to the true meaning of Freemasonry. It should b e remembered that it is addressed to an E.A., who as yet has had hardly any indication what Masonry is anything else than a system of morality. The first degree, for the most part, aims at teaching its members s imply to be good men and true, and strictly to o bey the moral law, but subsequent degrees teach much more than this. Until a man h as grasped"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"these e lementary lessons it is not only useless, but dangerous, to try to develop his intellectual facilities, which is the main exoteric purpose of the second degree. For a Mason who has taken h is third d egree to give this answer as an explanation of what Freemasonry is s hows that he has failed to grasp the inn er meaning of even the second d egree, much less of the third. In short, this explanation by itself is only true when restricted to the first degree, for Freemasonry is much more than a mere system of morality, whilst even in the first degree the veil is v ery thin. The Grand P rinciples, in modern language, may be interpreted as true comr adeship, charity, and the search after truth, the latter phrase b eing better explained b y the term the Mystic Quest after God. The remaining questions are of a practical nature e xcept that the phrase P....... t P.s. of my E. is often somewhat of a mystery to the newly made Bro.. Two interpretations of this phrase are so metimes given. Firstly, that it refers to the S....p, which is a tau cross, and means that we will trample under foot our animal passions. This is the mann er in which we e nter the L. when once it is properly opened. But from the point of view of the C. it cann ot refer to this, for at his initiation h e did not know the S ... p, and so the other interpretation is the only one possible, namely, \" of, at and on.\" This is interpreted as meaning that the C. entered F.M. of his own f.w. and ac., at the door of the L., on the pt. of a S.I. . (See lecture). Having satisfactorily answered these questions the C. is led to the W.M., representing the Spirit or Wisdom, and receives from him a P.W., which will enable him to enter the L. when it has been raised to the highe r degree. We have already in our first book explained b riefly why P.Ws are necessary, but we will repeat our explanation for the convenience of any who have not yet read that book. They are a relic of old world magic. The C. goes out from a L. in the first degree and re - enters it in the second d egree. In h is absence the L. is raised b y a ceremony which, in the techn ical language of magic and the occult, \"raises the vibrations \" of those present to a higher key, and in consequence force is generated, Those who have studied such matters know that a body of men who are all concentrating on a particular subject do generate a peculiar, subtle, but powerful force, which h as not been actually defined b y science but is loosely called magnetic. In the old d ays of ph enomenal magic c ertain words, when uttered in the correct tone, were believed to be in consonance with this \"Power,\" like a tuning fork is to a violin. Therefore we give a P.W. to the C. to raise him quickly to the same \"Power,\" as the L.. Such P.W.s were usual in all great mystery rites, ancient or m odern, and it is therefore not surprising to find them in Masonry. It is worth n oting that the Ancients were right when they charged the so - called Moderns, in the 18th Century, with having altered the W.s and P .W.s. As a matter of fact they reversed them, and the W. now given to an E.A. was originally g iven to an F.C., and vice versa, and the same fate befell the P.W.s. Those foreign Gr. Lodges who derive from England b efore about 1745 (for example, the French a nd the Dutch), still have the W.s and P .W.s in the old order, and in S outh Africa E.A.s and F.C.s of the Dutch Lodges are for this reason forbidden to visit the English Lodges until they have been made M.M.s. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The interpretation of this P.W. will be given at a later point in the book; all we need d o now is to stress the fact that, as it is represented in our L. by C. and W., it is c learly associated with the J.W.. In the last book I pointed out that the J.W. represents in man, the body. This therefore indic ates that to the spiritually minded man the simplest necessities of life are plenty. All he requires, as the Buddha taught, is s ufficient to keep his body in h ealth, whereas luxuries c log the soul and retard its upward p rogress. I also pointed out in the last book that the J.W. represents God the Preserver, whose e mblems in India, Mexico, etc., are C. and W.. From the anthropological point of view, it is worth remembering that among primitive peoples God the Preserver is also the God of Vegetation and the Rain God. He Who makes the corn to grow and p rovides food for his worshippers. Thus we perceive that Freemasonry is perfectly logical in its use of this W.. Another fact of interest is that Quetzacoatl, the Mexican Preserver, wears E.s. of C. in h is hair w hen h e is wounded b y the giant of evil near to a F. of W., and at that very instant makes the S. of a F.C. . The C. then departs to be prepared, and in the interval the L. is raised to the second d egree. We will, however, consider the mann er of his prepar ation before going on to the raising of the L. This v aries in several details. Most English workings are the same, but the Scotch and Irish h ave certain variations which are worthy of mention. According to the Scotch rituals he brings into the L. a sq. sup ported in h is L.H., but, as with us, the I.G. presents the angle of a S. to his N.B., although to the Rt. B. instead of to the L.B. In the Irish Lodges the same B. is made b. as with us, but he is s till divested of all M.s as he was in the first degree, an d a C.T. is wound twice around his neck. Thus it will be noted that everything save the B. is reversed. The Scotch, more logical, reverse even this. In American rituals the Irish arrangement of the C.T. in the second degree is also found. The reason for th e deprivation of M \u0000 s in the Irish ritual is because, as with us, the P.W.s have been reversed. This has a deep symbolical meaning, and is logically correct, but I must defer the e xplanation to the next book. Reverting to the English method of preparation, we must realize that the R. side is the masculine side; it is also the stronger side. It therefore implies, firstly, that we symbolically have passed out of the control of the women of the household and have gone on, as it were, to school. In the first de gree we were symbolically \"Babes\" or children, under the care of women. In the second d egree we are youths s ent to be e ducated at school, and the whole e xoteric meaning of the second d egree is the training of the intelligence. This c orresponds to a boy \u0000 s t raining when h e goes to a public sc hool and is s urrounded entirely by men. At home, under his mother \u0000 s influence, he learnt only the simple lessons of morality; the lessons of the first degree. The second meaning, i.e. the stronger side, is s tressed in th e Scotch rituals, where the C. is afterwards told that he knelt on h is r.k. to take his ob. because the F.C. ob..... is even more binding than the E.A. \u0000 s ob. This latter fact is also accentuated b y the nature of the P., but this we will deal with later. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"T he C. is not H ..d, because clearly he is no longer in that state of absolute d.. .k.s which enshrouded him when h e first entered Masonry. He has s een the L..t, and can n ever again return to the same darkness, although h e may not as yet fully understand al l that t he Lt. means, and it is to teach h im the true nature of that Lt., which is really the Lt. of God, that he takes his s econd degree. In view of what has been written concerning the preparation in the first degree, no further explanation is necessary . THE OPENING O F THE SECOND D EGREE The W.M. asks the J.W., representing the body, whether he is a F.C., to which the J.W. replies that he is, indicating the test to be applied. Now, what does the Sq. mean in this c ase ? It is not, be it noted, the W.M. \u0000 s square or tau cross, but it is an emblem of rectitude of conduct. The right - angled square has always had this s ignificance, and in many an Egyptian papyrus the Gods, when sitting in judgment on a soul, are depicted as seated on squares, implying that the y are just judges. So the J.W. \u0000 s answer implies that he must be proved b y his moral conduct in the physical world. The F.C. degree indicates that the soul and b ody are now w orking in union, as is s hown by the knocks, although, as yet, the purely spiritual faculties have little influence. So it naturally follows that in this s tage of man \u0000 s development we have a right to expect that he will conform to all the moral laws, and to the higher dictates of his nature. For example, he should have a kindly and chari table disposition. lf he has these, he is a fellow craft, but as yet we must not look for great spiritual insight. It is through h is body that a man is able to perform the moral duties of his s tation. The S.W., or Soul, has little work to do at this s tage , for it is through the body that we prove ourselves, and so it is the J.W. who is bidden to satisfy himself that all present are F.C..... This being done, he confirm s their testimony in h is own person, and the fact that he literally is proved on the squar e must not be overlooked. It should b e noted that it is no longer the Creative Aspect of God Whom we call on, but the Preservative. He Who places limitations on us for our preservation, for, unless we conform to the rules of the Great Geometrician we cann ot hope to be preserved. It should b e remembered that by these ceremonies the Lodge has been raised to a higher plane of spirituality. Its s piritual and p sychic v ibrations are much higher, and to help the candidate to reach the same plane a P.W. has been given h im. CHAPTER II PRE LIMINARY STEPS"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" The Ty. gives the ks. of an E.A. for the Can., thereby emphasizing the fact that it is an E.A., a stranger to a F.C. L., who seeks admission. The I.G. should therefore say, \" There is an alarm ,\" as is done in most old p rovincial workings, instead of \"a report,\" a word suitable for ann ouncing that t here is a F.C. outside. Symbolically the difference between the ks. of an E.A. and an F.C. is most significant. The three separate ks. indicate that the body, soul and sp irit are all equal and at variance, whereas the one and two pence show that the two lower, namely, soul and b ody, are now united. This means that the soul of the F.C. dominates the body, and in view of the fact that spiritual progress while on earth is dep endent on this, the arrangement of the knocks is most important. The C., having been properly ann ounced, is admitted on the S., implying that he has been proved to be a man of rectitude and has therefore learnt thoroughly the lesson of the first degree, w hich is good morals. Throughout the whole of this degree stress is laid on the fact that only a man of good moral standing can be perm itted to extend his researches into the intellectual spheres. The other important point which is early impressed on the C . is the fact that God is c alled b y a new title. He is no longer spoken of as the G.A., but as the G.G. . We shall revert t o this point later, but even at t his early stage it is desirable to point out that the aspect of God emphasized in the first degree w as the creative aspect (Brahmna of the Hindus), this is most appropriate for a degree dealing with birth, both physical and spiritual. The second d egree deals with the preservative side of God; it is essentially the degree of life, which is educational for the soul. After invoking a blessing the C. is led round the L. with the sun and tested. Note, it is the body, or J.w., which n ow does the testing, but when C. is led round the second time, to show that he is properly prepared and in possession of the P.W . which will make him in tune with the rest of those present, it is the S.W., or Soul, which tests him. Moreover, the Soul first satisfies itself that the Body has done in work p roperly, therefore the C. advances with S . and Sn ., before giving the P.W. Ha ving satisfied himself on this point, the S.W. calls on the Divine Spirit, represented b y the W.M., f or help, but as in the form er degree, is told that it is the Soul that must instruct the C. to advance towards God. The Soul therefore tells the S.D., repr esenting intelligence, to instruct the C. how to advance. This method of advancing is exceedingly interesting, and worthy of detailed consideration. The F. Sp.s undoubtedly have reference to the five senses, which represent the physical man, whilst their spiral nature recalls the P. within a C. hinted at in the tracing board of the first degree, and reminds us that round it t he Brn. cann ot err. This c learly teaches us that we advance spiritually from within, by bringing under control all five senses and d i recting them towards that M.Ch. where dwells the Divine Spark, or God. As this s ubject will be treated at greater length when we come to the tracing board, we will merely point out that this mann er of approach brings"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the C. to the V.S.L., which is God \u0000 s re vealed word. It should also be compared with the mann er of approach in the first degree, which in the last book we saw disclosed the fact t hat t he God we sought was within us, while His triple nature, and likewise that of man, is s ubtly suggested. Here we are taught the same idea, but from a slightly different angle, and are reminded that we are approaching Him by means of our five Physical faculties. But as we arrive at the safe place we perceive He is the same God, although during our ob. we learn of anot her aspect of His nature. One other fact is worthy of our attention. Whereas in the first degree the C. was instructed to advance towards the P., in this he is told to advance to the E.. What is the reason for this difference? It will be remembered that i n the first degree he is H.W., and therefore unable to tell which is E. and which W.; by the time he reaches the second d egree not only can h e see, but his previous experience tells him exactly where it is he will take his ob.. Esoterically, in the first d egree he had no clear idea where to go for light, he was merely g roping blindly, although led b y a friendly hand: but in the second d egree, having learnt that the true light comes from the E., there is no reason why this phrase should not be e mployed. The position in which h e takes his Ob. again makes the three S.s, but t he instrument which h e has to hold, and the mann er in which h e holds it, produce two more, making five in all - corresponding to the five senses, this irrespective of the sixth on the A. or Ped. . To begin with, these five S.s indicate that all our senses must be dedicated to and ruled b y, the strictest moral conduct e.g., \"Speak no evil, see no evil\" etc, but when we recollect that in the first degree we got by means of the Sq.s a suggestion of the Divine Name, we shall not be surprised to find that here again the Divine Name is indicated, but with two profound d ifferences. Firstly, the Name is c omplete within ourselves, that is, without needing to utilize the Sq. and secondly, it is no longe r the four lettered Name of the Creator, Yod - He - Vau - He, but t he five lettered Name of the Preserver, Yod - He - Sh in - Vau - He, or Yeheshuhe, which we call Jesue or Jesus. As we learn from the Kabala, the Sh in h as descended to earth and b y combining with the othe r four letters has made the Divine Name masculine instead of feminine, for Sh in is masculine. Secondly, it is the name of the Messiah. Now it has already been pointed out that the mann er in which the Can. K.s, and also his preparation, emphasize the mascul ine aspect of this degree. Likewise the Name by which God is s poken of emphasizes His Preservative character, in contra - distinction to the first degree where He is spoken of in His Creative aspect and the feminine side is s tressed. Finally, the fact that t he whole Name is made by the man h imself must be considered in conjunction with what has been said about the mann er of advancing by the W.S. .c., and the M.Ch.. The Kabala teaches us that Messias is made flesh, and this implies more than the fact that on a certain h istoric occasion God b ecame manifest in a human body. It indicates rather that God is always being made manifest in every human being, and so the C., though h e knows it not, is a manifestation of God on earth. Thus in a sense he himself represent s the missing letter Sh in, and so, when our ancient Brn. entered the M.Ch. to receive their wages and saw the Mystic name Yod - He - Vau - He, they themselves"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"represented that fifth letter, which turned the name of the Creator into the name of the Preserver and Savior of mankind. Perhaps I should p oint out this is not strictly orthodox Christianity, but Kabalism, although its s imilarity to much that is taught to us as Christians is dear. Before leaving this s ubject I should like to remind any M.M.s who read this book of the mann er in which they approach the Ped. in the next degree, for if correlated with what has gone before, the full significance of that mann er of approach will be e vident to them. The Sq. on the Ped. indicates that there is s till another aspect of God about which as yet the Can, learns nothing, and its c ombination with the C. \u0000 s to make a lozenge should remind him that, though this degree is essentially, masculine, God the Preserver has also His feminine aspect. The variation in the position of on e of the points is explained at the time, but there is also a deeper m eaning. One symbolical meaning of the Sq. is the material world, and therefore the body of man. In the first degree the body is dominant and over - shadows the spiritual side of the Cand. \u0000 s nature. In this degree the body is dominated b y the soul, but as yet t he spirit has not gained control over the latter. The C....m. .. ses, representing the higher or m ore spiritual side of man, reveal this fact by disclosing one point only. The Ob. expl ains itself, and the Py. will be dealt with in the next chapter, as it can be more appropriately considered in conjunction with the Sn .s. As in the form er degree, the Can. is r. with the proper g., which is s ubsequently explained to him. CHAPTER III THE S........ TS As before, the Cand. is taught by making the tau cross to trample under foot his animal passions, thereby reminding him that spiritual progress always entails increased moral rectitude. The first difference the Cand. notes is that the Sn . is o f a threefold nature. This no doubt has a reference to the triple nature of man, but to the Cand. the most important fact is that whereas in the first degree the Sn . refers only to the Pen., in this degree two o ther lessons are taught him. The first part i s the Sn . of F., and implies not merely fidelity to his Ob., but obedience to the rules of the G.G.O.T.U. . We can only hope to be preserved if we conform to those rules laid d own by Him for our preservation. The second p art of the Sn ., or H....g Sn ., is s aid in our rituals to be the sign of P....y....r, or P....rs....e, but in its essence it is the sign of preservation, the sign associated with God the Preserver, under whatsoever name He is c alled, throughout t he world. In my form er book, \" Freemasonry and the Ancient Tools,\" I have adduced abundant evidence of this and here it is only necessary briefly to summ arize that evidence. In ancient Egypt it is associated with Horus; in India with Hanuman, the skilful craftsman who built the bridge of Rama, the sev enth incarnation of Vishn u, the Preserver. It was in this position that he brought the fruit of the tree of life to the dead and d ying in the battle which Rama waged against Ravena, the Demon King. In Mexico, Quetzcoatl makes this s ign when h e is wounded b y the e vil giant. The Roman College of Architects at Pompeii painted it in a fresco depicting the preservation of OEdipus. The"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"lineal descendants of the Roman Collegia, the Comacine Masons, in the 13th Century made a marble pulpit for the church of Ravello near Sorrento, not very far from the buried city of Pompeii. This pulpit t hey adorned with mosaics depicting Jonah coming up alive out of the whale \u0000 s mouth and as he does s o he makes this Sn . - H..g Sn . and Sn . of F. complete. Now w e are told that Jonah per severed in prayer for three days while he was in the belly of the whale, and was therefore preserved. Furtherm ore, we must recollect t hat t he e arly Christians, their m ediaeval successors, and even the modern clergymen, have always regarded Jonah as the pro totype of the Christ, for just as Jonah lay for three days in the belly of the whale and came forth alive, so Christ lay for three days in the tomb, and then rose from the dead. It is therefore not surprising to find that in England a 13th Century carving of the Holy Trinity at Peterborough depicts Christ making this Sn ., f or to us Christians Christ is the Preserver, since by His death we are saved. Thus it will be seen, firstly, that the Sn . is of great and genuine antiquity, and has been passed d own by a regular line of successors from the days of the Ancient Mysteries; and secondly, that it is clearly associated with God the Preserver and the idea of preservation. This fact emphatically shows that when we speak of the G.G.O.T.U. we are speaking of the Pre servative aspect of God. It is also worth n oting that except in London and those parts of England where the influence of London workings has s pread, the 1.a. is always held in a line with the shoulder, and not at right angles. In the ancient representation s of it both the London and the Provincial form s are shown - a fact of considerable interest. Among the various initiation rites of the savages, as, for example, among the Yaos, in Nyasaland, this Sn . is also used with the inn er m eaning of preservation, and two p........ rs form an integral part of their ceremonies. The P ... 1 Sn . is also o ld, for it is s hown on n umerous Egyptian frescoes and is referred to in the Book of the Dead. The significance of the Py. itself lies in the fact that among the ancient E gyptians the H..t was regarded as s ymbolizing the good and b ad in man. It was weighed at the judgment against the feather, the symbol of truth, and if a man \u0000 s life had b een evil the H... t and the Feather failed to balance and he was rejected. If therefore the H..t could not be produced, clearly the man was doomed to destruction. This point should b e compared with the T..e in the first degree, and just as in that degree the Thr. was indicated b ecause it is an important occult centre, so here the H..t is con sidered to have a similar significance. The part pressed in the G. has always been regarded b y palmists as masculine, just as in the previous degree it was feminine. The meaning of the W. will be revealed in the chapter dealing with the tracing board, fo r obvious reasons, and those e ntitled to know w ill recognize where it occurs. As before, the Cand. is instructed how to give and accept challenges and then is sent round the L. to be tested b y the officers, who represent the Body and Soul respectively. Th is part of the procedure having been adequately dealt with in our first book, need not detain us now, for those parts which are peculiar to the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"second d egree also arise in the tracing board. It is however worth n oting that the phrase about the house standi ng firm for ever is not found in any passage of Scripture. It suggests the e xistence of an ancient Masonic tradition, whose full history it is difficult to discover, but which is in closer analogy with certain phrases in the Book of the Dead associated wit h the Pillars, Tat and Tattu, which do convey the meaning thus indicated. It therefore looks as if we have here a genuine old tradition, now disguised under a Biblical form , but not derived d irect from the Bible. Once again the S.W., representing the Soul , calls on the Divine Spirit for some outward mark of his favour, and is told that he himself must invest with the distinguishing badge. To - day this badge has on it two rosettes, symbolizing the rose, and made of light blue. Light blue was the colour of Is is, and later became the colour of the Virgin Mary. The Rose is her emblem, and these two facts imply that all below the M \u0000 s. chair are regarded as passive or feminine, whereas only those who have actually ruled the Craft, and represented the Creative Spir it, are masculine. Thus on the P.M. \u0000 s apron we get the Tau Cross, instead of the rosette, an emblem of the masculine and creative power. The shape of our modern apron is undoubtedly of comparatively recent date. Our ancient Operative Brn. had large aprons, unadorned, and members of the different degrees were distinguished b y the mann er in which the apron was worn. Thus in the E.A. degree the triangular flap was worn with the point upward the triangle of course represents the spiritual, while the Sq. part of the apron represents the material. It was worn up to indicate that the spiritual had not yet entered into control of the material man. It was usually turned d own in the second d egree, but, to distinguish between the second and third d egrees, one or other of the corners was turned up. The apron was s uspended b y strings round the waist, and these are still used on the aprons of the first and second d egree, although in a M.M. \u0000 s apron these strings have been replaced b y a band of webbing. There are still apron s in the higher degrees however which are kept in place by cord and we shall consider the whole matter m ore fully when we come to discuss the M.M. \u0000 s apron, which is full of both h istorical and symbolical interest. CHAPTER IV CONC LUSION OF THE CERE MONY Wh en the S.W. has c ompleted his task of investing the new F.C., the W.M. further points out that the purpose of the degree is to indicate that a Bro. must polish h is mind b y a study of the liberal arts and sciences. This reminds us that whereas the E.A. is l ikened to the rough ashlar, which rests on the J.W. \u0000 s ped., the F.C. is likened to the perfect ashlar of the S.W.. The two ashlars are respectively therefore associated with the J.W. as representing the body, and the S.W. as representing the soul. Thus onc e again we are reminded that although the E.A., as indicated b y the knocks, has not yet subordinated the body to the Soul, the F.C. degree teaches the important lesson that the soul must dominate the body, and that the intellectual faculties must be e ducat ed so that t he F.C. may the better discharge his duties to his fellow - men, and appreciate the wonderful works of the Almighty. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"In the few operative lodges which still survive the indenture papers of the E.A. are, of course, torn up on h is being made a F.C .. Another important incident which takes place there is his form al testing to prove that he is a \" square \" man. This is done by passing a four - sided square, the four arm s of which are extended, over his head and d own to his feet, whilst to see that he is straight a five foot board, called the \" straight edge,\" is placed against the front of his body. The principal interest to us Speculatives of this peculiarly shaped square is that by means of it half the secret Masonic c ypher was produced. The rest of th e cypher was made up out of the St. Andrew \u0000 s c ross, used in the sixth degree of the operatives. After this brief admonition the Cand. is placed at the S.E. corner of the L. and instructed to stand in a position which form s a Lewis, as in the form er degree . (See E.A. \u0000 s Handbook). Having explained the reason for this, which symbolically denotes that he is an adept, but not yet a master, the W.M. closes his brief peroration with the peculiar phrase \" That as in the previous degree you made yourself acquainted with the principles of moral truth and virtue, you are now perm itted to extend your r esearches into the hidden mysteries of nature and science.\" Now this is a very pregnant phrase and often puzzles the Brn.. Only a few minutes before the new F. C. is told by the W. M. that he is expected to do this. Now he is told that he is perm itted to do it. So puzzling is this to many Brn., that in one London ritual at least, the word p erm itted has been changed to the word expected. This c hange, however, in my opinion, is a grave mistake, for the word p erm itted is there for a very special reason. In the Ancient Mysteries it was believed that the masters of the higher grades held certain important secrets of nature, or, in plain English, had certain occult powers, such a s s econd sight, hypnotism, and p ower to heal, and therefore, naturally, its reverse, the power to make men ill. To this day in India the higher Yogis claim the same powers. They claim also the power to comm unicate with beings not of this world. Now the anc ient Masters of Wisdom declared that if these powers were obtained b y a man of low moral character, on the one hand his very life might be e ndangered, by his attempting to get into touch with possibly hostile spiritual forces, while on the other, he might use these powers for evil, and so become a danger to the comm unity. Therefore, only those who had given unmistakable proof, through many y ears, that t hey were men of the most exalted moral character, were perm itted to o btain that degree which entitled them to extend their r esearches into the hidden mysteries of occult science. Whether or not we to - day believe in such powers is a matter of personal opinion, although the hypnotic power is generally acknowledged b y men of science. But even if we restrict the m eaning of the phrase to modern scientific knowledge, we shall perceive that there is here a most important lesson. Every thinking man who has lived through the great war m ust realize that during it science has been used for the vilest, as well as for the best, purpose. Poison gas and the aero plane which drops bombs on defenseless women and children are but two o f many examples which makes us realize the dangers which threaten the human race if the hidden secrets of nature and science are discovered and us ed for evil purposes. Indeed, it is not too much to say that if we continue to make further scientific discoveries, and use them irrespective of our duties to o ur fellow men, we may utterly destroy civilization. Therefore this"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"word \"perm itted\" conveys a mo st profound message. It warns us that knowledge without morality may be a curse, and not a blessing. Thus we can see that the ancient Masters of Wisdom were wise in their generation when they refused to perm it a man to delve into the hidden mysteries of na ture and science until he had given proofs that his morality was s uch that he could b e safely entrusted with those secrets. And so this little word p erm itted is one of the most important in the whole ceremony, and in n o way conflicts with the e arlier phras e that the Can. is expected. He is expected to study these secrets, and is told why: it is because he has made himself acquainted with the principles of moral truth and virtue in the form er degree, and it is assumed that being acquainted with them, and hav ing passed the tests which qualify him for admission into the second d egree, he will i n the future act up to these principles. The e xplanation of the working tools is 18th century work, apparently, and requires no further explanation, whether we take the short form usually g iven in Emulation working, or the longer explanation sometimes given in some of the Lodges. Perhaps, however, the word enthusiast used in this c onn ection n eeds a little e xplanation. It meant in the 18th century language, a \" bigot \" or an extremist, just as the words zeal and zealot did. In the course of years the e xact meaning of many words in the English language alters, and some acquire a sinister m eaning, while others become more kindly. To - day, the words \" enthusiast \" and \" zealot \" are generally used in comm endation, whereas in the 18th century they were phrases of censure. THE CHARGE The charge after passing is not given in Emulation working, but as it occurs in some other workings it is deserving of a short mention. For the mos t part it is ordinary 18th century work, without any very deep meaning, but we may point out that a craftsman is told p lainly that though h e may offer his opinion on such subjects as are introduced into the lecture - i.e., the lecture of the second degree, \" now seldom given - he must only do so under the superintendence of an experienced master. In brief, he is not yet a fully qualified Freemason. The other important point in the charge is the e mphasis laid on the necessity for studying g eometry. In operative days a sound k nowledge of geometry was important in the laying out of the ground p lans, and a careful study of the ground p lans of Glastonbury, and other great mediaeval churches, shows not only that geometry was of practical use, but that the main axial l ines of the building were so drawn as to produce various geometrical figures of a symbolical nature. Many of these were of a most complex kind, and would require e laborate drawings to explain their m eaning, we will therefore only mention the constant use o f the e quilateral triangle - the e mblem of the Trinity - its duplication to form the lozenge, the circle, and the e llipse, or the Vesica Piscis. In general, Geometry symbolizes the laws of the G.G.O.T.U., more e specially those to be found in n ature and scienc e. Laws, be it remembered, which cann ot"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"be violated without jeopardizing our m oral and spiritual well - being, thus endangering our preservation, (or which purpose they exist. CHAPTER V THE TRACING BOARD The main teaching of the second d egree is c ontained in the picture of the tracing board, and with regard to at any rate some of the incidents and facts an allegorical meaning is evident. The first important architectural feature mentioned is a pair of columns, stated to have been set up at the porch way o r entrance of the Temple. These pillars seem always to have had a peculiar fascination for our Masonic ancestors, and even in the e arly days of the Comacines we find them setting up B. and J. in the porch of the mediaeval church at Wurzburg, but their symb olical history runs back very much further even than the days of King Solomon \u0000 s Temple. The two p..rs Tat and Tattu are found in the e arly papyri of the Book of the Dead in Egypt, and appear to have had the meaning of \"in s.\" and \" to e. firm ly,\" but even in the primitive initiation rites of the Yaos, in Nyasaland, the boys, after various adventures, have to pass between two p....rs. The original meaning of these p...rs was undoubtedly phallic, and in rites dealing with whence we come are obviously appropri ate. The use of the word s. in a ceremony which, like these Yao rites, aims at increasing the procreative powers of the members of the tribe by a magical ritual, is obvious, but at a later date more e thical meanings were naturally g rafted on to the basic o ne. That t his original idea was not forgotten when the twin columns were set up b y King Solomon is c lear from the description of the chapters. The net work, denoting union, combined with the my work, denoting virginity, and the subsequent references to the pomegranates with their abundant seeds, convey the same lesson, as do certain other adornments of the columns, but already other m ore e volved ideas had been grafted on to the age - old symbols. Thus, the fact that they were form ed hollow in order to serve a s archives for Freemasonry, for therein were deposited, etc., seems to refer to the doctrine of re - incarnation. The constitutional rolls in this c ase are the e ffect of his past lives which are already latent in the child. At any rate it is c lear that there must be an allegory here, for if intended to be accepted literally the statement is absurd. No sensible person would really put the constitutional rolls inside a hollow p........ r, they would b e placed in the monuments room of the Temple. The reverence p aid to p...... rs or to monolithic s tones is well known to every anthropologist and undoubtedly was Phallic in origin. In the Bible, for example we find constant denunciations by the prophets against the worship of stocks and stones; the stock b eing a pilla r of wood corresponding to the stone monolith, to which the worshippers were in the habit of addressing prayers containing the phrase \"Thou hast begotten me.\" The use of the two p....... rs also reminds us of the gateway of birth through which we e nter phy sical li fe, and so by analogy we get the idea that we must"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"enter the mystical temple of Divine Life between similar p...rs. From such ideas would naturally evolve the suggestion that of the two p ....rs one was black, the other white; one of fire, the othe r of cloud. Thus we get the opposition between light and d arkness, day and night, good and evil, male and female. Moreover, we do know that in many of the ancient mysteries, and in the savage initiation rites of a boy into manh ood, it was v ery usual for th e Cand. to be obliged to pass between two p..... rs. The opposition between light and d arkness is also taught by the checkered pavement of our lodge. This pavement is a symbol used in many religions, and the Persian poet Omar Khayyam writes as follows: - \" Life is a checker board of nights and d ays, Where Destiny with men for pieces plays, Hither and thither m oves and mates and slays, And one by one back in the closet lays.\" Certainly this is one of the meanings of the mosaic pavement, although in additio n, as Sir John Cockburn h as pointed out, the word \"mosaic\" may be conn ected with the same root as the word Moses, which means, \"Saved from the flood.\" If this be so, the checkered p avement would b e derived from the mosaic effect produced b y the receding fl ood of the Nile as it left the land on either side dry after the floods. Let us now consider the names given to these two p... rs by the Jews. If we turn to the Hebrew w ords themselves we shall find that they had a secret inn er m eaning among the Kabalists. These Jewish sages had a special and secret interpretation of the Old Testament, and one part of this s ecret was to read certain significant names backwards. If this be done in the case of the two words under consideration we find that their conjoint and full signification is, Being fortified b y the practice of every moral virtue we are now properly prepared to undergo that last and greatest trail. The official interpretation given is not without significance as far as the first word is c oncerned, for God said that He would establish the House of David for ever, but while we can perceive the importance of the ancestor of K.S. what of the Assistant H.P.? Firstly, it must be recognized that t he first column was considered to be the Royal column and the other the Priestly, and the explanation may refer to this. In that case we obtain a declaration as to the necessity for Church and State as the foundation for civilization. It is interesting, however, to note that those who look for a Christian interpretation o f our r ituals are able to point out t hat whole the first name refers to the founder of the House of Jesse, the other name is that of the last male ancestor of Christ, namely the husband of St. Ann e and the Father of the Virgin Mary. Thus the names of these two p...rs represent the beginn ing and the e nd of the House of Jesse, from whom was drawn the body of the Savior of Mankind. As there is a school of symbolists who consider that the whole of the Craft degrees c an be interpreted in the Christian sense, th ese facts c ann ot be ignored. If their interpretation is c orrect t he apparently casual reference to H.A.B., the son of a W., takes on a new significance in association with these"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"p...rs. In any case, in h is progress through masonry this is the first mention that the Cand. hears of the famous Architect. H.A.B. is regarded as a prototype of the Great Master, and there does c ertainly seem to be a striking similarity between the chief incidents in the lives of both of them. But t his fact will become more e vident when the F.C. has taken h is M.M. degree. Before leaving the subject of these two p...rs it is of interest to point out that p...rs are regarded as emblems of stability among many races, and on a \"chop,\" or certificate, used b y one of the great Chinese se cret societies the character KE H, meaning a p...r, is used, which among them has the further m eaning of Stability. Sir John Cockburn recently pointed to a most pregnant fact. It is well - known that in the course of oral transmission foreign words become so corrupt in form that there comes a time when they cease to be intelligible, and in consequence attempts are made to replace them by a word whose meaning is known, and whose shape is s imilar to that of the corrupt word. Many Masonic s tudents suspect that t his has occurred in our ceremonies, and Sir John suggested that the Greek words Iacchus and Boue were the original names attached to these p...rs. Iacchus or Bacchus was the God of Youth and of the procreative powers, Who in some of the Grecian Mysteries w as s lain and rose again, while Boue means the primeval chaos, the dark womb of time, and so the womb. This interpretation cann ot be rejected lightly. Firstly, the appropriateness of such words to these two degrees is s elf - evident, but even more striking i s the fact that the Supreme Council 33 d egree of France gives to its members an esoteric interpretation of all the important words used in Freemasonry, and it interprets J. as the phallus, and B. as the womb. Spiritually interpreted this would mean that th e God of Life and Light, Iacchus, descended into the womb of chaos and b rought forth Life. The tracing board having at considerable length, and in great detail, described these p...rs, goes on to give a certain amount of inform ation about the men who actu ally built the Temple, and a very clear distinction is drawn between the reward received for their labours by E.A.s and that received b y F.C. \u0000 s. The E.A. \u0000 s, representing those who as yet are not very spiritually evolved, obtained merely simple maintenance, whereas it is s pecifically stated that the F.C. \u0000 s were paid their wages in specie, which, however, they could only receive in the Mid. Ch.. In other words, their wages were of a spiritual nature, suitable to their more e volved spirituality, and that this was s o is proved b y the fact that they received them in the Mid. Ch., which is an allegory for the secret chamber of the Heart, where dwells the Divine Spark. In all mystical l anguage, and all descriptions of mystical experience, this hidden chamber of the Heart is s poken of as the place where dwells God in man. It is in reality a state of mystical experience, where the soul realizes, and for a brief moment of time becomes one with, the Divine Source of all. That this is s o intended is c learly indicated b y the statement that when our ancient Brn. entered the Md. Ch. their attention was peculiarly directed to certain Hebrew characters, usually depicted in our Lodges by the letter G., denoting God, the G.G.O.T.U.. Now the Hebrew characters stood for Yod - He - Vau - He, or Jehovah, the G.A.O.T.U., but since, as has already"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"been explained, each F.C. in h imself stands for Sh in, in combination with himself he finds in the Mid. Ch. the name of the Messiah, Yeheshue, (Jesus) Who is the G.G.O.T.U., or God made Flesh, Who d wells among us. Bearing this fact in mind we shall the better understand the ceremony of closing, wherein the J.W., representing the Body, declares that in this degree they have discovered a S.S., representing God. The fact that it is the J.W. who makes th is ann ouncement, and not the S.W., is explained b y the correct interpretation of the W.St. c .. se. This St..c..se is our own body, as we shall explain later. The ancient Brn. were not perm itted to ascend this St...c...se until they had satisfied the J.W. that they were truly F.C.s, but he did not ask of them the F.C. \u0000 s W. as one might expect, but the P.W. leading to that degree. This is of course right, for he deals with the simple necessities of life, which the E.A. receives, and which to the truly spiri tual man, such as the F.C. claims to be, are plenty, whereas the true W., with its priestly meaning, belongs to the S.W. or Soul. The J.W. has no part or lot in that, but it is his task to see that the Body is in good condition, for a diseased b ody may eas ily hamper the Soul in its progress. Masonry deprecates those foolish ascetics who torture and ill - treat the body, as much as it does gross and luxurious livers, who o ver indulge the physical and thus hinder the soul \u0000 s advance. The e xplanation of the orig in of the W., although taken from the Bible, no doubt has an inn er m eaning. In one version we are told that Japheth, like Joseph, and b efore him Ishmael, was rejected b y his relations and went out from his father \u0000 s house to a strange country. When, however , Gil ead was threatened b y the Amm onites and sent a deputation to him begging him to come to their help and organize arm ed resistance, he forgave the unkindness he had suffered and saved his native city. Thus we can see that, like One who came after him, h e was \" The stone which the Builders rejected,\" which became the headstone of the corner. So here again we get a reference to the Savior of men and to Preservation. The W. St....c..se with its three, five, seven or m ore steps, must have puzzled many thoug htful Brn., who have no doubt wondered why it was that those who codified our r ituals c ould not make up their m inds c oncerning the e xact number of steps the St..c...se had. This v ery fact warns us that it is an allegory, for the thing disguised under this name can be considered to consist of three parts, five parts, seven parts, and p ossibly more. The three who rule a Lodge represent the Body, Soul, and Spirit which constitute Man. The five who form a Lodge are the five senses of the physical man. But the p hysical man h as both soul and spirit, each of which h as its own peculiar sense, the Soul having psychic faculties, and the Spirit mystical and inspirational. As the Bible indicates in the past there have been men who had second sight, and p rophets who spok e by Divine inspiration. Although while on earth the ordinary man only functions through the five physical senses, those who are approaching perfection, such as the great Masters and religious teachers of the world, function through all seven. The referenc e to the five noble orders of architecture is c ertainly an 18th century addition, for our m ediaeval Brn. cared nothing about t hem, while the reference to the seven liberal arts and sciences is probably a post - reference gloss. They are good enough for an ex oteric"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"interpretation, but obviously disguise something more profound. The five noble orders of architecture when applied to the Temple of K.S., are, of course, an absurd anachronism. Perhaps at this point one should explain that the Temple at Jerusalem, m asonically, is an allegory for the Temple of Humanity raised to the glory of God, or, to use a Christian simile, the Church of Christ on earth, into whose fabric every true mason is built, dedicating his body and soul as a perfect ashlar in its c onstructio n. This W. St....c..se spiraled round a central column, so that when the Brn. reached the top they had advanced neither to the East nor to the West, but were still revolving around the centre. To an Eastern Bro. this W.St c..se will certainly recall the la dder of re - incarnation, by the gradual ascent of which the Soul in time returns to God, from Whom it came, traveling upwards in a spiral. But to the Western mind this St..c..se is our own body, subdued, brought under control, and d edicated to the glory of God. This done we receive our wages, which are knowledge of God in that hidden chamber which is within us. No other m an and no external organization can really g ive us knowledge of God, that is an experience which each must discover for himself, and in h i mself, as every mystic has taught, no matter to what external religion h e conform ed. Mysticism is not an organized religion, in rivalry with any of the e stablished faiths, but is the real truth enshrined in every religion, and the force which gives that re ligion vitality. Therefore it is that we find among Mahomm edans, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and Christians, men who while they often employ different symbols, use them to describe precisely the same spiritual experiences. Finally, let us note that the last guardian who has to be passed is the Soul, which itself passes the man who is a true F.C. into that hidden Ch.. When h e has thus proved himself a true priest in the spiritual sense, the Soul enables him to discover the God Who is within h im, and that this Divine Spark is ever linked to the Source of All. It should b e clearly understood, however, that this discovery of God within ourselves is not the e nd of the Mystic Quest, for the evolving Soul has other experiences to go through, some of a most painful sp iritual nature, before he achieves final and complete union with the Source of his being. But until he has had this first experience, this first realization of the Divine Spark within h im, he cann ot start on the real quest; for he is not yet properly prepa red. He may, and will, come out from that secret Ch. again and again, to take his part in the ordinary life of the world, but having once glimpsed the splendor of the Divine he will realize the glorious heritage to which he is the heir and will not be cont ent until he has c ompleted his journey. Nevertheless, it may truly be said that these occasional experiences, brief and passing though they be, are the just reward of his labours. This then is the great lesson of the second d egree, that by ourselves, and i n ourselves, we can discover and realize God, more e specially in His Preservative aspect. This discovery means more than an acquiescence in the statement of others that there is s uch a Being as God, it is the realization by oneself of this s tupendous fact, a thing almost impossible to describe in words except to those who have experienced it, while to them it needs no description. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" CHAPTER VI CLOSING CERE MONY As in the first degree, the Spirit tells on the Body and Soul to show that they are on guard against t his world. The Spirit t hen asks the body what it has discovered now that it has c onform ed to the laws of rectitude, as a true F.C., and the Body replies that it has discovered a S....d S....1. This S...d S...1, of course, is that same letter G me ntioned in the tracing board, which corresponds with the Hebrew characters for the Name of God. As we have already explained the full significance of these four letters we will not now discuss them further, but a few brief lines dealing with the valuable s uggestion of Sir John Cockburn, that the letter G was originally depicted in the mediaeval lodge by a sq., calls for some consideration. Sir John h as pointed out on many occasions that the sq., more particularly the gallows s q., was always regarded with ve ry g reat veneration by the Masons, because not only was it an important working tool, with a symbolical meaning attached to it, but it was also the shape of the gamm a, or G., in the Greek alphabet, as well as in the e cclesiastical script used in mediaeval Europe. Thus the letter G and the gallows s q. were the same shape, and stood alike for God and His great characteristic, \"Justice.\" Indeed, in mediaeval paintings the sq. is often found embroidered on the vestments of the disciples, and when depicted separ ately these are called \"gamm adias,\" that is \"gamm as,\" but when combined to form the Swastika it is c alled the \"gamm adion.\" As Sir John points out, references to this identification of the sq. and the G. are found in several old rituals. For example: - Q. - W hy did you get to be made an F.C.? A. - On account of the letter G. - Also an old Masonic legend found in one of these rituals, describing a murderous assault made on one of the chief overseers of the work b y some of the workman, relates that one of the wr etches s truck the overseer a blow over the heart with a sq.. When the victim was s ubsequently discovered those who found him noticed a faint t race of the letter G on h is breast, and they understood it as s ymbolizing the whole - hearted d evotion which the vic tim had always displayed towards God, the G.G.O.T.U. Another interesting point about the sq. is that if four r ight angles are joined together with the angles inward, an equal - arm ed cross, or cross of the cardinal points, is form ed. This c ross, of course, has many inn er m eanings, but one at least is that it represents the e arth and matter, just as does the four - sided sq., which also can be form ed out of four gallows s q..s. Finally the Swastika which later symbolized the sun, is also composed of four right a ngles; hence the vital fluid p erm eating matter m akes of it a living soul. In this last aspect t he Swastika becomes an emblem for God Himself, and thus the sq. in itself"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"represents not only God b ut also the universe, which He preserves by His Divine Spirit. So it will be seen that the S....d S...1 which the F.C. \u0000 s declare that they have discovered is of far greater significance than most brn. would suspect; in fact, in these few brief words of the closing ceremony we obtain a summ ary of the whole purpose of the degree, and realize why, throughout the whole of it, the sq. is emphasized. Nor m ust we forget that when h e ann ounces this discovery the J.W. stands in the correct position to indicate that he represents that fifth letter, the missing \" sh,\" which cha nges the name of the Creator into that of the Preserver - Yeheshue. Moreover, he declares the S...d S...1 is s ituated in the C...e of the building. Bearing in mind that in the tracing board we were told that our ancient brn. discovered this s ymbol in the M.. .e Ch., we shall perceive that the Lodge itself is now the Ch., into which the Cand. has ascended b y the W...g S...c...e of the f.... St...s which led him to the E. The fact that it is in the C...e reminds us of that hidden centre in every man, where resid es the Divine Spark, and b rings to o ur recollection the statement in the first tracing board that there is a point within a circle around which the Brn. cann ot err. In lodge in the Provinces which h ave their own Temples, it is usual to see depicted on the roof a pentacle, in the middle of which can be seen the letter G. In this c ase the pentacle represents man with h is five senses, with the G at the center to remind us of the Divine Spark within. On the floor directly underneath is inlaid in brass a point within a circle, which circle is bounded on the north and south side by two grand p arallel li nes, usually described as the two St. John s, but stated in our r itual to represent Moses and K.S.. They also undoubtedly symbolize many other things, e.g., the two pillars of night and d ay, good and evil, male and female, etc. The point I wish to stress, however, is that the brass point at the c. of the c. is directly underneath the G i n the pentacle on the roof, thus emphasizing the interpretation we have been stud ying. It is a thousand p ities that in most of our London Lodges both these e ssential ornaments of the Lodge are omitted from the decorations, as by so doing their intimate conn ection is apt to be overlooked b y the brn., and even the words of the ritual bec ome untrue. Thus the F.C. degree teaches us that we only begin to recognize the God within us when we have lived a good life. There is also, probably, a reference to the word \"Generation,\" which is naturally associated with the life of the fully developed man. The meaning of this is that the power of begetting is a Godlike gift, for it creates physical li fe, and we must use it with respect and for the noblest ends. It is only when we are masters of our passions in this respect that we are fitted for the las t and greatest trial.\" It is noteworthy that it is the J.W., representing the Body, who plays the most important part in the closing of this degree, which is, of course, appropriate, as we have been dealing throughout with the body and its five senses. Th is phase is c arried through to the very end, as is s hown in the curious doggerel li nes with which the J.W. perform s the last act of closing. As given in Emulation they are only three, but in the Provinces they are four, and form a curious jingling rhyme, w hich runs as follows: -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Happy have we met, Happy have we been, Happy may we part, And happy meet again. Personally I prefer this v ersion to that in Emulation which, f or some unaccountable reason, omits the second line, although it is quite as important as the first or third. Clearly the Brn. might be happy to part because they had been unh appy during the ceremony! The inn er significance of the lines, however, is that the body bears testimony that earthly happiness c an only be found b y those who know God. The closing prayer by the W.M. contains one important reference, which seems to be an ancient landmark carried d own in our ritual from a long distant past, viz., the All - seeing Eye. This Sacred Eye was a divine e mblem and an important talisman among the an cient Egyptians, even as it still i s among the Chinese, who paint it on the bows of their ships to protect them and p reserve them from misfortune. It is essentially an emblem of God the Preserver, and its inclusion in the closing prayer of the second d egre e indicates how carefully the preservative aspect of God is s tressed, from the beginn ing to the very end of the ceremony. This c oncludes all that it is possible to deal with in this little book concerning the second d egree, but t hose whose interest has be en aroused will be well advised to do two things ; firstly to study the ritual itself, in order to discover additional inn er m eanings, which do exist, although they have not been dealt with h ere lest we should b efog our newly passed Brn.; and secondly, stu dy the lectures on this degree, which contain a great deal of interesting inform ation, much of it with an inn er m eaning seldom appreciated b y those who have only read them through h astily. Finally we would add that in the M.M. \u0000 s Handbook will be found an e xplanation of several points which we have had to o mit in this book, but which show how carefully each of our degrees is linked up with the one that follows, and how to the attentive student they g radually unfold many important and illuminating truths. •"}]
