It is his belief, nevertheless, that many younger men now coming into the Lodges want more rational and scientific answers that will enable them to understand Masonry better. They are not content to bypass or ignore what seems difficult to understand. Since it probably cannot be expected that they will devote a great deal of time in pursuit of these answers, a brief glimpse into the meanings or possible interpretations of some of the expressions found in the Ritual of the first three degrees may serve to stimulate them to read and perhaps to study the books that contain more complete answers and throw further light upon the so-called “Mysteries of Ancient Free- masonry.” Of course, he would be naiIve indeed who would declare that what Masonry meant to him it would necessarily mean to every other Mason. The author does not know it all, or any- where near the all of Masonry; his book might well be called Wha;t Masonry Means to Me. He simply hopes that publication of what Masonry does mean to him will help more Masons to take a long look at Masonry and to want consciously to relate its teachings to their own lives and living. After more than half a century of studying and thinking in the fields of philosophy, religion, and ethics, and after some forty-five years of Masonic endeavor, the author believes that he has caught some of the meanings and purposes of life and the processes of the Builder, and that his conclusions, though still tentative, should have some value to the Craft. However, he"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"10 ‘IT33 MEANING OF MASONRY claims to possess no “authority” because of such studies; if he is right in his conclusions, they are completely valid to him alone. The reader should neither believe nor disbelieve, agree nor disagree with, these conclusions which comprise his personal philosophy and which he hopes (perhaps foolishly and egotis- tically) may be of sufficient interest to the Craft to warrant publication. If the book should stimulate some Freemasons of all Rites to take a deeper look at Masonry as the Science of the Builder, they will develop their own authority and their own philosophy of the processes and techniques of the Builder. But it is not sufficient either to believe or to disbelieve, to agree or to disagree. The reader who simply disbelieves or dis- agrees without investigation may think he washes his hands of responsibility to know the fullness of Masonic Truth; and what he does not try to le’arn, he will never know. On the other hand, the reader who believes or agrees because he has no convictions of his own will stop the processes of thought and investigation and will stagnate mentally and spiritually. Read not to agree or disagree but to search for Truth, as far as you as an individual can ascertain it. Today’s conclusions and convictions are based upon knowledge gained yesterday by individual effort, and the enlightenment and unfolding of tomorrow will be based upon the mental and spiritual progress of each today as it comes. Each man and Mason continues to build his own philosophy and is his own best authority. The writer will reveal no secrets-because he can reveal no secrets! How can anyone reveal a secret to someone who has not tuned his mind to perceive it as Truth? If and when the Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry are revealed to any man or Mason, they will be because he has prepared himself to re- ceive them, not because someone else has tried to show and teach him the way to Masonic light.

The hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry are not revealed to the initiate in the degrees of Speculative Masonry merely because he hears them alluded to in the ritualistic work of the Lodge. If the philosophy of Masonry is to be understood, if the arts of the Builder are to be applied in erecting a spiritual edifice, the aspirant will need to search out the meanings and learn the definitions of the words, phrases, and sentences that comprise or describe the signs, symbols, glyphs, enigmas, and allegories of the Ritual. Inasmuch as there are no explanations or interpretations in the Ritual itself, the search for the truths of the Builder, for the revelation of the so-called “secrets of Masonry,” will lead the seeker to s:;ldy the great volume of literature that is available in the library of e\\ Y rv Grand Lodge in the world and that can be obtained from many other sources. “Seek and ye shall find,” and “all that is hidden shall be revealed unto you.” In reading and thinking, search not for the differences of opinion or interpretation but for the similarities and the fine threads of unity that run through all philosophies of all times. Be not dismayed by disagreement among those who pose as authorities; disagreement in interpretation or understanding is inevitable, and merely represents the more or less blind grop- ings of the unsatisfied human spirit after Truth and reality, Many illusions must be pursued until they are ultimately dis- pelled by the reality of illumination. Know that there are many paths to the Sanctum Sanctorum of ultimate Truth. Even think- ing men will stray from the strait and narrow path of Truth into the devious and mistaken ways of error, but the bypaths, blind alleys, and dead ends of error will always turn them back into the right path and direction. They learn to see because they have been in darkness, and the light of Truth shines the more bril- liant and lovely because it follows the darkness of error.

All of them have been exposed to a series of symbols and allegories which, although purported to reveal the hidden mysteries, really served to conceal them; and it can be said fairly that the words of the Ritual conceal more than they reveal to the minds of most Masons. Initiation into Masonry and participation in its forms and ceremonies leave most Masons, so far as the meanings of the Ritual are concerned, in a state of perpetual bewilderment and perhaps frustration, In self-de- fense most Masons end by ignoring the whole thing, apparently satisfied to let the ritualistic work of the degrees “pass in one ear and out the other,” and to participate in the fine fellowship of the Fraternity. The mysteries concealed in degree work and in the ceremonies of opening and closing a Lodge thus remain hidden and “lost” from year to year and generation to gener- ation. On the surface this fact may seem deplorable; the reason for it will be discussed elsewhere. The Builder’s art down through the ages has been based upon an arcane science, secret methods of self-improvement that have been withheld from the many and revealed to the few who have made themselves worthy and well qualified to receive them. Ancient Operative Masonry and modem Speculative Ma- sonry have charted a narrow highway up the rugged heights to Masonic illumination and destiny, and declare that Masons are in the process of “fitting our minds, as living stones, for that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” If this marvelous idea has any meaning or validity to a Mason, and if he wants to know more about the process of erecting a “spiritual building,” he will have to make individual effort to learn and apply the meanings of Masonry.

FCSXZ your capacity for Light in Masonry, and you will be amazed to find that its potential for more light has expanded; and as there is no limit to Light, there is no limit in growth of capacity to perceive it. The wisdom of anyone is potmtidly adequate to the task, although the path to Masonic illumination is no easy one to follow. The will required for its achievement is often weakened and thwarted by preoccupation with demands of the physical body and with worldly affairs and responsibilities. But since (as Masons declare they believe) our souls are immortal and death is the ultimate portal to immortality, it would seem logical and provident to give more than a passing glance to preparations for our eternal sojourn in that immortal spiritual body that Masons believe will be ours at the death of our physical body. Practical masons pay much attention to and make elaborate preparations for the erection of any building, which will endure a few centuries at most; but most Speculative Masons pay almost no attention to, make almost no consci~~ preparations for, that “great change,” after which they will be living in that spiritual building for an eternity of centuries (as they believe). It seems fair to say that the effort they put into the “uprearing of that spiritual fabric” could and should be greatly increased if they wish to step up their rate of progress toward the great goal of Masonry. What are we waiting for-the wisdom of future generations to reveal what we should think and do? No; the truth is that the wisdom of any Mason is potentially adequate to the task- can make a beginning toward its achievement. The wisdom of past generations I&IS discovered and brought to light the hidden meanings of Masonic science, but those meanings remain hidden and obscure to every Mason until he has expanded his mind and soul diligently and resolutely to become worthy and well quali-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MODEN FREEMASONRY 17 fied to receive and emit the Light. The wisdom of future genera- ‘tions can reveal no more to anyone than the wisdom of past generations has revealed to those who wanted to know, or than the wisdom of this generation can reveal, or than one’s own wisdom can reveal, if one really wants to know what Masonry means. Light in Masonry will therefore continue to be ‘lost,” hidden from us and from all future generations of Masons, until each Mason tries to find out for himself the esoteric ( secret) meanings of the symbols and allegories of the Ritual. The “Light” is always here and now, shining brilliantly behind the symbols and allegories of the beautiful Ritual, its riches within the reach of anyone who wishes to grasp them. Each of us is always in the “now” and ‘here” of time; there is no need to wait for a future generation to reveal the methods by which the Builder improves himself in Masonry. The hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry-revealed to men in all ages who have proved themselves worthy and well qualified to receive them-are therefore not withheld from any Builder today who makes the effort to learn and to know. But we should remember that anyone can be a man and a Mason for a million years, in the here and the hereafter, and still not know much about the mysteries of his Craft unless somewhere along the level of time he takes time to discover and bring to Light the true Masonic wisdom.* The ideas concerning the hidden Mysteries of Ancient Free- masonry are here addressed only to the Brethren of the Craft because they, having been exposed to Masonic Light, have a right of access to and understanding of them. This wisdom is not hidden from any man in the world; but the men who theo- retically should have the greatest interest in it are those who have taken the degrees in Masonry and have demonstrated, * It is also suggested at this point that what one does not learn here in this life one is not likely to learn in the hereafter in the life to come.

This book is a call to them, a plea to take greater interest in the hidden meanings of the Mason’s art and in the development of a stronger %estleboard,” a better preparation for that immortality to which all aspire. Loyal Freemasons should have the high incentive to open the doors of their minds to let in the beams of Masonic Light, which they have three times symbolically declared they most desire. This is the basic purpose of Masonry, and sooner or later, in time and eternity, the Builder cannot and will not escape the destiny of its fulfillment. In any case, the Builder in Masonry will make some progress in the Builder’s art, whether conscious of it or not; but he will make more rapid progress if he makes conscious effort to per- ceive the Light of Masonic Truth, to expand his conscious un- derstanding bf the hidden Mysteries of- Ancient Freemasonry. There is evidence both in philosophy and logic and in common sense that, sometime during that eternity that stretches out be- fore each of us, as immortal souls we shall discover and bring to light the True Word, that we shall receive the rich reward of Master’s Wages, and that we shall ultimately be admitted into “that Celestial Lodge Above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.” This is dmtiny, but we need to know what these expressions and others like them mean, as they appear in the Masonic Ritual, before we can consciously set our feet upon destiny’s path. Many loyal Masons think that that destiny is so theoretical, so specula- tive, so sublime, so dimly remote, so unrealistic for them as indi- viduals that it is foolish to give much thought to it. But in spite of its difficulties, in spite of how frail a hold such sublime claims may have upon our conscious minds, the fulfillment of that destiny nevertheless is the real object of Masonry and the ulti- mate goal of the Masonic Quest. There is no escape from that conclusion. That is the purpose to which we commit ourselves, speculatively, when we join the Masonic Order, participate in its work and ceremonies, and set our feet upon the path of Masonic illumination.

There can be no doubt that this is the real and ultimate object of an eternal Quest for each of us, either consciously or unconsciously, whether we will or no. It was this Quest, this desire, this inner longing, that prompted Masons in the first place to seek membership in the Masonic Order. It is this same Quest that keeps them loyal, each in his own way, to the tenets and interests of the Fraternity. They must not be disrespectful of this Quest and of loyalty to the Craft by acting as if they are not consciously interested in its purposes and functions. These purposes (believe it or not, as you choose) are more real and fundamental than the demands of mortal flesh, than the demands of the material world in which we live! If one Brother could help another in the pursuit of this Quest, the path to the heights of Masonic illumination would be less rugged and easier to climb. But in interpretation of the symbols and allegories, no Brother can reveal to another any Truth beyond his mental and spiritual capacity to perceive it as Truth. All one Mason can do for another is to explain the sym- bols and allegories of Masonry as faT CLS he undmsta~ tJ-um. However well versed in Masonry he may be, no Brother who knows its transcendent character would declare that he has exhausted the meanings of Speculative Masonry; if he did so declare, then we would know that he does not understand the infinite nature of Truth as it appears in Masonic science. There- fore the help that one Brother can obtain from another is strictly limited both by the partial Light that any Brother may have and by the lack of capacity of another Brother to receive such Light, or any Light. Responsibility for Masonic progress lies entirely with each Brother. As “good men and Masons,” all stand humbly and reverently before the mountain of Masonic Truth and achievement. They do not pretend to know it all.

Every Mason therefore writes his own trestleboard, plans his own Masonic life and progress, and builds his own spiritual fabric; and nobody else can do it for him. One of the transcendent glories of Masonry is that it per- mits and encourages each to be steadfast in the faith of his acceptance, but it-does not impose upon any man a particular interpretation of a symbol or an allegory. It leaves each Mason free to bring his own Light to the Builder’s art and to build his spiritual fabric in his own way and in his own good time, even if it takes an eternity to do it, For this reason alone we should love Masonry mightily1 Free- masonry is the Light of free men. It does not chain the mind and spirit with preconceived interpretations or crystallized analy- ses, or attempt to dictate what its devotees should think about its so-called “hidden mysteries.” It does not seek to impose any authority in interpretation to which every Mason is expected to bow. But it does urge upon each that he faithfully direct his steps through life by-the Light he shall find in Masonry and as he there shall find it. This, it seems to me, is the transcendent glory and beauty and power of Masonry. It assumes that the highest and noblest state of man is freedom to think, to grow in mental and spiritual stature, to progress in the Builder’s art, in such ways and as fast as the individual Builder chooses. Masonry enslaves no man; it ultimately frees any man who will bestir himself with diligence and perseverance to develop his own interpretations and learn to live his own Masonic life according to the dictates of his conscience. Every Mason re- ceives from Masonry that Light and those lessons that he needs, and no more than he has the mental and spiritual capacity to perceive and understand. But he will not see the Light in Masonry until the Light of his own mind and soul illumines it. This “inner Light” in every man is the creative, regenerative power that dispels the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and death: know this as eternal Truth, and you have power to recog- nize yourself as one of the Sons of God."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II THE NEEDS AND ROLE OF MASONRY TODAY TWERE is no body of men in any community who should be more interested in the so-called “mysteries of life” than the Masons. Every Mason makes a solemn declaration, as a condition of being made a Mason, that he believes in the existence of One Ever-living and True God and in the immortality of the soul and that he is in search of Light in Masonry and the way of ever- lasting life. No good man and Mason wishes to ignore these solemn purposes -by neglecting to try to understand sonry means insofar as- it throws light upon them, garding these ideas as mere words or phrases that can or no concrete meaning for him. what Ma- or by re- have little It must be admitted that it is not easy to relate these sub- lime concepts to life as we know it in an earthly environment which tends to preoccupy our minds to the exclusion of every- thing else. Most men appear more devoted to the process of earning a living and enjoying life than they are to learning how to live a fuller and richer life. Freemasonry ministers to the whole man. It bids man pay attention to his secular and earthly interests, which are intended to promote his harmony and happi- ness, but it also enjoins him to a duty to cultivate his moral and spiritual character as an “immortal spirit.” In the Light of the “eternal verities” a Mason’s progress in character is more im- portant than his success in the world. How few believe this! Or, if they do believe it, they do not find it easy to act upon their faith. Besides preoccupation with material interests, one important factor seems to arise from Masonry itself that sets up an appar- ent barrier to efforts to understand its meanings. The very na- ture of Masonry, the science of the Builder of that “spEtual"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"22 THE MEANING OF MASONRY fabric,” the transcendent “other-worldism” of its Ritual, causes men to view it as they do the Golden Rule or the Sermon on the Mount: it appears too far removed from reality, from the practi- cal affairs of life, to warrant much attention. Men who do not allow ethics to interfere with their business interests are not mentally and spiritually geared or conditioned to take the moral and spiritual teachings of Masonry more seriously. Some Masons, however, take the moral and spiritual teach- ings seriously and in their hearts would like to know more about its “mysteries”; but they keep their thoughts so much to them- selves that they appear reluctant to discuss them with one: another. Perhaps the Masonic injunction to refrain from the dis- cussion of sectarian matters in the Lodge room also contributes to this seeming reluctance at times. Masons often fear that dis- cussion of what is meant by “God,” “the Great Architect of the Universe,” “immortality of the soul,” “everlasting life,” etc., would be in violation of this injunction on sectarian matters and might lead to such conflict of opinion as would interrupt the functions of fraternal relations. It is more fear than ignorance that keeps many silent about their understanding of the mean- ings of the Ritual. Men wish to tread on safe ground so far as their speculations on Masonic mysteries are concerned. It is safer to remain silent and be thought ignorant than to open one’s mouth and remove all doubt, or so men think. How much do Masons miss because of the fear either that they do not know enough to talk intelligently about such things or that, if they do know something, the other fellow does not care what they think or will ridicule their ideas if they express them! Year in and year out they go to Lodge and listen patiently to the formalities of opening, closing, and the degree work. And year in and year out they keep silent because of their fears, even where they have learned something about Masonic science, Many Masons who hold fifty-year medals and sixty-year palms know no more about the true Masonry they have been loyal to all through the years than they did at the beginning of their Masonic career, and there are also thousands of Masons who do not see enough in the Ritual to hold their interest once the novelty of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"TI-IE NEEDS AND ROLE OF MASONRY TODAY 23 participation has worn off. The writer has heard many Masons admit that they had become bored with the monotony of Lodge work. Think of the thousands of men who belong to but never attend Lodge. No matter how much we have contributed to the work of the Lodge, no matter how enjoyable the good fellow- ship within the Lodge, no matter how much benefit we have de- rived from our Masonic association, we still miss the tremendous spiritual wealth of Masonry that we could enjoy if Masons could only feel free to exchange ideas on the puzzlements and seeming “extravagances” of the Ritual, The words and ideas of the Ritual need not go in one ear and out the other if all could get together in the Lodge room afier, not during, meeting and exchange ideas based upon reading, research, and thinking. Such practice would bring the whole program and purpose of Masonry to life and significance in our lives, and it would add much-needed vitality to the ritualistic work of the Lodge. There is no real reason why one should take exception to what any other Brother might say. Masons are not there to argue and fight for their peculiar ideas because one thinks one knows so much. One should know that they are, or may be, more valid to one’s self than to others and that thev are onlv purtid glimpses of true Masonic Light anyway. No one is therc to puff up his own ego by pretending that he knows so much about the hidden Mysteries.

Why do so many Masons fail to attend Lodge meetings? If, after the novelty of joining and attending a few times, their in- itial interest wears off, is it their fault or the Lodge’s fault? If, after taking the degrees, the newly made Brother is not stimu- lated to learn the real meanings of Masonry, has the Lodge not “let him down”? In his bewilderment the Brother has no one to look to for guidance and instruction; and if the Lodge has no plan to provide them, he is left up in the air and may lose interest. It is the exceptional Mason who, without further help from the Lodge, has the initiative and sustained interest that are necessary to achieve proficiency in Masonry. I believe that it is the responsibility of the Lodge, under the leadership of its Master, to help the newly made Brother when he needs it most. Sh.ould not every Lodge, either by its own action or by requirement of Grand Lodge, set up a School of Instruction that would require all newly made Brothers to read at least one standard work with explanations or interpretations of both the outer and the inner meanings of Masonry? This matter is too important and crucial to be left to caprice or the discretion of the Brother. Regardless of urgency, if left to him- self the Brother will tend to postpone his effort to learn and know, even when he is quite interested; with the passage of time his interest will lag and die and his attendance will fall off. The Lodge must develop a well-organized, systematic pro- gram of instruction, and it is the Master’s duty to see that the program is carried out. Every prospective candidate for Masonry should be told be- fore he signs his petition that he will be expected to own and study a certain book and that the instruction will be under the direction and leadership of a well-informed Brother appointed by the Lodge or by the Master of the Lodge.

We have tended to take in too many men who have not the mental and/or spiritual capacity to be Masons in more than name only. They make little or no contribution to Masonry, and Masonry can make little or no contribution to them. Perhaps if we expected more of these men some of them could and would measure up to it; but no matter how much is expected of some men, they cannot think beyond the narrow limits of their native endowments and educational background, Unless a man is interested enough to attend Lodge and able to participate in its work, of what benefit is member- ship to him? Is it sufficient for him to wear the insignia and be known as a Mason? Is the proficiency of men to memorize the lectures adequate if that proficiency is no more than parrotlike, a mere repetition of words without meaning? Many, many men who are taken into the Lodges never get beyond this degree of proficiency, and they are not mentally alert and curious enough to want to know more about Masonry. Many of these Masons end by losing all interest in the Lodge and its work; although they continue to pay dues for reasons that seem good to them, they are still Masons in name only. Perhaps a more careful screening of the applicants, higher selectivity, would produce better results; and perhaps a School of Instruction in each Lodge would be effective in securing such selectivity. The theory that men do not care to know what they can learn by reading books on Masonry-that they are more inter- ested in and too busy with other phases. of life-is not entirely correct, Many Lodges that do little or nothing to enlighten the newly made Brother may assume that what is true of some men is characteristic of all. Even if we assume that most new members would prefer to be left alone and not be bothered with something they do not care for, what about the responsibility of the Lodge for a growing number of men now receiving degrees who do want to know what it is all about? The Lodge should not let them down because of indifference even of the majority."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"26 THE MEANING OF MASONRY If good candidates for Masonry would get cold feet when they learned that they would be faced with a School of Instruc- tion (for that was what the ancient Lodges were-schools of instruction and proficiency), the program need not be desig- nated by that term. The prospective candidate could be told that after he had finished with the Third Degree, he with other members of his class would receive help from a well-informed Master Mason in studying a book that would answer all his questions. In almost every Lodge there is some Master Mason who could serve as instructor. He might elect to follow his own outline and methods; if not, he could probably secure from his Grand Lodge headquarters an outline and methods that have proved best adapted to the purpose and most productive of results. If men’s understanding and loyalty could be aroused to a point at which Masonry had greater attraction than their other recreational or intellectual interests, attendance at Lodge would increase. The Masters and officers of many Lodges have wrestled with this problem. They have had programs after Lodge meet- ings when there was no work of conferring degrees-moving pictures, speakers, refreshments, etc.-but all to little or no purpose in increasing attendance. Often after these officers’ efforts to improve attendance have failed, they take the view that Masonry cannot compete with the many other interests that dominate life today, and they give up trying. But how many have tried a program of greater selectivity of candidates coupled with a program of instruction after they have taken their last degree? The prevailing opinion in Lodges, so far as I can appraise it, seems to be that the Lodge has discharged its full duty by the candidate when it has conferred the Third Degree upon him. The newly made Brother has been introduced into a new world of vocabulary, symbolism, and allegory, a new teaching, a new philosophy-very often with no background of learning and experience adequate to cope with it intelligently.

Loyalty to Masonry grows in a man’s mind only with experience in the fellowship and associations of a Lodge; it rarely develops in a day. The critical time for nearly all new Brothers is immediately after their Third Degree; if nothing is done at that time to stimulate their interest in Masonry, many are either lost to the Craft or become Masons in name only. Some Brothers who were not very good Masonic prospects in the first place could prob- ably have been reclaimed for Masonry if their Lodge had undertaken to do so immediately after the Brothers received their Third Degree. If they had been obliged to study a book under the leadership of a competent Brother in the Lodge, they could not claim that they never had a chance to under- stand Masonry better, and the Lodge could properly feel that it had done its very best by each Brother. The fault for lack of appreciation for Masonry would rest with the Brother, not with the Lodge. Motives for joining the Masons vary greatly from person to person. Some use the Blue Lodge as a steppingstone for ad- mission to so-called “higher” Masonic bodies. Some think that membership in the Order will improve their business prospects. Some like to wear the insignia and be known as Masons among men; they think that membership in the Fraternity gives them prestige that they could not otherwise enjoy. These are not laudable motives, and they do not promise potential loyalty to the Lodge and to Masonry; but some of these might be re- claimed to active interest if efforts were made to sell real Masonry to them. Those who join because they know something about Masonry that meets with their approval, and because they grasp some of the implications and interpretations of the degree work, find increasing satisfaction in attending Lodge and participating in its support and work; and they tend to remain loyal to Masonry for life.

Perhaps it might also attract the interest of other members whose motives were less praiseworthy and constructive. Different Grand Lodges have various ways of promoting the Standard Work in subordinate Lodges, and they try to stimulate the officers to attain word perfection in its rendition. This is important; but how many Grand Lodges, or subordinate Lodges, attach as much importance to real understanding of the inner meanings of Masonry? There is no doubt that the best Lodges are those that take pride in the word- letter-perfect ritualistic work; but we must remember that this is only half the real responsibility of a Grand Lodge or a subordinate Lodge under the leadership of its Master. Do not the prerogatives of the Master enable him to assume the leadership in a program of Masonic instruction? The Master undoubtedly has the power, right, and duty to provide instruc- tion for members of the Craft, and if such instruction is pro- vided, it will be the duty of the Master to initiate and promote it in ways satisfactory to him and to the Lodge. The Wor- shipful Master sits and rises in the East, which is the symbolic source of Masonic Truth and Light; and the newly made Brother journeys to the East in search of that Light that only a Master can help him obtain. This is, indeed, the real function of the Master of a Lodge, as it was of the chief priest of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and this is the real reason why we become Master Masons. Not only the letter, or the word, but the spirit of Masonry brings life and Light to members of the Craft. Therefore do not say: “The Lodges of Speculative Masonry have never given instruction in the deeper meanings of Masonry. Why should they now?” Or: “The Master’s Word is lost. Why seek to rediscover it now? Let us be satisfied with the Sub- stitute and wait for future generations to reveal it to us.” There was a time when men were taught in the Lodges some of the secrets by which they could, and did, improve themselves in Masonry.

Men not only learned a lecture, they had to live a lecture, before being advanced in Masonic instruction and experience. But after Masonry became “speculative” it was considered satisfactory if men simply learned a lecture and became able to repeat it like parrots, and the repetition was considered as suitable proficiency. Then, when men were no longer expected to improve themselves in Masonry through instruction and by deeds and conduct, they lost the Master’s Word (the science of the Builder of a spiritual fabric) and became satisfied with a substitute that indicated that they had not built a spiritual edifice but were expected to build one in due time, as future generations should pass. The whole symbolism, to whatever extent it was appreciated, re- duced Masonry to a mere speculative faith, a farfetched, far-off. objective, almost beyond the hopeful reach of men. The soul of Masonry, in its speculative phase of historical development, was lost in the rubble of the temple of modem man’s body and mind. This is the time and the generation in which mankind’s tragic and critical need should offer a tremendous challenge to revive the ancient teachings and to make them effective as a dynamic force in the main stream of life everywhere on this planet. Do not misunderstand when I speak of modem Masonry as “a mere speculative faith’; I do not imply an indictment of modern Speculative Masonry, which I regard as the means whereby the hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry have come down to this generation. Speculative Masonry has per- formed perhaps the most remarkable historical mission that ever became the lot of any organization of men, since it has brought the inner teachings and-philosophy of the Builder down to this day, when Masonry has the potential to establish a world brotherhood and to bring Light and the more abundant life to all men.

Rampant, disintegrative, and destructive materialism seems to have penetrated almost every phase of the institutional life of the Republic. The struggle for money and the goods that money will buy has become a dominating passion among men. It is a fearful thought that, in my own lifetime, the respect of youth for the commandment “Thou shalt not steal” seems to have grown less and less. Respect for law and order, for property rights, and for the rights of others in general appear to be on the decline in certain segments of society; and our so-called “superior” Western culture has sunk to a level of sheer sensuous perception and gratis ca ‘on that can be “viewed with alarm” ti as we ponder the question: “How much more godless can we become and still survive the historical fate of other empires and cultures of the past?” Millions of people in our ‘Iand of plenty” are tied down to an economic treadmill of jobs and work they do not like, from which they try to escape into dubious forms of recreation and surcease from boredom. The secular demands of job, recreation, and home preoccupy the minds of too many men to the almost complete exclusion of consideration of the purposes for which they were born: to improve themselves mentally and spiritually, to know more and learn to do better. This is just another illus- tration of the hold of materialistic interests on the national mind.

Here in America we shall begin the second phase of that Novas Ordo SecZmum-that New Order of the Ages-which under the guidance of God was inaugurated by the Founding Fathers of this nation in 1776. Has Masonry no part to play in this second phase, equal to the part it played in the first? During the next forty years tremendous changes are to come in the lives of all the peoples of the world. What shall Masonry do to keep pace with the changing times? How cun the future of Masonry continue to be like its immediate past? Must membership in the Lodges continue to be characterized by nothing more than a light loyalty to a speculative science? Masonry must change from a speculative to an operative Order to place itself in harmony with the spirit of the new age that will inevitably follow the third World War. It cannot rest upon past laurels or glories. There must come soon a reappraisal of the basic purposes of Masonry and rededication of a sub- stantial part of membership to make the basic teachings a dynamic and potent operative force in self-improvement of the individual and in reconstruction of society in terms of world brotherhood. A New Age of Brotherhood will require Masonry to expand its power to bring the attractive possibilities of soul regeneration to men so that they can have every facility and opportunity to bring to light the True Word and to live it everywhere in the world. This is not intended to be an academic, fancy-worded pero- ration. Though the Freemasons of the United States may be unaware of it, Masonry at this very moment is face to face with the stern and stark reality of a world in crisis, and with problems of reconstruction in a new world that is to be built upon the ruins of the old.

Its soul will go marching on forever, but its present body (organization) can fail to comply with the requirements and needs of that soul. When and if it does, it will lose its soul and become a dead organization. The teachings of the ancient Masters are the same as those hidden in modern Speculative Masonry, and there are several centers in the United-States where these teachings are now being revived and disseminated: Astara in California, Soulcraft in Indiana, and several others. These schools are actually spreading the same teachings that the Ritual of Masonry conceals. What is Masonry doing to develop and utilize the vast resources in the wealth and beauty of its sublime teachings and in the perfection of its organization? Can the teachings of the various-“mystery schools” that now exist in the United States bring understanding, hope, and “sal- vation” to men of this generation? It appears that they are doing it and are attracting large numbers of the thinking elite of the country. Then why should not, why cannot, Masonry do it?

This Truth is, therefore, symbolized by the Word.” He also declares that in Speculative and scientific Masonry “the Word becomes the symbol of Divine Truth, the loss of which and the search for it constitute the whole system of Speculative Masonry.” As long as the Word (the symbol of divine Truth or wisdom) remains lost, it is the “symbol of death”; but when it is dis- covered and brought to Light, it becomes the True Word and “is the symbol of life eternal.” When applied to the progress of the individual Mason through the degrees, the Word (divine Truth) becomes a symbol of his search for light within the veils that hide the mysteries of ancient Freemasonry. Therefore when we think of the “Lost Word,” the “True Word,” the “Master’s Word,” we as Masons ( Builders) must also think “divine Truth, ” “divine science, ” “divine wisdom,” “ancient Mys- teries,” “ancient wisdom,” “arcane science,” etc. In short, by “the Word” is meant the whole of Masonic science and philos- ophy, the discovery and application of which by the Builder in his own life and living are the primary object of Masonry. Therefore we should always think of the matchless Ritual as the great repository of that divine wisdom that has come down to us from remote antiquity. Hidden deep within the symbols and allegories of the Ritual, that ancient wisdom has been preserved to the present hour.

This secret society, having re-discovered the lost wisdom of the ages and fearing that the knowledge might be lost again, perpetuated it in two ways: ( 1) by an Organization [Freemasonry] to the initiates of which it revealed [or concealed?] its wisdom in the form of symbols, and (2) by embodying its Arcana [its hidden science] in the literature of the day by means of cunningly con- trived ciphers and enigmas. . . . The discerning few were thus enabled to find that Wisdom by which a man is “raised” to an illumined life. [Italics added.] It should be carefully noted that the purpose of the Ritual is just as much to conceal as to reveal the secret science that lies behind and within the outward and literal forms and sym- bols. The true wisdom is concealed, hidden, not only from those who do not join the Masonic Order but also from those who “take” the degrees; and it will remain “hidden” until each Mason seeks revelation and finds the Truth for himself. There are no interpretations in the Ritual; they have to be sought elsewhere. In his Mystic Masonry Dr. J. D. Buck quotes from the Legenda of Sir Albert Pike regarding concealment of the true wisdom in the Ritual: ‘What is most worth knowing in Masonry is never very openly taught. The symbols are displayed, but they are mute. It is by hints only, and these the least noticeable and apparently insignificant, that the Initiate is put upon the track of the hidden Secret. . . . It was never intended that the masses of Masons should know the meaning of the Blue Lodge Degrees, and no pains were spared to conceal the fact.” Today the true science of the Builder of a spiritual edifice is lost among the rubbish of man’s materialistic and secular interests, Today most men so assiduously cultivate their material interests that little or no time is left for the conscious pursuit and development of their spiritual powers.

The truth, of course, is that Masonry has no secrets that the ancient mystery schools and every great religion did not, or does not, possess; all deal with the hidden mysteries involved in the search of man for God, for his own soul, and for the powers of the human mind and spirit. Masonry, in common with the inner teachings of every great world teacher, is the science of the Builder of a spiritual edifke, and as such encourages every man, whether Mason or not, to search for Truth and personal power-which all the great teachers of mankind came into flesh to manifest and express for the spiritual uplift of the races. This divine knowledge, this process of achieving personal power, is so deeply mysterious and transcendent, beyond the thinking of the great mass of humanity, that those who possessed it, no matter how much they might yearn to make it known, were compelled to keep it secret. Why compelled? Because no desirable objective could be attained by trying to reveal to another what would not be understood, appreciated, and used unselfishly. Ignorant man fears and hates the unknown and persecutes and slays those who know the deeper truths of life and nature. The history of the last two thousand years, even in the face of the ameliorating effects of Christian teachings, shows that power, when granted to mankind, has been used for selfish and destructive pu?-proses. If all the secrets of self-development and personal power -Gould be known and used by men today, the power would be used greedily and sel&hly, with almost every man’s hand a@.nst his brother, until the flesh of mankind would perish from the earth. God permitted man, or at least man has been able, to make use of atomic power-and see what terrible use has been and may be made of it! In the hands of ruthless and crazy men it can destroy humanity and make of earth a lifeless, barren rock pile.

Men of all races today need not a littZe knowledge but the fullness of knowledge. The fullness of knowledge includes the spirit and the will to use it for beneficent purposes. What a great gulf lies between them in the use of the personal powers that all the great masters and teachers of the races have possessed! Take the Master Jesus for example. He could, and did ( 1) heal the sick, restore sight to the blind, and raise the dead--but he also could have used this power for destructive purposes, as the black magicians have done throughout history; ( 2) trans- mute one substance into another, as water into wine, or the ingredients of bread into bread, and thus feed five thousand from a few loaves-but he never did this to make a fortune for himself; ( 3) levitate his body to walk on the water, and still the tempest-but his employment of this power was always exercised for the benefit of others; (4) rise from the dead in his light-body and become visible to his mother and his disciples. The Master Jesus had learned to use these personal powers, but there is no instance where he used them for self-aggrandize- ment of any kind. He used them always to help and benefit others. He had the fuZZness of knowledge and the fullness of Zone for humanity to use them for beneficent purposes. Christians who take a dim view of the so-called secrecy of Masonry should remember that Jesus himself often enjoined secrecy upon his followers. Two or three quotations from the New Testament will suffice: 1. Matthew 1620: “Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.” Why? No doubt because he knew that, coming from his disciples, no man would believe it; they would not have believed it even if he"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE FOUNT OF TRUTH AND SECRECY 39 himself proclaimed it in public. The rank and file of people do not know w-hat it means to have become Christ; they will not understand it; even Nicodemus did not understand him when Jesus declared: “Ye must be born again.” Why proclaim it to the mob? 2. That this was the view taken by Jesus of Nazareth is further shown in Matthew 7:G: “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.” Do not try to inform profane and ignorant men on such sacred, mysterious, and occult matters as soul regeneration, atonement, resurrection, immortality. These pearls of great price are too transcendent and spiritual to be within the mental and spiritual reach of ignorant, vicious or degraded persons. Why attempt the impossible? If you attempt to reveal the secrets of soul regeneration to men in spiritual darkness, they will laugh in your face or turn upon you and heap all kinds of vili- fication and even persecution and death upon you. Read the history of the Christian dispensation and learn the truth of this. If you know things beyond the knowledge of most men, keep them to yourself, or reveal them only to those who you kmw are worthy and well qualified, duly and truly prepared, to receive them.

The inner or greater teachings or mysteries have been handed down from a remote past in this way, and they have thus come down to us today in, our Great: Light and in the allegories (parables), symbols, and working tools of modern Speculative Masonry. The real object of the true Christian teaching was the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth (as it is in heaven, within the mind and potential spirit of man), and this is the real object of Freemasonry. The science and philosophy of Masonry, when applied and expressed by the individual mind and soul, are a continuing and expanding process, the object and end of which are the attainment of personal powers to be used for the benefit of mankind. This is true Masonic illumination and is the same thing as the philo- sophic initiation of the ancient mystery schools, the soul regen- eration of the Rosicrucians, the self-realization of the Eastern yoga schools, the kingdom of heaven and “second birth” of the Christians, and the “Brahmic Splendor” alluded to in the Ma- sonic Ritual. Jesus declared with finality: ‘“Ye must be born again,” “born of the Spirit,” for the development in time and eternity of the same personal powers that all the great masters and teachers of a blind humanity came to possess and use for the benefit and instruction of mankind. When a person has attained this level of soul development he does not have to be reborn into a mortal body; he then can dwell permanently in the Celestial Lodge Above, that ‘%oume from which no traveler returns.” He has completed his human evolution; he has attained “salvation.” “Many are called, but few are chosen” from any generation. What the few attain is a beacon light to illuminate the path that leads to the destiny of the many. This is a cosmic and eternal process for the whole of humanity, but the techniques and methods of soul regeneration are always practiced by the few in silence and secrecy; and since this is the hidden object of modern Speculative Masonry, the initiate is strictly enjoined to preserve the sanctity and integrity of the teachings within the tiled Lodges of the Craft.

There is, however, a sense in which there is nothing hidden in the Masonic Ritual that is different from the ancient wisdom that can be found in the books of any good library, that can be discovered from reading the works of Plato and the Greek Gnostics, from what is known of the teachings of the ancient Egyptian masters, particularly Hermes, and of the Pythagorean School, that cannot be learned from Manes and the Mani- cheans, from the great” medieval alchemists and Rosicrucians, from the modem Theosophists--to name just a few examples of the transcendent philosophy of modem Masonry. Moreover, much of this ancient wisdom appears in the New Testament of the Great Light, where it is summed up in the brief statement of the Galilean Master to Nicodemus when he declared: ‘Ye must be born again . . . of the water and the Spirit.” (Read the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.) The central theme of all these similar philosophies deals with the origin and destiny of man, his relations in nature, his search for his own soul through conscious self-development and self-realization, his rise to masterhood and liberation. Since the rise and domination of the Roman Church from the open- ing of the fourth century A.D. to our own time, the Church has regarded these schools of thought as heretical and has done everything in its power to stamp out and suppress them. Read the history of the Inquisition, and you will get a glimpse of what the Church has done to people whose thoughts and revelations differed from the prevailing theology. During this period of the so-called “Christian dispensation” the divine gnosis was persecuted, outlawed, and driven underground; the power of the ancient and medieval Church and State was employed to prevent the dissemination of the ancient Truth among the people; they burned both books and people as heretical; and those who persisted in loyalty to it were forced to adopt every"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"42 THE MEANING OF MASONRY possible device of secrecy to preserve and pass it along down through what are properly called “the Dark Ages.” The “secrecy” enjoined in the Masonic Ritual, therefore, rests partly on the traditional policy of the various men and schools of thought who preserved, perpetuated, and transmitted the ancient wisdom clown through the centuries until the proper time came when it could be incorporated into the Masonic Ritual in the early eighteenth century. Of course, in the twentieth century Church and State do not combine to “tear a man limb from limb on the rack” or burn him at the stake because he is adjudged a “heretic,” but there are other reasons why it is still considered necessary or expedient to enjoin secrecy upon those who take the Masonic degrees. Any man, whether Mason or not, can learn what the best thought of the ancient masters was as to the purpose of life in a body; but the techniques and methods of self-improvement and self-realization, though they are not a part of the Ritual, are the inner secrets that all Master Builders have used to acquire transcendent personal powers and attain to cosmic conscious- ness and masterhood, or “adeptship.” Not so much what was expected of an aspirant, or neophyte, but how he was to achieve it has always been the most secret, and has been withheld from people of every generation. Few in any generation avail themselves of the knowledge of the techniques and disciplines of self-realization that make for cosmic consciousness or soul regeneration; few could profit by such instruction; the disci- plines are too exacting and even dangerous, except under the expert guidance of a competent teacher.

IN THE monitorial part of the Middle Chamber Lecture, “opera- tive masonry” is defined as “a proper application of the useful rules of architecture, whence a structure will derive figure, strength and beauty and whence will result a due proportion and a just correspondence in all its parts.” An “operative mason,” then, is the builder of a material edifice; but this definition must be qualified by the fact that his operations are confined to such parts of an edifice as are constructed of stone and mortar, Mackey declares : “The operative art is that which was prac- tised by the Stone-Masons of the Middle Ages”; but he later appears to qualify the implication that the freemasons of the Middle Ages worked only with stone by implying that they used other materials in “the construction of edifices for private and public use, houses for dwelling places of man, and Temples for the worship of Deity.” The monitorial part of the Middle Chamber Lecture also declares that “By Speculative or Free Masonry we learn to subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy and practice charity.” By these processes, especially the process of learning to subdue the passions, a man, as a Masonic Builder, erects in due course of time “that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” -the purpose of development as it applies to every individual that was ever born.

In all ages only a few have succeeded in attaining a level of psychic development at which they could be safely entrusted with these secret methods of self-mastery. We learn to realize that all men, as “children of God,” or as “children of nature,” make a little progress by coming to live even one lifetime in a mortal body; but among the great mass of the people of any generation the process is more or less unconscious, or casual and sporadic. Only a few in every generation devote themselves with con- scious perseverance and great labor to learn to know and apply in their own lives the secret methods of self-improvement that the Masonic Ritual declares to be the purpose of all truly Masonic endeavor. The very fact that only a few find this “way to everlasting life” and that the many would not benefit from it discloses the reason for the concealment of the philos- ophy of life in the Ritual. The makers of the Ritual chose to use the whole terminology of the stonemasons for this purpose. That is the reason why Masonry, as the art of the Builder of a spiritual edifice, is termed “speculative.” To the newly “initiated” the terminology of the Ritual tends to be like a closed book; it is so far from the background of their lives, education, and experience that it is more difficult to understand it than it is to learn a foreign language. Even when the candidate is enabled to catch a glimpse of the inner content of the Ritual, he begins to realize that it is deeply hidden in the terminology of the builder or mason or architect and is behind various other symbols, where it tends to remain a “dead letter” to the great majority of the Graft. In many instances the Masonry of the Brethren does not rise even to the level of its “speculative” aspect, for by “specu- lative” is meant “contemplative,” “reflective,” “theoretical.” It is a well-known fact that many Masons spend too little time"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"MASONRY: SPECULATIVE AND/OR OPERATIVE? 45 contemplating and reflecting upon the beauties and glories of Masonry as it applies to them as Builders of a “Temple more glorious than that of Solomon, a Temple of honor, of justice, of purity, of knowledge and of truth.” There can be no question that in modern Speculative, or symbolic, Masonry the purpose of coming into a Lodge of the body is subjugation (control and transmutation) of the passknx and attainment through works of self-mastery, Referring to the ‘lodge of the body,” “Know ye not,” said Paul in our Great Light, “that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” The intention of the makers of the Ritual was undoubtedly that a majority of those who attain the rank and title of Free and Accepted Masons could and would give some time to contemplation of this sublime truth. The esoteric mean- ings of Masonry might be “lost” to succeeding generations, but the founders of the Ritual must have hoped that sometime the majority of the Graft would begin the process of rediscovery of the Truth in Masonry by giving time to its “speculative,” or contemplative, phase. The seeds of inner Masonic Truth are planted in the fertile soil of contemplation. The thinker must think before the knower can know the Truth in Masonry. Masons must not despise or depreciate the present status of Masonry as a “speculative art”; in the upward longings and strivings of the soul, “speculation,” “contemplation,” and “meditation”-much reading and thinking-must be the initial step toward under- standing of the inner content of the Masonic Ritual and its relations to individual lives and conduct. Thank God for the truly speculative Mason! He begins to become the Son of God. He will soon catch a glimpse of that ‘?hieroglyphic Light that none but craftsmen ever saw.” True Operative Masonry arises out of speculative Masonry. The ancient Brethren who have gone this way before us were true Operative Masons. They had gone far on the way of “spir- itual regeneration” and “self-mastery”; the seeds of contempla- tion and meditation had sprung into fuller growth and borne more fruit in relating their speculations to their OWII lives and conduct. We may declare, if we wish, that ‘by ‘operative"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"46 ‘l-HE MEANING OF MASONRY masonry’ we allude to a proper application of the useful rules of architecture,” but let us realize at the same time that this is a symbolic and secret way of declaring that, as truly operative Masons, “we allude to a proper application” in our lives and conduct of the inner philosophic content of the Builder’s art that is concerned with the “uprearing of that spiritual fabric wherein his soul shall find rest forever, and forever more.” The truly “operative” Mason in all times and places has applied in his own life those secret and hidden methods of self-mastery that f’raised” him to a degree of consciousness and wisdom far beyond the achievement of most men but not beyond the pos- sible achievement and destiny of all. In order to obtain a correct perspective regarding the rela- tionship between what may be called “practical masonry” and “Speculative Masonry” as compared with Operative Masonry, the earnest seeker for Masonic Light should read Chapter VIII, “Freemasonry,” in The Great Message by J. E. Richardson? The writer maintains that an “Operative Lodge” was one in which the candidate-neophyte had to show by severe tests his mental and spiritual proficiency in one degree before he could be advanced to the next, and that, prior to A.D. 1717, when the “Mother Grand Lodge of the present Speculative Order was organized and established in England,” there were individual Lodges dating back to the beginning of the Christian Era in which Operative Masonry has been designated variously as “spiritual Masonry,” “scientific Masonry,” “esoteric Masonry,” “mystic Masonry,” and in which the philosophy and practice of the ancient teachings were taught, inculcated, and made effec- tive in the life of the aspirant. Though we do not wish to emphasize this definition of 440perative’y as a matter of supreme importance here, in the com- ing age, which we are even now entering, the Masonry that we now think of as “speculative” will develop, or should develop, into a more “operative” and implemental form in which the * Distributed by the National Metaphysical Institute, I238 West IPierce Street, Phoenix, Arizona."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MASONRY: SPECULAm AND/OR OPERATIVE? 47 Lodges will endeavor to teach and practice the principles of self-improvement in Masonry. Richardson says (page 95): “ ‘Operative’ Masonry has been designated also as ‘Spiritual’ Masonry, in that it embodies an accumulation of exact and definite knowledge concerning the unfoldment of the spiritual nature of man, which inspires the individual Mason to the development of his faculties, capacities and powers, until he becomes personally conscious of himself as a Spiritual Being inhabiting a physical body.” Not only does this introduce to the reader what is perhaps to him a new con- cept of the meaning of ‘bperative” as it applies to him as the Builder of a spiritual fabric, but it reiterates the emphasis that should be placed upon the real purpose of Masonry. In Speculative Masonry we learn what Masonry is, but in Operative Masonry we perform the disciplines that enable us to apply what we learn and to work consciously toward the status of the “Perfect Ashlar,” as did the Brethren in the operative Lodges that existed before the establishment of the Grand Lodges that drew together into the various Masonic Jurisdictions the modern Speculative or symbolic Lodges. THE BENEFITS OF MASONRY Modern Masonry, therefore, confers two kinds of benefits upon members of the Craft: first, the benefits derived from association in a universal brotherhood in which men help one another in a great variety of ways; second, the benefits that can be derived from a study of the philosophy of Masonry. The first set of benefits may be described as available to the rank and file of members who come to Lodge meetings and partici- pate more or less actively in the work of a Lodge; the second set accrue only to those who are willing to look beneath the outer teachings and forms and seek to become more familiar with the so-called “mysteries” and “secrets” concealed in the Ritual.

The men who formulated the Ritual knew much about the science of the soul, about the ancient wisdom, or they would not have concealed it in the Ritual, where it has rema,ined Yost” for generations and will remain “lost” until every man discovers it for himself. That was the reason why the ritualists of the or-der placed this “wisdom” in the Ritual; they hoped and expected that it would become a light to all generations. If it were not for the Ritual of Masonry, how long would the outer benefits and advantages of membership in the Order continue? Whether men know it or not, recognize it as a fact or not, the urge, the longing, for Masonic fellowship and its more obvious benefits will ztkkately lead the Builder to a careful considera- tion of the deeper meanings of Masonry. Masonry deals with the whole num, not only with his outer interests and satisfactions but his inner life and longings-the secret though unconscious promptings of his soul. Amid the noise, confusions, pleasures and pains, joys and sorrows, of life few men appear aware of the existence of these more or less unconscious, secret promptings of the soul that cause men to be, or to become, discontented with what they know, and to want to know more about the hidden meanings and purposes of life. This eternal Quest of the soul, this fundamental desire to find happiness, harmony, security, serenity, and peace, has sometimes been called a “divine discontent,” as if it emanated from God as an evidence of the divinity that resides deep within the soul of man. If this indeed is a correct appraisal, it makes every one susceptible, sooner or later in the life of his soul, to a conscious pursuit of the meanings and purposes of life. This is the real and dynamic purpose of Freemasonry, which is emphasized in the declaration that a Mason is a Builder of a spiritual fabric on the level of time and of eternity. Iet us therefore as individual Masons grasp the opportunities and challenges of membership in the Order to become aware of and to understand the meanings and purposes of life as portrayed in the secret teachings of the Ritual. It is from the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MASONRY: SPECULATIVE AND/OR OPERATIVE? 49 vantage point of the present membership in the Masonic Order that we should develop an incentive to expand our minds to delineate the broad outlines of the past history of the soul and to explore its future-in other words, to learn more about whence we came and whither we are traveling. The curious and inquiring mind naturally asks: Who am I? What am I? Whence came I? Why am I as I am? How can I become better? Whither am I going? What are the purpose, plan, and meaning of life?

They are not intellectually or spiritually curious enough to want to know whence they came or whither they are travel- ing. Many ridicule any suggestion that they try to find out for themselves. Regardless of the motives that impel men to seek admission to the Order, regardless of the seriousness with which Masons pursue the purposes of Masonry, still no man can pass - through the degrees, continue to attend Lodge meetings, and participate in the work of a Lodge without deriving great benefit frond it.

If this is true-and as a student of psychic science the author thinks it is true-how little is one consciously aware of the extent to which one’s future is being shaped by Masonry! This effect has to do with the soul’s growth, and no one has a way -of measuring it within the limitations of his body and mind unless he pays prolonged attention to the laws of psychic development as discovered and brought to Light by the great thinkers and teachers of the past. The effect of Masonic activity plays a tre- mendous part in the long future of our souls. This benefit of participating in the work of a Lodge, or even of hearing the Ritual, may not be fully realized in this life, but there are many tangible benefits that the minds of Masons can appreciate in the here and now, if they will stop, look, and listen as the years of their Masonic careers go by. It is indeed quite stimulating and heartening sometimes to read what non- Masonic friends say of Masonry, To quote again from Masonry and Its Symbols: The Brotherhood of Freemasons is the largest of the bodies in the world which are outposts to prepare possible candidates for an inward life. . . . The Order existed under one name or another as a compact, well-organized body long before the building of the oldest pyramid. It is older than any religion known today. It is the extraordinary thing among organizations in the world. This organization and the system of its teachings, with the tools, land- marks, emblems and symbols, have always been substantially the same. . . . There are no better and no more advanced teach- ings available to human beings than those of Masonry. Another contemporary writer, a prominent expositor of phi- losophy, declares : “The leading Masonic scholars of all times have agreed that the symbols of the Fraternity are susceptible of the most profound interpretation and thus reveal to the truly initiated certain secrets concerning the spiritual realities of life.” (Manly P. Hall, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry.) But so far as the conscious mind is concerned, unless you"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MASONRY: SPECULATIVE AND/OR OPERATIVE? 51 bring your Light to Masonry, Masonry will bring no Light to YOU; but if your conscious mind learns to discern its Light, Light shall be added to the coming Light until your whole body, mind, and soul become illumined and you experience satis- factions you never dreamed were possible. In Chapter XVII, “The Ancient Masters and the Ancient Wisdom,” which pur- sues this theme further, you will discover that Masonry is the deep well of living water that springs from the inexhaustible fountainhead of Truth-which, if you drink deeply, will quench your thirst for Truth and bring you into the presence of the Mason’s God. You will realize that Masonry is the bread of life, that heavenly manna which will assuage your spiritual hunger and render you worthy and well qualified to enter the Celestial Lodge Above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides. You will recognize that Masonry is that “pearl of great price” which exceeds in value all the wealth and riches of the material world, the sight and Light of which will bring unimaginable illumination, calm, tranquility, peace, and happiness to your mind and spirit. Not only is Masonry the Light of the soul; it is the sacred fire that burns upon the altar of the soul, whence comes that divine urge to learn to subdue the passions and to make progress in the Builder’s arts. That these ideas are here introduced does not mean that you can, or will, entertain them now, but there is value and benefit in merely introducing them because, even if you reject them now, ultimntely in the here or the hereafter you will meet them again and again and sometime will be more inclined to examine them on their merits. This is one of the benefits of being intro- duced to what may at first seem silly and inconsequential. Sooner or later you will begin to think about them. Thinking must always precede action, motivation, and the benefits of thinking, just as cause is followed by corresponding effect in both the visible and the invisible worlds.

The answer to this question can be covered in a twofold manner. 1. So far as the writer knows, the Grand Lodge and the subordinate Lodges of every state in the United States make the Holy Bible, with both Old and New Testaments, “the Great Light in Masonry”; it is the Book of the Law in Western Coun- tries, No Masonic Lodge can be opened without opening the Holy Bible on its altar. The prophets of the Old Testament, particularly Isaiah, foretold the advent of a savior about seven hundred years before it took place; the prophet makes reference several times to the “Holy One of Israel,” and the reference is undoubtedly to Jesus of Nazareth, who, regardless of what view anybody may take of him as Saviour, was the great world Teacher and Way- shower. Jesus of Nazareth had attained a level of consciousness, of perfection, that has been called by various names: cosmic consciousness, soul regeneration, philosophic initiation, spiritual illumination, Brahmic Splendor, Christ-consciousness. Masonry as the art and science of the Builder of a spiritual edifice therefore urges upon each votary that he diligently study the Book of the Law to “Zeurn the way to everlasting life,” that he remain steadfast in the faith of his acceptance,” and that * An “Avatar” is the’ incarnation of a divine messenger, like Jesus and Buddha and others."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"54 THE MEANING OF MASONRY “he faithfully direct his steps through life by the Light he there shall find and 0~ he there shall find it,” The searcher for Masonic Light is enjoined to go not only to the Old Testament but to the New for the religious instruction and Light that seem best to him. There he will learn something about the life, philosophy, teachings, and works of one of the great Avatars, whose advent was foretold hundreds of years before it took place. The fact that his name is not mentioned anywhere in the Ritual need not be an affront and an offense to him, because the purpose of Masonry and the real purpose of Christian teachings are one and the same thing: soul regeneration, the building through faith and works of a spiritual fabric. “I am the Light of the world,” said Jesus; ‘he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but’ shall have the Light of life.” Masonry also proclaims that the most desirable thing a man can wish for himself is Light, More Light, Further Light, and ultimately All the Light that man can perceive while living in a mortal body. In both cases this is the Light of faith, knowledge, wisdom, and works, all in harmony and co-operation to bring a soul back to the Father’s house, to the Celestial Lodge Above, This is the purpose of life in a physical body for every Christian Mason as well as for every non-Christian Mason; and it is a never-ending, a cosmic process in which Masons are taught to emulate the greater Brethren who have gone this way before them, Now, therefore, why is Jesus the Christ not mentioned in the Masonic Ritual of the first three degrees? Those who ask this cjuestion should remember that Masonry has been, and is now, attempting to promote the idea of a universal brother- hood, a dwelling-together of all peoples on earth in harmony and peace. Though Avatars have come to all people at different times with the same essential message, nevertheless the Chris- tian Avatar is still not acceptable to some peoples. The brother- hood of man, however, can be established upon the Fatherhood of God, which could and should be a universal unifying synthesis of sufficient power to draw all men together. Masonry proclaims the universal sovereignty of the All-Father, for it is He, the “I Am"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"HIRAM, CHRISTIC HEiRO OF MASONRY 55 That I Am,” who has sent every divine messenger into the world of humanity to teach men the way, the Truth, and the Light, The ancient teachings were projected on the earth plane by the great teachers-“Avatars,” “divine messengers,” “messiahs,” “way-showers,” “examplars, ” “elder Brothers,” who at the behest of the Great Architect came into flesh from the Celestial Lodge at different times and to dtierent races of men. Jesus of Nazareth was sent to be a light to the world to some branches of the human race, but other branches have had, and do now have, their Buddha, their Krishna, their Zoroaster, their Confucius, their Mohammed. Masonry declares that all these peoples, of whatever religion or creed, are “children of God” born into a particular race, religion, or creed to derive whatever benefits and self-development they need, or are capable of, on their long journey back to the Celestial Lodge. As all men “live and move and have their being” in the Creator, all men are potential Brothers. Hence Masonry emphasizes no one Avatar in its Ritual more than another; and Masons all over the world express their first allegiance to God, as the Universal Father, and as Builders of a spiritual fabric follow as best they can the teach- ings in their own peculiar Book of the Law. The Christian Mason can, and should, fraternize with Masons of every race, color, or creed if the ideal of world brotherhood of all peoples is ever to become a fact. And, we might add, unless some way can soon be found to implement this concept of world brother- hood, the peoples of the world, motivated by the evil spirit of world-wide selfishness and mammonism, will use the powers of atomic energy for universal destruction, perhaps to the point where our earth will be unfit for human habitation. We have quite definitely come to the point where the alternative to universal brotherhood is universal destruction. It is the undoubted purpose of Masonry to promote brother- hood among 1111 races and classes of men.

Regardless of what Avatar or religious leader founded or perpetuated the religion of a people, the Truth, or Truths, underlying every great religion of whatever name or faith are the same; and Masonry has concealed these Truths in its Ritual, so that men of all races might ultimately come to understand them and be drawn together in universal brother- hood because of them. Masonry does not, cannot, countenance or magnify the disunity and divisiveness of particular creeds,. external religious beliefs, or faiths, or cults, or sects, or of any particular interpretation of an Avatar’s teachings. Nor can Masonry express partiality to any one Avatar, as if there have been no others who have come to other branches of humanity at various tinnes, Masonry minimizes the moral and religious differences among human beings that produce disunity, hostility, and weakness; and it magnifies likenesses that promote under- standing, reconciliation, and brotherhood among all peoples. Masonry is the synthesis of all Truth which reconciles, in its great moral and religious teachings, the age-long antipathies between faith and science and which dispels the misinterpreta- tions and superstitions that have always arisen to becloud, pervert, suppress, institutionalize, or theologize the original teachings as they have come from the lips of an Avatar. Masonry is both the art and the science of the Builder of the spiritual fabric of the individual of every race, clime, and time. This fact makes of the Masonic Order a universal brotherhood, or invests it with the potentiality of becoming a universal brother- hood. In no age of a developing humanity have more than a few of any generation learned to subdue passions and improve themselves as Builders of a spiritual fabric. Few, indeed, are they who find the strait and narrow way that leads to the richer and fuller life of soul regeneration, the so-called second birth. But these few disciples in every age and race in turn became the leaders of the people in their upward quest and strivings for Light and righteousness.

Without them humanity never would have learned to exhibit cohesiveness and unitv sufficient to draw men to- gether in associations and fraternal relations for the common good and for the self-development of the individual. Without their divine teachings the innate selfishness and savagery of men would have no ameliorating antidote to enable men to rise above the level of beasts of prey. Right now, after nearly two thousand years of Christian teachings in the many sectarian churches in the Western world, many men in every so-called “enlightened,” “cultured,” “civilized,” “progressive” nation have not risen above the status of savage beasts of prey. One can imagine what nearly all of mankind would have been for the past two thousand years without the ameliorating and regenera- tive influences of Christian teachings. The slowness with which men mend their ways from one generation to another has its mysterious implications; and we have come now to a state of international relations and domestic problems in which we could hope for the re-advent or descent of “the Redeemer of Israel” to fulfill and comDlete his divine mission to humanitv, The golden thread of Truth and unity runs through all theie teachings of the great ones from the Celestial Lodge back to the remotest ages of humanity on earth. The essences of this Universal Truth are hidden in the Ritual of the first three de- grees of modern Speculative Masonry, where it has remained “lost” to all who do not take time to learn or to seek more Light. Rut these Universal Truths are perpetually on record for all to see who ask with hope that some facets of the Truth be revealed, who seek with the certainty that they will find, and who knock that the door of understanding, wisdom, and right action may be opened for them. The universality, the unifying Truth of Masonry, makes it possible to develop on earth a universal brotherhood of men devoted not to the weakness and disunity of sectarian doctrines and teachings but to religious and humani- tarian purposes in every field of human activity.

Now we come to the second phase of the answer to the question concerning the place of Jesus the Christ in modem Speculative Masonry. Do not think that because no savior appears a3 such in the Ritual, modern Speculative Masonry does not countenance the advent of divine messengers (Ava- tars). The Great Light describes the advent, life, and teachings of one, the last Great One, of the long succession of divine incarnations. The divine matrix of the ancient wisdom (the secret Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry), which held the knowledge of a Lodge of divine Brethren who come to humanity from time to time as teachers and way-showers, was concealed in the Ritual of the first three degrees, where the symbolism associated with the legend of Hiram Abiff represents Masonry’s esoteric allegiance to the eternal teachings that have come from every divine messenger who ever came to humanity from the Celestial Lodge through the outpouring love of the Great Archi- tect, our Supreme Grand Master. Grand Master Hiram Abiff was and is but a symboZ of masterhood, Avatarhood, a man whose spiritual illumination and life should be a beacon light and a way-shower for all Masons, who are bidden to represent and emulate his great virtues of fidelity and integrity, and a man whose life and death should exemplify for us those great moral and religious princi- ples that form the inner essence and outer meanings of Masonry.

The scope of Masonry as the speculative and applied art and science of the Builder is so remote and universal in time and space that, in its philosophy and esoterics, it includes the fundamental teachings of all great Avatars. Therefore in its Ritual it does not mention any one of them but develops the theme and pattern of their teachings in the symbolism incorporated in the legend of Grand Master Hiram Abiff, If the legend of Hiram Abiff does not mean that much to you as a Mason now, perhaps you will be challenged some day to study the secret teachings of all the great Avatars and see for yourself how the legend of Hiram Abiff embodies and con- ceals these same teachings. The serious student of the philosophy of Masonry should have a great interest in what is known about the great teachers and divine messengers that have come to humanity from time to time, because the occult and speculative phase of Masonry is derived from their teachings regarding the origin, development, and destiny of the soul of every man and woman on earth."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI BY WHOSE AUTHORITY? THE TEACHI~TGS of Masonry recognize and impose no “authority” upon the members of the Craft. Masonry leaves each man free to search and find his own way to everlasting life. Each Mason’s trestleboard is a product of his own thinking, planning, and. doing. True, the broad and apparent landmarks of the Order do lay down certain principles or rules of action which every Mason is expected to follow; but conformity to them imposes no restraints upon his freedom to think, search for, and find his own way to everlasting salvation. Each Mason follows the way to Masonic illumination as best he can, and no other man or Mason can properly declare that he has the last word on any phase of Masonic Truth and that, therefore, his Brother Mason should rely on the “authority” of his interpretations without objection or question. Masonry itself imposes no authority, no compulsion to think and reason in definite patterns in the inter- pretation of its symbols and allegories. And what Masonry itself does not seek to impose upon its members no individual member should presume to undertake. There is probably no human foible so futile and fruitless as the erroneous belief that any organization, either ecclesiastical, political, or private, or that any individual, however wise, can impose any lasting authority that usurps a man’s inalienable and divine right and duty to think, search, and find his own way to Light and salvation. The hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry, like the mysteries of our lives, our minds, our bodies, like the mysteries of Nature and her marvelous works and powers, are so transcendent, so illimitable, so sublime, that it would be the height of presumption and folly for any organi- zation or individual to attempt to impose a particular interpre- tation upon a member of the Craft.

We always have to guard ourselves against an ego- tistic presumption that we know so much that the other fellow should accept our judgment without question. The responsibility to improve one’s self in Masonry rests entirely with the individual Mason. It is not a free gift from God or from anybody who presumes to represent God. If the individual member of the Craft does not think and act to im- prove himself in the Builder’s art, no one else will ever succeed in doing it for him or imposing it upon him from without. There is really no such thing known to Masonry as “authority” to compel conformity to definite interpretations or definite pro- cesses of improvement. Every Mason is his own “authority” with- in the established landmarks of the Order. The landmarks were anciently set up to allow the greatest possible freedom to the individual Mason, and they recognize his individual and inalien- able right to improve himself in Masonry as he sees fit and in his own way and time, With this view in mind of the place of authority in Masonry, let us find out what help we can derive from what other com- petent thinkers and witnesses have said about the great purpose of Masonry and the attitudes of mind that will pave the way for a clearer insight into the meanings of its mysteries. To individual Masons groping more or less in the dark for Truth in the “eternal verities,” appreciation of the meanings of the symbols and allegories of Masonry will depend almost entirely upon the degree of development of the spiritual insight and the breadth and depth of their reading and thinking. The understanding of Masonry takes each into the realm of the sub- jective mind, or spirit, or soul, where it is difficult for any other person to enter. Each is aware that what seems to be valid as “the living Truth” to one person may appear as only meaning- less patter to another.

It is true that not all the mysteries of Masonry can be revealed at one time to everybody in the Lodge; it would be a waste of effort to attempt to do so, even if it were possible. But it would not be possible, for no matter how much we know we are all only humble searchers for Masonic Truth, not purveyers of personal views, however enlightened. At the rate of progress of many Masons in Masonry it would take a million years to achieve all that Masonry declares it exists for, Regardless of where one is on the ladder of achievement of Masonic Truth, all are climbing, or attempting to climb, some on one rung, some on another, some slowly and some more rapidly. Thus also all are brothers in a common endeavor-the pursuit of the Builder’s art-who, being tolerant of and sympa- thetic toward one another’s efforts to climb to a position of higher vision, should reach down helping hands and attempt to raise themselves and one another to higher levels of faith, understanding, and wisdom in personal adjustment, freedom, happiness, and security. Yes, you can do this for Masonry, and Masonry can do this for you! How shall we help one another up the rugged path toward the heights of Masonic illumination? Can we rely on our unaided efforts to understand the mystic symbols and allegories of the Ritual? If the Ritual gave us particular interpretations of what is meant by such terms as “Masonic Light,” “traveling in foreign countries,” “ working and receiving master’s wages,” “the secret word of Master Mason,” ” one ever-living and true God,” “the immortality of the soul, ” “the uprearing of that spiritual fabric,” that “house not made with hands,” “that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,” “eternal in the heav- ens” , . . then we could probably rely upon such explanations.

Therefore, in our search for true Masonic Light, we find it desirable, perhaps necessary, to rely more upon what the great thinkers and teachers of the past have said than upon our own unaided reflections and knowledge. In other words, at the begin- ning of our search, at least, we have to go to the books-the writings and teachings of The Masters, the “wise men,” adepts, seers, and saviors of every era in human history-for what- ever illumination we can find and comprehend. “It’s all in the books,” and everybody has equal access to the great storehouse of Masonic scientific and philosophic literature. This literature will put us in possession of a form of riches the satisfactions of which will eclipse all the gratifications of the material world. As autonomous thinkers, we may not understand all that we read. We do not need to agree without question with what we read,*or with what someone else says, without knowing why we do so. But we should always hold our minds open and be willing to give a fair hearing to the thoughts and inspirations of others. Well-trained minds do not reject a new concept merely because they do not grasp or understand it in a moment. It is the ignorant who proclaim a new idea as error or foolishness befoTe they give any thought to its possible Truth for them. It is often much easier to dismiss an idea without investiga- tion and be done with it than to spend much time and mental or spiritual effort to discover its Truth. Thinkers of the past have searched for and found a path of illumination that gave them great insight into the mysteries of life and brought them unimaginable satisfactions and fulfillments of their life purposes. What others have achieved in the work of the Builder’s art, every one of us can achieve-yes, is d!iwtined to achieve. Do not say, “It’s too much for me”; just start the process of discovery of new light.

From cradle to grave, so long as we retain our power to think and reason, we are forever pushing outward the frontiers of our knowledge of ourselves and our environment. However much or little we may know, our minds can be‘ thought of as centers of spheres, the radii of which extend outward in all directions toward the infinity of limitless space. There is no Truth that we cannot aspire to learn if we are willing to pay the price in mental and spiritual effort. The truths, the science, of ourselves and our universe, mysterious as they may be, exist about us and within us as an illimitable cosmic ocean. Tenny- son expressed this thought wonderfully well when he wrote in ‘Zocksley Hall,” “Boundless inward in the atom, boundless outward in the whole.” Surely mind and spirit are themselves boundless. There is no limit to their activity and power to pene- trate the hidden mysteries when mind is driven by a will to know and use knowledge with wisdom. Now, if it is true (and I should not want to be responsible for proving it untrue) that we have come into bodies for the purpose of expanding the scope of our knowledge of ourselves and our relations to the world in which we live and to use that knowledge to build our spiritual body, our soul, then the implementation of that purpose will arouse our interest and chal- lenge our curiosity and our desire to learn to the limit of our potential at all times in the progress of our immortal souls.

But if possession and use of mere things necessarily bring us hap- piness, why is there so much unhappiness, frustration, sorrow, insanity, disease, and untimely death in our world? It is more probable that whereas of necessity things must play their part in our lives, we are in error if we place too much dependence upon their possession and use as ends in themselues. People who live to eat and drink, to wear gaudy and extravagant clothes, to search for gratifying pleasures, to make money, etc., etc., will probably spend most, if not all, of their time frantically and anxiously pursuing happiness but never catching up with its elusive spirit. Our Great Light tells us through the words of Jesus, the great Way-shower and Master Builder: “Seek ye first the king- dom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you”; and the Master Builder also said, “The kingdom of God is within you,” and ‘You cannot worship both God and mammon.” The kingdom (the power) of happiness is within us, and does not inhere in mere things or in our sense response to them. If we worship mere things we shall end with frustrations and the loss of the very happiness for which we have vainly strug- gled. Let us not rely upon anything or anybody outside our own minds and spirit for the achievement of tranquility and contentment, inner peace and unity, the joys of living. The power to be joyful and happy resides within each one of us; but it must be awakened and understood and used. But if we would find it, let us search for it within. What does it mean to “search within”? Learn to find satisfactions and joys in expanding the mind and building character. The more we know, the happier we will be in the long run, Masonry teaches that each one of us can build that ‘blouse not made with hands” only through the acquisition of constantly expanding knowledge and application of Masonic science and the Builder’s art.

Even though we pay little or no conscious attention to the sublimities of the Ritual, regarding them as mere ceremonies or words without significance to US as individuals, yet common sense and experience teach us that reliance on mere things as ends in themselves does not neces- sarily bring happiness, and that happiness is a state of mind arising from a source of power within a person. “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth will make you free.” And being free, you will be happy. Regardless of the comparative qualities of our minds, all of us have the power to think and know more and to transform our thinking into knowledge and the wisdom of right action. There is not a single member who, by thinking and learning, could not “improve himself in Masonry” more and faster than he does. We do not need to fear the impact of thinking, knowl- edge, and wisdom; in them inhere poise, calmness, and true happiness of life; from them spring those enduring satisfactions that make for personal progress toward the fulfillment of life’s uurnoses for all as “men and Masons.” A basonry deprecates the “invidious distinctions” that arise in secular life, distinctions of worldly wealth or honors, because Masonry teaches that “it is the internal, and not the external, qualifications” that bring lasting happiness to a man and enable him to be and become “a better man and Mason,” As Masons we all know that this is Truth, but our problem is to make Masonry a more dynamic and powerful force in our lives.

But if we succeed in improving our immortal soul, we take it with us beyond the grave, and it is ours forever and forever.

AU the ancient religions in their pristine purity, however, and the Master Builders of all ages have proclaimed the divine per- fectibility of man; indeed, if man is not a perfectible creature, why should he be born in a human body and why should he be encouraged and permitted to earn immortality? Modern Freemasonry often refers to this teaching as the supreme pur- pose of the Builder’s art, You may be sure that, if this teaching did not represent the best that the ancient masters of the wisdom thought concerning the status and destiny of man’s soul, it would not have been incorporated into the Ritual as the great goal of Masonic endeavor. Faith in and a better understanding of the divine perfecti- bility of the individual are destined to play a most significant part in any synthesis of thought, aspiration, and experience that can emerge during the next century of human development. Ancient and modem Freemasonry is the repository of the most exalted and inclusive synthesis, or system of Truth, known to man. Within it has been brought together (synthesized) the wisdom of all the ages; and as an inexhaustible reservoir of divine Truth, it is available to every man who wants to know more about his origin, his purpose in life, his divine destiny and the general pattern of achieving it.

Masons must begin now not only to build their own faith in the purposes of Masonry as they apply to them but also to dispel others’ doubts and misgivings as to the potentiality for improvement of the human mind, body, and soul. In support of faith in man’s capacity for self-improve- ment, Sri Aurobindo writes in his Essays on the Gita: We of the coming day stand at the head of a New Age of devel- opment which must lead to such a new and larger synthesis. , . . We do not belong to the past dawns but to the noons of the future . . . we have to take full account of the potent though limited revelations of modem knowledge and seeking; and, be- yond that, the remote and dateless past, which seemed to be dead, is returning upon us with an effulgence of many luminous secrets long lost to the consciousness of mankind but now break- ing out again from behind the veil. Though he was not speaking of Freemasonry and its sublime Ritual as such, his words are strikingly descriptive of the func- tion of Masonry in the new age now emerging. Of these “luminous secrets . . . now breaking out again from behind the veil” Dr. R. Swinbume Clymer in his 27ze My&&m of Masonry says: The mystical side of Masonry is not alone the “Key” to the vari- ous religions taught to all men in all ages . , . but it is in fact the repository of religion itself. The Ancient Mysteries of the Secret Schools are so-called because under that title was, and yet is, conserved all that men have believed and do now believe, all that men have been taught and have experienced through obe- dience to a super-life, and these Secret Schools therefore con- serve the secrets of all inner mystical or occult Initiation. Thus Masonry as the science and art of the Builder down through the ages from the remotest antiquity, as the great synthesis of the Builder’s art, was the fruitful mother of all religions. Man has always been taught the concept that, as he"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"70 THE MEANING OF MASONRY comes from God, he is capable of working his way back to God. The authority of such teaching does not emanate alone from the conclusions of all the great thinkers and teachers of the past but also from the knowledge and experiences of the relatively few of humanity who found this way and who could show others how to find it. The fact that some men of past gen- erations have found this way should encourage the millions who have not and who may aspire to find it either in this life or in the life to come, The fact that millions of people over the world appear not to want to find this way does not alter the truth that, somewhere and sometime during the eternity that lies before them, the inner longing and Quest of the immortal soul will become a directive and purposeful force in their con- scious minds and conduct. At this moment in our long journey back to God, just about all that most of us can do is develop what faith we can in our own and our Brother’s potentiality for that improvement in Masonry as envisioned by the Ritual, to which we have paid lip-service but in too many instances fail to understand. Therefore as modern Masonry proclaims its faith in the divine perfectibility of man as an individualized immortal soul on his way ( the path of illumination) back to the Celestial Lodge, it asks (and can ask) no more of men today than the mystery religions back to man’s remotest antiquity on this planet have proclaimed and asked of their initiates. What is more, there have been hundreds, nay, thousands, in the long history of mankind who have proved by their lives that it is possible for men to advance to the stage of true initiation (Masonic illumination) while in a mortal body-men who knew both the lesser and the greater mysteries of life and consciously used this sublime knowledge toward self-improvement and achievement of the divine goal of a Mason. In all ages, by self-discipline and the transformations resulting from the con- scious use of the Builder’s arts these men have become the exemplars and way-showers for all men in all times, and have taught men that the achievement of Masonic illumination and perfection is not an impossible goal for anyone, Therefore"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"TEE DESTINY OF HUMAN NATURE 71 let everyone look up with faith and courage, sustained by the certainty that what the true initiates of the past have achieved each can achieve and is destined, ultimately, to achieve. Hard to believe? Yes, but remember, each one proclaimed his faith in God and in his own immortality when he was made a Mason and was formally introduced to Masonry’s great philosophy and work. He is one of the neophytes of the Widow’s Son! If he has not this faith, or cannot develop it, in the end he will have nothing. No matter what happens to the body, the professing, pro- gressing, achieving, and growing mind of man as an instru- ment of the immortal soul cannot die. The soul, coming from God as a spark of the divine fire, is perfect as God in heaven is perfect. For some mysterious reason, it became necessary for that perfect soul to take on a body and a mind in a body- yes, a whole series of bodies over thousands, perhaps a million, of years of time-and, as a divine wanderer from the Celestial Lodge, manifest in physical form within the limitations and imperfections of the carnal mind and body. But as he comes from the Celestial Lodge, he is destined to return thither as, by a long and arduous process of learning to subdue the passions and improve himself in Masonry, he overcomes and conquers all the vices and superfluities of life, unfolds and reveals the true soul within (the perfect God within) and becomes worthy and well qualified agai.n to sit in the Celestial Lodge, that bourne from which the divine wanderer need never return. Having erected that spiritual fabric, that house not made with hands, he has arrived at a stage in his divine destiny-the drqrez of perfection symbolized by the white leather apron which he received from the hands of the Master of a Lodge when he was told that it was “an emblem of innocence [purity] and the badge of a Mason.” This was the consc-io~ goal of all the ancient priest-initiates and Master Builders; this is the sublime goal set before Master Masons in their marvelous Ritual; and this is the divine destiny of every Master Mason who gives serious consideration to the meanings and applications of both the superficial and the esoteric teachings hidden in the Ritual."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"72 THE MEANING OF MASONRY A DILEMMA The divine imperative to improve one’s self in Masonry and complete the process of perfection presents no problem to the man who says, “There is no God,” and declares that “death ends everything.” Such a man is concerned only with the gratification of the senses, not with the fate of his immortal soul. If he denies that he is an immortal soul, he will not cul- tivate and develop concepts of moral responsibility to himself or others or be concerned with preparations for building his spiritual fabric either here or hereafter. For him death ends all; nothing survives b.eyond the grave except the elements of which the body is composed; when the body dies, the thinker perishes along with it.

The laws of God and the imperatives of religion and morality must enter his mind and conscience, sharpen his powers of discrimination and choice of alternatives, modify his thinking, and improve his conduct.

There have also been thou- sands of superior men down through the ages whose moral and spiritual achievements have far eclipsed those of average humanity; from the primal source of light they have received and reflected more light than the great mass of humanity. What these men attained we are all destined to attain; all of them achieved a kind of consciousness toward which all of us are striving on the level of time. It is undoubtedly this form of consciousness, as exhibited in the superior men of the past, that it is the purpose of Masonry to develop. As we have said, the assurance of man’s perfectibility would not have been incorporated into Masonic teachings unless, in the judgment of the makers of the Ritual, the ancient masters were right that the ultimate goal or destiny of the zuh~le of mankind is the development of a much higher form of con- sciousness than what men now possess. All men, regardless of how far they are along the path that leads to this destiny, have within them the latent power to achieve it. As immortal souls emanating from the Universal Spirit they have within them the potential powers to improve themselves in Masonry until they too shall achieve all that the ancient masters achieved. This is the great teaching that has come down to Masonry from the earliest times; this is one of the Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry, But this very teaching presents a problem, or dilemma, to the thoughtful Mason who is not grounded in the philosophy of the ancient masters, whose teachings form the background of modern Speculative Masonry.

The dilemma is eliminated only when we conclude that we do have more than one life on earth in which to arrive at that degree of perfection already achieved by the ancient masters. Schooled as we have been in the partial truths and falseness of theology as it has come down to us from the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era (though not as they came from the lips of the Nazarene himself), we do not easily think cnctside the limitations of that theology and are not willing to go back to the teachings of the ancient masters, including Jesus, from whom modem Speculative Masonry was derived, If we are to resolve this dilemma, however, that is just what we shall have to do, because there is nothing in the sectarian teachings of the Christian churches that will adequntely explain how man can arrive at his divine destiny.

It cannot refer to such desires that show themselves in human conduct as love, compassion, calmness, poise, generosity, altruism, temperance, hope, courage, etc.- all those noble qualities of the mind that build the spirit and soul of man toward its divine status as a Christ-conscious Son of God, The destructive passions we are enjoined to subdue; the constructive passions we are enjoined to keep in mind and exemplify in practice. It is my firm conviction that those who incorporated this expression into the Masonic Ritual were thinking in terms of its esoteric, or hidden, meaning; otherwise they would not have phrased the expression as they did-Yearn to subdue the pas- sions” -thus emphasizing it as a learning process ultimately resulting in a “taming,” a “toning-down,” a “control,” an “over- coming” of the baser, more destructive forms of expressions. But here again, as in other points emphasized by the Ritual, regard- less of how extravagant it may seem, the expression “subdue the passions” would not have been incorporated in the Ritual unless it was intended to become meaningful to the individual at some time in his long career as a Builder of a spiritual fabric. This expression is probably the most important of all the cryptic allusions found in the Ritual (as the reader will see if he reads this chapter thoughtfully). The fact that at this time it does not mean anything to most men is not necessarily a sign that at some time in the life of every man as a conscious being, the “occult,” or unknown, phases will not be revealed to him.

During them we sZozr;ly learn to connect effect with cause, and we realize that many of the sorrows, ills, diseases, and deaths we experience are due to ignorance and perversions of the sex function, and that many of the joys, exaltations, and powers of life and living are caused by the proper use, conservation, and transmutation of the sexual energy and function. When we read and think about the conservation and transmutation of the sexual energies, we shall learn that there are many mysteries involved in the process known in Masonry as “subjugation of the pas- sions .” Even though Masons may not now be able to put into practice the teachings of the ancient masters regarding this matter, yet it is good that they begin to know segments of the Truth that will become useful and beneficial as they progress on the level of time. For this reason the expression appears where it does in the Ritual and is esoterically implied in the apron presentation. Its position in the Ritual and the tremendous emphasis placed upon it indicate its paramount importance in the teachings of Masonry. The proper expression of the sexual energy in conjunction with the other phases of iMasonic progress u2timat~Zy leads to that second birth emphasized by the Nazarene Master, who had learned to control the matter of all the worlds. By his own example he taught that all men have deep within themselves the divine power to control their own thoughts and, by thought, the matter within their own bodies. Every man knows that without this control of thought and desire there can be no control of the secretions, the elixir vitae (the essences of life itself ), within his own body. Every man is at his own peculiar stage of evolution in this process of learning to subdue the passions and developing life-giving temperance and wisdom in expression. The objective of this book is to point out that the ultimate result of this cosmic process is the attainment of Christic power which could, and perhaps should, be the con- scious objective of every person who calls himself “Christian” or who becomes a follower of any of the ancient masters or is a neophyte in any of the mystery schools of the present day."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"“LEARN TO SURDUE THE PASSIONS” 77 You may say that you do not believe that any man or woman ever attained the level of human development where the sexual impulses were under such complete control as thy appear to have been in the Galilean Master,* but you would be mistaken in such an assumption. As a matter of historic fact, all the great teachers and exemplars, our elder brothers, who have gone this way before us have learned to subdue (dominate and control) their passions. That is the way that all of us are destined to travel on the level of time; that is the reason the expression appears in the Masonic Ritual. The reader, if he has not already consciously started on this way, must make a beginning some- time. Why not now? Read the book by R. Swinburne Clymer discussed at the end of this chapter and learn segments of the Truth that you never even suspected-the “truth that is . . . stranger than fiction,” to the passions. the Truth that will free you from bondage Of all the passions, the most unruly and difficult to subdue is probably the sexual passion, which appears as a “racial memory” and by means of which the human race has been propagated for thousands of thousands of years and will be for many thousands or millions more. Yet, strange as it may seem to Freemasons, this is the primary, though ultimate, objective that the makers of the Ritual intended to set before men, so that those who became ready to receive the Light could learn to perceive it as they progressed on the level of time. Hate, anger, jealousy, envy, covetousness, greed, avarice, combativeness, intemperance, gluttony, worry, hopelessness, fear-all are indeed destructive passions, and these too we are enjoined to subdue. It is easy to see this as Truth; but the one great drive that does more’ than any other to undermine the character of man, to stupefy the functions of brain and mind and to prevent or delay the uprearing of his spiritual fabric, is that of the lust, excesses, and perversions of the sexual passions.

In the course of our long development and self-improve- ment in time and eternity, however, this is the one great passion that we shall have to learn to subdue, to keep under construc- tive control, though not necessarily to eliminate at this stage of our psychic development. By “keep under control” is meant the exercise of temperance and understanding in its expression that will build strength of body, mind, and soul so that vibrant health, happiness, wisdom, and length of life may be ours. Again, read good books on this theme for glimpses of the meaning of “control” and ufemperance ” and the sublime Truth of the matter. Both ancient and modern Freemasonry has always displayed, and still displays, a symbol that teaches men that for Masons and Builders of a spiritual fabric it will be necessary to subdue the sexual passions. ‘The lambskin, or white leather apron, is an emblem of innocence [purity] and the badge of a mason.” Every Brother who attends Lodge has heard the apron presenta- tion over and over again and is familiar with the sublimity of its language. What does it mean to him? Nothing but nice words? In the Entered Apprentice Degree the candidate-Brother is taught how to wear it as an Entered Apprentice and instructed as to the significance of the manner in which it should be worn, In this connection the words “untempered mortar” are used, which, according to Mackey, are designed to teach him ‘hot to allow his Soul to be defiled by the ‘untempered mortar’ of the unruly passions.” As untempered mortar has no cohesive power and allows a structure to fall apart, so will unruly passions prevent the uprearing of the spiritual edifice. Despite the levity or apathy with which a Mason may be inclined to treat this phase of the Ritual, it is much more sensible to give it the consideration and to ascribe to it the importance that the makers of the Ritual intended it to have in the eyes and minds of men and Masons, The practical mason used an apron to keep his clothes from being soiled by mortar.

A In modem Speculative Masonry the real meaning and the intent of the symbolism of the lambskin, or white leather apron, seems to be ignored or rarely explained. It is a part of the ‘lost” science of the Builder, the whole philosophy of Masonry. Though the thinking Brother cannot help but wonder about this ever- present symbol, he learns to keep his mouth shut and accepts the form with little or no real understanding of its content or spirit. He certainly finds no explanation in the Ritual itself, and when he looks in the standard texts on Masonry, he will find only casual references or brief explanations of its symbolism, no formal disciplines by which its implied purpose can be ac- complished by the aspirant. “When a candidate was initiated into the Ancient Mysteries, he was esteemed regenerate and he was invested with a white garment and apron as a symbol of his newly attained purity.” * But regardless of what meaning can be attributed to “purity,” whether of limited control and expres- sion or of strict continence, we know that it takes time and stern disciplines even for a determined aspirant to achieve the degrees of control that the ancient and modern masters and yogis attained.

If he pays little or no attention to the meaning of this sublime symbol as it applies to him as man and Builder, no Brother finds fault with him and no Brother seeks to instruct him; and the whole matter hangs as a mere form without any dynamic or practical purpose. So far as the writer knows, no expositor of Masonic sym- bolism has placed the emphasis upon this phase of Masonic en- deavor that its relative significance requires-probably because of awareness that it would not be understood by most members of the Craft and would be appreciated only by the very few. But in this book, which sets forth the fact that “improvement in Masonry” is an eternal, conscious process and that mastery of the passions is not attained all at once, it seems desirable to pay more than passing attention to it to try to stimulate the reader to study this important phase, of human development and to begin, in howeve r small a way, to apply it in his own life and living. “Ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall set you free.” As stated elsewhere, every Mason as man and Builder on the level of time must first know the Truth, or an approximation of the Truth, before he can benefit by it and transform it into definitive action in his daily life. The knower must know before the thinker can think, and the thinker must think and zoiZ2 before the doer can do. Therefore at this time in the life of some doers, it is of benefit to know what is meant by “subduing the passions.” Even though such knowledge may to some seem quite transcendental, or out of this world, and impractical, yet if the sublime purpose of Masonry shall ever be carried out in this matter, a beginning of the process must be laid first in the word (knowledge), then in the thought (the mind that strongly wills), then in the science ( the formal disciplines), and finally in the achievement (the result of disciplinary action) of that “purity of life and rectitude of conduct essentially necessary to gaining admission into the Celestial Lodge Above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.” The Builder of a spiritual fabric should learn to recognize himself as an active"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"“LEARN TO SUBDUE THE PASSIONS” 81 participant in this eternal, cosmic process; “for in every man, however fallen and degraded, are contained all the forces, both cosmic and deific, which brought him into being and have nur- tured him throughout the vast cycle of generation, in countless incarnations upon earth, while the Logos [the divine Word; Christ] of the Light has taught him the loving lessons of Good and Beautiful, of Truth and Righteousness, and the Logos of Darkness has held before him the dread lessons of the Evil and the False.” (Kenyon Klamonti Awaken the W&d Within., p. 93.) If it be admitted that the millions of earth’s men and women, both those now incarnate and those that are now discarnate, are destined through a whole series of incarnations to achieve “spir- itual regeneration” up to a level similar to that of the Master Jesus, and if it be admitted that millions of discamate souls are eagerly awaiting opportunities for rebirth in physical form for the same purpose, it is more easily understood why physical men and women must express conjugal love of various qualities, thus affording discarnate souls opportunity to take physical bodies, even as they themselves sought such opportunity from their own parents and as countless generations of mankind have done. The Creator implanted in humankind the sexual instinct and invested it with marvelous potentiality for self-develop- ment up to the status of the Christ, or cosmic, consciousness, which is the highest form of consciousness that man can reach in an earthly body. But man has to Zearn to control and transform the gross animal passion from its expression as mere sensuality to the highest form of conjugal love. There is a long, long way between these extremes of expression; that is the esoteric meaning of the word “learn” as it appears in the Masonic Ritual. As we know when we look about us and when we appraise our own lives, the learning process is not completed in one lifetime on earth; our trials and errors, our sorrows and sufferings, our failures and penalties, should teach us that through many lifetimes on earth and in the heavens men and women search and search with deep and persistent longing for perfection in a soulmate. This eternal"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"82 TED3 MEANING OF MASONRY search for the “right man” or the “right woman” is the most important part or phase of “man’s long search for his own soul.” The “masculine” qualities are not complete in themselves, nor are the “feminine”; each must eternally find fulfillment in the other until, as the ages glide away, through lessons learned while in the flesh the conscious mind of each person perceives the light of his own soul and he knows himself for what he is- a Master in his own right-because he has “overcome” the destructive passions and becomes entitled “to eat of the hidden manna” promised by the apocalyptic seer “to him that over- cometh” ( see Revelation 2:17). As Kenyon Klamonti writes in Awaken the Wcdd Within ( p. 110) : “The reward of the Conqueror, who, by the daunt- less energy of the Will, vanquishes all the evil foes in his own nature and fights his way to the pure region of spiritual light, is that he has imparted to him the secret knowledge, the Gnosis, and is given, as it were, a ballot, being named and naturalized a citizen of the nation of the initiated.” This “secret knowledge,” this divine gnosis, is the same thing as the hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry, which will remain “hidden” and ‘lost” to every man until he becomes worthy and well qualsed, duly and truly prepared, to receive them as a reward for the ultimate conquest of the unruly passions, and he becomes entitled to sit in the Celestial Lodge Above, “a citizen of the nation of the initiate&” whose members are the Master Builders of all the ages who have gone this way before us. It is easy, with this cosmic view of the destiny of every soul in mind, to see that the main purpose of the sexual func- tion is less the procreation of offspring than a means toward the better and swifter development of the individual, which follows from the expression of more perfect love for an ideal mate and for the children that such ideal mating produces. Love perfected to the level of cosmic consciousness (the love of God and the Christ-in-man) is the greatest achievement of enpth man; and man learns by love of mate and children to extend his love to God and humanity, even as all the great masters have done.

Swinbume Clymer, may provide some scientific information that ultimately can be practical and useful for motivation to liberate the thinker and doer from bondage to sexual passion and to erect that spiritual fabric upon which the Masonic degrees place so much emphasis.

Regardless of what it may mean to him to improve himself in Masonry, he knows that his progress through the degrees and his work in the Lodge have not been a free gift from any source outside himself, but have required more or less effort on his part. He spent a great deal of time memorizing the lectures and the degree work. How often has he wished that he might Yhave it” by reading or hearing it once! But no, it seems as if some power has de- creed that he must labor mightily to achieve any desired objec- tive; so he spends hours and hours mastering the words and phrases of the Ritual and becoming proficient in the work of the Lodge. Now, what is the significance of this commonplace experi- ence of all who take the degrees, attend Lodge, and participate in its work? It illustrates a law of life-that cause must precede effect, that action must precede reaction, that work must pre- cede the fruits of labor, that service must precede reward. Any attempt to reap where one has not sown, to possess where one has not earned, will place the reaper and possessor under a debt which he will have to pay sooner or later “to the last farthing,” as the great Teacher declared. If one wants results, let one set causes in operation; if one wants the fruits of labor, let one work and earn them. This is the normal, just, and manly way of life both within and without a Lodge of Free and Ac- cepted Masons. It teaches us that there is no way to improve- ment in Masonry but by constant effort. There is no such thing as a pearl without price, and the price is human effort to obtain it. The joys of living, the beauties of life, the glories of nature, the riches of Masonry-any good thing that we. can desire is available only to those who are willing to make the effort to"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"rCAS YE SOW” 85 obtain it. The Creator ordained it thus, and it appears as a law of nature that is effective both on earth and in the heavens. The greater and more remote or sublime the reward we seek, the greater the physical, mental, and spiritual effort we must put forth to achieve it. Do we really want to improve ourselves in Masonry? Are we inclined to take seriously its high purposes and aspire to make them effective in our individual lives? Aspira- tion to achieve a noble purpose must be implemented by the will to make a great personal effort to become worthy to receive the fruits of labor, the Wages of a Master Builder. The achieve- ments of the great masters and superior men in the past have not come as a free gift from the Creator; those men were not “gifted” men in the sense that their superior powers of intellect, spirit, and soul had been attained by them without effort on their pti. We know that they exhibited unusual powers of mind, soul, and character, and so have been prone to believe that theirs were “gifts of God,” whereas the possession of such powers is the result of a long, long history of herculean effort to improve themselves in the Builder’s art. Do not be misled by external appearances that they have anything worth while who have not earned it, Also, do not despair in any desire and effort to emulate the masters, for beyond the shadow of a doubt they have traveled the same toilsome path on which you would set your feet. They have gone this way before us, and we shall ultimately follow. The way to that undiscovered country that, we are told, is by the subjugation of the passions is most difficult and ever nerilous to follow. Few there are who find it in one lifetime I or, at their present rate of effort and progress, would find it in many lifetimes without much greater constancy of will and effort. Most of us who give it any thought feel that the sublime goal of Masonry is unattainable, too far out of our reach, to warrant any hope that we can ever attain it, or, if we believe it is attainable, that perhaps we ultimately enjoy it, in the heavens, without effort on our part as a “gift of God.” Those who think that we achieve mastery in heaven that we have made no effort to achieve on earth, or that we merely hoped for on"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"86 THE MEANING OF MASONRY earth, are under illusions that will never, never enable them to make much progress on the level of time on earth or in the heavens, Someday on time’s level we shall learn the Truth that only as we sow shall we reap, that only as we work shall we enjoy the fruits of labor. There is no escape from the operation in our lives of the law of the Master Builder of the Universe; it applies at all levels of existence on earth and in the heavens, Escapism will not in the slightest alter the inevitability of that destiny for each of us: escapism will only slow our rate of progress in the Builder’s art. Say, if you want, “Well, I’ll take my time at it; right now I do not want to move any faster.” That is your high Masonic privilege as a free man, and you are entitled to the respect and fraternal fellowship of all Brothers who are on this same path, regardless how far advanced. But every man and Mason should be made aware of his destiny as an immortal soul, even though he may not have any hope of achieving it or wishes to take more time, hoping to obtain it as a “gift” from heaven. Let us pause a moment here to consider the function of thinking as a force in shaping destiny. Volumes have been written on this theme, but a few sentences will summarize the conclusions of the writers. The ancient thinkers and masters are in substantial agreement on the basic premise that there has been, and can be, no improvement in human character that did not originate in thinking sometime, somewhere, The qualities of character possessed by an individual today are the results of past thinking, and acting, and their development md im- provement will follow only from present thinking. A person must know what is right before he can do right. The character with which a person is born is the result of past learning and doing right; his present character is the summation of all past experiences and achievements in right thinking and doing. All of us are now in the process of improving character by right thinking and doing, and this conclusion applies particularly to Masons, each of whom is, or should be, a con~cCous Builder of that “spiritual fabric wherein his soul shall find rest forever and forever.” Masonry’s basic teaching is that we come here in a physical body to learn to subdue the passions and to im-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"‘kS Yl3 SOW” 87 prove ourselves in the Builder’s arts. Thinking is basic to learn- ing, and right thinking must always precede right action, In this process of building the temple of his character through right thinking and right action, great emphasis is placed upon the Mason’s duty to himself; the Ritual is replete with refer- ences to this duty. Probably there is no large body of men in human society who are making more progress in the Builder’s arts than the Freemasons; but how can any Mason be satisfied with himself and his progress when he starts to think about the teachings of Masonry and their sublime goal? Start reading and thinking about these teachings, and endeavor to discover the Light of their meanings and their bearing upon your own life and its real purposes. Most Masons make no great effort to learn the meanings of the symbols and allegories of the degree work or to improve their characters to accord with the teachings of Masonry. What thinking they do on these matters is passive and inconclusive. The purpose of Speculative Masonry is to “subdue the passions, act upon the square, keep a tongue of good report, maintain secrecy and practice charity”; but regardless of the extent to which many Masons pay attention to these ideas, they never do more than pay light lip-service to them. There appear to be few who get to the stage of active thinking, whose minds are transformed and renewed by it, and whose deeds reflect the transformations of right thinking. Thinking is passive when it leads to no conclusions that change conduct; thinking is active when it results in conclusions that do change conduct from less to more perfect forms; thinking, externalized to change conduct, improves character and fulfills the purposes of Masonry. Passive and casual thinking is better than none at all, but it will never enable the thinker to reap the rewards of Masonic endeavor, Real improvement in the art of building character can come only from active and persistent thinking and the desire to change for the better. And the greater the effort to improve one’s self in Masonry the greater will be the rewards of such labor, “for whatsoever a man soweth that shall’ he al.so reap.” He who works is sure to receive the wages of a Master Builder!"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER X FAITH AND SCIENCE WHEN MEN declare their belief in God and the immortality of the soul on being made Masons, what mental and/or spiritual element-faith or knowledge-predominates in their thinking? Probably faith, and probably, no matter how much men may learn and recognize as Truth, faith always will predominate. Far be it from the writer’s intention to build an artificial barrier between faith and science, because in reality there is no such barrier. Faith, as an active force to promote human happiness and soul development, need not be depreciated, even if it could be, as a means of exalting the authority and validity of science or exact knowledge. Regardless of how far behind the curtain of reality science has penetrated, or can penetrate, ultimate and infinite Truth will always elude the senses and the mind of mortal man and all the intuition he can bring to bear in scientific research. Reality brought to light by scient&e method and by inspired rationalizing of the human mind and spirit is not a fixed but an expanding quantity and quality, and there will always be plenty of room for the exercise of faith-the “essence of things hoped for but not seen,” We know from observation and experience that the scientific intellect of our day has not exhausted the reservoir of truth regarding the phenomenal world. The senses of sight, sound, feeling, smell, and taste, and all the analytical and synthetical powers of the reasoning minds of men of science cannot know all there is to be known in any branch of biological, physical, or psychic science, In whatever direction the searching mind of man looks and however far he may go in this direction, he is always con- fronted with the great challenge of the unknown. Not a single branch of science today can boast of knowing everything about it; there is probably much more to be learned in every field of science than man knows today."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"FAITH AND SCIENCE 89 So science still needs faith to beckon it on to higher vistas of truth; faith will always have its part to play in human devel- opment. In times past too much emphasis, especially in the field of psychic science, has been placed upon mere blind faith and not enough emphasis upon works and knowledge and upon the demonstrability by scientific methods of the conclusions of faith. Faith need not be apathetic and static; it can be made dynamic and revelatory by science; if we search, we shall find, and ultimately all that is hidden shall be revealed. Regardless of the extent to which Freemasons in the past have accepted on faith and without question the fact of the existence of the Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry, the mysteries of God, and the immortality of the soul, the time has now come when more members of the Craft should be persuaded to examine objectively and scientifically the cardinal principles of the Builder’s art. All need to know more about the Great Architect, about the Celestial Lodge Above, about themselves as “sparks of the divine fire,” about “soul development,” about the death of the body, about the immortality of the soul, about the mysterious implications that arise from these sublime con- cepts, about Masonic destiny and about the secret means by which one arrives at that destiny. Mere passing and passive faith in, mere incidental attention to, these marvelous and glorious ideas is no longer adequate to meet the spirit of inquiry that is emergent in the minds and souls of many men and Masons today. The stresses, the fears, the hopes of contemporary life are prompting more people to search without and (particularly) within themselves for some deeper analysis and a more fundamental synthesis that will bring into their lives a greater degree of mental and spiritual security. Men in larger numbers today are seeking more actively some kind of answers to the enigmas and problems of life, Masons will not hold faith in contempt because it has too often been blind and ignorant and accompanied by intolerance, bigotry, persecution, torture, and death; nor will they deride the scientific method because it has too often been productive of materialism and atheism. Faith and science (organized knowl-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"90 TKE MEANING OF MASONRY edge) are companions and partners in philosophy; they travel the same path to Masonic illumination, faith in advance beck- oning science on, and science following closely to protect and sustain faith by tangible evidence of Truth and reality. The purpose of Masonry is not to destroy any man’s faith. Masonry magnifies faith. One might say that Masonry places a tremendous strain upon human credulity by setting before its votaries the most exalted and transcendent objectives known to man. It is not easy to induce the rank and file of Masons to think in terms of the reality and practicality of such sublime concepts as the Celestial Lodge Above, the Supreme Architect of the Universe, that spiritual fabric, that house not made with hands, the brotherhood of man, Masonic illumination. The mind of mortal man, involved and engrossed with self-interests and’ unfamiliar with the science of the soul, recoils before the extrav- agances of these ideas as being so far above his capacity to understand and govern his life that he is prone to accept them on mere faith, which always remains blind, passive, and ineffec- tual as a transforming power in life. It is almost as if he prefers to live and die in darkness and ignorance regarding them, be- cause if he cared enough about learning more about them, there is nothing to stop him from doing so. Let all read and think, so that they too, along with their ancient Rrethren, can intellectually and spiritually put form and content and spirit into these marvelous ideas and so partake of the inexhaustible riches of their Ritual. Let the Ritual come alive: let thme be 1 ght i . For example, the Ritual speaks of the Celestial Lodge Above. Is there such a Lodge? If so, let us get some ideas about it that we can get our intellectual and spiritual teeth into. Let our faith in it be backed up with as much knowledge as possible for each of us. Men may say: “How can we know anything about such things?” Why do you think that expression was placed in the Ritual? Just to be mouthed over and over again as a fine phrase without any concrete meaning to have signifi- cance in the minds of men? No, the makers of our Ritual placed it there because they knew what they were talking about, be-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"FAITH AND SCYENm 91 cause it had meaning to them, and because they hoped. that men would search out its meaning. They never intended that anything they placed in the Ritual should be ignored as too inconsequential for or impossible of understanding to warrant the most careful thought of the Master Mason. The ancient Brethren knew what this phrase meant; they knew a great deal about the Celestial Lodge and they wrote some of the things they knew in books and manuscripts that have come down to the present day. If any Mason wants to know what they thought and wrote, he should go to those books to be lent from the Grand Lodge Library and to other sources which can be dis- covered by the earnest seeker for Masonic Light. To whatever extent “ignorance” is a synonym for “blind faith,” we must deny that it is a powerful force to increase rev- erence for God or to understand the mysteries of His wonder- ful creation; but we afFum with all assurance that the greater a man’s knowledge of God, the wider ,will he open the doors of his mind and heart to the influx of the divine spirit. It is a certainty that God blesses those who struggle to emerge from ignorance into the Light of knowledge, Truth, and wisdom. The more a man knows about the spirit and the works of God, the more Godlike he ultimately becomes. If as immortal spirits we are in essence and in Truth emanations from the godhead and have come into mortal bodies to learn how to become “perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect,” then we must emphasize the learning process as a dynamic personal respon- sibility and not as the passive acceptance of the thinking and authority of others. St. James exclaims, “By works was faith made perfect.” But works must be preceded by knowledge; the knower must know before the doer can do. God is a spirit and must be worshipped in spirit and in Truth, but “ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.” It takes mental and spiritual effort-work-to ascertain the Truth, and blind faith has often been a roadblock to the pursuit of the Truth of the wisdom of God for centuries past. And even in this age of so-called enlightenment it is still a roadblock. Blind faith induces passivity, apathy, and indifference, by which"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"92 THEl MEANING OF MASONRY the more fundamental and enduring aspects of reality are entirely ignored or relegated to a position of secondary impor- tance in life; Blind faith tends to produce static and crystallized thinking or feeling that causes men to be satisfied with a mere superficial expression of belief which blocks the expansive powers of thought and spirit. Many men, on being “made Masons,” declare that they believe in the existence of One Ever- living and True God, but up to the moment of death they never seek to know more of the meanings and implications of such a belief, Real desire for Light and More Light all through Life would transform blind faith into active faith, which is dynamic and expanding, as the frontiers of demonstrable truth are pushed back. Man, created in the image of God and possessing a portion of the divine fire ( Light), is the more in harmony with the divine purpose when all the marvelous powers of intellect and spirit are growing and expanding toward that wisdom and perfection symbolized by the Perfect Ashlar of Masonry. As knowledge grows, faith grows; knowledge of God does not diminish faith in God. Happier is the man whose active faith in God forever prompts him to seek the wisdom of God. Him will God reward! Let men avoid the pitfalls of blind faith. Too often blind faith has produced those crystallizations of thought called doc- trines and dogmas, which became the foundations for rigid creeds and priestcraft. Too often has blind faith been the mother of bigotry, intolerance, and arrogance which-motivated and abetted by eccle‘siastical and political power-has promoted the discrimination and persecutions of the early and -medieval Church. Too often has blind faith motivated condemnation as heretics of those whose ideas were not in conformity with those of the prevailing ecclesiastical and political authorities. Too often has blind faith prompted the use of torture, imprisonment, the racks and hot irons of the Inquisition, the burning of human beings at the stake for so-called heresy or witchcraft, so as to make men and women recant. Too often has blind faith been a contributing factor behind the terrible religious wars"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"FArrEX AND SaNCE: 93 of the past. Too often, in more recent times, has blind faith scorned-&e scientific method and spirit and endeavored to per- petuate its crystallizations by condemning and attempting to disprove the proved findings of science and build up an artificial barrier between science and religion. Our own Scriptures declare emphatically that man is created in the image of God and in Him we live and move and have our being. The Creator is described as giving man the privilege and power of exercising his free will, so that, as mortal man comes from God in a state of %nperfection,” * so will he, in his own good time and way, work his way back to God as a “perfected being.” By divine fiat man is free; and no man, no priest, no church, no government, should rightfully interfere with that natural and divine freedom, claiming the power to save a man’s soul thereby. What is salvation, that it can be con- ferred as a free gift by- one man upon another? The Truth is that salvation is earned by every man; and it is not within the power of any other man to confer it upon him or to take it from him. The Truth is that every man, again by divine fiat (natural law), reaps only as he sows, not as somebody else sows and by no other man’s authority. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” No, not in the sense that I win his salvation for him by telling him what to think and do or by persecuting him if he fails to obey. The ancient wisdom declares that every man, as an immortal soul, is his own savior, because if he does not save himself he will not be saved. And this is the view of modem Masonry-man is the Builder of his own immortal soul by both faith and works within the Lodge of his own body. All the great teachers and saviors of the past have proclaimed this same teaching; but the authority for its validity does not lie in the fact that it was so proclaimed, but in the- fact that it is in accord with the inner, natural consti- tution of man himself, as the image of his Creator. As the very soul of man cries out for freedom and the exercise of free will toward complete liberation, the soul of man also proclaims that * See beginn in of Chapter XVI, on the question “Why?’ g"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"94 THEl MEANING OF MASONRY the responsibility for personal progress back to God and libera- tion lies within the mind and conscience of the individual, not in any outside authority whatsoever. It is not the responsibility of any other man, or priest, or minister, or &w&, or govern- ment. No man is his “brother’s keeper,” so far as that would mean usurpation of an individual’s natural, God-given rights, sovereignty, autonomy, and responsibilities. If man had not the inner power to achieve it, his own redemption could not be achieved. But man, every man in a mortal body, does have this power, which is born with him as a “spark of the divine fire.” His redemption, his attainment to cosmic consciousness, philosophic initiation, lie within him in his possession of marvelous powers of mind and spirit, and it is not conferred upon him by any outside authority or power, except the power of God; man can neither take it from him nor confer it upon him. The kingdom of God is within you,” said the greatest of the great teachers. Latent and hidden within the soul of man lies the power to save himself through a process of seeking and working to know and apply the mys- teries of the Builder’s art and unfolding and manifesting at-one- ment from within the Sanctum Sanctorum of his own being. In summary, it is not blind faith and passive thinking, but dynamic faith and active thinking and doing, that will enable a man to consummate this process of regeneration, liberation, and salvation. Faith wilt always Zead the way; knowledge and wisdom will always follow closely behind faith to give it sub- stance, reality, and vitality. Thus shall science and religion be- come reconciled and, as a complete synthesis, shall confer the richest blessings upon mankind.

MASONRY encourages men to accept their role as spiritual fabric, but it also emphasizes that there Builders of a is a power in every man that will enable him to work toward that sublime goal. What a mockery, what a mummery, if the teachings of ancient Freemasonry had placed before men a goal that -they had no power to attain either on earth or in the heavens1 The ancient teachings declared-and modern psychology cor- roborates-that every man, no matter how deeply in the dark- ness of ignorance and error, has within himself, sometimes deep within himself, the marvelous power to lift himself out of dark- ness into light, out of ignorance into wisdom, out of error into righteousness. Indeed, if this is not the Truth, then the life of man on this earth would be meaningless and devoid of all hope amid the terrible tribulations and predicaments of a world of ignorant lunatics. The Great Archiiect could not have created men in His own image without endowing all with the inner capacity and potential- for redemption through the conquest of self in a long-term process of self-improvement on earth and in the heavens. Therefore Masonry teaches that redemption and salvation are both the power and the responsibility of the individual Mason. Saviors like Hiram Abiff can and do show the way, but men must always follow and demonstrate, each for himself, his power to save himself, to build his own spiritual fabric in his own time and way. Every man in essence is ‘his own savior and redeemer; for if he does not save himself, he will not be saved. The reader who succeeds in getting back to the real teachings of the masters, including Jesus of Nazareth, will find unanimity of thinking on this matter.

The great teachers of all ages, the progenitors of the sublime Ritual, have shown us the way; but if we do not follow in the way, what right have we to expect redemption and salvation as a gift from heaven and without effort on our part? Any man who thinks that he can get something for nothing is dwelling in a fool’s paradise and only Ykidding” himself. If some men think that the economy of earth is built upon that erroneous concept, how can they be expected to become aware of the fact that the economy of heaven is any different? But man rises by his own efforts both on earth and in the heavens, and there is no power that can confer upon him any gift that he has not earned in his own right.

You do not stop learning from cradle to grave, and there are no limitations upon your capacity to know the Truth except those you are born with or choose to place upon yourself. Know this also for a certainty: you do not stop the learning process when you divest yourself of your mortal body. There too in the heaven-world, you are subject only to such limitations as you have placed upon yourself. You must come to know that .the main purpose of life in the heavens is to find out what you did on earth that was wrong and imperfect; you must know that you shall abide in the superphysical world until you perceive and evaluate your character defects and weave your achieve- ments into the fabric of your faculty and character. This is the great work of the Builder, as proclaimed in the Sublime Degree of Master Mason. But as one sojourn on earth is not enough to enable a mind to demonstrate perfection in the various phases of personality and character, so obviously one sojourn in the heavens is not enough to enable the ego to adjudge its own merits and demerits and to weave the qualities of self-improvement into the patterns of character and into the texture of the soul. Our life in heaven can accomplish no more for us than we have laid the basis for in our life on earth. If heaven could do more for us than our life on earth makes possible, heaven would send to earth only those perfected spirits who could create a heaven on earth.

This shows that you are not yet ready for the Light that you have declared you most desire. That is your divine prerogative, your privilege to reject or receive the Light in accordance with your natural right of free will. But in view of the overwhelming evidence of personal survival, it would seem arbitrary and capricious to dismiss or ignore it without probing its depths and heights. Emotionally and inwardly, most people long for survival, continuation of life and consciousness, maintenance of individual and identical existence in time and eternity; and so far as we know, man is the only animal that does. Indeed, this fact can be properly cited as further evidence that man is essentially divine in a sense that the lower animals are not. The very thought of annihilation of individuality at death of the body is abhorrent to the mind, spirit, and soul of man-at least to most men. Life itself, consciousness, is held dear, desirable, and worthy of perpetuation by the vast majority of human beings; to think that it ceases at the grave is a violation of the instinc- tive desire and knowledge for its continued existence beyond the grave, What is the “I” that is the source and essence of life, that it can disintegrate and lose its identity merely because it no longer manifests itself on the physical plane in a mortal body? Why should any “I,” any “spiritual fabric,” be an individual identity just for the brief and fleeting time it is in a physical body or manifesting through a physical body? To the author it is unthinkable that the only power, the power of mind, spirit, and soul, that enables us to say, “I live in a physical body,” shall not have equal power to say, “I live,” when it leaves its physical personality at death.

No, belief that death is the end of all personal existence presents a greater enigma, a greater contradiction, a more inscrutable dilemma, a more unbearable affront to both reason and desire, than the blindest faith in personal survival and immortality could present or that denial of the existence of the soul could present. Logically and ration- ally it is much easier to present a case for immortality of the soul than to declare that the soul does not exist or, if it does, that it “dies” when the body dies. Even if scientific proof of survival is not available, can we not trust our instincts and intuitions, our inner longings, when we recognize them as such? Men are more than vegetables, insects, or animals, even those in whom it is most dif8cult to recognize anything divine. If their purpose on this earth then is to “improve themselves in Masonry,” it is rationally necessary to continue to live after the death of the body and (as I am convinced) to come back to physical-plane manifestation again and again to continue and complete the process of individual development to the ultimate stage of Masterhood, Fortunately the truth of this statement does not depend alone on blind faith, or logic, or intuition, or the desire to survive the grave. It can be fully-more fully than most of us think-substantiated by the findings of physical and psychic science. There is knowledge of survival that arises from the testimony of the physical senses; there is tangible and sensible evidence of survival of identity, a continued existence of the “I” in more tenuous bodies that are imperceptible to the physical senses, In the books listed above you will discover this evidence; and if you want tangible, personal proof, you may sometime obtain it by contact with those who understand and employ scientific methods in the field of psychical research.

There are whole octaves of vibratory light rays, “cosmic rays” from outer space, that most human beings are not even aware of. There is not a single sense that can make us aware of the passage of electromagnetic waves through our bodies. We know that there is such a thing as an electric current, or an electric impulse, but who has ever seen one? We know that so-called electromagnetic waves of many frequencies pervade the atmosphere, but who has ever seen or felt them? We know that the heat and light of the sun are transmitted through space as energy, but who has seen -or felt the substance of the transmitting medium? Scientists have posited as the transmitting medium an “ether” which vibrates or transmits vibrations at rates greatly exceeding those of any solid, liquid, or visible or invisible gas. From experience we know that the heavenly bodies we held in their orbits by what we call on earth “the force of gravity,” but who has ever seen or touched such a force? Surely enough we have felt the effects of such a force, because we are always adjusting our movements to it. As a matter of fact, the very existence of the material world by which we are surrounded, the very existence of our bodies, which we think so real, is dependent more upon the impact on them of the intangible and (mysterious and unconscious forces of nature than upon the known and measurable factors of life. There is no human chemist who knows as much as the unknown Chemist who guides the metabolism of every human, animal, and vegetable body animated by the life principle (whatever that is).

There is no human philos- opher who has been able to give a full answer to the question “Why this or that?” Xn view of the great volume of Truth that the finite mind of man has not yet been able to perceive through his weak and limited senses, it behooves us to learn the virtue of humility. The chemist, the physicist, the biologist, the physician, the theologian, the philosopher-not one of them knows all there is to be known in his field alone, to say nothing of the other fields of human science. Instead of puffing himself up with pride of superior erudition, as many appear to do, every one of them should humble himself reverently before the unknown and acknowledge how comparatively little he really knows. He should know that no matter how far he may push aside one curtain of Truth, there will always be a succession of curtains that will still hide ultimate reality from his physical senses. Paul the Apostle expressed this idea well when he declared that “spiritual things must be spiritually discerned.” If this is true, large volumes of Truth are concealed from the consciousness of the materialistic scientist who does not admit the validity of “spiritual things .” What a limited range of scientific truth can be covered by the thinker who is content to rely only upon what the senses can reveal to him!

What makes an object seem “real”? The word may be briefly defined as “The state or quality of being in existence, or of being actual; that which exists or is actual; fact; truth.” The mind of man ascribes existence, actuality, “out-there-ness,” to the objects of the physical world around him; he says such objects are real because he can see them, or touch them, or hear them, or smell them, or taste them. Because of various sense impressions man can ascribe a great variety of qualities and characteristics to such objects, like form, size, color, composition, weight, and many others. But the evidence of reality as revealed to the thinker by, or through, the senses comes from the mind of man, the thinker, the see-er, the hearer, the feeler, the smeller, the taster. If an object is “out there” and has certain characteristics peculiar to itself, it is so because of the power of the human mind to use words descriptive of the object and its phenomena and to declare that it is “out there.” The ball is round; but it would not be “round” if the mind of man did not declare it to be a fact, real, The ascription of reality to objects of the physical world is 0 mental act, (This concept of reality and consciousness is more fully treated in Chapter XIV, “The Real and the Occult Rec- onciled,“) Now consider the word %onsciousness.” An organism can be said to be conscious when it is “alive,” and -it can be said to be “alive” when it is conscious. All living creatures, from the minutest microscopic virus or cell to man, the most complex organism of earth, possess this characteristic which human beings have been taught from childhood to call “consciousness.” “Consciousness” can be defined as “The knowledge of that which passes in one’s own mind; the state of being aware of this knowledge; perception, sensation, feeling; the apprehension of"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"110 THE MEANING OF MASONRY the existence of some object, state, or influence; the sum total of all that one perceives, knows, feels, or thinks; the entire mental life of a sentient being.” Although the word ‘life” is not prom- inently mentioned anyhere in this definition, “consciousness” is nevertheless synonymous with ‘life,” The life principle, what- ever it is in essence, manifests itself in forms in nature that have varying degrees of consciousness. There is no consciousness where there is no life and no life where there is no consciousness. The power to respond to stimuli, to move, to breathe, to sustain life in a physical body by the ingestion of food, to propagate the species, is characteristic of all animate forms. Consciousness, varying from simple response of chemical affinities and response to stimuli of heat, light, and moisture to the infinite sweep of the “cosmic mind” is always associated with the life principle in every form; perhaps it is the life principle itself. In God, the Universal Consciousness, all things ‘live and move and have their being.” Philosophers declare that the life principle and some degree of consciousness inhere in every particle of matter or assemblage of particles in the Universe from animalcule to man, from atom to cosmos. Life and consciousness are not sustained by what human beings can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste; what human beings can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste is caused and sus- tained by the intangible, immeasurable, imponderable mysteri- ous forces and activities of consciousness and life. Wherever and whenever consciousness and life appear, they are Cause, of which forms, phenomena, and characteristics of the manifested universe are but effects, Out of the ocean of the unknown comes the drop of the known; out of the infinite comes the finite; out of the macrocosm comes the microcosm; out of the untreated and unmanifest come the created and manifest; out of cause proceeds effect. Thus has the finite mind of mortal man learned to declare when he rationally views the phenomena of earth and the heavens.

Man ascribes consciousness to himself; he is aware that he is conscious, that he has life. So far as we know no other animal is thus aware. If therefore there were no conscious human beings on this planet to declare the existence, the reality, of Universal Consciousness of which they are but a part, how could there be such a concept as “Universal Consciousness”? Men ascribe reality and univer- sality to the power of which they recognize themselves but a part and of which they feel themselves but a minute and shadowy representation. God exists in the Universe because He first made Himself manifest in man; He created man ‘7.n His own image and likeness”; therefore man through consciousness and intellect developed the power to recognize himself as a part of divinity. God manifests Himself in the physical world as thought incar- nate. If men were not divine in essence, or had no power to rec- ognize themselves as divine, how could they ascribe divinity to Universal Mind? The drop has an affinity for the ocean as the ocean does for the drop, but there could be no ocean without the drop and no drop without the ocean. The finite mind of man (human consciousness) is but a drop in the ocean of Infinite Mind ( divine consciousness), but there can be no “ocean of divine consciousness” unless and until the drop of human con- sciousness becomes aware of it.

Such a declaration can come only from that form of self-consciousness that characterizes the highest animal, man. Of all the animals man alone has the power to declare that there is a God, or that there is no God, or that man has a soul that is an emanation from God. From infancy, by coming to know the meaning of words, man has to learn to make such a declaration.

If the consciousness of human beings did not have the power to ex- press itself in words that have meaning to their own mind and to convey to other minds the thoughts and concepts that have validity and reality in the minds of the thinkers, there could be no Creator and no creation. From the beginning of childhood until we lose consciousness in “death,” the most important factor in life in all its motivations and relations is the number of words of which we know the meanings and by which we express the degree of our individual consciousness. It is the Word that makes us human, and it is the Word that invests us with the potencies of divinity. “In the beginning . . . God said [expressed Himself by the use of words], ‘Let there be Light’ [Let there be con- sciousness, life, knowledge, wisdom, divine science, on all levels of human existence] : and there was Light [the thought of God made manifest] .” In the beginning was the Word of creative power, and the Word was in the divine mind, and the Word was divine intelligence, the Universal Consciousness. But if there were no human beings endowed with the power of the Word, the mind-stuff of thoughts and concepts regarding the phenom- enal world, who could declare the existence of a Creator or the realities of a creation? Who has ever heard an imbecile declare the glories of God or the beauties of nature? A dog can see a glorious sunrise but he has no word with which he makes his awareness known to himself or to another dog or to man. It is through the use of words that man has been endowed with the creative power of God. The finite mind of man declares the glories of infinite mind, which in turn are dimly reflected in the marvelous mind of man. Reality is the growing creature of an expanding consciousness.

It recog- nizes man’s age-long search for his own soul and his Quest for the Universal Soul. There is no limit in the finite mind to reality. As our consciousness expands through the use of words and concepts, the limits of what we call real and beneficial to human consciousness and life are pushed back and back, life upon life, until we shall know who and what we are and shall find our- selves in the presence of the Mason’s God in the Celestial Lodge Above. At that time in our career as a Builder, we shall per- ceive the reality of what we have always thought to be unreal and too sublime to be understood or appreciated. That which we dimlv sensed as Truth in Masonry will sooner or later become as real as the existence appears to be.

Some men of every generation have known more than others about the hidden or “occult” Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry as well as about the immediate and ultimate realities of life on this earth. In its broadest sense the word “occult” can be properly ap- plied to the great volume of science (body of possible knowl- edge) that remains unknown or hidden from the individual. The human mind and spirit concern themselves with the whole range of the known as well as the unknown regarding either the phys- ical or the so-called “superphysical” world. The common belief . that the word “occult” applies only to those speculations and “hallucinations” of the mystic enthusiast that cannot be tested and proved by the criteria of science is the erroneous conclusion of those who declare that what they cannot see, hear, feel, smell, or taste does not exist. They do not stop to consider that in the upward development of the race the most important factor has been the mind, intellect, and spirit of man in the progressive apprehension and application of the Truths of na- ture. In this restless and growing process, it has always been true, and is still true today (in spite of our boasted science), that the volume of the unknown is vaster by far than the volume of the known. And what is unknown todav in all fields of DOS- sible knowledge can properly be called ‘:occult”---hidden from the senses and mind of man and awaiting discovery, revelation, and technological application. There is no scientific reason for ignoring, depreciating, or ridiculing the “occult” merely because it is unknown; this conclusion applies just as much to the so- called hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry as to any other field of human knowledge. The occult phases of Masonry-should not be ignored by those who can see in Masonry only- an out- ward moral order or by those whose minds are under the in- fluence of the prevailing materialistic philosophy."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"116 THE MEANING OF MASONRY Every person born in a body on this earth, each within the limitations of his own heredity and environment, is mentally and spiritually forever confronted with the barrier of the occult or unknown. No matter how much he knows about himself or the phenomenal world, the unknown or hidden realities will always elude his senses and challenge his best thought, experimentation, and intuition. Every man continually, be it ever so little or much, pushes back veil upon veil that hide Truth and reality until, as Jesus proclaimed, “there is nothing hidden that shall not be known” to him. Otherwise, what can be the purpose of existence on this earth? This process of revelation and perception of Truth is a cosmic one in time and space on this earth and in the timelessness and spacelessness of the heavens. There is no such thing as one sudden illumination that reveals aEZ that is occult, hidden, un- known. Ultimate Truth always recedes, as does the horizon in an earthly journey; at every advance we learn that so much is still hidden from our view that what we know is but a minute fraction of the knowable. The occult world of the physical and the superphysical holds a universe of Truth that becomes real and palpable only as we diligently and persistently search for and discover it, each for himself. The ocean of hidden Truth is infinite in space and time; the variable of the drop of Truth in every individual is finite and real and continually approaches its lim.it of infinity and ultimate reality. Viewed scientifically, there is no conflict between the real and the occult, any more than there is between the verities of science and the verities of religion. In view of these facts, why should any thinking person raise an eyebrow of doubt or disbelief in what is not understood or is hidden, the so-called occult, and tacitly or volubly accuse those who claim to know the hidden realities of being “tetched in the head”? IIow easy it is, even for the so-called intelligent, to avoid the trouble of investigating and evaluating the evidence that establishes the reality of what is unknown and may become known.

Thus even among more intelligent people appears a deep and uncompromising suspicion of anything that smacks of the “occult”; they tend to think that what they do not know scientifically cannot be known and has no semblance of reality. How puerile such a conclusion1 The fact is that the whole of life is full of the occult; much more is still hidden than has been revealed in every branch of science. There is no evidence in science for a static concept of reality; science advances on every front and will always do so. In my lifetime every branch of science has substantially increased its scope and expression of Truth, and new revelations of what was previously hidden and unknown have been made. And there are striking evidences in the current scene that the achievements of new knowledge and technology of the next hundred years will far eclipse those of the past century. If, for example, half a century ago anybody had revealed to me that the time would soon come when the “science of elec- tronics” would be so far developed as to enable me, in the privacy of my own living room, to see pictures and hear words “projected” into space many miles away and transmitted by no tangible means, perhaps I would then have declared him a nitwit, a dreamer, a miracle-monger. The science behind this miraculous invention was unknown, ‘bccult,” at that time, and remains so to this day to most persons. We already take tele- vision for granted, though the science of it is still magical and occult to most of us and perhaps only less so to the men whose knowledge and use of electromagnetic waves (whatever they are) made it possible.

In all ages-and, it seems, particularly in this age--The oc- cult” becomes “the real” as the hidden becomes revealed and the unknown becomes the known. The following quotation from Sri Aurobindo’s T/W Life Divine throws additional light on this theme and encourages every man in the certainty that, if the occult and unknown present a problem to his intellect, he also possesses undeveloped faculties and powers which, if de- veloped, will enable him to bring this new knowledge into the realm of scientifk reality: The Unknown is not the Unknowable; it need not remain un- known for us, unless we choose ignorance or persist in our first limitations. For to all things that are not unknowable, all things in the Universe, there correspond in that universe faculties which can take cognizance of them, and in man, the microcosm, these faculties are always existent and at a certain stage capable of de- velopment. We may choose not to develop them; where they are partially developed, we may discourage and impose on them a kind of atrophy, But, fundamentally, all possible knowledge is knowledge within the power of humanity. And, since in man there is the inalienable impulse of Nature toward self-realization, no struggIe of the intellect to limit the action of our capacities within a determined area can forever prevail. When we have proved Matter and realized its secret capacities, the very knowl- edge which has found its convenience in that temporary limita- tion must cry to us . . . “Forth now and push forward also in other fields .” If this is a correct appraisal of the real powers of the mind, in- tellect, and spirit of every person born into flesh, then no man need despair of his innate ability to discover and comprehend the unknown, the occult, and to make it real to himself in his conscious efforts at self improvement in Masonry. For if man as a “child of God,” born in His image and likeness, is destined to achieve the transcendent goals of Masonry, man must possess the active or potential faculties and powers that are equal to the herculean tasks which life in bodies imposes upon him, Do not recoil from the unknown as if it were unknowable. “Forth now"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"!JYHE REAL AND THE OCCULT REZONCILIED 119 ad push forward”; travel in foreign countries.

Why do Masons recoil from this view of Masonry? Let me &e the main reasons as I have observed them: 1 e 2. 3. Because of educational defects, they lack the background knowledge that is necessary for a fuller understanding of and greater interest in the cryptic, or “occult,” passages and allegories of the Ritual. They allow the beautiful language of the Ritual to pass into meaningless jargon, which they label “nice” and “fine,” but which, like their religion, is “too much to understand.” They are too much engrossed and preoccupied with mate- rial interests and compulsions to be willing to sacrifice time and effort to try to find out what they do not understand or what they have‘no interest in. They do not believe that man does not live by bread alone, The ordinary benefits of Masonry that come within experi- ence and comprehension afford sufficient satisfactions and leave no time or incentive for probing deeper into the occult phases of Masonry. If these reasons explain indifference to the real purposes of Masonry among members and leaders of the Craft, they repre- sent the materialistic characteristics of Western culture. It is probably true also that since the leaders come from the ranks of those who have devoted many years to Masonic service and have received many honors at the hands of the Brethren, we should not expect that they know much more about the real purposes of Masonry than the members of their respective Lodges. However, no matter how much more the leaders may know, they probably can go but little further in spreading such knowledge among the Craft than their Brethren in the Lodges are willing and able to go.

The coming era may require that the real purposes of our Order must again be re- stored to their rightful place of emphasis, just as they were in the ancient Lodges. Perhaps upon this development will depend the perpetuity of the Order as we know it now. There are, however, those who would claim that the failure of the leaders and members of the Craft to recognize and empha- size the occult character of the Ritual carries no necessary dan- ger to the perpetuation of the Order in its present form. They might even reason that it is better to attract and attempt to hold in a fraternal relation and moral Order many men who will, it is hoped, benefit by its fellowship, its honors and duties, and its charities than it would be to limit membership to the very few who, in an age of materialism, have the interest and ability to profit by its inner and real purposes. It can properly be claimed that a man can improve himself in Masonry by partici- pation in the activities of a Lodge, and that such participation fills a great need among many men, Modern Masonry is aptly called ‘Speculative” because it encourages men to ponder and meditate on all phases of Ma- sonic science. Rut unlike ancient Freemasonry, it does not im- pose upon any man particular interpretations of the cryptic passages of the Ritual or any particular disciplines whereby a man can learn to subdue his passions and improve himself in j Masonry.

Amidst the materialism of our time, it seems a futile gesture to remind men that the spiritual value of paying some attention to those “wisdom teachings” exceeds all material riches which in the name of happiness they so vainly struggle to ac- quire-only to relinquish them when death strikes. Material riches often fail to bring that happiness that mortal mind as- cribes to their possession, and at death they are left behind; their potency for either weal or woe ceases, except as the mind and soul are then free to contemplate their true worth. But if a man by conscious efforts learns more of that wisdom, which will lie hidden from him until he brings it to light, the fine gold of that divine gnosis will be added to his soul essence; and it will remain with him forever during all his sojourns on earth and in the heavens. This was what Jesus meant when he quoted from the Old Testament: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Learn to recognize the existence of a vast unknown, a world hidden from your present view; be stimulated to search for segments of it that meet your present needs and capacity. By knowing more you will ultimately learn to do better, and so will progress from triumph to triumph until, at perhaps some distant great day, a final initiation will confer upon you all the Light (spiritual illumination) that can be conferred upon a man in a mortal body, and you will arrive at the same status of spiritual power and expression achieved by all the Master Builders who have gone this way before you."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"c HAPTER XV “VVILL I HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE?” Wrz SHALL here develop an idea that should, it seems to me, encourage every Mason who wishes to take the expressed and implied purposes of Masonry seriously and to find out more about the science of the soul as a means of more rapid prog- ress in Masonry. Most men and Masons who pay any attention to them look with despair or discouragement upon the rich promises of the Ritual as something so far out of their com- prehension that they would be foolish to spend time in an attempt to understand them and make them more real and effective in their lives. Masonry holds out the hope of heaven (immortality) to every one of its votaries, but it also declares that in order to be permitted to sit in the Celestial Lodge Above, the aspirant must subdue his passions and improve himself in Masonry. There is no short cut or “royal road” to heaven and immortality, a permanent residence in that “undis- covered country”; like every other good thing, it must be worked for, achieved, earned. Sooner or later in the long life of every true Builder of a spiritual fabric he will have occasion to give more serious thought to these paramount questions: ‘7Vhat have I done to merit the joys of heaven? How much do I know about the Builder’s art? How many of the teachings of Masonry have I woven into the texture of my character and Soul stature?

If any Mason holds such an idea, let him look at his Brethren, at him- self, and at the people of his world and judge how far away they and he are from the true Masonic goal. If there is only one chance, one life in a human body, and if his whole future in eternal life depends upon what he does while in the body, is this not a most discouraging prospect for the man who cares? Why should a man be committed to a program of self-improve- ment as a Mason unless he has the fullest opportunity to carry it through while in a physical body? If he does not make sub- stantial progress in the Builder’s art in a whole lifetime as a Mason, and this is his last chance, shall he forever be excluded from the Celestial Lodge because he has not subdued his pas- sions and earned “salvation” by wisdom and works? Is not this “where” instinctively in his heart he wants to be when he has passed the portal of death? Is this not the ultimate haven of his eternal Quest? Let him not delude himself, however, into believing that when he has given up his mortal body his chances of improving himself in Masonry will be any more adequate in heaven than they were on earth. The law of action and reaction, of labor and reward, applies to him in the heaven-world just as it does on the earth plane. If one has made little progress in self-improve- ment here on earth, his rate of progress will not be substantially greater in heaven. If a man is a devil, or acts as if he were “full of the devil” here on earth, he does not suddenly become an angel when he leaves his mortal body. If a man did become an angel after death, one could properly and logically wonder why he was born into a body at all, or why it was necessary to come here even once. If his whole spiritual evolution could take place in heaven, why be born on earth? If the “angelic” state is the better of the two states of being and could be completely at- tained in heaven, the need and purpose of life in a physical body on the earth plane would be eliminated, Why then come heie at all, only to suffer “the slings and arrows of an outrageous"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"124 THl3 MEANING OF MASONRY fortune”? Millions upon millions of people here on earth go through a veritable hell of labor, unhappiness, pain, and suffer- ing in their blind efforts at self-improvement. If heaven could give them the peace, happiness, and the pleasure they seek, they would prefer to remain in that state of being and living forever; they would never choose to be born again on earth. But heaven cannot grant them more than they have earned on earth. Millions may long for the bliss of heaven; but no man, or even God Himself, will violate the inexorable law of com- pensation by granting any man more than he has earned either here or hereafter. If he seeks happiness, peace, security, and Light of heaven, let him “divest himself of all the vices and superfluities of life” here on earth and thus earn the right and beipme worthy to occupy “that house not made with hands eternal in the heavens.” Masonry recognizes no magic in dying that suddenly trans- forms an evil spirit on earth into an angelic spirit in heaven, or that suddenly makes a man infallible in knowledge when he, an ignoramus, divests himself of his earthly mantle. If he is in ig- norance and spiritual darkness on earth in a physical body, he will still be in ignorance and spiritual darkness in heaven in his “spiritual” body. We know and are what we have achieved by effort both here and hereafter. In our thinking we should never lose sight of this truly Masonic fact. The ancient masters of the wisdom, including Jesus of Naz- areth, taught this sublime truth, The Masonic Ritual emphasizes this truth when it uses the word “Builder.” The true Mason is a Builder of his “spiritual fabric,” and as such must be a thinker, a worker, a doer, an achiever. At no time in the life of his immortal soul, whether in or out of a physical body, can he build without thinking and planning and doing. Our Great Architect has ordained it thus, and only thus can we place our- selves in harmony with His divine law, purpose, and plan as we ascend the heights of Masonic illumination and destiny.

The writer is not the first to declare that the teaching of rein- carnation, of rebirth into flesh again and again, is implied in the teachings of Masonry. Other commentators, especially those who trace modem Speculative Masonry back to its ancient origins, have found the teaching of multiple rebirths a most important part of that divine gnosis that is designated in the Ritual as the hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry+ One commentator, George H. Steinmetz, wrote a most illuminating book entitled The Royal Arch, Its Hidden Meaning, in which he declared without reservation that “an understanding of the Chapter De- grees is impossible” without a background of understanding of the doctrine of reincarnation and karma, He wrote: These degrees are so largely based on that doctrine, which they symbolically illustrate, that, if tho doctrine of reincarnation is withdrawn, or if any attempt is made to interpret the symbols"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"126 THE MEANING OF MASONRY by any other means, these symbols become meaningless. . . . The doctrine of reincarnation holds that man was first a spiritual being . . . he “fell,” or descended, from his high estate into matter, physical bodies. . . , All the symbology of Freemasonry depicts man’s journey back to his lost perfection and is intended to assist him to accelerate his progress by teaching him how to more quickly accomplish his purpose? To clarify this teaching for the reader it is well to quote Steinmetz at length. The following is one of the best statements I have ever seen on this theme: According to this doctrine man lives on this earth in a physical body, not once, but many, many times. He learns the, lessons needed and intended in one incarnation, he experiences that which is called “death.” After a period of time spent in a spiritual state he again incarnates, starting this next life at the highest level attained in the preceding life and so on, and on, for in- carnation after incarnation, always upward, evolving slowly toward the ultimate goal, continuing to work out his evolution from birth to birth in accordance with Immutable Universal Law. His objective is to perfect himself that he may attain that ordained spirituality where no more lessons will need to be learned, no more experiences are necessary. Then he need not again incarnate on this earth. As the Eastern Occultist would say, “He is freed from the wheel.” As Masonry phrases it, ‘having made of the rough ashlar the perfect ashlar, he takes his place as a living stone in that spiritual building, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” Brother Steinmetz has also written a companion book en- titled Fwenuzsony, Its Hidden Meaning, dealing with Masonry in general and the first three degrees in particular. The doctrine of reincarnation and karma (pp. 12344) is mentioned as part of the ancient wisdom from which modern Speculative Masonry is derived in its religious or philosophical aspects.

Masonry is concerned to know what a man is, whence he came, what he came here to do, where he is going, and how he can plan to get there. These questions are answered in the Ritual in such a manner as to conceal the Truth concerning the origin, manifestation, unfoldment, and destiny of the human soul as it exists and functions in time and eternity.

Many contemplative minds want a more complete answer to the question ‘71rho am I?” than, for example, “I am John Jones.” As a personality, he is John Jones, but that answer refers only to his body and conscious mind and all their external character- istics and qualities. Many people want to know more about themselves than the name whereby their personality is tempor- arily distinguished; they want to know more particularly who or what they really are mentally and spiritually, as souls. They declare, perhaps from early training or reading or hearsay, that they believe that they have an immortal soul, but they often conclude that they cannot be sure of its existence or know much about it. So the question ‘Who am I?” needs to be an- swered for those members of the Craft who want to look beneath the surface of Masonic symbolism and bring to light the basic Truth hidden therein, “Seek and ye shall find” the Truth in Masonry as it applies to you as an immortal soul, Who is it that comes here into the Lodge of this body? The answers to your fundamental life problems are to be found in the ancient wisdom from which, by various circuitous routes, modern Speculative Masonry is derived and which ante- dates Christianity by thousands of years. This ancient wisdom was the best thought of many of the great masters who preceded Jesus of Nazareth regarding the origin, evolution, and destiny of man as an individualized soul entity. Though Jesus also taught this same divine wisdom to those of his disciples who could comprehend it, yet with the rise to dominance in the fourth century A.D. of the so-called “Christian Church” this di- vine knowledge was suppressed as heresy; and it is still regarded as heresy by every Christian Church on earth, whether “Funda- mentalist” or “Liberal.”"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"%ILL I HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE?- 129 How did the ancient masters, including Jesus, answer the question ‘Who am I?” They all declared that in essence every man born in a body is a soul that emanated from the Oversoul. Masons acknowledge that the Supreme Intelligence, “the Great Architect of the Universe,” has created and is still creating His Universe. He is regarded as “the All-in-all” containing all that is manifest to man as well as all that is not manifest to man. The next step in this concept of Deity is the acknowledgment that, as a part of the Universal Soul or Divine Intelligence, the real entity of man must survive the death of his body and live forever as a “child of God.” What meaning, otherwise., can you ascribe to your life in a body? The word “individualized” is used to describe a fundamental characteristic of the soul entity. It means that, though the ani- mating intelligence and spirit of man emanated from, or is a part of, the universal spirit, at a certain point in its upward striving and development it began to maintain its identity as an “individual,” a “that which can no longer be divided” or “that which maintains its identity through all its experiences on earth and in the heavens.” The life principle that animates every form that lives on this earth is, for the period of its tenure in the form, “divided off” from the “reservoir of universal life”; and when the form perishes, the life principle (whatever it is) re- turns to its proper reservoir. It has no individuality of its own; it has “dividuality” in that it can reactivate a succession of such forms that are in nature in the process of evolution. But there comes a time in the process of development of consciousness in bodies when the “consciousness” upon leaving its form (body) does not return to be merged again into the reservoir of con- sciousness but maintains its identity as a conscious unit in time and eternity. It is no longer “divided off” from Universal Gon- sciousness every time it manifests in a form; consequently it con- tinues to be an “individual,” a continuing identity, in the long (cosmic) process of its human evolution in a succession of bodies.

Jesus, it must be added, is “our etim Brother.” He came from God earlier than any of us did; but we follow the same natural law on the level of time that he did and we have the same destiny that he achieved on 4Sis same path. Otherwise (to the writer at least), these ‘lard gaying” passages of Scripture have no meaning at all. If the ader learns to *understand and comprehend what Jesus has Nld us in the Great Light, he can place the fullest trust in the Tmth of his words, even those words as they have come down ti US perhaps garbled and distorted.

If the answer to this question is taken literally, it has no meaning at all. I challenge any Masonic thinker to make any sense out of a literal rendition. But when the thinker realizes that it refers symbolically to the sublime Truth that we all come “from the Celestial Lodge Above where the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides,” then both question and answer take on tremendous meaning, Jesus repeatedly de- clared that he came from the Father, and every man will so declare when he is ready to do so. An ancient Scripture declares: “As from fire, sparks, being like unto fire, fly forth a thousand fold, so do we, my Brothers, come forth from the Infinite and return thither also.” If we really mean what we say-that the Soul is now in its body, that the Soul will exist forever-then the inquiring mind will naturally ask: “Did the soul exist as a sepa- rate entity before it took this body?” And if so, where did it come from? If we are individualized entities, or identities, nou, in this h~dy possessing vast differences in qualities of mind and spirit, what logic is there in denying that we were entities and identities bq~re we took on this body? We came (into bodies) as “sparks of the divine f&-e,” as separate entities, or parts, of the universal creative energy, divine spirit. Our original home was the Celestial Lodge Above, the “heavens” of the Great Light in Masonry. It is indeed that “spark of divine fire” within us that illumines our minds and enables us to become Master Masons, or Builders of that spiritual fabric. Without that spark of divinity we would be no more than the clods, plants, and animals of the earth. Masonry teaches clearly that what distinguishes one man from another is the difference in the qualities of his mind and soul, those internal (not the external) qualities upon which Masonry places the major em- phasis in the Ritual. Why should one man be different from another in the unfolding and manifestation of these qualities unless it represents different achievements in his past history as a separate identity? Not all of us are on the same rung of the ladder of achievement; not all are at the same place on the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"“WILL I HAVE ANOTHER CHAptTCX?” 133 path of illumination; the spirit of Jesus Christ, or of Hiram AbifF, is not at the same stage of unfoldment in all of us. We have been different from one another down through the eternity of the past and we are different from one another today. We have built this present character from past achievements in the same way as we are now building our characters as Master Builders in our present bodies. And as we have come here at this time and place to improve ourselves in Masonry, so have we come here many times before from the Celestial Lodge for the same purpose. The very same creative purpose that brought us here this time in mortal bodies has brought us here many times in the long and unremembered past. We have been exer- cising the Builder’s art all down through the millennia and con- stantly improving ourselves in Masonry. We have come many times7 in different ages and among different peoples on this planet to gain the necessary experiences through which we learn the lessons of life; though we do not remember particular in- stances” of being in a body before we took our present ones, yet the memory of all past sojourns in different bodies is with us now in the guise of whatever stage of character development we may have achieved. Each of us has therefore always been a Mason-in truth and reality, though not always a member of a Lodge of Speculative Masonry. Thus the question “Whence came you. 3” takes on scientific and philosophical and logical meaning; and Masons get an an- swer that will enable them to open to their inquiring minds the windows of the soul for the better ingress and egress of the Light in Masonry that they seek in time and in eternity. r . o There are on record in the annals of societies for psycl~ical research authenticated instances where a person in a body has remembered a past incarnation-details of environment, parents, relatives, a different language.

Whither am I going?” Glimpses of the answers that Masonry gives to these questions appear elsewhere in this book; but so far as I can determine, the Ritual of the fist three de- grees is silent on the questions, “Why was I not created perfect in the first place when I appeared in a human body, as a child of God, created in His image? Why all this struggle to attain perfection over, say, a million years of births, lives, and deaths on the physical plane?” Millions of harassed and frustrated people in human bodies ask every day: “Why must I go through all this hell on earth?” Even for the more thoughtful among them, no satisfactory answer comes to finite mind, either from the depths of the human soul or from the pronouncements of the philosophers who have spent years and years pondering this inscrutable mystery of life. How few human beings, in the midst of affliction, have or develop the capacity to see any relation between such affliction and the development of their own character and soul qualities! They cry out with varying degrees of emotional anguish: “Why should this happen to me? What have I done to deserve this?” If they do not find an answer from their own reasoning and reflections on the purposes and destiny of life in a body, there will be no answer at all. Not knowing the cause of suffering, they find no ways to alleviate it by elimination of its causes. It is no answer to them to declare that it is by tribulation, as effect, that we learn to discover its cause and to act intelli- gently to eliminate it. Suffering therefore continues until it arouses capacity to cope with it understandingly. Common sense would dictate to any person that there must be some cause"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE SOUL’S LONG JOURNEY 135 for every effect, so that if he suffers, there must be some reason for it. In many of the experiences of life the causes are quite obscure or difficult to perceive, but diligent and patient search- hg will reveal them and deliberate and intelligent action can be taken to avoid them and their inevitable effects. Sooner or later all things that are hidden and mysterious shall be revealed to him who acquires the moral and spiritual strength to continue his search for answers to the enigmas of life. There is no record that before Adam partook of the “for- bidden fruit” of the “tree” that stood in the “garden of Eden” he was ever sick, or suffered, or sorrowed; he was perfectly ad- justed to his environment and led an angelic and happy life. One gathers that he was quite childlike in his innocence and that, having been created in the image of God, he was a perfect being in the beginning of his earthly career. He was a child of God. For some inscrutable reason God is depicted as placing in the Garden “the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” and forbidding Adam to partake of its fruit; but Adam, childlike and curious, “disobeyed” God and brought upon himself and all his progeny down to the present day all the tribulations, sins, sorrows, and suffering that come from a knowledge of both good and evil, by which knowledge and our herculean endeavors in its use we are in the process of working our way back to God again as perfected men. From Eden and Adamic man, angelic man, perfect man, to imperfect, sinful, sorrowing man and back again to perfect, sinless, happy man in God’s garden of Eden at last! This is the $64,000 question: Why was the “fall of man” necessary? Can the deep meaning of this Adamic allegory ever be deciphered by the finite mind of man? Can the slightest light be thrown upon this mystery by further reasoning? Let us look further. Human beings have learned to ascribe to the Creator the attribute of “perfection.” Jesus on one occasion was moved to exclaim: “Ye, therefore, shall be perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect.” If God is perfect and possesses (as we are sure He does) the other attributes of omni-science and omni- potence, if God is all-perfect, all-wise and all-powerful, one may"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"136 THE MEANING OF MASONRY properly wonder why, since we come from God, we are so im- perfect and have to spend so vast a time to become perfect again and thus fulfill the purpose and destiny for which we take mortal bodies and go through such terrible tribulations again and again. There can be no doubt but that in essence, in regard to the mysterious life principle and in regard to the soul that consti- tutes the inner potency of every human being on earth, man is a divine being, or a being with the potentialities of divinity. Man is God made manifest on the physical plane, for “in him we live and move and have our being.” God expresses Himself in man even as man expresses himself in God. Jesus declared: “The Father is in me, and I am in the Father”; and in one strikingly significant passage he also declared his approval and verification of the statement of the Psalmist, “Ye are gods,” as it applies to all men on earth. Every man has in him the potentiaEities of divinity and of the perfection of divinity. But what do we see when we look around at the children of God and when we take a good look at ourselves? Ignorance and sin, disobedience to the laws of God and man, vice, crime, dis- ease, sorrow and suffering, unhappiness, frustration, pestilence, war and death-all these make of earth a veritable hell from which some people attempt to escape by suicide and which most people appear to tolerate without enthusiasm or ‘any ra- tional understanding of why they are here and what to do about it. Millions and millions of God’s creatures designated as human beings appear to have no clear concepts that enable them to account for either the benefits and rewards or the ills and woes of life on this planet. Poverty of mind and spirit is accompanied by poverty and deprivation in material blessings. They are the “children of God,” created in the “image of God”; yet we find many of them sunken and depraved, sinning like the prodigal son, ignorant and perverse, not too far above the animal in moral and spiritual attainment, hostile to society in crime, the enemy of their neighbors in business, wronging, cheating, defrauding, selfish, and avaricious! Yet Jesus is recorded as saying: “Every life, no matter how humble, no matter how tragic, no matter how"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE SOUL’S LONG JOURNEY 137 broken or thwarted, hath a meaning and an inner glory, and is precious in my sight.” What a mystery is here! So far as I can ascertain from a study of Masonic science, masonry accepts man czs he is (indeed, of what avail would it be if Masonry did not accept man as he is?), and no Masonic philos- opher has attempted to explain why he is as he is. That, indeed, a a mystery which no thinker of the past has attempted to reveal to mankind. At one place in the Ritual men are referred to as “weak, frail mortals” who should rely upon the Great Architect of the Universe for support, protection, and deliverance. Ma- sonry accepts a man as he is at any time in his soul’s develop- ment and does not ask the question: 7Vhy were so many men meated so much lower than the angels that they appear to be but little higher than the apes?” Masonry asks not why I come here a sinner, but for what purpose I came here as I am, at this time, Masonry looks to tie future of men as Builders of a spiritual fabric, And the Masonic neophyte answers clearly and unmistakably: “I came here to subdue my passions and improve myself in Masonry.” The question is not why men have passions or why men are so much like devils, but what Masonry can do to subdue the passions and to save men from deviltry and help them build their spiritual edifices and become worthy and well qualified to sit in the celestial Lodge again. It is undoubtedly more logical and scientific to accept, or recognize, men as they are than to attempt to explain why they are that way. There appears to be no rational answer to the question, “Why ignorance, sin, and death in a potentially perfect man created in the image of Cod?” In a wonderful book, The Science of the Soul, Dr. R. Swin- bume Clymer makes the following statement that should have significance to Masons who are searching for the Lost Word; In the beginning of time all Souls were with God [in the Celes- tial Lodge] and were purely spiritual . . . they took upon them- selves bodies, they no longer remained purely spiritual or all good [as they were before they took bodies], because they took upon themselves the desires and weaknesses of the body, . . ."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"138 THE MEANING OF MASONRY As a consequence . . . the Souls of men must work upwards to the Perfection that was theirs before “the word” took on flesh,-- the Souls feZZ into flesh.

Why the necessity to go through the terrible travail of body, mind, and spirit in life after life on this earth plane, only to get back in\\ the end where they started from?” There is a mystery’ here, and the inquiring mind, the Godlike mind and soul of man, needs to penetrate the veil, or veils, that hide it. The Creator, according to our reason, must have deemed it necessary to create man’s body from “the dust of the earth,” or no soul, no “spark of the Divine fire,” could have become in- volved in matter. If souls as sparks of the divine fire were “perfect” in the beginning of time, why did the creative power in the soul of man have to create a body through which lusts and weaknesses predominantly express themselves and have to perform this “fall” into flesh thousands of times in order to evolve back again into that “perfection” that enables him to become again a “Son of God,” to rise to cosmic consciousness above the necessity of taking physical body? Sensitive persons, viewing the bloody, cruel, and inhuman trails winding through history, the awful woes and sufferings of humanity, which have scarcely abated even to this day, like Gautama, could properly cry out against the irrationality, the inhumanity, the injustice of such a futile process. From “per- fection” to “imperfection” as a means to get back to “perfection” again! The idea is an affront to a logical mind. Do we not de- clare that the Lord God formed man’s body from the materials of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, whereby man became a living soul?

What was the reason for this"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"TED3 SOUL’S LONG JOURNEY 139 act of creation, if man was a perfect being before he took on a physical body? Why was man, the image of God in the begin- ning, as we declare, permitted to “disobey” God while in the body of Adamic man, be “born in sin,” live a thousand sinful lives and die a thousand more or less fearsome deaths, before he could get back to God and become as perfect as he was before he fell into flesh? That is the question, probably the most important question that the finite mind of man can ask. Millions upon millions of human beings, the “sons of man,” have never even thought of the question, to say nothing of searching for a rational answer. Where they give such a question any consideration at all, they deem any rational answer so far beyond their capacity to think that it would be futile and foolish to undertake a search for it. Indeed, why should the ordinary thinker seek an answer to this enigma, when the trained philosopher, if he knows the answer, will not reveal it in his writings? The author has sought the answer in the pronouncements of great teachers of the past and in the public statements of contemporary philosophers and thinkers, but to no avail. Man’s puny intellect seems incapable of comprehending and encompassing the inscrutable mystery in which the doctrine of the sinful nature of physical man is en- shrouded, and there appears to be no answer to the question ‘Why?” Perhaps a gleam of Light can be thrown upon the problem, or enigma, of imperfection and sin among God’s human crea- tures by taking a more profound, a more tolerant and perhaps truthful view of the nature and function of sin as a stimulant to the progress of the soul, The best thought I have discovered in the reading of many years is to be found in Sri Aurobindo’s The Synthesis of Yoga: Our sins are the misdirected steps of a seeking power that aims, not at sin, but at perfection, at something we might call a Divine Virtue. Often they are the veils of a quality that has to be t.rans- formed and delivered out of an ugIy disguise; otherwise, in the perfect Providence of things, they wmld not have been suffered to exist or to continue. The Master of our works is neither a blun-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"derer nor an indifferent witness nor a dallier with the IUXUJYY of unneeded evils. He is wiser than our reason and wiser than our virtue. Our nature is not only mistaken in will and ignorant in knowledge but weak in power; but the Divine Force is there and will lead us if we trust in it and will use our deficiencies and our powers for the Divine Purpose. , , . If we fail in our im- mediate aim, it is because He has intended the failure. . . *The Master of our Works knows the thing to be done, and we must allow Him to do it in us by His own means and in his own manner. This view appears to give sin a purpose and a function that may develop toward the higher forms of consciousness. The Creator, being the Giver of life, is the divine Author-in-us of every phase of manifestation in the nature of man. Man, as an individualized identity, possessing absolute freedom of will, be his will weak or strong, must learn to be good by the punish- ments that naturally follow his actions that are not good, or as good. At the time of the commission of the “not good” acts, they are or may be ignorantly deemed “the good” by the doers. But though ignorance may be deemed the cause of sin, ignorance of the laws of good (God) cannot avoid the punishments that inevitably follow their violation. “Offenses must come,” said Jesus, “but woe unto that man by whom they come.” It appears that human beings in the kindergarten stage of development must ultimately learn to be good only by “sinning” and experi- encing the sorrows and punishments that naturally follow the violation of the laws of God. Satan and God are not antagonists, each striving for control of human beings. God, the Universal Spirit, the Creator-in-us, the Originator and Builder of our souls, encompasses everything that is on all the planes of nature, and we must come to know that He would not create or tolerate an evil except as a means of promoting His divine purpose in the building of the soul qualities of every one of His human creatures.

In our sense of guilt we shall ultimately cry out: “Why did not God not only create us in His own image but keep us always in that angelic state of perfection and bliss which was ours at the beginning and is destined to be ours at the end?” The “fall of man” into flesh and the weaknesses of mortality are still an incomprehensible mystery. Our cry for Light goes out, but there is no convincing or adequate answer from the silence.

HOW? The question “How?” is worth answering, but there is nothing in the ritualistic work of a Lodge that tells the Master Mason hm to subdue the passions and improve himself in Masonry. The secret methods by which our ancient Brethren built their spiritual fabric are not named in the Ritual. If any man, or Mason, wishes to make more rapid progress in the Builder’s art, he would need to study the methods from books and lessons that are now available from the various “schools” and associ- ations located in this country. These schools are trying to dis- seminate the teachings and methods of self-improvement enun- ciated and employed by the ancient masters but which were suppressed and repressed by Church and State during the Dark Ages and by the Church right down to this day. The hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry, particularly in respect to the disciplines necessary to achieve self-improvement, are not u From Great System of Yoga, by Ernest Wood, p. 82 ( 1954)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"142 THE MEANING OF MASONRY to be found in Masonic texts but in the literature and lessons put out by contemporary schools that are providing a service for the people of the United States that, I think, every Grand Lodge Jurisdiction in the country should provide. (I have re- ferred to three of these centers in Chapter II.) In the whole process of soul development, however, whether one is dealing with the secret methods or the more common methods of self-improvement, the function of words and thoughts should be stressed as a basis for improvement in action and deeds. A man must learn to think good before he can do good. If a man is good and does good without thinking, he does so because he is born with a “naturally good” character; the principle of “good thinking, good acting” still applies because in previous lives he had learned the lessons that both good and bad thinking and acting always teach. The qualities that good thinking and right action have woven into the fabric of his soul are brought over in the form of good character which intuitively expresses itself in right human relations in any lifetime in a body. But at some time or other in the course of the life of the eternal soul there must be right thinking in the intellect as a basis or condition of right action. Chapter IX deals with the theme “As Ye Sow” and emphasizes this concept of the function of thinking and knowing. A conscious effort to improve one’s self in Masonry will always be a potent force to bring one to true Masonic Light, the ultimate goal of the Builder. The Nazarene Master declared: “Ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free” (John 8:32). How else can this be interpreted except that knowing something must come before doing something, that knowledge as cause precedes action as effect? If it is the Truth that will make us free, it must be that ignorance is what keeps us in bondage, and that the Light of Truth dispels the darkness of ignorance. However free we may be in other respects-political, religious, or economic-we are still in bondage if we are under the sway of the “unruly pas- sions”; in other words, we must come to know that accor&ng to the teachings of Masonry, freedom, real freedom, is something that a man confers upon himself when he learns to subdue his"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE SOUL’S LONG JOURNEY 143 passions and improve himself in Masonry. Real freedom, then, arises within a man and is not conferred upon him by any out- side authority or power. This implies self-discipline, self-control, self-mastery, self-realization, all of which lead to soul unfold- ment and spiritual regeneration, the “spiritual rebirth” enunci- ated by the Galilean Master in his conversation with the Pharisee Nicodemus (see John 3: l-21). Masons should know that soul regeneration is the real object of Masonry, the art and science of the Builder of a spiritual fabric. Masons should learn and know what ought to be done before they can learn how to do it; this is all that this book recommends that Masonic Schools of Instruction attempt to do. If Masonic Schools of Instruction were established, one in every Lodge, they could teach certain Masons what ought to be done, what Masonry really is in respect to its real purposes. ‘Ye shall know the Truth.” Further, if Masons come to know the Truth in Masonry, the problem of its application in the individual life of a member is an individual matter. One man can choose one method and another man quite a different method. The problem of how a man shall improve himself in Masonry is the responsibility and right of every man, who will find the right path for himself, each one in accord with his capacity, power, and will to learn how to do so. At this stage of the development of Western man, when the Lodge has taught the member what ought to be done, it has performed its whole duty by him. This leaves each mem- ber on his own initiative to discover how to make this knowledge effective in his own life and how to arrive at that application of Masonic Truth that shall make him free from bondage to the unruly passions. “And the truth shall make you free.” As has been said many times in these chapters and will be said again, this process of how to apply Masonic Truth, this process of soul regeneration, is a long, long one. The great Teacher who spoke these words did not imply that a mere knowledge of the Truth would make us free at the very moment that we ascertained it as Truth. No; the Truth shall make us free, if-mark well, if-we can learn"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"144 THE MEANING OF MASONRY how to apply it in our own lives. Freedom from bondage to the passions is something that every human being has to earrt by the strongest possible effort and over a long period of time; it is not a free gift of God to be appropriated by the individual without effort. Soul regeneration, L’salvation,” must be earned by effort, “works” (as well as by faith; see Chapter XI). There are many paths and degrees of proficiency that lead to soul regeneration. Read the books and choose your own path, if indeed you are equal to any conscious effort toward the achievement of that freedom from bondage to the unruly pas- sions that is most certainly the ultimate goal of a Mason. If you are not so much interested in making sustained and conscious efforts to find out how to improve yourself in Masonry as you are to know what Masonry is, write to the librarian of the Grand Lodge of any state in the Union and ask for books dealing with both the exoteric and esoteric phases of Masonry. It is suggested that as a beginning you read at least one of the standard works dealing more particularly with the outer and more obvious phases of the Ritual; but remember also that Masonry, as the art and science of the Builder of a spiritual fabric, is an arcane (esoteric or secret) science, The most ad- vanced among the ancients knew much more about a “spiritual fabric” than we moderns know, in spite of, or perhaps because of, our materialistic science and sensate culture that has tended to deny the existence of anything that could not be perceived and measured and tested by the human senses. Therefore in trying to find out what Masonry is do not neglect to look into the books dealing with soul science (see Chapter XII).

If you will read Yogananda’s book, The Autobiography of a Yogi, you will get a clearer concept of what the yogis of India have achieved and of what almost any man can do if he is willing to pay the price of various disciplines of self-improvement. Go to any good library in your own community and ask for their latest book on yoga. ASTARA FOUNDATION (261 South Mariposa Avenue, Los An- geles 4, California) publishes books and tracts on every phase of the ancient wisdom emphasized in Masonry as “the hidden mysteries.” This school is spreading the same teach- ings and philosophy that are contained in the symbols and allegories of the Masonic Ritual and that, I think, should also emanate from every Grand Lodge Jurisdiction in the world. THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHER SOCIETY (P.0, Box 1228, Chi- cago 90, Illinois) publishes a set of paper-bound books of less than a hundred pages each that contain the most modern and scientific approach to that same ancient wisdom that is hidden in the Masonic Ritual. Perhaps the titles would be intriguing to some readers: The Measure of Man; Yoga and Meditation; The Story of Race; America; Our Vibrant Uni- velrse (ancient and modern physics); Toward Salvation; In Quest of Health; Always Living.

There are also several other schools in the United States that are worthy of mention in this list; but if you get the literature of any one of the above and set yourself to read it, you will not only learn what the hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry are but how to apply this divine wisdom in your own life and living. You will learn what is meant by the statement attribu- ted to Solomon, King of Israel, one of our three Grand Masters, who praises wisdom (Proverbs 3: 13-17) and concludes: “She is a tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is everyone that retaineth her.” WHITHER? Masons answer the question “Whither?” by a declaration that the soul of man will “never, never, never die.” At least that is the answer for any Mason who declares that he is searching for the light and is desirous of improving himself in Masonry. The question comes, “Whither are you traveling?” and the answer given is just as enigmatic as before; it conceals a mystery, and the words of the answer are not to be taken literally.

The human soul has been and always will be immortal, so long as it works toward the fulfillment of the law of divine being, the law of growth in t.he direction of divine power and perfection, which is the pur- pose of living on all planes of existence. If a man continues to improve himself in Masonry, he continues to fulfill the purpose of God, and his soul shall endure forever. It takes great effort on the part of each one of us to become worthy and well qualified to fulfill his Masonic destiny. It is a very slow process; and, it appears, he must learn the lessons of life, like a child, over and over again. What we have achieved in past lives has cost us dearly in effort and spiritual zeal; it has not been a free gift of God. It has been, is now, and will continue to be a long and difficult road “back to God,” in whom we “live and move and have our being.” If we succeed in attain- ing what Masonry declares to be its ultimate objective-that is, the subjugation of the passions, which means the control of all the emotions-it may take many more lives in a succession of bodies to achieve that destiny. There have been men who have done it, but they are comparatively few out of the whole mass of humanity, and we can properly wonder why Masonry sets so remote and difficult a goal to be achieved by mortal men unless, indeed, that is the true and ultimate goal for all individuals on this planet. Perhaps it appears as an integral and prominent feature of Masonic teaching because, as the learning process of the individual began thousands of years ago and has brought each of us to whatever degree of perfection he has attained to this hour, so must the learning process continue for thousands of years toward the completion and perfection of the Master Builder.

When we stop to think how long we have taken to get where we are now, to achieve the degree of perfection we have earned in past lessons, it becomes clear to any logical mind that these teachings of Masonry will require many lives to enable us to build them into our character and soul. It lis a slow process as seen through the finite mind of mortal man. No thinking man and Mason can rightly say that he has but one chance to reach the goal of the Builder and despairingly conclude that it is too remote for him to be troubled with its disciplines. As a man and Mason he has many chances; if now he is unwilling to express active faith in Masonic teachings and to strive to make them effective in his own life, let him be en- couraged because he too inevitably and ultimately will be drawn into the great work of improvement in Masonry, and by exposure after exposure to its sublime teachings in a vast series of lives, he shall arrive at that destiny, the Perfect Ashlar which is the final product of the Builder’s art.

The central theme of these ancient mysteries was self-knowledge and soul development, and this is the central theme and purpose of modern Masonry. Down through the ages in their long careers as Builders of their im- mortal souls, the true initiates, adepts, and masters who pos- sessed this wisdom knew that the way of man “back to God’ was through recurring births and deaths. But this teaching, as a clear-cut interpretation, is nowhere incorporated as such in the Masonic Ritual, any more than any other interpretation is, If any Freemason says that it is “hidden” there, he does so only because he as a Masonic thinker declares that that appears to be the only logical way whereby he can fulfill his Masonic destiny as he understands it. I would humbly suggest that before rejecting this ancient teaching, you take a good look at what the ancient Brethren, the great teachers and initiates of antiquity, have said about it, Let not the fact that this teaching does not appear as a part of modem sectarian theology discourage you or lead you to conclude that the doctrines of the churches contain all the Truth about life on this earth and about the origin and destiny of man.

Do not fear to tread the narrow, rugged, and precipitous path that leads to the heights of Truth and illumination, where the glories of heaven are revealed. If a man knows what is meant by his “Masonic destiny” and what it involves, he looks around at his Brethren, he looks at men as they are everywhere, and most of all he looks at himself.

Why come here at all, if we pass this way but once, spend so little time, and make so little improvement in Masonry ? Compared to what it is our ultimate destiny to achieve, what we can achieve in one life- time is a mere step on the path to Masonic illumination, a mere drop in the ocean of Masonic Truth. During the untold millennia of the past our ancient Brethren traveled the same road and received the same Light that we are destined to travel and re- ceive on the level of time. The great masters and teachers of antiquity, having traversed this road before us, are well quali- fied by experience to show us the way; they tell us how they achieved Masonic illumination and freedom from the cyclic necessity of recurring births and deaths; they tell us how to become true initiates, adepts, seers, and masters like themselves. “Ask a.nd ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened unto you.” Let us be as objective and “scientific” as possible about this matter.

Let us first take an ob- jective look at the minds and spirits of those great men and thinkers of the past who have traveled this same Masonic path and have received all the Light that can be perceived in any Lodge of the Builders. These men, though not all of them Master Masons in the modem sense-but true Master Builders among our ancient Brethren-attained the same kind of illumi- nation that it is the object of Freemasonry to stimulate good men to discover for themselves. To cite but a few names of the hun- dreds of illumined men of whose lives we have record as we look back over the pages of human history: Confucius of China, Gautama of India, Jesus of Nazareth, Apollonius of Tyana, Francis Bacon of England, Balzac of France, Dante of Italy, Behtnen of Germany, Whitman of America. What did these men have that we have not? What qualities of mind or soul did they possess that raised them so far above and beyond other men and that set the goal and charted the path for us to follow? As we get into this phase of Masonic illumination (Light in Masonry) we shall see that these men had attained a level of consciousness that appears beyond the experience of most men and that we can hardly imagine in our most exalted moments in life. The writer has never experienced such illumination and has never personally known a man who has, but readily admits that it is desirable, attainable, and des- tine; for each of us, if the Truth of the ancient teaching of the pre-existence and re-existence of the soul be admitted. The records of the lives, teachings, and soul qualities of all these men are available to any man who wants to learn and know. Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke might have been named with those mentioned above; he experienced this inner Light himself, and he assembled in one wonderful book, Cosmic ConscZousness, excerpts from the teachings of some fifty men and women who had arrived at varying degrees of spiritual illumination. It is clear from reading this book that, regardless of when and where such people appear on the human stage, they all say about the same things, and there is a strong thread of unity and a definite pattern of thought and spirit that runs through what"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE ANCIENT MASTERS AND THE ANCIENT WISDOM 153 they all say about life, nature, God, man, and destiny. This unity and singleness of pattern in outward manifestation in- &cates a hidden source of knowledge, a divine gmsi~, from which all true teachings emanate. Outer unity, inward univer- sality! It is apropos to declare that modern speculative Masonry sprang from the same source, the ancient mysteries, the divine gnosis, which is as old as humanity. What were the characteristics of mind and soul that are common to all of these men and women? They may be enumer- ated and described as follows: 1. When they were around thirty-five years of age, all had an experience in which they thought themselves suddenly ilm- mersed in a flame of rose-colored 2ight. If that were all that happened, the phenomenon might be attributed to de- lusion, delirium, or hallucination, because in no instance was this Light an objective reality but in every instance was sensed inwardly and subjectively as imaged by the mind and/or soul. The Light of illumination emanated fTom them and was not shed upon them from any outward source; but it was accompanied by other phenomena of consciousness that showed that a great change had suddenly come over the mind and soul of the illuminated one. 2. At the same instant of the perception of this inner Light, these men experienced feelings of ioy, assurance, triumph, m-d ‘Esalvation”; they became keenly aware of a moral ex- altation and intellectual illumination. Emotionally, the happi- ness of such men knew no bounds; and when they wrote about this transcendent experience, they used the words *‘joy,” “bliss,” “ecstasy,” “rhapsody”-feelings to which we all aspire but perhaps rarely experience to any extent, if at all. Morally and intellectually these men quite suddenly be- came aware of truths and ideas and powers of mind far surpassing anything they could previously have imagined and for which they were incapable to find adequate words for utterance, No language was adequate to describe what they saw and felt both “in heaven” and “on earth.” Walt Whitman’s description is characteristic:"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"154 THE MEANING OF MASONRY When I undertake to tell the best, I find I cannot, My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots, My breath will not be obedient to its organs, I become a dumb man, Gautama exclaimed: Yet, 0 soul supreme! knowest thou the joys of pensive thought? Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart? Jesus, answering the question of some of his disciples who asked, “Why speakest thou in parables,” replied: “Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.” That seems to indicate that Jesus had an inner teaching that he gave in private to a few of his disci- ples. He could not attempt to reveal the hidden mysteries to those not worthy and well qualified to receive them, “because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.” This same idea of secrecy made effective by “speak- ing in parables,” symbols, and allegories appears strongly in the Masonic Ritual. This teaching of the ‘Sngdom of heaven,” which is but another phrase for “divine gnosis,” “ancient wis- dom ,” “hidden Mysteries of Ancient Freemasonry,” is of such a transcendent character that it is beyond the power of most men even to glimpse. Rut it is hidden in the Masonic Ritual, and he can discover and bring it to light who has the will and power to do so; to him its inexhaustible glories and riches wil1 be revealed as he opens his mind and soul to its Light. Dante declares : “The Glory of Him who moves everything penetrates through the Universe and shines in one part more and in another less. In the Heaven that receives most of its Light I have been, and have seen things which he who descends from there above neither knows how nor is able to recount.” Many more testimonies could be cited to describe the moral and spiritual exaltation of those who experienced this sudden illumination.

This sense of immortality was not something to be hoped for or believed in as a future event or condition; it was something already achieved in the here md now, and though they were still in a physical body, they knew for a certainty that their minds and souls were not identical with their bodies and that their souls had always &sted and would survive the grave and live forever.

It must be noted, however, that all those who experienced this sudden illumination were remarkable people anyway. Their emotional, intellectual, moral, and spiritual powers greatly exceeded and excelled even those of the elite among the masses, and all were exceptionally earnest and sincere people who had spent years in search of Light on the path.

In- stead of brushing aside their recorded declarations as the ravings of lunatics, we should try to raise ourselves to an intellectual and spiritual level that would enable us to catch revealing glimpses of what th ey meant. It is this tendency of men that causes many millions to regard the teachings of Jesus of Naza- reth as too farfetched and extravagant to warrant a belief in them as valid for so-called “practical men of affairs.” Many professed Christians even take this same view of the practicality of the teachings of Jesus and becoming lukewarm or indifferent, make little or no progress in the Christian virtues; they regard Jesus as an impractical dreamer-to be candid about it, another name for lunatic. The Truth, however, is that we can place the fullest confidence in the validity of the teachings of Jesus and of every other great initiate and adept who has reached a stage in the development of consciousness which has been variously called “the second birth,” “regeneration,” “true philosophic initia- tion,” ” cosmic consciousness,” or “the kingdom of heaven.” I am convincecl that the illumination of these men is the same thing as the “Light,” “More Light,” “Further Light,” and “All the Light” that Masons symbolically seek on being made Builders. We seek the Light as if it could be conferred upon us from without, little realizing that if and when we perceive the Light, it will manifest itself from within our minds and souls.

Every time we as Masons seek to learn more about the “hidden mysteries” of the cryptic passages of the Ritual, the power and force of the Light-within is increased, and as we learn to awZy Masonic teachings in our own lives, the intensity of this Light-within increases until that great day will arrive when we too shall perceive that glorious illumination that our ancient Brethren experienced, as all Brethren and Fellows have done who have gone this way before us. During the preliminary stages of Masonic illumination the aspirant is not aware of the existence of this Light as it permeates his body, mind, and soul; but the time ultimately comes when its intensity is so great that his own eyes behold it and his conscious mind interprets it as the Light glorious and iIluminating.

If he learns the meaning of these words, he is enabled to evaluate his own shortcomings and his own relative position on the path of improvement. Active think- ing must always precede action, and modification of conduct toward himself and others will ultimately follow. Take one illustration at this point. The word “integrity” repre- sents one of the great purposes of Masonry. The more a Mason knows about the meanings of this me word (to say nothing of many others), the easier it will be to evaluate the extent to which his character and conduct express the qualities described by the word. And if he finds that he could improve his conduct with respect to this word, he could go about it deliberately to change for the better, and so improve himself in Masonry. No mm can have more integrity unless he is stimulated to think that he needs to have more, One opposite of “integrity” is “viciousness,” which represents the lowest development, even as “integrity” represents the highest development of man’s char- acter. There is a long and hard road, or way, between them in the life of any soul on earth. Every Mason who is interested in self-development must be stimulated to think about the meanings of this word as it applies to him and his happiness and progress, to recognize where he is on this hard road, and to see what he can do to build a character that will better express and manifest the wonderful Masonic word “integrity.” The English language contains scores of such abstract “char- acter words,” as they may be called; but if a Mason would learn the meanings of just ten of the most common of them that appear in the Ritual of the first three degrees, he would possess a liberal education in character-building, If he consciously ap- plied the meanings to modify his conduct from day to day, he would not only improve himself in the Builder’s art but would endear himself to most of his associates, Brothers, and Com-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"166 THE MEANING OF MASONRY panions; and he would secure the approbation of his conscience and a happy frame of mind. The meanings of ten such words (or groups of synonyms) and their opposites are therefore given here to help Masons evaluate the relative position of their own characters on the scale, or road, or level of time, that represents their progress in the Builder’s art. It is necessary to start with the opposite of every good character, or quality of mind, because the human nature of every one of us is at a stage of development some- where between low and high. Low development above the level of the beast is Masonically symbolized by the Rough Ashlar, “a stone in its rude and natural state, as taken from the quarry,” unshapen, uncut, and unpolished; “by it we are re- minded of that rude and imperfect state which is ours by nature.” The highest development is Masonically symbolized by the “Perfect Ashlar,” which is one “prepared by the workmen,” shaped by conscious design and polished to high and beautiful brilliance; by it “we are reminded of that state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by educc&n, our own endeuvom, and the blessing o# deity.” Let every thoughtful Mason pause to consider where he is on the steps, scale, or ladder between the state of the Rough Ashlar and of the Perfect Ashlar of human development in each of the ten character-building blocks defined in this chapter. Some of all generations of men have already attained develop- ment much beyond the Rough Ashlar stage of each of these building blocks of a Mason; even so, they may have a long way to travel before they arrive at the stage of the Perfect Ashlar in any or all of these character qualities. So the level of time stretches back perhaps through eons of time during which each of us has made himself what he is in character and ability, and it will also stretch forward into the future perhaps through eons of time before the “divine traveler” will be able to express the fullness and best of each quality.

Hiram Abiff is the symbol of the “stone which the builders rejected,” but which shall be- come “the head of the corner” in all our lives as we manifest Masonic illumination and soul regeneration through the acqui- sition of Christic power. It is indeed a long, long way that most of us have yet to travel; but each of us has already traveled a considerable dis- tance upon it and is destined to travel a still greater distance in both time and eternity. There are few men who are so de- praved, so ignorant, so deep in spiritual darkness, that they exhibit all the lowest traits of the Rough Ashlar. Most men have some redeeming qualities and show that they have made some progress on time’s level; and there are many men and women who have made a great deal of progress in some or all of these qualities. The perfections they have attained point the way for themselves and the rest of us and encourage us to believe that what they have achieved we too can, and some day will, achieve. I3ut no one needs to be fully convinced that this is a valid hope for all humanity in order that he may make a little progress each day in manifesting the qualities of character that he recog- nizes as meaningful to him. Therefore no matter how many lifetimes in a body we may have, whether one or many, any man or Mason can say at any time in the long history of his soul: ‘What can I do mzo from day to day to improve myself in the various qualities of charac- ter that are represented by the character words emphasized in the Masonic Ritual? Masonry asks me where I came from, what I came here to do, and where I am going, but I know that I can not answer these questions intelligently unless I take the little steps every day to build the fabric of my character by consciously evaluating my own defects and striving to correct them. Then, perhaps, as my mind expands, my insight increases, and my conduct becomes better, the correct answers to these questions will be partly revealed.

In order to get a clearer idea of the long way between the status of the Rough Ashlar and the Perfect Ashlar of human development in each of the ten qualities, the words represent- ing low development appear at the left of those representing high, or perfect, development, which appear on the right. Im- agine a line between them symbolizing the level of time that stretches forward into eternity, during which you will live always as an individual immortal soul and be responsible for your continuous moral development. Brief definitions will be given of all of these words, and some will be followed by com- ments based upon the Ritual and by quotations from the Monitor (New York State)-all hopefully designed to give them greater force and meaning to the reader. 1.

If men could be redeemed by simply hearing the words of right think- ing and action, the race would have risen long before this generation to much higher levels of righteousness than it ex- hibits today. But apparently it takes more than merely hearing the word “Truth” to cause most men to obey its mandates and live according to divine laws. Whether we understand it or not, it appears that men must reap in sickness and sorrow, in frustra- tion and disappointment, in weakness and death, where they sow in hatred, mul-euolence, and uncharitableness. In other words, men seem to respond more quickly, figuratively, to a *‘rap on the head” or a Kick in the pants” than they do to the auditory perception of the moral precepts of Masonry. I do not think that you really want it that way in your lives; you do not like to be Ykicked around” or to suffer the “slings and arrows of an outrageous fortune”; but this will be your “fate” until you learn by experience or by precept that these virtues represent the highest development, the Perfect Ashlar, of human character. For this purpose you are traveling on the level of time to that undiscovered country of moral excellence envisioned by the superb Ritual as the destiny of all men.

Every Brother is left free to develop his own trestleboard of life and living within the framework of the landmarks of the Craft; and this perfect liberty of thought is not intended, and it does not need, to interfere in any way with such a feeling of a common purpose, such a sense of human brotherhood, as would encourage men to emulate those who ‘%est can work and best agree.” 3.

However, it is hoped that a definition of each word with its opposite (antonym) may be of greater help to the reader. There are many allusions in the Ritual that enjoin Masons to maintain control of the unruly passions which afflict men in a “crude and natural state” but which must be subdued if men are to rise ‘%y education, our own endeavors and the blessing of Deity” to the status of the Perfect Ashlar of human development. Among the many such allusions one is outstanding: the apron presentation, which declares (see Monitor) “that the Lamb-skin or White Leather Apron is an emblem of innocence and the badge of a Mason” and which enjoins the newly-made Brother to “let its pure and spotless surface be to you an ever- present reminder of a purity of life and rectitude of conduct, a never-ending argument for nobler deeds, for higher thoughts, for greater achievements.” Wonderful words, are they not? Shall we ignore them, or try to apply them consciously to our own problems? 4. Infidelity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...*..... ( ) a .*.**............*......*....*......,..

How far is it from ignorance, error, and half-truth to fuller truth and wisdom? A long, long way, because the fullness of Truth seems never revealed; for as we ascertain more Truth (Light in Masonry) concerning any particular phase or phenomenon in life or nature, our minds sense the greater possibility and scope of Truth, until we learn to declare : “Truth is infinite.” But the capacity of mind and"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE BUILDER'S BLOCKS 173 spirit to ascertain Truth is also infinite; and the alert mind is always expanding its capacity for a larger encompassment of truth in all the worlds. Most Masons today are more or less indifferent to an active pursuit of the Truth in Masonry. This fact has been mentioned with regret many times in this volume, which is a plea to the Brethren to take Masonry more seriously and to use their minds and talents to make the most of their opportunity to get reveal- ing glimpses of Masonic Light and to improve their working knowledge of the Truths of the Builder. The New York State Monitor declares: “Truth is a Divine Attribute and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry.” 6.

The man who can meet adversity with a smile has won one of the greatest of all victories. If men deliberately set about it with determined will, many adversities could be over- come, many sufferings ameliorated or eliminated. “Fortitude is that noble and steadfast purpose of the mind, whereby we are enabled to undergo any pain, peril or danger.” 7.

Masonry does not proclaim any particular techniques whereby the Builder shall construct his spiritual edifice. The earnest Builder will Grid, develop, and apply his own techniques. So far as I know, there is no evidence that Masonry proclaims the concept of pre-existence and re-existence of the soul in mortal bodies. If I declare that, to me, the idea of repeated comings and goings, births and deaths, is implied in the teachings and philosophy of Masonry, that is the. one great interpretation that enters into VH.J own trestleboard and that, as I understand life and its mysteries, throws revealing light upon some of the seemingly extravagant, esoteric, and far- fetched passages of the Masonic Ritual. Sometime in the long development of each earnest and faithful builder’s soul, he will prove the truth or falsity of this teaching for himself. Logic teaches us “how to think and reason with propriety”; and this is what I have attempted to do in this book: “thought and reasoned with propriety” in trying to understand what the Ritual seeks to teach. I do not claim that I have any direct or scientic evidence of the truth of re-existence in mortal bodies beyond the evidence of logic and reason and beyond what most of the greater thinkers and wise men of the past have pro- claimed-although several modem experimenters and writers, employing scientific methods of investigation and research, claim to have direct and scientific evidence of the immortality of the soul and recurring births and deaths, and their conclusions are available to any person who wants to know the truth regarding them (see Chapter XII). If the sublime aims of Freemasonry were attainable by the members of the Craft in any one lifetime in a body, or if I could know that they could be attained by the immortal soul"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"178 THEi MEANING OF MASONRY in eternal life, I could logically conclude that there would be no need for a thousand lifetimes in a body, or even one life- time. Rut I believe I know that, here and now, we are in character and aptitudes what we have achieved in past bodies; that we have come here in this body to build a better character, that is, to improve ourselves in Masonry; that when we leave this body we still are what we have achieved and no more; and that therefore we need to come back again into the Lodge of the body for further instruction, for further Light and achieve- ment in character-building. The logic of this, it seems to me, is inescapable if we are to understand the symbolism of the Ritual and the enigmas of life on this earth. At this stage of my thinking and feeling, the concept of an eternal life in some vague heaven of rest and inactivity, with its “golden streets” and “heavenly music,” does not offer an entirely agreeable and reasonable prospect to my mind; it lacks vitality and the immediacy of dynamic action and achievement. If a million years have elapsed in the eternity of the past during which my soul has existed as an individualized identity, and/or if a million more years of heaven’life are to come and go, during which I am to continue to achieve my divine destiny, I ask, ‘Why did I have to come here at all, just to spend a few years, an infinitesimal fraction of a second between the eternities, in a mortal body in this so-called ‘Vale of Tears’?” Why come here at all to start a process that cannot possibly be completed in one lifetime? Why come here to improve myself in Masonry, if during the eternity that I existed in the past and that I will exist in the future I have been and will always be improving myself in Masonry? It must be understood and admitted that, as a matter of both experience and logic, the purpose of living in a body is self-improvement to the heights attained by the great teachers and wise men of all the ages, including Jesus of Nazareth. That is why we take a body and that is the reason we are endowed with powers to beget children, so as to enable others to take similar bodies for the same divine purpose. If this is not the truth, and if heaven is the only condition of the soul in which self-improvement is possible, why did"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"PERSONAL TESTIMONY 179 I not remain where I was, in whatever condition I was? If I could make greater progress in heaven, why not remain there, in that condition forever, especially since that is said to be our Masonic haven or destiny anyway? And especially since life on earth is so full of tribulation for millions of souls? Furthermore, if this is not the Truth, what meaning can life in a physical body have? Just to live like a vegetable or animal for a few fleeting years does not enable the individual to fulfill his inner longings or his Masonic destiny. Why come to earth tu suffer in a physical body? Even if men are but a ‘little higher than the apes,” there is in them all a conscious and/or uncon- scious “force” or power that makes for self-development, and it is this eternal Quest for Truth and the great work of applying it toward self-development that give meaning to life. If it were not for the need to learn the lessons of life in a physical body, we would not come here even once; and that same necessity that brought us here owe has brought us here many times before this advent and will bring us here many times after this exit. To me there is such a thing as a “science of the soul,” just as there is a science of physics or chemistry. Just as there are laws and principles that govern the matter of the physical world, so there are equally scientific and similar laws that govern the forces of the psychic world-the world of soul and spirit, what- ever it is, As from birth and childhood we learn how to act in harmony with the law of universal gravitation, the law of com- pensation, the laws governing heat and light, the change of seasons, the principles of health and nutrition-all the laws of nature-so we must and ultimately will learn to recognize and adjust ourselves to the laws of the spiritual realm. We can no more escape the necessity to obey, even by the trial-and- error method of living, the laws governing our spiritual nature than we can the laws governing our physical nature. “As above, so below,” and “as below, so above!” We have freedom to think and act within the bounds of nature and nature’s laws as they apply both to the physical and to the psychic worlds, Life in a physical body is a continu-"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"180 THE MEANING OF MASONRY ing process of adjustment to nature, a never-never-ending proc- ess of recognizing and applying the laws of all the worlds in one’s own mortal and immortal existence. Each individual makes such progress as he can within the limitations of his past achievement, and he is free to become one of the Sons of God as rapidly as he desires and can master the lessons of living in mortal bodies. The children of God learn slowly, like the children of men. The lessons of life have to be repeated again and again. But no one lifetime in a body is adequate for the achieve- ment of all that is involved in becoming a Son of God. It has taken many lifetimes in a body to develop what. powers we have to date, and it will require many more lifetimes to achieve all that we are destined to learn, do, and become. We know from experience that we have made and could make even more progress in the body we have now; but for the most part, I think, those who write about the conditions of life in an etheric or spiritual body are agreed that the heaven-world is not the main locale for spiritual progress. If it were, there would be little point in leaving it for the limitations of earth life, and incarnation and reincarnation would .not be necessary. I there- fore come back to the facts of life as we experience them in a physical body. We ~MX.U that we can make as much progress as we wish to make in a physical body, and that therefore we should make the best of our present opportunity for self-devel- opment. The great thinkers and masters of the past have declared that we reap as we sow in all the worlds. I gather from reading their pronouncements that the heaven life is devoted largely to the “reaping” process after the “sowing” in the physical world. In the heaven-world, they say, we stand in court before the only judge who can help us rectify the sins, errors,. and wrongs we have committed while in the body; and that just judge is our own soul.

At this stage in my soul’s progress, I therefore declare that I want to come back again in a new body, for I know that- 1. I can improve upon the appearance and conditions of a body, its health and vitality; 2. I can make it, and the mind that functions in it, a better instrument and opportunity for self -development-the “im- prove myself in Masonry” phase of life; 3. I can make a better contribution to universal welfare and perform a better service to God and humanity. To me it seems that it would be more interesting and devel- opmental to enter a new body and perform services to man- kind than to spend an eternity in the heavens, unless indeed the heavens offered equal opportunity to help humanity in its efforts at self-improvement. There is undoubtedly much con- structive service a soul can perform, whether in the heavens or on earth; and so, since I find earth life pleasant and profit- able as an opportunity to improve myself in Masonry and perform services to mankind, I shall probably in due time after this exit take a new body and continue the process of improve- ment in the Builder’s arts and in the service of God and humanity. I speak merely for myself My purpose in bringing my personal philosophy to the attention of Masons and others is to bring encouragement to the members of the Craft who may wonder why the makers of our Ritual incorporated and secreted in it the ancient wisdom for future generations to discover and bring to light, and to apply and manifest in their own lives.

It is pitiful and tragic that so many men seem to prefer darkness and ignorance to Light and knowledge; this pessimism has given rise to the pithy observation that “fools deride, philosophers investigate.” While we know that no true Mason derides Masonry, yet we could wish that more Masons would start being philosophers. The writer knows that the Masonic reader should not and will not take what he has said “on authority”; on the other hand, he hopes that the reader will not dismiss it summarily as ravings but will read what others through the centuries have written, and above all do his own thinking and ty to undertiand. All the writer claims is that what he has written here appears logical and right to him; but it may not, probably will not, be as logical to anybody else. The whole purpose is to get a case before Masonic readers, hoping that, if they will devote more time to reading and thinking about the ancient teachings, the answers or partial answers to many of the enigmas, mysteries, and problems of life may arise in their thinking minds and that thereby more men and Masons may be helped up the ladder of Masonic achievement."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"184 THE MEANING OF MASONRY Interpretations vary with the background of reading, study, thinking, experience, and mental and spiritual capacity of the individual. I never have experienced, and I do not know that there could be, a complete revelation of Truth, either in the Masonic Ritual itself or in any interpretation of its mysteries or in the ancient mysteries upon which modern Masonry is based. All that any member of the Craft can do at any stage of his development in spiritual wisdom is to seek to know more and as much as he is capable of learning-this for the sake of his own satisfaction on earth and the good of his immortal soul on the level of time and eternity. The trouble with most of us is that we do not exhaust our individual potential to know more about Masonry. It should offer a greater challenge to all of us to learn as much about it as possible in a lifetime. True, the conscious or unconscious Quest of the soul will always be to seek more Light; and if at any time in the life of the eternal soul a man has learned all he is capable of perceiving, he need not be disappointed because he cannot at the moment penetrate further behind the veils that hide the Truth. He will not condemn himself, nor will his Brethren condemn him, if he has done his best. As an immortal soul in time and eternity he will continue his great Quest, and what he cannot understand now will ultimately be revealed as he moves along the path of Masonic illumination and achieve- ment and becomes worthy to receive the divine revelation. Each of us, regardless of how much he may know about the Builder’s art, can always learn more and thus keep his mind and spirit open to new Truth. Thus never in the long history of his soul’s life on earth or in the heavens does he stop growing, developing, and unfolding the inner potencies of being. The haven, the ultimate goal, of that great Quest is always hidden from his aspiring gaze by the veils that shut out an eternal future. How can he, as a mortal mind, know the undis- covered Truth that the future will reveal in all its glories? As a “divine wanderer” from the Celestial Lodge, he knows in his heart and mind only what he has learned in the past, the eternal past, which stretches from this present moment"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION: CaTpe Diem 185 backward into unremembered eons of time. What he knows and learns in the present will be a base, or springboard, from which he will project his future progress in the Builder’s art, This is eterna.2 Truth! The fullness, the richness, the glories of the ultimate scene need not, indeed cannot, be mentally and morally encompassed now for any of us. The temple of our bodies, minds, and spirits must be completed and dedicated before we can be worthy and well qualified to receive the Master’s Word, enter its Sanctum Sanctorum, and be entitled to Master’s Wages while traveling in foreign lands. Seek not to seize the glories of heaven before you have mastered the mysteries of earth and the problems of living in a human body! Indeed, the way to Masonic illumination and the mani- festation, the unfoldment, of soul regeneration (the so-called “second birth”) will require all the power of will, determina- tion, perseverance, and the exercise of all the faith and enthusi- asm that we can bring to the successful pursuit of our Quest. We shall need all the integrity, fidelity, and courage of our illustrious Grand Master Hiram Abiff, who died rather than reveal, or attempt to reveal, the secret science of the Builder to any who had not been found worthy to receive it, Therefore do not despair of your power to pursue the Quest; do not hope for the fullness of revelation all at once. Seek to discern a little Light clearly; this is the way to More Light and ultimately to All the Light of Masonic Truth. The ruffians of our frail human nature may prompt us to want to seize upon more Masonic Truth than we are worthy and well quaNed to receive; but we should know that we cannot and will no;t receive it until we have taken the necessary preliminary steps on the way, and our temple is completed and dedicated, So courage, Brother! Regardless of where you are on the path of Masonic achievement, look up with faith, hope, per- severance, and a will to pursue the great Quest ccznsc~ly to the limit of your ability. When the hand of death strikes, as it will again and again down through the millennia of the future, each such time you will be able to say: “I have done my best according to the Light I had and the Truth I learned.

And may the power and help of God the Father sustain me in this great work!” This is the great work of each and all of us; this is the grand goal toward which we strive with strong and persistent will. But the consummation of this great work, inevitable and destined though it be for each of us, is not the achievement of one lifetime but of many. It is the long-term objective of all lifetimes. The scope of our change, growth, unfoldment, trans- formation, and illumination runs into eternity; it is a program of the ages in which one lifetime is but a single step toward the far-off goal. Thus every soul fits into the cosmic plan and through time and eternity works its divine way back into the presence of the Mason’s God as one of the Sons of God and co-workers with Him to help humanity on earth and in the heavens. This program of self-development on earth and in the heav- ens is quite unreal to most of us now. Very few of us are even aware of its Divine imperatives. Life as we know it on earth seems vastly more real and compelling, We are under the habits and routines of living in a physical body, the joys and sorrows, the pleasures and pains, the fulfillments and frustrations, bond- age to and conquest of the passions, the struggle to live and the enjoyments of living. Our homes, our families, our posses- sions, our jobs, our thoughts, interests, amusements, our asso- ciations-all these assume the shape of reality and occupy our minds to the exclusion of the more enduring values and pur- poses of life. Indeed, in these everyday attitudes and experiences are the real purposes of life unconsciously fulfilled. Each day brings its infinitesimal increments to the totality of what we are in character and faculty at any one time. But such unconscious"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION: CCW?W DiH72 187 learning and achievements are slow and halting, a sort of grop- ing in the dark, with many a forward and backward step, with many a sense of defeat, frustration, and inferiority, with many a “sin” and payment for sin, with few feelings of exaltation and victory. Sooner or later as time stretches into eternity we shall learn how to step up the tempo of achievement by becoming aware that we could make more rapid progress by conscious effort to improve ourselves in Masonry. We come face to face with the problems of living every day, and they seem more pressing and real than the distant goal set for us by the great thinkers, saviors, initiates, and philosophers of the past, who knew the purposes and plans of the Great Architect as they apply to man and nature in an ordered and harmonious Universe. For this reason, this day, ati each day as it comes, is of the greatest importance to us. As the eternity of the future un- folds day by day, so the steps to progress and fulfillments of the abiding purposes of life must be taken day by day. It would perhaps be better if each of us cc&d think in terms of the cosmic objective of life and being; but probably not one in a million people on this earth has been vouchsafed a vision of the glories of God, the splendorous cosmic scope of the divine plan and the certitudes and beatitudes of each person’s position and rela- tions in this plan. It is perhaps sufficient for the time being to know that each of us is now in a body not mainly to obtain a preview of the Celestial Lodge Above but to prove what kind of man and Mason he is, from day to day. So if we cannot now envision the glory and beauty of the universal plan and the reality of our individual position and relations in it, let us try to find out what is best for us to think and do each day so that profitable and beneficial experiences can predominate over frustrations, sorrows, and disappointments, and so that we can realize and evaluate the reasons and pur- poses of all our experiences. If we can be somewhat successful at this daily effort to profit by our experiences, we shall not need to be greatly concerned about the cosmic or long-term purpose of life. The future will take care of itself, if we learn how to profit most by the present.
