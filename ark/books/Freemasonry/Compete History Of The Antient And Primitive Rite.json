Second Preamble Rui Alexandre Gabirro M.D.R. High Commissioner of Cabinda London England 2002 Our current civilisation is greatly influenced by the w orks of those Greeks and Roman writers and philosophers who examined the recorded works of the Egyptian civilisation such as Plato Aristotle and Pythagoras. Our current civilisation is inevitably influenced by t he Egyptian civilisation. The greatest disaster to the Egyptian civilization was the irresponsible and criminal destruction of the great l ibrary at Alexandria. Everything not examined and translated ha s been lost for ever. The Alexandra library took three months to b urn. For 1400 years, no one knew how to read Egyptian hier oglyphs. Virtually all understanding of this mysterious script had been lost since the 4th century AD. The breakthrough to the decip herment of hieroglyphs came in 1799 when a French officer of engineers discovers the Rosetta Stone in the town of Rashid on t he western delta of the Nile. The notice of this important discovery reached Napoleo n and he ordered it to be placed in the Institute National which he had founded in Cairo. Napoleon ordered copies of the stone, w hich was covered with hieroglyphics and rows of Demotic and Gr eek text to be distributed among the learned of Europe, and throu gh this action the lost language of the Ancient Egyptians was recovered from oblivion. .............................................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 The Ancient and Primitive Rite has always acknowledg ed the Supremacy of the State or National Grand Lodges over the symbolic first three degrees of a Blue Lodge, and engrafted the sa me into its constitution.

The Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons The Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons is a det ached independent body of men from all walks of life. They meet regularly initially to work on their personal development. Thes e meetings which are based on Christian thought are conducted wit h dignity and bound in tradition. The idea and aim of Freemasonry is to influence the pro cess of ennoblement and personal improvement by promoting humil ity, tolerance and compassion. Those qualities which the mem bers master in the lodge should be practised in their dail y lives. These human qualities can of course be attained and prac tised by others who are not freemasons, but the Order of Freem asons in an organisation where this thought has taken a practical form which enable its members to develop it through ancient rituals , and with dignity. The Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons does not engage itself in national or international political issues, nor does it engage itself in religious or social disputes. The members shall show loyalty to the authority and law s of the land. They shall show respect for the Order itself and the aims of Freemasonry. A short history Our present day Freemasonry grew forth in Germany, Fran ce,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 Scotland and England in the 1600 ́s as an ethical and philosophical system based on the art of building, its symbolism and history. The Order, in its original form, was established in 1705 by the Grand Assemby or Grand Lodge at York. The system was quickly adopted and became predominant in continental Europe. What is a lodge? It is the name given to the assembly room or building where the Masonic brothers meet. A lodge meeting, as a rule, includ es a solemn ceremony where new brothers are received into their respective degrees. These admissions are conducted with in a framework of solemnity with opening and closing cere monies, with Rituals rich in Tradition. The lodge evening closes wi th a simple meal in an air of informality among the brothers. The foundation for our Masonic system is the first t hree degrees, which are called Blue Lodge of Freemasonry or Saint John Lodges where brothers receive the titles appropriate to their degree - I. Entered Apprentice II. Fellowcraft and III. Master Ma son as in accordance with the art of building. This Degrees are only Obtained in a Blue Lodge regularly constituted under a State Grand Lodge. This is followed by Philosophical Masonry, which wo rks within the 4th to the 95th Degrees. How does one become a member? To become a member of the Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons, which has today members all over the globe, one must be sponsored by two members of the Order. Those seeking admission must profess to the Christian faith (or ha ve a firm believe in Jesus the Christ), have reached the age of 24 and be known to have stability in his daily life. Not secret, but closed The Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons is not a secret order. It operates openly. It is evident from this tha t the Masonic system worked to has its basis in the Christian faith . It is in point of fact a Christian Order, but within this framework no demands are made for adherence to special dogmas or cr eeds."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 The Masonic learning system is closed to outsiders. Freemasonry is a school lasting a lifetime where a Master Mason has to work through the degrees 4th to 95th and last of Ancient and Primitive Freemasonry. The content of each degree is held closed until the freema son himself has had the opportunity to take a standpoint on questions and challenges, which are attached to each new degree. International cooperation The Ancient and Primitive Order of Freemasons is an i ndependent Order, unbound and under no obligation to any foreign order. There is however good co-operation between the Ancient and Pr imitive Order and other Masonic orders all over the world. A humanitarian Order To show compassion and fellowship is an obligation for each human being, but a freemason is especially bound and must b e most vigilant in this area.

FREEMASONRY IN EGYPT Freemasonry first appeared in Egypt on 1798, introduced by French Masons in Napoleon’s conquering armies.

The Rite is known to practise 95 degrees, each with their respe ctive secrets and ceremonies."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 General Kleber in Egypt Isis Lodge prospered under its first Master, General Kl eber, until he was murdered in 1800. At this time, following the w ithdrawal of the French, Freemasonry seems to have gone underground. In 1830, some Italians formed the Carbonari Lodge in Alexandria. This Lodge was altogether political and, as its activ ities were closely watched by the Government, its meetings were held in com plete secrecy. It proved popular, however, and a further Lodg e Ménés, working the Memphis Rite, was founded which also pros pered. One of the most active members, of the Rite of Memphis wa s Samuel Honnis, he founded a number of French Lodges in Alexandria, Ismailia, Port Said, Suez and Cairo, inc luding the Al Ahram in Alexandria in 1845. This was recognized by t he Government and many Senior Officials were initiated i nto it, including the famous Emir Abd el Gazairi, who fought the French in Algeria and, whilst exiled in Syria, gave refuge to and saved hundreds of Christian families during the Damascus m assacres. Another famous member of the Rite of Memphis was Salva tore Zola. He also founded the first Italian Lodge to work the Anc ient and Accepted Scottish Rite in Alexandria in 1849. In 1836, the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Rite of Memphis in France issued a Warrant for a Provincial Grand Council in Egypt and several more Lodges were founded in Egypt under the Ital ian jurisdiction and others up to 1862, all of which wor ked in perfect harmony with the French Provincial Grand Lodge.

The Khedive Ismail, one of the greatest figures in 19th century Egypt, although not a Mason, patronised the order as a prominent humanitarian organisation and allowed his son Tewfik to be initiated. Khedive Mohammad Tawfik Son of Ismail Pasha Governed Egypt from June 26, 1879 to January 7, 1892. In 1881, The Khedive Tewfik Pasha became Grand Master a nd held sway over more than 500 Lodges working in English, Fr ench, Greek, Hebrew, Italian and Arabic, and obtained recognition for the Grand Lodge of Egypt from most of the recognised Grand Lodg es of the world.

The Constitution was placed in the hands of a competent and enterprising committee, and it became evident that the A . and P. Rite needed but small encouragement to stand first and foremost among all Masonic bodies. Its great antiquity and authority give it the precedence , and no other Rite on the Continent of America can boast of it s legitimacy and antique origin. With the rights of York Rite Maso nry it cannot interfere-it admits none but Master Masons in good st anding; it conflicts not with Royal Arch Masonry, for the degrees of Mark, Most Ex.

APPENDIX No I Translation, of the Italian, of a Manuscript, which is itself a translation from the French, or German of an origin al paper dating from the year 1864.   The Ancient and Primitive Rite of Memphis is a Masoni c system, named after the Ancient Capital of Egypt, which for sev eral tens of years running has had in France, then in Belgium, E ngland and North America a humble extension, but many offshoots was recently (1862) placed on the list of recognized systems by the Grand Orient of France, after having been long cultivated in a few L odges in Paris,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 even if unknown to us. This system is consequently ev en now in activity and looking forward to a greater expansion an d, as it is essentially different from other systems already establis hed, a brief account will be given of its history, its organizati on, its Rites and, so far as these are known, of its tendencies. For this we b ase ourselves on the publications of its leaders and on wh at is contained in the Report of Dr. Razy to the College of Rites of t he Grand Orient of France on November 12, 1862 (Bulletin of the Gr. Or., November, 1862, page 419 and ff.). According to the legends of the Order, the Masonic Or der of Memphis was introduced into Europe by Egyptian sage n amed Ormus, converted by St. Mark in A.D. 46. At same time, (so literally runs the legend of the Order) the Essenes founded a school which met Ormus; the pupils remained until 1118 the Conserva tors of the Ancient Egyptian Wisdom; but in 1150 the Knights of Palestine carried the Masonic Wisdom to Edinburgh and there found ed a Grand Lodge, and it is here that one must seek for the origin of modern Free Masonry. The history of the Order of Memphis recommences – withou t further references to link up the older events to those of more rec ent times - with the year 1814. In this year, in consequence of an official project the Brother Samuel Honis, a native of Cairo, Eg ypt, brought the Rite of Memphis to France. Messrs. Gabr. Mathieu M arconis, Baron Dumas, the Marquis de LAroque and Hypolite Labrun ie founded, on the 15 th April, 1815, at Mountaban ( in the Department of Tarn et Gerone) the first Lodge of the system, wich was constituted on May, 1815, under the name of Disciples of Memphis. The Grand Master if this Lodge was Marconis (senior) w ho, January 21 st , 1816, was named Grand Hierophant. But before the cl ose of that year the Lodge already suspended its labours, havi ng declared itself “asleep” on the 7 th March, 1816, and, for 22 years the activity of the new Rite remained dormant. On March 21 st , 1838, the aforesaid Lodge resumed its labours and already, on A pril 3 rd , of the same year, the Grand Lodge Osiris was constituted. The Compilation of Statutes was undertaken and these (f ollowing another project of April 7 th ) were published on January 11, 1839. Three Supreme Councils were installed and Joseph Stephen Marconis (junior) was appointed Grand Hierophant and Keeper of the Universal Archives of the Order. The organizations o f this Supreme Councils of the Order, although they were subsequen tly altered, is sufficiently worthy of the attention req uired in order to form a precise idea of them. It was characterised by t he Oriental Mystic Pomp which stamps the whole system. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 The Supreme Council is the Mystic Temple; from it proc eeds all light, wisdom and doctrine. In its Sanctuary are fo und the Venerable Arches of its Traditions, the Altar of the hi ghest obligations and the Attributes of all degrees. At the h ead of the Nine Grand bearers of dignity stands the Hierophant Grand Master of Light, sacred depository of the traditions, Sublime Elect of the Sacred Veil, Member of the Alidee; after him follows the Hi gh Dai “governor of the scientific region”; the rest, to whom is added the predicate of “the wise”, have similar esoteric names: L amas, Zerdust, Helvell, Plist, Quetzal, Cattl, Ized, Ferotol ist, this last being the distinctive title of the Secretary. These nine grand bearers of dignity were, in 1843: the before mentioned Marconis ( named also J.E. Letrillard); a literary man, H. de Payen; a Prof. and physician, Audibert; a Baron, Hol. Von Poederle; a Chevalier, Garzay ; the physician of the Duke of Sussex (Grand Master of the G rand Lodge of England) Morrison of Greenfield; a retired Battalio n leader, Labrace; and two private gentleman, Fabre and Schaffner . The Second Council is the Sovereign Grand Council General , composed of seven members with names of high dignity. It decides on all applications of Lodges, Chapters, Aeropagi an d Councils and guides them in their work. The Third Supreme Council is the Liturgic College, compos ed of nine enlightened members and charges with watching over the d octrine, and the orderly development of dogmatic, moral and scien tific teaching. The members of these other two supreme Councils were, in 1843, for the most part literary men private gentlemen, with m oreover a General, De Melinet. These, who were at the head of the Government, constituted the Supreme Council. Under them were: in Paris – besides the already mentioned Disciples of Memphis and Osiris - the Lodge Philadelphi, founded by the before named Brother Audibert and Baron Roederle; th en in Brussels, the Lodges Bienveillance, 21 st , November, 1839, and Sages of Heliopolis, 29 th , February, 1840, founded by the banker de Mesmaker, by Hofjuvelier Viterbols and by the Secretary of the Glandis Academy; lastly, in Marseilles, the Knights o f Palestine Lodge, 30 th December, 1840. Another Official Report of June, 1843 gives, besides, Lodges as having been founded in London (where a Staff Captain, Menso de Villa, and a Member of Parliament, Baron de Beauvois w ere at the head), in America, in Smyrna and Buenos Ayres, and al so [states] that special Representative Supreme Councils, a sort o f Provincial"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Lodges, have been founded in the above named cities, outs ide the French State. Consequently the Order of Memphis appears at that time to have consisted of 3 Supreme Councils, 5 Representative Coun cils and, including some expected installations, of 11 symbolic Lodges, with 3 Chapters and 2 Aeropagi. The Memphis Rite proceeded in a manner calculated to pro cure it access. Its statutes prescribed that Lodges and their Members should maintain the best of relations with the Masons of other systems. It received also brethren of every other Rite, fo r “Tolerance stands at the head of its Laws”. It grante d all its degrees free of charge; under no pretext could they be bought; they were to be exclusively the possession of those who deserved the m. No one could obtain a degree without having written a paper on questions concerning that degree. All this was calculated to aw aken affection for the system, but it had also the bad luck to decei ve the Police. On February 25 th , 1841, the Prefect of Police requested the members of the New Order to suspend their labours and o n May 21 st , the Grand Hierophant declared the Rite to be asleep. T his took place after another denunciation, 7 th of July, 1843. The Order celebrated its second birth on March 5 th , 1848. The Chapter Les Sectateurs de Menes was founded by Baron Braunecker, Cap t. J. Rousseau and by the painter B. Netter in Paris, 21 st May, 1848, and the Lodges Disciples of Memphis came again into activi ty in November, 1849, many Lodges following suit in this a nd the two subsequent years. But the Order also took on a new Organization in 1849, being extended to 90 degrees as was announced: a system of wh ich up to that time there existed, at least beginnings as happens from the things said. These 90 degrees of Wisdom are divided into 3 Orders:  The First Order teaches morality, gives the meaning of Sy mbols, guides its Adepts to the love of Humanity, teaches th e first part of the Story of the Order and reveals the science of Nature. I t contains the following degrees: 1-3, symbolical; 4 Secret Master; 5 Master Architect; 6 Honoured Master; 7 Just and Perfect Master; 8 Knight of the Auserwahlter; 9 Auserwalther Knight of the Nine; 10 Auserwalther Knigth of the 15;"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 11 Exalted Auserwalther Knight; 12 Knight Grand Master Aerchitect; 13 Royal Arch; 14 Knight of the Sacred Arch; 15 Knight of the Sword; 16 Prince of Jerusalem; 17 Prince of the Aurora and of the Sunset; 18 Knight Rose Croix; 19 High Priest of Jerusalem; 20 Grand Master of the Temple of Wisdom; 21 Noachite Knigth of the Tower; 22 Knight of Lebanon; 23 Knigth of the Tabernacle; 24 Prince of Tabernacle; 25 Knight of the Brazen Serpent; 26 Trinitarian Knight; 27, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Temple; 28, Knight of St. John, or of the Sun; 29, Knight of St. Andrews; 30, Knight Grand Kadosch. The Second Order teaches Philosophy and History, explains Indian Geometric theorems, fables and the poetic myths of Antiq uity, the Zendavesta, the Manu of Harmasasha, the Sacred Vedas and the forth. The ultimate object is to stimulate investigatio n of First Principles and Bases and to promote sentiments of hu manity and sympathy.

It compromises the following d egrees: 61 Knight of the Work of the Seven Colours; 62 Knight of the Temple of Truth; 63 Sage of Heliopolis; 64 Priest of Mithra; 65 Prince of Truth; 66 Sublime Kawi; 67 Most Wise Muni; 68 Architect of the Mysterious city; 69 Sublime Knight of the Holy Veil; 70 Commentator of the Symbol; 71 Orphic Doctor; 72 Custodian of the Three Fires; 73 (wanting); 74, Sovereign Master of Wisdom; 75 Knight of the Golden Bough of Eleusis; 76 Sovereign Grand Master of the Mystery; 77 Supreme Master of the Sloka; 78 Doctor of the Sacred Fire; 79 Doctor of the Sacred Vedas; 80 High Knight of the Gilded Vliesses; 81 High Knight of the Shining Triangle; 82 High Knight of the Fearsome Sadch Sadch; 83 High Knight Theosophist; 84 High Grand Inspector of the Order; 85 High Auserwahlter of the Lybian Chain; 86 High Master of the Shining Bird; 87 High Master of Masonry; 88 High Knight of the Kneph; 89 Auserwahlter of the Mystic City; 90 High Master of the Great Work."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 With these 90 Degrees go, as 91 – 93, the three Supreme Councils: 91 Grand Conservator of Rites; 92 The Sovereign Grand Council; 93 The Mystic Temple. But even these were immediately brought up to five grand Councils named: 91 Grand Tribunal; 92 Grand Liturgical College; 93 Grand General Council; 94 Mystic Temple; 95 Sanctuary. This is a structure of the Order of Memphis in its comp lete Organization. As regards the number of degrees, it expl ained that the three Orders or series are a symbol of the three si des of a right angled triangle and contain the Wisdom of all Mason ic degrees; for the first series represents the Apprentice; the second, Fellow Craftsmen; the Third, Master Masons. The 90 th degree is perfect because the right angle of a right angled triangle is equal to the other two. It does not appear to be necessary, however, that in orde r to pass into a series every one should have obtained all the degrees o f the preceding series; he is only required to have worked in a Lodge, or Chamber, of the lower Order and have at least been Init iated in some key degrees. But in any case he must first submit a written treatise for judgment by the Lodge, or Chamber, into w hich he is to enter. As regard the last five degrees, they are invited , in the General Meetings of deputies from all the Lodges or Cham bers, to consider, confer and decide upon, by a majority of Vot es, all questions regarding the Order which do not exclusively p ertain to the competence of any of the Superior Councils. The 95 th Degrees, Sanctuary, has no direct influence on the Government of the Order. It consecrates itself entirely to Esotericism, and admits to its meetings and to the la bours of the Sanctuary an unlimited number of brethren chosen witho ut distinction from all the Orders and without any specia l privileges being conferred thereby. No sooner had the Order begun to settle down under this n ew Organization and to found Lodges, than its start for ward, which, in France at any rate, was already effective and running normally, came to an end. On December 21sr, 1851, the Rite of Memp his was"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 again declared to be asleep. Its headquarters were now t ransferred to England where there had been already founded in Londo n, in 1850, a Representative Council for Great Britain and, on May 7 th , 1851, they were constituted under the Presidency of J. Th . Berjean . The Police had allowed the French Lodges to be closed in France (which was annoyed at having appeared to maintain its declaration of asleep until 1853). On September 30, 1853, the above named Brother Berjean was installed Grand Master of Light o f the new Mystic Temple and of the Grand Council General, and as Organ of the Grand Hierophant. The Order thenceforth began again t o make progress. Already, on August 23 rd , 1854, there was founded in Birmingham a Lodge, L’Avenir under the presidency of E. Chevassus, who later became the Grand Chancellor of the O rder. But, even outside Great Britain, Lodges and Chapters of this Rite were founded. In particular in May, 1854, there was co nstituted in Brussels a Grand Lodge, L’Invisible; in 1856 a simil ar one in Geneva; and, in New York, through the exertions of F.C. Pelletier, the Lodge Thabor on September 22 nd , 1855; in Ballarat Australia, a Grand Mother Lodge, The Golden Bough of Eleuis, was res ult of the work of Brother Ballaguy. Thus in 1857 the Order cons isted of above mentioned 5 Supreme Councils, of 4 Grand Representa tive Councils in America (New York), Australia (Ballarat), Belgium (Brussels), and Switzerland (Geneva) and of the before n amed Lodges in Birmingham, Brussels, New York, and Ballarat , to which are now added the Lodge Friends of Virtue at Geneva and t hen following 4 Lodges in London : Gimnosophists, Supreme Chapter of the Fraternity of Peoples, Grand Chapter of Disciples of Hermes and the Council of Grand Regulators of Freemasonry. These fo rmed together 14 Lodges of various degrees; but the report t hat we have before us brings up this number to not less than 104 , for it adds below 90 model Lodges in London, one for each of th e 90 degrees. With reference to these 90 Lodges, no one has any other information and, with some foundation, according to the very reports of one of the Sovereign Councils, the General C ouncil in 1857 had already been inactive for a year past, a fact which cannot be reconciled with a florid condition in the life of t he Lodges. And one is confirmed in the conclusion that the Order mus t have been in a poor condition by the fact that, already in 1860, it had arrived at a new Organization. This is distinguished from the preceding ones as follows : The 90 degrees are reduced to 30 and there is something more systematic in their grading, even thought it be only nom inally so. Each series of 3 degrees forms special class of Masonry ; there is a division of the 30 degrees into three series, correspond ing to the grades of Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master, so that always the terms of these three series fall into one of the ten clas ses:"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 The manifest intention of this new Organization was “by means of this division, derived from the widening of the Work o f System, to give to the Brethren and to the Lodges the possibilit y of studying usefully, and according to their special faculties, the fruitful principles of Masonic philosophy, and old and new.” Nor shall we are in supposing that, at one time at any rate, it had t he object of putting the Memphis System on the Masonic market, so t o speak, in a new form procuring for it better access. In fact we find that Order tended to spread, on the Continent. In Berlin, at the b eginning of 1861, an Agent, who nominally sold Jewish certificat es of the Lodge of Gymnosophist of London, (this is stated in writin g by Serbeth in the Freimaurerzeitung), began an agitation for restri cting the limits of that Grand Lodge. A better result was obtained by th ese efforts in France, where the Memphis Rite once more gained ground. O n July 29, 1862, the Lodge Les Sectateurs de Menes having r esumed its labours presented a list of Members to the Grand Orien t trough Brother Marconis, as Grand hierophant of the Memphis Ri te, and asked for recognition. The Lodge remained as it was, b ut the request for recognition of the Rite was presented to t he Grand College of Rites, which in the meeting of the 12 th , November of the same year, decided. The above name commission (whose judgment is contained in the Bulletin of the Grand Orient of N ovember, 1862, S. fg.) was of opinion that, in consequences of that p etition, Brother Marconis had renounced all the rights and dignities d ue to him in the Rite of Memphis and, as the Rite has for its objec t the moral and scientific sides and the propaganda of the Masoni c truths which had for long been taught by the Grand Orient, the Comm ission pronounced on this, that in principle the Rite of Memp his be placed under the obedience of the Grand Orient and permission b e given to its Lodges to work in the three symbolic degrees accordi ng to their own Rite. An Application for admission to higher degr ees of the Rite which, however, according to the Statutes of the Gran d Orient, could follow, in principle, only up the 30 th , was left undiscussed, attention being only drawn to the fact that such a per mission, to work in higher degrees, could only come about if the rule s of the Statutes of the Grand Orient were observed. But in Februar y, 1864, this latter question came up again owing to the appli cation of the Lodge Disciples of Memphis, which had meanwhile resume d its labours in Paris, and the Grand College of Rites decid ed on the above mentioned presuppositions, by forming a Chapter in connection with this Lodge (Bull: of the Grand Orient, March, 1864). Consequently the Rite of Memphis is at present (August , 1864) active in France and possesses the two above named Lodg es, together with Chapter, in Paris, and also another Lod ge, The Knights of Palestine, in Marseilles. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 We don’t know if the above described Organization of 1860, recent as it is, has least in part been changed, but it is a lmost to be so conjectured, as, in treating of the matter, the Grand College of Rites, in November, 1862, speaks of the 90 degrees of the Rite grouped into 7 classes. According to other observatio ns and to what is known to us of character and doctrine of this Rit e, the same really presents itself as a system which has brotherhood for i ts foundation, which does not clash with the essence of M asonic teaching. “The Memphis Rite is the continuation of the Ancient M ysteries. Its doctrine has for its foundation Humanity, its, task is the study of the Wisdom which teaches knowledge of Truth. This is th e beneficent work of developing the reason and the intuit ion; it is the education of the qualities of the human heart and the su ppression of its Vices; it is the Sublime Institution, above al l, which ennobles manners, which covers the earth with its divine emanati ons and, by love, weaves among men the ties Universal Brotherhood.” So says the Grand Hierophant Marconis de Negre in the Mystic Sun, published in 1853 in the journal of Universal Freemas onry, and these words may be regarded as typical of what is sai d on other editions of the Journal. In the Rite of Memphis we sho uld see an attempt on the part of Masonry to strike out a new pat h, that of the symbols of all periods of culture leading to the Theoso phy of early times.” (Lett.

The Essenes, almost contemporaneously, founded the school of Solomonic Sci ence and held their meetings in [union with] Ormus. His discipl es up to 1118 remained the sole depositories of the ancient Egyptian Wi sdom, but it is alleged that they then communicated it in part to several Knights of Palestine who, in 1150, arrived in Edinburgh, and there erected a Grand Lodge, making use, in initiations, of the form ulas given them. It is believed that the disciples of Ormus remained fai thful to the Ancient traditions; the others founded a new Rite. What, however, is more positive is that in August, 17 98, Napoleon the Great and Kleber, although already Masons, receive d initiation and affiliation in the Rite of Memphis by one, venerabl e in age and"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 wise in doctrine and manners, who was said to be a descen dent of the ancient sages of Egypt. The initiation took pla ce at the Pyramid of Cheops and they [the Candidates] received for sole in vestiture a ring, as a characteristic sign of their dignity. Nap oleon, with General Kleber and various officers of his army, founded here the first Memphis Lodge in 1798-99. Both Napoleon and his Bret hren had to convince themselves that Masonry (namely, the school of Sages) has never really died out in this land, the cradle of the My steries and of human knowledge. It filtered through into the variou s classes of the Egyptian people who, under various denominations and f ormulas worked, and still work, the ancient Mysteries, which a re [also] ours, namely those of Modern Free Masonry. Napoleon found a fruitful soil and in it got the Ancient Wisdom to sprout again, en riched by all the knowledge of the modern world and rejuvenated by all t he hopes of a splendid future. Bro ∴ Samuel Honis of Cairo, having been initiated in the sai d Lodge, received the custody of its Archives and then, owing to political events, it was put to sleep. About 1814 Bro ∴ Samuel Honis introduced the Rite into France. This first Lodge was founded at Montauban on the 30 th , April, 1815, by Brothers: Samuel Honis, Gabriel Mathieu Marconis de Negre, Baron Dumas, Marquis de Laroque and Hypolite Labrunie . The said Lodge was constituted, under the distinctive title of Disciples of Memphis, on the 23 rd , May of that year. On the 7 th , March, 1816, this Grand Lodge declared itself asleep and its Archives were intrusted to Bro ∴ Gabriel Marconis de Negre, Grand Master, who had been so elected in the meeting of the Gr and Lodge and raised to the Grand Hierophancy by a decision of the same on January 21 st , 1816. On March, 21 st , 1838, The Rite of Memphis, after a sleep 22 years, resumed its interrupted labours and, on the 29 th , of the same month, its three supreme Councils were constituted. On April 3 rd , of the same year the Grand Lodge of Osiris was found ed by the Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Jacques Etienne Marconis, son of the deceased Grand Hierophant, depository of the traditions and Arc hives of the Order. On May 21 st , 1839, was constituted the Chapter of the Philadelp hi at the Orient of Paris. On December 24 th , 1839, the Lodge of Knights of Palestine was constituted at the Orient of Marseilles and, on Decem ber 30 th , 1839,"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 the said Lodge was raised to the rank of Provincial Gr and Lodge 90 degrees, Sublime Masters of the Great Work. On May 21 st , 1841, the Grand Hierophant put the Rite to sleep. On March 5 th , 1848, it resumed its labours. In May 21 st , was constituted the Menes Chapter at the Orient of Paris. On July 27, 1850,the Chapter and the Areopagus of Dis ciples of Memphis were founded in Paris. The Council of Sublime Masters of the work was installed in Paris on April 5 th , 1851. On December 21 st ,1851, the Rite of Memphis was again put to sleep by order of the Grand Hierophant. I t was not, therefore, Bro ∴ Jacques Etienne Marconis who introduced the Rite of Memphis into Europe as many believe. Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Jacques Etienne Marconis was the true restorer of the R ite and it is to his lights that we owe the bombastic na ture (“ampollosita”) of his reform and the various attempts made to propagate it. Ill ∴ Bro ∴ J. E. Marconis, after having kept up a serious strugg le for 26 years against the Grand Orient of France, being wea ry of his labours, or perhaps, too, in the interest of Masonic peace, thought it advisable to resign and abdicate his dignity of Univ ersal Grand Hierophant in favour of the Grand Orient of France, c eding the Rite at the same time, as appears from his letters of May 15 th , 1862, and those confirming his resignation of the 1 st September, 1863; 2 nd , March, 1864; 26 th , September, 1865; and 15 th March, 1866. Long before negotiating the cession of the Rite to the G rand Orient of France, Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Marconis legally and regularly constituted in Cairo the Lodge Menes and in Alexandria founded a Supreme Cou ncil of the Order, with the distinctive title of Grand Orient of Egypt, composed of Seven Patriarchs Grand Conservators of the Order, G rand Elects of the Mystic and Traditional Section of Memphis, with authority to confer from the first to the ninetieth degree of Sublim e Master of the Great Work and found Lodges, Chapters, Areopagi, Senat es and Consistories. In 1856 he issued to the Grand Orient of Egypt a Paten t of Sovereign General Administrative Council of the Order, 94 degree, a nd of Government of the Order, 95 degree, (Sanctuary of Memphi s) giving it full powers to constitute all the corporate sections of the Rite and rule them as a free and independent body.

(Arti cle 7 of section 3, and article 4 of section 1, of the Organic Statutes of the Order). Whereas Bro ∴ Jacques Etienne Marconis was not the owner of the Rite, but merely the successor of the deceased Grand Hierop hant and, consequently, the custodian (V. Statutes and Regu lations of the Rite published 11 th , January, 1839, Section I, Articles1, 4 and 5; Section III, Article 2), therefore the Act of Abdicat ion of Bro ∴ Marconis in favour of the Grand Orient of France, not having been countersigned by the Grand Chancellor of the Rite, a s is prescribed by Art.4 of Section I and by Art. 26 of Section III, which require the countersignature of the Grand Chancellor under pain of nullity, that Act is null and as if it had not taken place. Whereas the procedure of Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Marconis is not legal, inasmuch as he cannot cede the Rite which does not belong to him, but which was only intrusted to him as a sacred trust, and wher eas in face of the Order such Act is void, as it tends to the dissol ution of the Supreme Power of the Rite of Memphis; considering that t he resignation of a titular holder, or functionary, cann ot dissolve the Body which has entrusted to him that dignity; whereas in France, in consequence of the abdication of the Grand Hierophant, the Mystic Temple, the Sanctuary of Memphis and the Sovereign Grand Council, together with the three lower councils, 93 rd , 92 nd , and 91 st degrees, have been dissolved. Whereas the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Order of Memphi s in the Valley of Marseilles rose up and unanimously proteste d against such an Act. The Grand Orient of Egypt, in virtue of the powers con ferred upon it by Patent No III, called together all the Patriarchs 95 th existing in Egypt (and created such by Bros. Marconis himself) t o a meeting of the Sanctuary, and it is only in 1867 that met, and , in virtue of the legal and regular Patent No III founded the first Sanc tuary of Paris; Egypt in substitution of the demolished Sanctuary of Paris; Egypt being the possessor of the one and only Patent of that grade and Authority which the Grand Hierophant J.E. Marconis d id legally and regularly grant, of Supreme Administrative and Govern ing Power of the Order of Memphis, almost as a presage of what he himself was about to do, so that the Rite should have in Egypt, i ts ancient cradle, that which the circumstances of the time perhaps preve nted is being"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 any longer able to have in Paris, namely the general s eat of the Order. At the elections for the foundation of the Sanctuary H is Highness Prince Halim Pascia, son of the Great Mohamet-Aly was elected Grand Master of the Order. The Sanctuary’s first care was to construct Lodges, Chapters, Councils, etc. The enthusiasm aroused in Egypt by the foundation of t he Sanctuary is easy to understand when in a few weeks the number of its adepts grew to several hundreds . The Ground Orient of Egypt, as Supreme Power of the Or der, prospered until 1868, in which year those who were jealou s of the Egyptian Masonic Power, and the personal enemies of the Grand Master, insinuated in the ears of the Khedive, and on his Government, that the Prince, and the Order, had sinister a ims and succeeded in getting him exiled from Egypt. The Order so on felt terrible shock of the Grand Master’s departure. The Lo dge and Councils ceased to work; the Sanctuary worked clandest inely with a very limited number of Patriarchs and Subl ∴ Magus 96, the Marquis Joseph de Beauregard- acting as a supplementary Grand M aster under mandate received from the Grand Master himself pr eserved the Rite for some time longer. In 1869 prudence required that it should again be put t o sleep as it had aroused not a few suspicions in the Civil Governm ent. From its foundation in 179-99 until 1869 the Rite w as to succumb many times and, like a new Phoenix, to rise again as man y times with its own element. In 1872 we were called to take p art in the Rite of Memphis, which about a month earlier had begun to s how signs of new life, and on November 21 st of that year the Grand Orient of Egypt called together all its Patriarchs to a meeting of the Sanctuary, and on December 21 st , nominated us a its provisional Grand Master in the place of His Highness of His Highness Ismail, Kh edive of Egypt, to reopen the labours of the Grand Orient of Egypt, a n authorization accorded to us as a mark of the confidence and friends hip which the Sovereign was pleased to extend to us, we became aware, in assuming the reins of the Administrative and Governing power of the Order, of the grave and difficult task we had undertak en. The Order had returned to chaos and it was necessary to found, or ganize and consolidate it. We do not blame our predecessor, as he had not had time to consolidate it, nor yet the time to arrange matt ers so that his supplementary Grand Master should do so, for he had on ly for a few days the pleasure of finding himself among his brethr en, having been exiled a few days after his nomination as Grand Master o f the Order. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 Shortly after, the Sanctuary [had] ceased to exist, and I might almost say it never really existed, except in the authentic documents granting it powers to constitute itself as such, for almost as soon as it was born it, like its ancestors, fell asleep again unt il the 21 st November, 1872. From that date to the 20 th , December were merely preparatory meetings and, between December 21 and Marc h 20thm we were really able to found and reorganize the Order. On March 21 st , 1873, we were unanimously and definitely elected and proclaimed Grand Master of the Sanctuary of Memphis, National Grand Orient of Egypt, and invested it the dignity whic h, up to 20 th , December, 1872, was held by the very Ill ∴ Bro ∴ His Highness Prince Halim. As soon as we had taken definite charge of our Office and of its inherent prerogatives, we dedicated ourselves with all our energies both physical and moral to the consolidation of the E gyptian Masonic Power, which was definitely proclaimed as founded on March 21 st , 1873. On the 19 th April of the same year the Order was more than ever consolidated by the protectorate of the August Soverei gn of this historic land. The august Ismail consented to grant h is powerful protectorate, promising his full adherence to the develo pment of our peaceful labours, provided that the Order took no part in politics hostile to the progress of Egypt. WE pledged our word of honour that we should never ta ke part in politics, unless asked to do so by the Head of the St ate; and that if, one day, the Order, or the Members comprising it, were a sked to assist the plans of the Head of the State and his Go vernment, they would do so, provided that such plans tended to the g ood of the people and to the progress of Egypt. The August Sovereign, who was a century ahead of his peo ple, quite understood what we said and declared himself satisfie d. Thus was established the understanding between Masonic Egypt and the Ruler of Civil Egypt. While, with the assistance of the Patriarchs Grand Cons ervators of the Order, we were dedicating ourselves to the reorganis ation of the Rite, our August Protector asked us to join with him in smoothing the way and difficulties which opposed the foundation of Judicial Reforms in Egypt. On behalf of the Order, and with its conse nt, we accepted the grave and difficult, but in every way honourabl e, task. It is to the National Orient that Egypt very largely owes the result obtained by the foundation of the Institution of Reformed Tribuna ls, which however cost us twenty thousand pounds."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 Nevertheless, in our struggle against all sort of diffi culties for nearly two years, we must conscientiously declare that we had t he collaboration of the most learned Masons of our Order, but for which we could not have succeeded in the task. Our action and the result obtained was highly appreci ated by the August Sovereign who, in thinking us, was good enough to grant us his Sovereign protection, and it is to the Sovereign support that the Grand Orient of Egypt owes its development, for withou t the approval of the Khedive for its foundation, and without his pr otection, the Order would have been tormented by religious quarrels a nd by the persecution of the civil Government; whereas, under the patronage of the Khedive himself, the most eminent personages became initiated, or were affiliated, to our revered Rite. Even the heads of Islam gave a strong hand, morally, to clear away the prejudices o f the Egyptian people; and some of them applied for and obtained initi ation. On June 27 th , 1873, the Supreme Council of the Order granted us full and unlimited powers, accompanied by unanimous vote of confidence, and on August 15 th , the Constituent Assembly approved and confirmed the decision of the Supreme Council. On the 1 st , November of the same year we were raised to the 96, and on 11 th , January, 1874, we were, by unanimous vote, authorize d to assume ourselves the title of Grand Hierophant in the s tead of the abdicated Grant Hierophant J.E. Marconis. As soon as we obtained the Supreme Dignity of the Rite our first thought was to raise 6 Patriarchs 95, to the degree o f the Sublime Magus, 96, and with them to rebuild the ruined Mystic Temple. The Mystic Temple was rebuilt within the Grand College of Ri tes, which we had previously founded for the complete independence an d dogmatic liberty of the Rite. On May 8 th , 1876, by our Decree No77 bis, we reorganized the Gra nd Orient anew and constituted it a Confederation Diet of Egyptian Masonry. We found a Symbolic Grand Lodge under the title of Nat ional Grand Lodge of Egypt and proclaimed it free and independent of any other Body, both as regards Dogma and Administration. We ha nded over all powers both of Dogma and Administration to the Supr eme Councils of the Scottish and Memphis Rites, declaring and procla iming them free and independent the one of the other, each to govern itsel f in accordance with its Organic Statutes, [and] only bou nd by ties of brotherhood to the Confederative Diet of Masonry of the Valley of the Nile.

SUNTO STORICO Come a noi tutti è noto, si vuole che l'ordine di Me mfi sia stato introdotto in Europa da un saggio d'Egitto nominato Ormus,"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 convertito dal filosofo Marco (detto il Santo) alla scuola filosofica del Cristo. Gli Esseni quasi nel contempo fondarono la scuola della scienza Salomonica, e tenevano le loro riunioni in Or mus. I suoi discepoli, fino al 1118 restarono soli depositari del la antica saggezza egiziana, ma a quell'epoca, si pretende che la comunicass ero in parte a diversi Cavalieri della Palestina che nel 1150 giunsero ad Edimburgo, dove fu da cotesti Cavalieri eretta una Gran Loggia, servendosi nelle iniziazioni di quelle formole a loro dat e. I discepoli d'Ormus si crede che restassero fedeli alle Antiche tradiz ioni; gli altri fondarono un nuovo Rito. Quello che però è più positivo si è che nel 1798 (agosto ) Napoleone il Grande e Kleber, sebbene massoni, ricevettero l'inizi azione e l'affigliazione al Rito di Memfi da un venerando per et à e saggio per dottrina e costumi, che dicevassi discendente degli an tichi saggi d'Egitto. L'iniziazione ebbe Inogo alla Piramide di C heope ed ebbero un anello per tutta investitura, come segno caratteristi co della loro dignità. Napoleone, Kleber e vari officiali della sua armata, fondarono qui la prima Loggia Memfitia, 1798-99. Ta nto Napoleone che i suoi FF. ebbero a convicersi che la Massoneria (cioè la scuola dei saggi) non fu mai veramente spenta in questa terra, culla dei misteri e dell'umano sapere. Essa si infiltrò nelle di verse classi del popolo egizio, e sotto varie denominazioni, e formule hanno sempre lavorato e tutt'oggi lavorono ai loro antichi Mister i che sono pure i nostri, cioè della Moderna Massoneria. Napoleone trovò u n terreno fecondo, e sur esso fece rigermogliare il germe dell'antica sapienza arrichita di tutte le cognizioni del Mondo moderno e r ingiovanita, di tutte le aspirazioni d'uno splendido avvenire. Il fratello Samuele Honis di Cairo, essendo stato i niziato in detta Loggia, ne ricevette in consegna gli Archivi, indi per ali avvenimenti politici, fu messa in sonno. Verso il 1814 il fratel lo Samuele Honis introdusse il Rito di Memfi in Francia. La prima Loggia fu fondata a Montauban il 30 Aprile 1815 dai fratelli Samuele Honis; Gabrielle Matteo Marconis de Negre, il barone Dumas, il Marchese de Laroque e Ippolito Labrunie. Dett a Loggia si è costituita sotto il titolo distintivo dei Discepoli di Memfi, il 23 Maggio di quell'anno. Il 7 Marzo 1816 cotesta Gran Loggia diciharossi in sonno ed i suoi Archivi furono affidati al F. Gabrielle Marconis de Neg re, Gran Maestro che era stato eletto tale nella seduta di Gran Loggia, ed elevato al Grand' lerofantato per decisione della medesima il 21 Gennajo 1816. Il 21 Marzo 1838 il Rito di Memfi, dopo un sonno di 22 anni , Riprendeva i suoi interrotti lavori e il 29 dello stesso mese furono"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 costituiti i suoi tre Supremi Consigli ; ed il 3 Apri le dello stesso anno fu fondata la Gran, Loggia d'Osiride, dall' Ill. F. Giacomo Stefano Marconis figlio del defunto Grand'Ierofante, depositar io delle tradizioni degli archivi dell'Ordine. Il 21 Maggio 1839 fu costituita la Loggia Capitolar e dei Filadelfi all'Oriente di Parigi. Il 24 Dicembre 1839 fu costituita all'Oriente di Marsig lia la Loggia dei Cavalieri della Palestina; ed il 30 Dicembre 1839 dett a Loggia fu elevato al rango di Gran Loggia Provinciale 90 grado Sub. . Maestri della Grand'Opera. Il 21 Maggio 1841 il Grand'Ierofante ha posto il Rit o in sonno. Il 5 Marzo 1848 ha ripreso i suoi lavori. Il 21 Maggio f u costituito il Capitolo Ménés all'Oriente di Parigi. Il 27 Luglio 1850 si fondò in Parigi, la Loggia Cap itolare e Areopagita dei Discepoli di Memfi. Il Consiglio dei Sublimi Maestri della Grand'Opera fu installato in Parigi il '5 Aprile 1851. Il 21 Dicembre 1851 il Rito di Memfi fu di bel nuovo posto in sonno per ordine dei Grand'Ierofante. Noti è dunque Marconis che abbia introdotto il Rito di Memfi in Eur opa, come molti credono. L'Ill. F. Giacomo Stefano Marconis fu il vero ristau ratore del Rito ed è ai suoi lumi che noi dobbiamo l'ampollosita della st ia riforma e i diversi tentativi del suo propagamento. L’Ill. F. G. S. Marconis, dopo avere sostenuto una s eria lotta di 24 anni contro il Grand'Oriente di Francia, stanco dalle fattiche, o forse anco per la pace della Massoneria, credé conveniente di d imettersi abdicando la sua dignità dí Grand Ierofante Universa le in favore del Grand'Oriente di Francia, cedendo nel contempo il Rito, come risulta dalle su lettere 15 Maggio 1862; confermando la sua di missione colle sue 1 Settembre 1863; 2 Marzo 1864; 26 Settembre 1 865 ; e 15 Marzo 1866. Molto prima che l'Ill. F. Marconis trattasse la cessi one del Rito al Grand'Oriente di Francia, legalmente e regolarmente cost ituiva in Cairo la Loggia Ménés; in Alessandria, fondava un Supr emo Consiglio dell'Ordine, col titolo distintivo di Gran d' Oriente d'Egitto e formato di sette Patriarchi Grandi Conservatori dell'O rdine, Grandi Eletti della sezione mistica e tradizionale di Memfi, con autorità di conferire dal primo al novantesimo grado Sublime Maest ro della Grand'Opera e di fondare Logge, Capitoli, Areopagi, e Concistori.

Siccome il f ∴ Giacomo Stefano Marconis non era padrone del Rito, ma era solamente il successore del defunto Grand’Ierofante per conseguenza, il conservatore, vedi Statuti e Regolamenti del Rito pubblicati 11 Genajo 1839,titolo I. articolo I, IV e V; titolo III articolo II, per cui l’atto di abdicazione in favore del Grande Or iente de Francia fatto dal f ∴ Marconis non essendo stato contrassegnato dal Grand Cancelliere del Rito come e prescritto dall’articolo I V titolo I, e dall’articolo 26 titolo III che esige la controssegna tura del Cancelliere sotto pena di nullità, quell’atto e nullo e come non av venuto. Visto che il procedere dell’Ill ∴ f ∴ Marconis non e legale, per cui egli non può cedere il Rito che non gli appartiene ma ch e gli fu solamente affidato come un sacro deposito conservativo e che dirimpetto dell’Ordine tale atto e nulla giacche tende allo scioglimento della Potenza Suprema del Rito di Memfi: Considerand o che la dimissione d’un titolare, d’un funzionante non puo s cioglieri quel corpo che gli ha affidata la dignità. Visto che in Francia si e sciolto il Tempio M istico il Santuario di Memfi il Sovrano Consiglio generale unitamente ai tre C onsigli inferiori 93 92 91 grado, per il fatto dell’abdicazione del Gran d’Ierofante. Visto Che la Gran Loggia Provinciale dell’Ordine di Me mfi costituita alla valle de Marsiglia si e sollevata e ad unanimità protes to contro un tale atto, il Grand’Oriente d’Egitto in forza dei poteri c onferitigli colla’patente No III convocava tutti i Patriarchi 95 esistente in Egitto (creati tali dallo stesso f ∴ Marconis) in seduta di Santuario ed e solo nel 1867 c he si riunirono, e che in forza della legale e regolare patent e No III fondarono il primo Santuario di Memfi in Egitto, a surrogazion e de Parigi.

La prima cura del Santuario fu di costituire Logge, Ca pitoli ecc. L’entusiasmo che suscito in Egitto la fondazione del S antuario di Memfi e facile a comprendersi, quando in poche settimane i suo i adepti ascendeva a piu centinaja. Il Grand’Oriente d’Egitto, qual Potenza Suprema dell’O rdine prospero fino al 1868. In quell’anno i gelosi del progresso del la Potenza Massonica egiziana e nemici personali del suo Gran Maestro insinu arono alle orecchie dell’ex Kedive e del suo governo dei sinistri sc opi del Principe e dell’Ordine, e riuscirono a farlo esiliare dell’Egitto. Tosto partito il Gran Maestro, l’Ordine ne senti una scossa terribile. Le Logge, ed i Consigli cessarono di lavorare; il Sa ntuario lavorare clandestinamente con un limitatissimo di Patriarchi, c he assieme all’Ill ∴ Patriarca e Sub ∴ Mago 96 il Marchese Giuseppe de Beauregard, il quale funzionava da Gran Maestro aggiunto per mandato avut o dal Gran Maestro stesso, conservano il Rito per alcun tempo ancor a. Nel 1869 fu prudenza di porlo anco una volta in sonn o perche aveva destato non pochi sospetti al governo civile. Il Rito, dalla sua fondazione nel 1798 – 99 al 1869 doveva soccombere piu e piu volte, e come novella Fenice, altre tante vol te risorgere col suo proprio elemento. Nel 1872 fummo chiamati a far parte d el Rito di Memfi, che da un mese circa cominciava a dar segni di nuova vita, e il 21 Novembre di quell’anno il Grand’Oriente d’Egitto riu niva tutti i suoi. Patriarchi in seduta di Santuario, ed il 21 dic embre ci nominava a Suo Gran Maestro provvisorio in surrogazione di Sua A ltezza il Principe Halim.

Noi prendendo le redini del potere governativo ed amministrat ivo del'Ordine ci avvidimo del grave e del difficile carico che ci ass umevamo. L'Ordine era ritornato al Caos, bisognava di nuovo fondarlo, organizzarlo e consolidarlo. Noi noti ne fasciamo carico al nostro predecessore, gia cchè Egli non aveva avuto il tempo di costituirlo; nè tampoco il te mpo di disporre le cose in modo che il suo Gran Maestro aggiunto lo po tesse fare, perche ben pochi giorni ebbe il piacere di trovarsi coi suoi fratelli, essendo stato esiliato pochi giorni dopo la sua nomi na ed investitura alla Grati Maestria dell'Ordine. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 Poco dopo il Santuario più non esisteva, e quasi direi che non ha mai veramente esistito se non che in titoli Autentici ch e gli davano il potere e la facoltà di costituirsi tale, giacchè, qu asi appena nato, s'è posto, come i suoi avi, a dormire di bel nuovo fino a l 21 Novembre 1872. Dal 21 Novembre 72 al 20 Dicembre furono semplic i sedute preparatorie. Dal 21 Dicembre al 20 Marzo abbiamo pot uto veramente fondare l'Ordine e riorganizzarlo. Al 21 Mar zo 1873 venivamo ad unanimità definitivamente eletto e proclama to Gran Maestro del Santuario di Memfi, Grand'Oriente Nazion ale di Egitto, ed investito di quella dignità che fu fino al 20 Dicemb re 1872 occupata dall Illmo. Fratello Sua Altezza il Principe Halim. Tosto che ebbimo preso possesso definitivo della nostra carica, e delle sue inerenti prerogative ci dedicammo con tutte le no stre forze sì fisiche che morali a ben consolidare la Potenza Mas sonica d'Egitto la quale fu definitivamente proclamata fondata il 21 M arzo 1873. Il 19 Aprile dello stesso anno, l'Ordine venite pià ch e mai consolidato dal protettorato dell'augusto Sovrano di questa storica terra. L'Augusto Ismail aderi ad accordare il suo pot ente protettorato promettendo la piena adesione allo svilup po dei nostri pacifici lavori, purché I' ordine non si occupasse di politica ostile al progresso dell Egitto. Noi abbiamo impegnata la nostr a parola d'onore che mai e poi mai ci saremmo occupati di poli tica senza essere dal capo dello Stato invitati; e che se mai un d ì, l'Ordine, o i Membri che lo compongono fossero invitati a coadiuvare le mire del Capo dello Stato e del suo governo, ciò avrebbero fatto purchè tali mire tendessero al bene del popolo ed al progresso dell'Egi tto. L'Augusto Sovrano che precedeva di un Secolo il suo p opolo, ben comprese il nostro linguaggio e se ne dichiarò soddisf atto. Così si stabilì l'accordo fra l'Egitto Massonico ed il Regn ante dell'Egitto Civile. Nel contempo che noi, assistito dai Patriarchi Grandi Conservatori dell'Ordine, ci dedicavamo alla riorganizzazione del R ito, il nostro Augusto Protettore ci invitava di unirci a Lui, onde appianare la via e le difficoltà che vi si frapponevano alla fondazione della Giudiziaria in Egitto Noi per l'Ordine, e col sito consenso, abb iamo accettato il grave e difficile incarico, ma onorevole sott'ogni ra pporto.

Tuttavia lottando contro ogni sorta di difficoltà per ben quas i due anni. Dobbiamo per iscarico di coscienza dire, che abbiamo a vuto a collaboratori i più eruditi Massoni della nostra Po tenza, senza i quali non avremmo riuscito nell'impresa. "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 Il nostro procedere, ed il risultato ottenuto, fu alta mente che nel ringraziarci volle apprezzato dall'Augusto Sovrano, anco accordarci la Stia Sovrana Protezione. Ed è al Sovrano appogio c he il Grand'Oriente d'Egitto deve il suo sviluppo, giacchè, s enza l'adesione del Khedive, per la sua fondazione, e senza i l suo protettorato, l'Ordine sarebbe stato tormentato dalle lotte religiose, e dalla persecuzione del governo civile; mentrechè, sotto il patronato dello stesso Khedive, i P iù eminenti personaggi si iniziarono o si affiliarono al nostro venerato Rito. Gli stessi Capi dell’Islamismo, moralmente hanno data man forte per fare scomparire i pregindizii del popolo egizio; ed alcuni di loro chiesero ed ottennero d'essere iniziati. Il 27 Giugno 1873 il Supremo Consiglio dell'Ordine ci accordava pieni ed illi mitati poteri accompagnati da un voto unanime di fiducia, il 15 A gosto l'Assemblea Costituente approvava e confermava la decisi one del Sup.

Il 1 Novembre dello stesso anno fumino elevati al 96 g rado; e l'11 Gennaio 1874 siamo stati per un voto unanime autoriz zati di assumere Noi, il titolo di Grand'Ierofante in surroga zione del dimesso Grand'lerofante Giacomo Stefano Marconi. Appena ottenuto la Suprema Dignità del Rito il nostro primo pensiero fu di elevare sei Patriarchi 95 grado al gr ado di Sublime Magi 96, e con essi loro riedificare tosto il crollat o Tempio Mistico. li Tempio Mistico fu riedificato nel seno del Gran Colleg io dei Riti da Noi anteriormente fondato per la completa indipendenza e libertà Dogmatica di ogni Rito. L'8 Maggio 1876 con nostro decreto No. 77 bis abbia mo nuovamente riorganizzato il Grand'Oriente e l'abbiamo costituito a Dieta Confederativa della Massoneria Egiziana.

Nel Settembre 1877 abbiamo decretato il trasferimento d ella sede della Gran Loggia Nazionale in Cairo; e il 5 Maggio 1 878 Essa teneva la soa prima seduta quì.

In 1901 – 1902 Mizraim in its turn, became dormant and its members, for the most part, passed over to the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite. A few, like Papus and Teder, remained independent. “In 1908, June, 8 th , they brought about a Masonic Spiritualist Convention in Paris under the Hon.

(Extract from the Report of the Convention) “The Constitutive Patent of a Supreme Grand General Cou ncil for France was signed by the Sov. Sanct. Of Berlin on June 24 th ,1908, for the United Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. “Such is the origin of the revival of the Rite in Fran ce, after making the following passage: Marconis transmitted the Rite from France to North America; the latter transmitted it to England (John Yarker); England transmitted it to Germany (Theodor Reuss) and Germany brought it back to France in 1908 (Papu-Teder). “During the War (1914) the Rite became disorganised. Papus died in 1916 (25 th October), Teder succeeding him as GR ∴ M ∴ ; but he died, in his turn, in Spetember, 1918, tra nsmitting to me (Jean Bricaud) his powers. But the Rite was Dormant. In 1919 I notified Th. Reuss of the situation in France and of m y wish to revive the Rite with members that remained. Th.

With all the sentiments and perceptions on our part, we cannot very well accede to the solicitations, referred to in the abo ve mentioned communication, since, if it be true, that this Grand Body exists on the continent of America since thirty years, and hols full pledged jurisdiction over the Rite of Memphis 95°, then it is clear that this Soberana Gran Consejo General Iberico practices an other distinct Rite, with distinct organizations, and other views in its object, as may be distinguished by its proceedings, regime, admini stration, and denominations, for since our pretender and accuser solely conducts and governs the Rite of Memphis 95°; we do gov ern the"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" 161 Oriental Reformed Rite of Memphis and Mizraim; or more properly speaking: that we do govern neither the Rite of Memphis, nor of Mizraim but the Oriental Reformed-Rite of Memphis and Mi zraim, wherein the 91° and 97° have been converted to the 33°s o commonly known. It is for this reason, that our Consulting and Judi ciary Committee taking in consideration the international and univers al Masonic Rites, has adopted a decision and formed an opinion, that we are justified in occupying the American territory non-occ upied as yet by the Rite we do exercise. In fact it is a universal precept that each and every M asonic power is in the right to govern by its statutes all bodies es tablished within the confines of its jurisdiction, on any territory no t occupied by any other power of the same Rite. Thus, it is rational, that each and every power, gover ning a certain Rite in a recognized territorial jurisdiction is sovere ign and independent from others throughout the extension of i ts territory, save with due respect to all general laws of Masonry and fundamental Statutes of the Rite. Discontinuance to enunciate the denomination of the var ious powers; suffice it to convince our reader of the differ ences in the rite by the evidence contained in the seals thereof, as t he one bears the inscription: Sovereign Sanctuary 33°, 92° Ancient a nd Primitive Rite of Memphis Continent of America, while the other, t he one we govern: Soberano Gran Consejo General Iberico of the Anc ient and Primitive Oriental Rite of Memphis and Mizraim 33° 90 ° 96°. And if this be not sufficient proof to convince the r eader, we refer the same to the Supplement No I of the Lybic Chain April 1 st ,18 85, p7,8, wherein appeared the Charter of Craft regulating its situations, issued by the Grand Hierofante of the Rite of Memphis granted in Paris by the powerful Br ∴ S.E.

Consequently it results, that the Sovereign Sanctuar y of Memphis, with its higher jurisdiction in America, equal to th at of Rumania and Egypt, constitutes a confederation , with which we h ave always been on terms and relations of extreme amity, but never theless forms no part of the confederation of the Rite we do exer cise. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":" 162 Furthermore the Supreme Sanctuary of America seems to undervalue and hold in little esteem the Symbolism, whil e we on the other hand concede and lay great stress on the firs t three degrees of Masonry, as we consider the capitular and p hilosophic degrees, as generally understood, not representing any more than pure personal ambition, or incense loftiness. It is for this and various other reasons, that we have clearly demonstrated our right to occupy the territory of A merica and deem our actions in this respect fully justified as there is no omnipotence or omnisovereigness attached to Masonic Rights, and since the rank and most ancient precepts of ritualistic Masonry is o f more valor to us, than to them. It is scarcely comprehensible, that Universal, which ma inly involves the sentimental of individual right, should have no pos sible redemption for an institution, wherein should flagra te the sentiment of justice, and that Universal Masonry should have o mitted the idea of justice is beyond belief. We as a social entity, have admitted, recognized, and s heltered other social entities, desirous to live with us, we hav e admitted them, for we are aware of the fact, and know that every society must originate from some voluntary act, and coordina te with individual freedom, must have a certain well determined a im in view, in order to be recognized as a subject of righteou sness and as a lawful person. The fundamental law of social relations prohibits us to permeate or force in into the aims of individual persons, unless i t be of his own free will and accord, neither are we to violate the righ t of his own autonomy, or use the same for void purposes, for suc h is likewise the fundamental right of each and every lawful society , which as every lawful person, enjoys the prerogatives of choosi ng its collective aims, of determining its functions, of design ing and contriving the volition efforts and confidence of its members, of liberally disposing of its means, and simultaneously n ot violate the individual freedom of the social conditions, to be dec lare and sanctioned as unique right.

Nay, we cannot yield, the work we have accomplished to a body of different distinct Rite, notwithstanding the fact th at we doubt we doubt whether the same body whose presage is contested t o us, will ever desire it. Subsequent to thirty years of hard labor this Soverei gn Sanctuary of Memphis has succeeded in constituting nine bodies whil e on the other hand we have constituted eighteen bodies within a period of six months. Furthermore, they have always considered us abject, an d never did find it worth while to respect us according to the fo rms of good education, they contempted our company instead of excha nging with us representatives, as they have done with the Gran d Lodge of Cuba and not until then that we have succeeded in consti tuting within a period of six months twice the result of th eir labor during 360 months, that they consider us a body of the same R ite, presenting us with their official bulletin; prior to th at they have not conferred the favour upon us of nominating us as hono urable members; while now they demand of us that of which they never possessed any knowledge, nor were able to construe. This is a graceful interpretation of their precepts, an d an admirable theory of Territory Invasion. Let us examine this question from reasonable standpoint of view: We did not travel to East of North America with mere pr urience of invading said territory, but we have pursued, and soug ht to attain a certain aim, which we may well consider political, oral and essentially just. Omitting the primaries temporarily, we find that the latter have for their fundamental basis, the petition of diverse juridi cal entities and great number of Masons while we on our part cannot very well omit the precept which states: “Man does not live so isolate d, but in constant communication with his fellow beings”, since it is therefrom, that originates the laws governing the condit ions demanding The Right, the same being true within the orb it of individual activity or social action- consequently, when as the right, realized through conscientious and free activity, is a medium absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of the nat ural aims in social life; how then are we to leave and permit the co nditions of this right unaccomplished?

The invasion of the territory, non-occupied as yet by t he Ancient Reformed Oriental Rite of Memphis and Mizraim is a case of prompt resolution, not decided by a judge, but by those who have authoritatively constituted the law, and we have well interpreted the dispositions of Universal Convention and Congress in regard to this main point, for it is a well known fact, that the fa culty of law creation is augmented by the interpretation of diverse ca ses, such as justly demand that the respective law be accurately kn own. It was within this sense and for this reason, that the Ro man jurist maintained, that the office of interpretation of laws p ertains to the art of Legislature. “Eorum vanam subtilitatem tam risimus quam corrigend am esse censuimus.

Are we to omit the accomplishment of good for the sak e of good, which is per se a moral precept, and perform the same in order to obtain some other good, which is another precept of rig ht?

Since we are not solely induced by the aforesaid reasons and causes, but it is the sublime sentiment of patriotism that prevails upon us at this solemn moment.

While it is obvious, that our fatherland possesses su fficient life and vigor of mind, not to consent to any disgrace of the kind; it is for Cuba to mediate and reflect upon, that fatherland for fatherland is of more value, for it was the first populace in the wo rld from the sixth till the sixteenth Century, equal to Greece throu gh Epopee, Italy, through Art, France through philosophy, it is this fatherland that had maintained a Leonidas in Pelago, an Aquiles i n Cid; that commenced with Numanic and ended with Zaragoza; it i s this our native country that traversed the fiery seas of America, and to wich this new continent owes its civilization, culture, a nd in its immense superiority its language.

Does Masonry advanced in its progress above all orders , maintain as an absolute Epiphany the principle of divine right? A series of men, highly respected in Masonry, but very ignorant in the subject of public right have arrogated and attrib uted to themselves the power of recognizing Masonic rights and regularities, a regularity they concede to whom it pleases them, or refuse whenever such idea comes uppermost in their min ds; dare ye be inquisitive and ask who has granted them much p ower?

Such is the spirit of understanding and reason of t he members of that gallant potency, such is the disposition of the members of the Masonic science, which they interpret according to th eir methods.

Notwithstanding the stat e of affairs granted in favour of the above said Grand Lo dge, France has contracted alliance of amity with another potency, p rofessing the same Rite as the Independent of Spain, recognizing as t he unique regular body of Scotch Masonry in Spain the Grand O rient of Spain, while on the other hand, the Grand Lodge of Switzerland the Grand Orient of Greece, and various other Grand Lodges, grant the same recognition to the National Grand Orient of Spain, and the Grand Lodge of the State of New York concede the same to the Gr and Orient of Spain with which powers, they simultaneousl y exchange representatives, without any scrupulosity whatsoever."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 167 On the same continent of America, whereon there exists th e most undisturbed and unaffected Order of Masonry, a Mason ry, which is the most crankly observer of the doctrines of Fraternity a Masonry gigantic in the eyes of the world through its character istic works, with a modesty among its conspicuous members equal to none; there on that same continent we do encounter with (not withstanding the tiresome gossip of jurisdiction rig ht), 260 Lodges existing without fear, scrupulosity, without being con sidered as invaders or vagabonds working under the auspices of th e directive bodies of the German Masonry, practising the Rite of York, which is the same Rite practised by the most perfect Masonry.

Se ymour received into the 33-95 a Mason of the name Calvin C. Bu rt, who was expelled from the Craft for dishonourable conduct , and accordingly he stood expelled from all degrees of our Ri te. Meantime the Grand Orient of France issued a Concordat regulating all the degrees of our Rite with 33 degrees of the A.A. Ri te, and acting upon this Seymour and his Sovereign Sanctuary arranged to reduce the degrees to 33 by eliminated the more useless names where no ceremony was attached. It is clear that in la w Seymour could only sell or give what he had received, and the re ductions is valid on no one who chooses to repudiate it. In such case, where the reduction is objected to, it is only necessary to r ecall the eliminated names; besides which all the American patents i ssued to this and other countries were on the old form of 95 degr ees down to 1872, and even after that date. The expelled Calvin C. Burt then declared himself Grand Ma ster of the Rite of 95 Degrees, and went on receiving members i nto it and, as was always alleged, applied the fees for doing so to his own use. In point of fact, his Masonic standing in the United States was at no time other than of Masonic imposture. It is fair to add, however, that Burt asserts that he obtained re-admittance to t he Craft and had his expulsion cancelled. This may or may not be so , and it is very little consequence, for he stood expelled in our Rite, and had made himself the leader of a spurious body, which was l ooked upon everywhere as an imposture and a swindle, and tending t o bring disgrace upon the genuine bodies of our Ancient and Pri mitive Rite. While all this was occurring the genuine Sovereign Sa nctuary of America became dissatisfied with the conduct of Harry J. Seymour, and the Grand officers determined to purchase him out at a cost of 3.000 dollars. Seymour took the dollars, resigned his office to the Sovereign Sanctuary of America, with all patents, char ters, rituals, documents and privileges whatsoever, and notified the s ame to the world. Upon this the Sov. Sanctuary of America elected as its Grand Master an honourable and high-minded gentleman, Professo r Alexander B. Mott, 33 – 96, who yet holds the office o f Grand Master by re-election. It follows from this that ther e is only one legitimate body of our Rite in America, namely – that p resided over"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 by Bro ∴ Mott; all others are spurious, and we have no excuse f or holding relations with them. Anything contrary to th is which may reach our members is Yankee bunkum and humbug. The next step in this farce was as follows. The spurious Egyptian Rite of Memphis, presided over by Calvin C. Burt, becam e dissatisfied with their chief, and he (Burt) agreed to sell out to Darius Wilson for 1.000 dollars. A small hole and c orner meeting, the circular of Bro ∴ Lord informs us, was held of a few members who were favourable to Darius Wilson - about eight w e believe - who were said to represent 506 chapters, and 10.319, m embers, which was probably a mathematical calculation of wh at they might expect to get before the world came to an end. But a re mainder of the prospective ten thousand members refused to agree to Da rius Wilson’s purchase of the Rite, and elected Judge Parrish as their Grand Master. Thus there came into existence two spuri ous branches of our Rite; besides which Calvin C. Burt continued to confer degrees. This led to a judicial tribunal in w hich Wilson expelled Burt, and it was found: 1. The said Burt is a liar. 2. The said Burt is a swindler. 3. The said Burt is a counterfeiter. Against Wilson himself the following charges are mad e: (we do not, of course, vouch for all of them, and if not true, we render him a favour in informing him of them.) 1. His order is confined to a few hundred members of t he 95 degrees, with whom he divided the fees for admission. 2. He is running the Rite as a private speculation out of which he can make a living. 3. That he is not a lawfully qualified medical practi tioner. The Grand Lodge of Massachusetts formally endorsed the assertion, that Wilson is running the Rite to make m oney, and expelled him from the Craft. It was an excess of zeal on part of Massachusetts, and has led Wilson into conferring the Craft degrees, wherever such intolerant Grand Lodges exist. We need only say that whilst every brother will admit that Wi lson had a right to recoup himself fir his outlay of 1.000 doll ars, yet any brother in this country who attempted to run a Masoni c system in the lines upon which this is done, would be deserved ly treated as a Masonic swindler. The next irregularity arose in CANADA. Grand Master Mot t believing that Canada was included in his charter, es tablished a"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 Grand Mystic Temple 32-94 in that dominion, upon whic h our Sovereign Sanctuary gave them a Mizraim Charter. Canada , dissatisfied with holding from the United States, ins tead of waiting for a charter declared themselves independent, an d elected Bro ∴ Geo. C. Longley, 33-95 as G. M. of a Sovereign Sanctuary and, as Darius Wilson had also established a Sovereign Sanctuary in C anada the two united in a fraternal manner as one body. Meantim e G. M. Longley had chartered Bro ∴ W. B. Lord, of the United States, as G. M. of Mizraim, in opposition to G. M. Mott, who also claimed to confer Mizraim in virtue of being an honorary memb er of our own body. But these complications were not yet and end. Seymour h ad a Mizraim patent, obtained in 1862, which he sold to Da rius Wilson, as a genuine charter. Seymour could however, giv e Wilson no powers in our Rite, for he had none to give , he had sold and handed over every power to G. M. Mott. We know, however, that a 30-90 degrees charter had been stolen from Mott and handed by Seymour to Wilson. Of course such a stolen charter could carry with it not validity, and was at best only a council charter (30 degrees). Bro ∴ Lord, in his circular of January 21 st , 1884, says, that our own Grand Examiner General (meaning Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Campbell), after due search says, that if Seymour had a document it was a forgery. But that is altogether a mistake. Seymour was over in England in 1872, and informed the writer of this personally that he had exchanged with Donald Campbell a Mizraim for a Memphis certificate; moreover, in 1873, Bro ∴ Donald Campbell at a personal interview told the writer that he held Mizraim powers from Whyte Melville, and had a 90 degrees certificate to Harry J. Seymour. The fact s remains, however, that Seymour made no use of his Mizraim powe r and allowed Bro ∴ Lord to occupy the ground without protest. But we ought to have all the facts of the case as regards Seym our and Wilson, before drawing any inference as to the respect ive validity of the antagonistic claims of Lord Wilson. It is to Wilson’s credit that he proposed a union wit h Mott’s body, but the terms were such that Mott refused compliance, and that we think in justice to himself. But it might be possi ble for Dr. Mott and Judge Parrish to unite their forces. Lord mig ht join either with Mott or Wilson, probably the former. Is there no man of influence amongst these several bodi es that will strive to bring about a consummation so devoutly to be wished as union?"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 There another alternative, for the sake of peace and qui etness, as regards Wilson, which is favoured by circumstances. The circumstances are as follows and it would depend upon Wilson himself whether he would accept recognition o such terms: - We have shown that he is altogether a spurious and i rregular member of our Rite, and he seems to have accepted the situation by detaching himself from all its tradition s and forming a new Rite, inasmuch as he has compiled an entirely new Egyptian Ritual of 95 degrees, in which every grade is based on the antagonism which existed in old times between the Hy ksos and native Egyptians. Might not, therefore, the regular Sovereign Sanctuaries accept it as a third Rite? We und erstand that a Limerick and Glasgow Brother are prepared to p ropose and second such proposal, but it could only be accept ed subject to some limitations; we could not recognise the whole of his members is true, and it would be necessary to limit our recognition of members of the 95 degrees, to about a do zen Grand Officers of his governing body.   We leave our brethren to think over these ideas. We feel s ure that they will agree with us in the desirability of keeping up the standing of our Rite, by admitting none but good and true Ma sons in their Chapters, and by supporting only the respectable and r egular Sovereign Sanctuaries of the Rite. EXTRACT - 3 Pages 125-6 (Italy, Egypt and the Grand Hierophanc y) Again, once more has arisen another complication, and the reader will see that every one of these difficulties arises from t he unprincipled character of individual masons led by va nity, egotism, and love of money and fancied powers. The Sovereign Sanct uary of Great Britain and Ireland, America, Roumania and Ital y, combined to elect Guiseppe Garibaldi as S.G.M. of the Confederate Pow ers, and which the General formally accepted. There existed at t he time in Italy a body called the Reformed Egyptian Rite of 33 deg ree, led by Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Pessina, as G.M.; it was a reduction of the Rite of Mizraim of 90 degree, and has never been acknowledged by any Ma sonic power in the Craft degrees, and moreover bears a bad ch aracter with the Grand Orient of Rome. Bro ∴ Lord’s assertion that the Rite of Mizraim dates from 1747, is nonsense, as every one kno ws it was not"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 created until 1805. Its patrons, the Brothers Bedaride, asserted that the Italians were legitimate only to the 86 degree, and the spurious from that point, and refuse to recognized them; moreov er, it has been asserted that Bro ∴ Pessina has no legitimate authority as successor of the Neapolitan Mizraim body. However, everywhere Mizraim had been brought into contemp t by the grasping avarice of the Bedarides, and we ourselves only practise it, because at the commencement of our Sovereign Sanct uary in 1872, a few of our Members had it from old date. To get over this difficulty, and make a valuable colleague of Italy, w e exchanged charters with them and constituted them a legitimate So vereign Sanctuary of our Rite. As such all the powers hold rela tions with them at the present time, Except Egypt. But, Egypt, with whom we have held, and we hope always shall hold, the most amicable relations, refused to concur either in the election of General Garibaldi, with the title of Grand Hieropha nt, or in the recognition of Bro ∴ Pessina, on the grounds that since the death of the last Grand Hierophant, J.E. Marconis, the same ha d appertained to Egypt by transmission trough the Marquis De Baur egard, S.A. Zola, and lastly Professor F.F. Oddi. We are inclined to think that this claim is a valid one, provided their patent as a Sov ereign Sanctuary is older than that of America (1862), but on this poi nt we think no proof has been offered and it would be very easy for E gypt to make it. At any rate Egypt as a valid and acknowledged con servative power of the Rite, deserves our best support. However, on the d eath of General Garibaldi, Bro ∴ Pessina, contrary to the wish of the leading members of the Confederation, who desired to see a worthy successor to Garibaldi, put himself forward for the election as Grand Master of the entire Confederation, and his Grand Secr etary issued circulars requesting each Grand Master to vote for Br o ∴ Pessina. In spite of the objection of the made to this step, (for al though Pessina was a good individual member of the Confederation, y et he was considered a very unsuitable man for its head) by th e leading and legitimate powers of the Rite, Bro ∴ Pessina, with the consent of Canada, caused himself to be proclaimed Grand Hieroph ant of the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim. Upon this, the Grand Ma sters of Great Britain and Ireland, America and Egypt, whilst mainta ining the Treaty of Confederation, issued notices to the various power s of the Rite that they repudiated Bro ∴ Pessina as Grand Hierophant of the Confederation. In revenge Bro ∴ Pessina tried unsuccessfully to break up into three parts the Sov. Sanct. of Great Britain a nd Ireland, and is said with childish egotism to have expelled G.M. M ott from the Confederation, and received W.B. Lord. We can only sa y that Pessina never had any authority given him by any one either to ch arter new Sovereign Sanctuaries, break up old ones, or to expel a ny power"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 from the Confederation, and that if he has done any s uch foolish thing it proves that he is, both morally and masonic ally quite unfit for the post he has taken upon himself.

Union, Prosperity, Friendship, Fraternity The system of High Grade Masonry, from which our Anc ient and Primitive Rite derives its origin, had birth in this c ountry before the establishment of the Grand Lodges. In France it had dev eloped early last century, into several Rites which were distinguish ed as Primitive – notably the Rites of Primitives Philadelphes and Phil alethes, which were the offspring of those of Martinez Paschalis, and Marquis de St."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 Martin, and which, with others, worked side by side wit h the Rites of Perfection and knights of the Orient. The army of Bouna parte carried these High Grade Rites to Egypt in 1798, and a Grand L odge was then established at Cairo, when Buonaparteand Kleber rec eived investiture with a ring at the Great Pyramid of Cheops, at the hands of an Egyptian Sage, as a symbol of their union wit h the ancient occult Masonry of Egypt. Under this Grand Lodge of Ca iro Brother Samuel Honis was initiated, and afterwards removed to France. Mohemet Ali Pacha patronised Masonry in Egypt until hi s death, and the Rite maintained a correspondence with its confreres in Europe by means of our well-known secret ciphers. The Ancient and Primitive Rite of Masonry, Disciples of Memphis, was founded as a Grand Lodge at Montauban, France, in th e year 1814, by the Illustrious Brothers Gabriel Mathieu Marconis d e Negre; Samuel Honis of Cairo; Baron Dumas; Hypolite Labruni e; Marquis de Laroque; J. Pettitte, and others. The basis if this s ystem was the Primitive Rites, in which the degrees were not absolutely defined, as each principal grade had the power to confer others of li ke nature. The seven classes into which our Order is divided are sch ools for the study of Masonic knowledge, physics and philosophy; and embodies rituals, the production of more than a quarter of cen tury of assiduous labour and research, concerning all known Masonic Rit es. The Grand Lodge of Osiris, or Disciples of Memphis, a fter an interval of sleep, recommenced work at Brussels, in 1838, and at Paris in 1839, when it published its statutes; but, in 1841, the Grand Master Hierophant, the Illustrious and enlightened Brother J acques Ettiene Marconnis, 33. 97, son and Initiate of the first Gra nd Hierophant, was forced by civil politics to put all the Lodges in Fra nce asleep. In 1848 our Order revived its work at the Orient of Paris, an d continued to prosper; and in 1856 had established itself in Egypt, A merica, Roumania, and other countries. In 1862, the Illustrious Grand Hierophant united our Ancient and Primitive Rite with thee Grand Orient of France, and th e High Grades continued to be conferred by the recognised Grand Council of the Rites of the Grand Orient. A formal Concordat was promulgated by the said Gran d Orient, and the Ill ∴ Grand Hierophant, J. E. Marconis, 33-97, which arra nged the relative values of the 33 leading degrees of our Rite w ith those of the Ancient and Accepted, Mizraim, and other Rites recognised by the said Grand Council of Rites; also giving power to the 33 principal degrees to confer the minor ones. Upon this, in the year 1862, the Illustrious Grand Hi erophant J.E. Marconis, 33, 97, acting on concern with Marshal Ma gnan, 33, the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" 192 Grand Master of the Grand Orient, formally constituted the Sovereign Sanctuary of America, 33-95. Shortly after the degre es of the Rite were, nominally, and temporarily, reduced from 95 degree s to 33 ceremonies, by omitting the rest of those conferred only by name. The Grand Orient of France continued to exchange Represen tatives with the Sov. Sanct. of America, and list thereof wi ll be found in the French Official Calendar, until 1869, when in consequ ence of the invasion of American territory by the recognition of c ertain spurious Lodges of the Scottish Rite, the Americans withdrew f rom representation. France then abandoned the Rite, and the Ill ∴ Gd ∴ Hierophant, J.E. Marconis, 33,97 having died in 1868, Egypt took ful l possession. The Craft Gd ∴ Lodge, our Ancient and Primitive Rite, and the Ancient and Accepted Rite, executed a Tripartite Treaty to render mutua l aid, and restored the Sov. Gd. Mystic Temple- Imp. Council Gen. 96, presided over by a Gd. Hierophant, 97. In the year 1872 several Illustrious Brethren who had previously received the 33-95, obtained a Charter for the establis hment of a Sovereign Sanctuary in and for Great Britain and Irel and, with Ill ∴ Bro ∴ John Yarker as Grand Master General, 33-96, and in t he same year received many Brethren, members of the Royal Grand Co uncil of Ancient Rites, time immemorial, which was adopted the Rite of Perfection last century, and had met under H.R.H. the D uke of Sussex, Grand Master; and in 1874 the Jerusalem Chapt er of Antiquity, H.R.M.- K.D.S.H., formally amalgamated w ith the Palatine Chapter, No2, and Senate No2, of the Ancient and Prim itive Rite of Masonry thus giving the Rite the prestige of a time imm emorial association in the United Kingdom. One of the earliest resolutions passed by the new Sov. Sa nct. was for the establishment of an Order of Merit, of three classes , 1 st , for Saving Life; 2 nd , Literary Merit, 3 rd , General Merit. Besides this, the Rite possesses five Decorations; 1 st , the Grand Star of Sirius, or Wisdom; 2 nd , the Cross of Alidee, or Truth; 3 rd , the Alidee of the Third Series, or Justice; 4 th , the Lybic Chain, or Hope; 5 th , The Golden Branch of Eleusis, or Charity. These decorations are exclusively the reward of Merit, and are conferred in a Grand Chancery, one in consecutive order every year. A full history of the Rite, with the narrative of its early struggles, may be obtained from the Grand Secretary General, and as a contribution to Masonic history, is well worth perusal. Few, indeed, could rise from the study of its straightforward narrative of events, easily proved by the references given, without the conviction that our Rite had a legitimate Masonic standing, second to none in the wor ld, and also"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 the far higher claim to universal Masonic recognitio n, and the zealous support of the Craft. To strengthen its position and carry out its principl es - the toleration of all the Rites, the Sov.

The Grand Master General being a member of the 96 degree in Egypt, the system becomes assimilated t o the Memphis Rite in Egypt. The principles of the Ancient and Primitive Rite of Ma sonry we may summarize as follows: It is universal and open to every Master Mason who is i n good standing under some constitutional Grand Lodge; it teaches the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. The qualification of a neophyte is probity and honour, it esteems Masonic worth and learning above social and personal distinctions, seeking by means of its comprehensive ceremonials to exten d Masonic Knowledge, Morality and Justice, and enforce all those great principles which have distinguished true Masons in al l time. Its Rituals embrace all Masonry, and are based upon th ose of the Craft universal; they explain its symbols, develop it s mystic philosophy, exemplify its morality, examine its legend s, tracing them to their primitive source, and dealing fairly and tr uthfully with the historical features of symbolical Masonry. The government of the Rite is elective, and it extends th e hand of brotherhood to all legitimate Rites. It is in cordial union with a number of grand bodies of its own or similar Rites, w ith whom it has representatives established, and its influence is silently extending over the face whole globe. The Degrees of the Rite are divided into three Series, and t he Masters of each section receive the 31-91 and 32-93, and consti tute the Judicial Tribunal, 31-91, and the Mystic Temple, 32-93 , of which the President or Gd ∴ Master of Light, receives the 33-95, to represent his Province in the Sovereign Sanctuary, 33-95.

ESQUISSE D’ARCHITECTURE OU NOTION GENERALE SUR LE CARACTERE ET L’OBJET DU RIT PRIMITIF N.B. Quoique cet écrit soit destine uniquement aux FF:. I l faut penser que bien des circonstances peuvent en égarer quelque copie, et la faire tomber dans des mains profanes. Ainsi on a du s’attacher a ne compromettre aucun des secrets qui sont de l’essence de l’A.R:. C’est dans cette vue que les phrases le plus clai rement énoncées les plus scientifiques en apparence, ne veulent a peu- près rien dire, tandis que les FF:. Instruits retrouver ont peut-être les documents les plus curieux, toute la pensée du R. P. dans les expressions les plus simples, les plus insignifiantes, et jusque dans les locutions défectueuses. M. IV.16. L’association connue sous la dénomination de Franche ma çonnerie, a eu, comme beaucoup d’autres sociétés, ses temps rom anesques ou fabuleux, et ses époques historiques ; encore faut-i l distinguer dans ces dernières, ce qui appartient véritablement a l’ histoire, d’avec ce que l’enthousiasme, l’engouement, ou des moti fs quelconques, ont fait ajourer a la vérité des faits ; en un mot, d’avec tout ce que l’on pourrait nommer la broderie. Il faut convenir encore, que cette société a éprouve dans ses formes, ses dog mes et sa coordination, une infinité de schismes et d’hérésies, s’il est admissible d’appliquer ici ces expressions consacrées a d es objets plus relevés. Soit par l’impulsion de ce sentiment, que l’on nomme esprit de corps, soit par l’effet d’un zèle plus ardent que réfl échi, on a pris a tache de donner le change aux observateurs ; sur l’ori gine et le but primitif de cette association. C’est de la qu’est provenu e cette multitude innombrable de rites, de grades de titres de déc orations cette variété de couleurs et cette foule de soi disant Maît res, de Sages, de Philosophes d’Excellence de Sublimes de Précepteu rs de la sagesse, de Docteurs en toute science, de demi-Dieux de Thaumaturges en toute espèce de superlatifs qui (s’il p ourvoit être permis d’employer une pareille image dans ce discours), du haut de leurs traites eaux s’ecreint sur tous les tons, chacun de son cote :"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 208 Venez a moi; je suis le vrai Polichinelle; accourez tous m on baume est le meilleur. Impassibles au milieu de cette effervescence presque généra le et fixes dans leur croyance M:., les FF:. Anciens du R.P. ont toujours conserve, dans leur pureté originelle les notions traditio nnelles sur l’essence et les motifs de l’institut des Francs-maçons. Mais comme ils te noient a ces notions par conviction et non par entêtement, ni par prévention de secte; et que des trésors précieux sont quelquefois enfouis sous des tas de décombres, l es FF:. Anciens n’ont pas dédaigne de rechercher dans les divers systèmes M:. Ce qu’ils pouvaient renfermer de bon et d’analogue aux notions primitives. Lies l’un a l’autre par une confiance réc iproque et par un zelle a toute épreuve pour les progrès de l’A.R :. Ils ont saisi toutes les circonstances heureuses qui les ont mis en mesure d ’explorer les ateliers les plus illustres du monde connu. Les princ ipaux O :. De France, d’Angleterre, d’Allemagne, d’Espagne, d’Italie ; ceux de la cote de Syrie et des établissement européens dans les deu x Indes, ont été visites par quelques uns de ces FF :. On les adm is avec urbanité dans les ateliers peu connus qui existent en Chyp re, en Hollande, en Suède, dans la partie occidentale de l’Ec osse, et dans les Cercles mystérieux traces au pied des montagnes ble ues. A une grande distance des sources contestées du Nil, père des eaux, ils ont vu de très près le prétendu Grand Cophte, enseveli sou s son grand voile noir. Près des bords couronnes de lauriers, ils ont pénètre dans la Crypte auguste ou P.. RR. Présente aux regards et a la réflexion des mortels étonnes, les trois clefs, en f aisceau, qui lui ont ete confinées. Enfin, non loin des rives fortunées du fleuve des délices, existe a jamais pour eux l’O :. De tous les O :. De la terre, berceau originel de l’institut fondamental et primitif d e toute Franche- maçonnerie. De sorte qu’il ne peut guères y avoir de parties des conn aissances dites M:. Qui aient échappe aux études et aux observat ions des FF:. Anciens. Il a résulte de leurs notices et découvertes r eprochées et comparées, une immense nomenclature de dénominations et d e prétendus grades, mais aussi les documents de quelques véri tés utiles. Cependant ces FF:. Sont très éloignes de regarder comme rigoureusement apocryphes les Rites ou Régimes M:. Dont l es instructions et cahiers se distinguent par la beauté des emblèmes, l’ordonnance des cérémonies, la régularité de la contextur e, l’excellence de la morale qu’ils referment. Etrangers a t out esprit de prosélytisme exclusif et inconsidéré, ils se sont félic ites au contraire de ce qu’il existait d’autres voies ouvertes a l’inst ruction et a l’amélioration des hommes. Ils sont bien plus éloignes encore de confondre dans la foule des productions M :. Abstruses, les documents d’un Ordre mystérieux et"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 209 sublime, peu nombreux par une suite de son essence, et q ui sous certains aspects, présente aux yeux de ses Disciples, qu elques unes des formes des M:. Sa doctrine et la pratique de ses travaux, appuyés sur des principes vrais, essentiels, inaltéra bles, universels, permanents, toujours semblables a eux mêmes et jamais équivoques, ne sont point susceptibles d’être changes, tr onques ou dénatures par le caprice des hommes, par l’audace et l’i mpéritie des novateurs. Les lumières et les actes de cet ordre étant fo ndes sur une base vraie entant qu’immuable, il ne résulterait d e toute altération en ce genre, qu’erreur, mensonge et néant. C ’est vraiment ici que tout charlatanisme est en défaut ; ici se fait l’application juste de la sentence sans appel: a fruct ibus eorum cognoscetis eos ; puisque ce n’est point par un vain étal age de phrases et de titres, mais par des faits, qu’il faut p rouver et sa mission et sa puissance. Les FF:. Anciens ont également pris en considération, m ais sous un aspect moins favorable, ces Régimes exclusifs qui refusent de reconnaître dans leurs rivaux, leurs émules, tout ce qu’ eux-mêmes s’arrogent, sans être toutefois mieux fondes dans leurs prétentions; ces Rites qui critiquent avec amertume, la coordination, l’enseignement, le plan fiscal des autres, et qui ne se don nent pas le soin de voir que ces reproches seraient mieux places v is –a vis d’eaux; eux encore qui feignent de rejeter, de proscrire certains prétendus grades, et qui néanmoins, sous les auspices de quelque variante, en font le but principal de leur culte, et le bu t définitif de leurs travaux. Enfin, ils ont apprécie ce que valent les Régimes qui , profondément plonges dans leurs formes, leur hiérarchie, leurs cost umes, confessant implicitement, et sur tout sans même s’en ap ercevoir, que leurs M:. ne sont guères puissants, ni en paroles, ni en œuvres. Quoi qu’il en soit, il est certain que les FF:. Anciens du R.P.n’ont rien néglige pour pénétrer dans le dédale des connaissances dites M:. Mais quelque succès qu’ils aient eu dans leurs rech erches, ils auraient savoure avec peu de douceur les fruits qu’ils e n ont recueillis, si, pour prix de leurs soins, de leurs tra vaux, de leurs sacrifices, il n’avaient pas acquis le droit, ou plut ôt, contracte le devoir de sauver leurs fils, leurs neveux leurs parents, leurs amis, du danger ou ils étaient exposés de parcourir la même route d’une manière tout aussi pémble, tout aussi dispendieuse, et peut être sans parvenir jamais au mêmes résultats. C’est pourquo i les FF :. Anciens n’on pas du hésiter a professer d’un franc co urage, que l’ordre ou société des Francs-maçons du Rit primitif , avoue et reconnaît pour première base de sa réunion et de sa pr opagation, l’esprit de sociabilité, exprime par l’adage connu; ho mo sum; nihil humanai a me alienum puto; qui tend a faire de tous le s hommes"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 210 un peuple de frères; et pour seconde base, l’esprit d’hum anité et de secours mutuel, qui découle du même principe, et revendiq ue le même adage pour son expression. D’ou il suit que le véhi cule du rapprochement des hommes sous les formes M:., a été, généralement parlant, le désir de goûter ensemble le plaisir qui résulte de leur réunion, lorsqu’ils y portent libéralem ent et mutuellement, l’aménité l’urbanité, les grâces, les man ières qui caractérisent des personnes bien nées. La conséquence de ce rapprochement est, en outre des plaisir de société propr ement dits, les plus pur de tous sans doute, celui d’exercer d’une , manière plus active, plus fréquente, plus efficace, des actes de bienfa isance envers tous les hommes malheureux, sans distinction ; et plus spécialement encore, envers les FF:. atteints par l’infor tune. Cette notion vraie de l’essence de la M:., transmise pa r les FF:. Anciens, des uns aux autres, est susceptible de la démons tration la plus rigoureuse; mais, dans cette esquisse, il suffira d’exposer deux passages extraits d’un ouvrage : (The constitutions of etc. 1767), que les M:. Doivent considérer comme classique, et qui est a sa quatrième édition. P. 194. « Mean while ingenious men of all faculties ans stations, being convinced that the cement of the L. was love and f riendship, earnestly request to be made Masons, affecting this a miable fraternity more than other societies, then disturbd wi th warm disputes. Alors, des gens d’esprit de toute sorte d’état et condition, convaincus qu’une familiarité décente et amicale et oit l e ciment des LL., demanderont avec empressement d’être fais maçons ; préférant cette confraternité douce et paisible a toutes ces association qui étaient en ce temps la fréquemment le t héâtre de disputes scandaleuses. Le second passage, encore plus développe, s’exprime ains i, p. 195 : Now Masonry. Flourished in harmony, reputation and nu mber; many noblemen and gentlemen of the first rank, desired t o be admited into the frtaernity; besides other learned men, merchants, clergyman and trdesmen, who found the Lodge to be a sa fe and pleasant relaxation from intense study, of the hurry o f business, without politiks or party. La M:. Fleurit en ce momen t, et s’accrut en nombre, harmonie et réputation. Bien des personnes de qual ité et des gentils hommes du premier rang voulurent être admis au nombre des frères ; de même que beaucoup de gens de lettres, de négocians, d’ecclésiastiques et d’artistes distingues , qui trouvoient tous que dans la L :. Ils se délassoient avec sécuri té et agréablement, de leurs études profondes, et du tracas d e leurs diverses occupations, sans aucun mélange de discussions politiques ou d’esprit de faction. "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" 211 Il doit donc rester pour constant, qu’a cette époque f ameuse, ou les cotteries les plus bizarres et les plus bruyantes s’étoi ent donne une vogue qui avoit fixe l’attention et mérite les sarcasmes d u célèbre Addision et des ses imitateurs; les personnes de goût, en cèdent a la nécessite de payer leur tribut a la mode des cotter ies, donnèrent cependant la préférence a celle ou elles étoient assurées d e rencontrer des mœurs douces et un délassement et agréabl e ; et réciproquement, le choix de cette composition a du déter miner l’affluence des prosélytes, et faire survivre enfin cette c otterie a toutes les autres. On doit tenir également pour constant et avéré, que cette simplicité primitive de but et formes ne se maintint pas longtemps. La seconde base fut bientôt accueillie généralement, et devoi t l’être : Mais on alla plus loin. Aiguillonés par divers motifs , des M:. Se sont plus à propager, sous le manteau de la F:. M:., àpeu-prè s toutes les doctrines possibles. Si dans le nombre on en trouve qui méritent peu de considération, il faut con venir aussi qu’il y en a des très- intéressantes, auxquelles bien des FF:. n’auroient peut -être fait aucune attention, si elles n’eussent pas été comme encadr ées dans les formes M:. ; ce qui a aussi contribue à l’invasio n de ces nuées de grades, de dignités, de régimes, sous l’encombrement d esquels les deux bases fondamentales de l’institut sont bien so uvent méconnaissables. Les FF:. Qui malgré l’entraînement presqu’irresistible d e l’exemple, auront la constante fermeté de s’en tenir aux deux ba ses m:., donneront en cela une preuve d’un jugement bien sain et d’ un goût dedicat. Ils n’auront à cueillir dans les jardins de l a fraternité, que des roses depourvnes d’épines. Ceci toutefois ne doit répandre aucune défaveur sur les FF:. a qui l’exercice habituel de l’étude, le désir de connaître tout, d’approfondir tout, et même , disons le, une curiosit é inquiète fera souhaiter de voir par eux-mêmes tout ce que a f:.m:. r ecèle dans son sein.

Enfin, il ne faut pas se dissimuler que les sages profes seurs de certaines connaissances singulièrement intéressantes, on t juge a propos de considérer les LL:. M:. Comme des espèces de conservatoires et de séminaires, ou la diversité de form es et d’objets déployé a leurs yeux exerces, l’aptitude d’espir it et le fonds du caractère des FF :. Qu’ils destinent à devenir leurs disciples. Les"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 FF :. Anciens ont trouve bon, juste et prudent, de pour voir a l’utilité, a l’avancement et a l’agrément des FF :. Pour accomplir l’ensemble de leurs vues, tout en ménagea nt la pureté des deux bases primitives, ils ont dans ces temps modernes, adopte l’organisation de quatre sections d’associatio n, et de deux échelles d’instruction, avec leurs subdivisions respecti ves. La première section, qui forme plus spécialement ce que l’o n nomme la L :. Est composée de FF:. Dont les manières po lies et l’éducation libérale, les rendent propres a goûter et pra tiquer les principes de la première base m:. Et dont la fortune leu r permet de concourir aux actes de bienfaisance qui constituent l a seconde base. La seconde section, occupée par la L:. dite d’adoption, est composée des FF:. Membres de la L:., et des épouses, mères , filles, sœurs, nièces ou cousines de ces FF:. De cette intéress ante réunion, résulte le complément de la première base, et pe ut être aussi une activité plus énergique pour l’accomplissemen t de la seconde base. La délicatesse qu’exige tout ce qui touche cette section invite a répéter ici ce qui est très expressément p orte aux règlement généraux, chap.I. tit. 3. 4.-2., que les M : . Isoles ne sauroient être membres d’une L:. D’adoption, et que les Da mes et Demoiselles qui n’ont pas parent proche, du moins au tr oisième degré, au nombre des membres de la L:., ne doivent poi nt y être admises. La troisième section, sous la dénomination de philanthr opique, composée de FF :. et SS :., s’occupe essentiellement de to ut ce qui tend a rendre moins pénible la situation des infortune s, et même plus commode et plus agréable celle de tous les hommes. Qu oiqu’il ne soit pas interdit aux autres sections d’exercer des a ctes de bienfaisance, la troisième est, a proprement parler, le comite bienfaisant de l’ensemble ; et, dans ce sens, il est spéc ialement consacre au culte de la première base m :. La quatrième section, dite de l’harmonie, uniquement dest inée aux jouissances constitutives de la première base, a pour ob jet la musique, la poésie, les autres parties des beaux arts, et les fêtes que leur réunion embellit et rend plus complètes. L’économie de l’instruction et des dépenses des quatre sec tions est nécessairement confiée à des FF:. Qui, ayant la connais sance et l’habitude de l’ensemble et du rapport réciproque de ces d eux objets, sont plus en mesure de diriger le cours et la dist ribution de l’un et de l’autre. Chaque section a donc un conseil d ’économie qui administre spécialement tout ce qui concerne l’enseigne ment et les frais particuliers de chacune d’elles ; et les quatre con seils se"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 réunissent en conseil général, pour les affaires ou ob jets quelconques, communs a la totalité de l’établissement. Il est sans doute a propos d’exposer avec quelque détail le développement du mode d’enseignement M :. Qu’il a fallu adapter au R. P., pour que ses FF :. Fussent en mesure de visiter les ateliers des autres Régimes, lorsqu’on leur fera la faveur de l es y admettre. Ce qui sera dir. pour la L :. Des FF :. Est également applicable a la L :. d’adoption, sauf les différences que l’éducation, les moyens physiques et la destination dans la vie civile et profa ne, doivent mettre dans les grades propres aux FF:. Seuls, ou aux F F:. et SS:. Réunis. On n’a point perdu de vue que bien des FF:. Auront le tact assez pour s’en tenir aux deux bases fondamentales. Pour ceux -ci, le système d’enseignement est renferme dans une échelle a trois divisions simples, nommées classes. La première comprend les FF:. Qui apprennent les manières et les formes M:. ; la second e est composée de ceux qui font usage de ce qu’ils ont appris ; et la troisième, de ceux qui, s’étant affermis dans la théorie par la pratique du travail, doivent être en état d’instruire l es FF:. de la première classe, et de diriger ceux de la seconde.

J. XIII, 34   - Appendices XI  The Philalethes By Karl R. H. Frick As a continuation of the Elus Coëns, but also as far as th e doctrine is concerned of the Illuminés of Avignon, the Philalethes are part of the mystical Freemasonry in France. The Philalethes or Searchers of T hruth was the name of the masonic-hermetic system founded in Paris in 1773. This we will investigate now. On April 23 1771 a new lodge was constituted with the name ‘Des Amis Réunis’ (of the United Friends). In 1774 it had 57 me mbers, mainly officers of noble descent and rich citizens, among whom were two Elu s Coëns. They were the Viscount de Saulx de Tavannes, Major of the roy al infantryregiment, and the Abbé Joseph Baptiste François Rozier (1734-1739? ), Honarary Knight of the Church at Lyon, known among his contempor aries as a naturalist. As a doctor of theology he directed from 17 65 -1769 the vetenary school at Lyon, and was Master of a lodge. With Pascually he had a personal contact, and was a dedicated supporter of his doctrine. He later studied at Paris botanics and agronomy. He published quite a number of books, among them textbooks on agriculture, physics and veterinary medicin, an d published with Pierre-Jaques Willermoz an Agronomic Dictionary. As a Ma son he also was one of the founders of the Grand Orient in 1773. During the sessio n of July 12 1773, when he was the president of the Chamber of the Provin ces, he proposed the foundation of Provincial Lodges. After some explanations with Lalande, which are here of no interest, he, Lalande and Joseph Ignace Guillotin (1738-1814), the inventor of the guillotine, proposed a regulation for the French Lodges, which was proposed on October 22 and accepted lateron. In 1775 he organised as an enthousiastic Elu Coën , together with Saint-Martin a magical session, according to the ritual of the Elus Coëns, in the Palai s de Luxembourg, the Duchess of Bourbon being present. Rozier started together with t he Master of the Lodge Des Amis Réunis, Savalette de Langes (1725-?), the royal treasurer at Paris and since 1773 Director of Ceremonies of the Chamber of Administration of"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 219 the Grand Orient (later its secretary, Orator and Junio r Warden, since 1777 finally Grand Secretary of the Grand Orient), a numb er of changes in the lodge. They wished as Searcher of Truth to investigate t he expected secret Doctrine of Freemasonry, and to this end they started a n academy for the Research of the Occult (Académie occultiste). So, in 1775 a Commission of degrees and archives was constituted , with the task to refo rm the system and to install for the research a library and archive, using the existing material. A plan for the ‘Increase of the Knowledge of the absolut e Truth’ was elaborated and within five years realised in the system of the Phil alethes. The Philalethes reorganised the existing system of high d egrees, returning to the original symbolic degrees of Freemasonry: The Colle ge of Symbolic Freemasonry consisted of five classes, as a substitute for the degrees. The first class consisted of Apprentices, the second of Fellowcraft s, the third of Masters, the fourth of the Elect, and the fifth of the Ecossais. The first three classe were in conformance with the classical degrees of the Symb olic Freemasonry, whereas the two others were taken from the historical de grees of Scottish Freemasonry, having a close relation with the Hiram leg ends cherished there. The Chapter of the Knights of the Amis Réunis consisted o f the sixth class: Knight of the Orient, the seventh of the Knights Rose C roix, and the eighth of the Knights Templar. The chapter corresponded with the usual degrees of knight s. In the Counsel of the Amis Réunis there was a ninth class of the Unknown Philosophers, the tenth of the Worshipful Philosophers, the elenventh of the Initiated, and the twelfth class of the Philalethes, Master of all Degrees. In this Council of Amis Réunis were the degrees with alchemist, theosophical-panso phical, theurgical and magical Secret Doctrines, which we trace everywhere in the systems we investigated. As a difference with the masonic lodges of cl assic caracter, there were no lectures, no ceremonials nor rituals, no S igns nor Passwords. The doctrinal edifice of the system had to transfer as a secret knowledge its teaching to the Amis Réunis in special study circles. This lodge was transferred into a Masonic research institut e, and wanted to investigate the true origin of Freemasonry according to scientific points of view. It is evident that the members would occupy themselve s intensively with the already discussed secret doctrines and the doctrine of t he Gnostic school, which gained more influence within the mystical Freemas onry at the end of the 18 century, but even more on the 19 century. In a report of the Research Committee of March 1780, w e read, according to Kloss, History of Freemasonry in France, Vol. I: This address may be ended by the presentation of the id ea, which should be made by all united friends and even all Freemasons, of the system of 12 classes. This is not a reformation, neither old nor new, being accepted by all masters of all degrees (of the highest class of the system). They want neither criticise nor accept the establishments, which similar to the united friends, mainly since six years invested with much pomp, and announci ng their"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" 220 affiliation, aggregation, rectification, or reformati on as presented by the Scots of Heredom, of Avignon, of Marseille; once by the Stri ct Observance in France of the Germans, imported by the Brother Baron von Wei ler by the name of Scottish Directories; the other time by the Souverain Co uncil of the Emperors of the Orient, which originated by the new and equal ly bizarre name of Grand Globe of France, which the Grand Orient believed for l ong to be extinguished or blown away; then again by peculiar sects, originated in the lap of the Strict Observance, to which Brother von Zinnendorf, as its founde r gave it its name; again by those Zinnendorfern differing much from Zinn endorf far older and less known in France, of which the patriarch was the Worshi pful Count of Zinnendorf. There are other masonic societies, in France as well in other countries, showing at least the same external marks of Free masonry, known by a small number of the Amis Réunis, following their secrets, however, in deepest secrecy consisting only of a small number of member s, who do not make their names known. The masters of all degrees are to estimate them highly as a relation, and pray that those, who by int ermediary or by another more direct path have knowledge of it, are to be assured well, that they are far away from mixing up with Freemasonry, anything relate d to them, even in the archives of the 12 class. (The Masters of all degrees) cannot sufficiently repeat, that their classes are no degrees, and besides they can truly assure that of all the archives contain has nothing to do with them, except the special reception forms in the different classses, as well as their consideration on the contents. The system of twelve classes of the Amis Réunis is definitely nothing else, than what its name indicates. It is a proceeding classification in twelve chapte rs, formed by the masters of all degrees, of all they could collect and stil l are collecting, ordering according to a small number of principles, belonging to a system, deploying gradually, of which the totality and development is ba sed on more than probable basics, and offering interesting compositions, pr oved by the composed objects, and their inner connection, proceeding cl ass by class, and unveiled finally in the last one. Therefore we deny a ny claim for a very old age. Our calculation of time starts with the acceptance of the denomination of commissaries for the degrees and the archives in 1775. Apart from the terrible translation of this declaratio n, the embarrasment of the Amis Réunis can be stated easily. Their investigations did not go to the ‘true’ secret searched for by all. Apparently they did occupy th emselves intensely with the contemporary doctrines, within and beyond Fre emasonry, as with the Brethren from Böhmen in the 15 century, of a sect strivi ng for the ancient Christianity, which under the the last bishop Johann Amo s Comenius (1592- 1670) was expelled from Böhmen and Mähren after the b attle of the White Mountains (1620). Its remainder created a ‘Unity of Br ethren’ under Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinnendorf (1700-1760), well known as the Herrenhüter Brüdergemeinde. At its seat at Berthelsdorf a new cente r with a special kind of christian Pietism of the 18 century was based. They ha ve surely nothig to do with Freemasonry in a direct line, but may have inf luenced it, as did the French Pietism and the theosophy of Böhme certain mystica lly oriented groups within Freemasonry. (Here too a special investigat ion should allow for new knowledge, as the person of Comenius was connected by several"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" 221 historians with Rosecrucianism and early types of english Freemasonry.) Especially investigations by the Philalethes were directed to the secret apocryphic societies, which the previously mentioned Irish d eist John Toland with his ‘Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalita tis Socratricae’ wanted to create. Practically the Philalethes had connections with nearly a ll contemporary secret or open representatives of the societies and groups, occupying themselves with classic doctrines or gnostic-theosophical or pan sophical religious doctrines. Their library and archive, institute d since 1775 until 1780 contained precious volumes and manuscripts from all areas of masonic, alchemistic-rosecrucian and mystic-occult richness of thought. A t a very early stage there was a cordial harmony between the Amis Réun is and the Masons at Lyon. Savalette had a very good personal relation w ith Willermoz and Saint-Martin. Since 1775, the moment the 12th class of Master of all Degrees existed, the contacts with the ‘Inner Order’ of the Chevaliers Bienfaisants were so good, that temporari ly in January 1781 a ‘f ree relation’ of both secret societies was under discussio n. But the denying attitude of the Philalethes to the Scottish Directories and their supposed past of Knigts Templar made this plan finally fail. The Philalethes regarded themselves as the direct successors of the ‘Elect orthodox Coëns’ who lately worked in San Domingo, and proposed their last Commander Sebastian de las Casas to the supporters of Pasq ually in November 1780 to join the Philalethes. The Parisian Lodge of the Amis Réunis comprized in Janua ry 1781 91 active members. They were divided over the twelve classes. So the 11th class counted three, the 12th 20 members, among them, next t o the leader Savalette, Rozier, J.B.Willermoz, Antoine Court de Ge belin (1725-1784), Salzmann, Dutrousset-d’Héricourt, Baron von Gleichen, Gr af Stroganoff, and Tassin l‘Etang, apparently also a Landgraf de Hessen-Dar mstadt. He is mentioned in the sources as Friedrich Ludwig, but it pro bably should be Ludwig Karl von Hessen-Darmstadt (1749-1823), who playe d in the mystical Freemasonry a manifold function. The system of ‘The Divine Order of the Philalethes or A mis Réunis of Truth’, as the group was also called, took up contact early 80's wi th the Marquis de Chefdebien de Saint-Amand, well-known in the mystical Freemasonry. This Major of the Chasseurs [a special type regiment], origin ated from a Breton noble family; he was a Malthese Knight and honorary C ounselor of the Scottish Directory of the Province Septimanie of the Str ict Observance, having the name in the order of Eques a Capite Galeato. Thi s name referred to his family name, being in Breton language Penmadou, whi ch can be read as head with a helmet. When the family moved to the old city of Narbonne in Southern France in the 18 century, the name was frenchized into Chefdebien. D uring the Convent of the Gaules he represented the chapter of the Knights Te mplar of Montpellier. With his father, the Viscount de Chefdebien d’Aigrefeu ille, he constituted in"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 222 1780 a new rite. After having written in 1779 a histo ry of Freemasonry, and having contacts with the masonic rosecrucian centers at Strasbo urg, Leipzig and Frankfurt, he also became a member of the Philalet hes in that year. As a member of the 12 class and of the ‘committee of the Five Brethren’, who the occupied themselves with the system of the lodges connected w ith the Philalethes, he felt obliged to create himself a system of high degrees also. He called it the ‘Free and Accepted Masons of the Origin al Rite of France. The history of Freemasonry calls this ‘very reverend Lodge of Saint John’ at Narbonne the ‘Lodge of the Philadelphes of Narbonne’ . It was constituted on December 27 1779, and April 19 1780 the new rite was introduced. This rite had great similarity with that of the Philalethes. It consisted of 12 classes, in which more or less the same thoughts were expressed, the wo rk being alchemistical. Next to the usual three symbolic Degrees App rentice, Fellowcraft and Master, combined in class 1, the second class showed the degrees of the Perfect Master, also called Elect or Archit ect, Worshipful Ecossais, Knight of the Sword, Knight of the East, and P rince of Jerusalem. In the 3 class there finally were three chapters of Rose Cro ix, and the last chapter of Rose Croix of the Grand Rose Garden. This last name directs to the “great rosarium of the philosophers” (Magnum Rosari um Philosophorum). This publication, so important to the Alchemists, was attrributed to Arnaldus de Villan ova. It was first printed in the 16 century. In the last degree the deepest secret s of life and nature were investigated, in which as a matter of fact the secret knowledge of the origin described, was investigated especially. The instructi ons for the separate degrees were signed by an imaginary Knight Pen (Chefdebien), who claimed to be one of the ‘unknown seniors’, and a knight of the Golden La nce. He declared that the knowledge of the old Brethren of the original Ri te be of oriental origin, and brought to Europe via Syria and both India’s. It was h ere save guarded by secret societies in Cyprus, Holland and Sweden, and enclose d by mysterious circles at the base of the ‘Blue Mountains’, being transf erred secretly. The doctrine itself showed strong parallels to the Re-integr ation of Pasqually, and was a mixture of the doctrine of the discussed systems. Already in 1781the contact between Chefdebien and Sava lette, which never ceased, was even intensified. During the Convent of the S trict Observance at Wilhelmsbad in 1782, which Chefdebien attended as depu tee of the Grand Priory Septimanie (Montpellier) of the III. Province, he was charged with the representation of the interests of the Philalethes, because they did not appartain to the Strict Observance, so having no observer d uring the convent. During the following period Savalette and Chefdebien occupied themselves intensely to collect all documents about old and new secre t societies and their doctrines. Numerous documents have been saved. It show ed that there were relations with the Baron von Steuben, called Eque s a Fortuna Resurgente (who most problably is not the Freemason and future general inspector of the American troups, Friedrich Wilhelm von S teuben 1730-1794, who went to the States already in 1778), with Lavater and the Prince von Nassau-Saarbrücken-Usingen, called Eques a Pomo Imperiali, having a castle at Bibrich in the neighbourhood of Strasbourg. W e know that both"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 223 princes Ludwig Georg Karl and Friedrich Georg August von Hessen- Darmstadt were members of the Philalethes of the 12 class. Both Brethren made a discovery tour thro ugh France and Italy, in order to investigate the the secret societies an d the origin of Freemasonry and Rosecrucianism and their doctrines. They se arched in vain, but found the two adventurers Peter Christian Tayssen an d the already mentioned Freiherr Gottlieb von Gugomos. Already in 1776, before the appearance of Gugomos at the convent of Wiesbaden (15.8-4.9.1776) both were already members of the system. Tayssen claimed to be a true adept. At the court of the prince Ludwig von Heilbronn, to which he belonged since 1776 as ‘econom ic adviser’, he told, that he had worked in Norway during seven years o n alchemy, which cost him 3000 Taler. He had been at Venice for eight m onths, where he searched for the secrets of the Opus Magnum, seeing very mu ch. The greatest secret he experienced at Dresden. The Rosicruci an Secret Counselor von Gemmingen and the stable master von Bischoff swerder were his friends and zealous pupils. Apparently Tayssen possessed 20 Arcana, made according to alchemical precepts. So he offered an a rcanum to the Berlin Rosicrucian and Agronom Wöllner, which should imp rove all kinds of corn, resulting in a twelvefold or even greater harvest. He should instruct the prince in the Opus Magnum, so performing alchemical exper iments. The prince occupied himself as well with the establishment of an academy of (secret) sciences at Heilbronn, which due to lack of money i n an excessive household never was realised. Prince Ludwig belonged also to other secret societies, f.e. the Asiates. Savalette and Chefdebien tried to make contact with all contemporary occultists, founders of Masonic systems, among them charlatans. Chefdebien informed continuously about Schrepfer, Gugomos, von Rosskam pf, Waldenfels, Gassner, Falcke, Zinnendorf, Beyerle, Loewen stierna, Livy, Weiler, Wächter and Tiemann. Their activities within Freemasonry was observed and all documents on the essence of contemporary secret societies assemb led in the archive at Paris. Also the Elus Coëns, as the Chevaliers Bei nfaisants, their chief Willermoz, and even members of te Philalethes wer e observed and information collected. After believing they possessed information about all syste ms of mystical Freemasonry, the Philalethes came to the foreground, a fter having worked introvertly in their lodge until now. An announcement of August 24 1784, being sent on September 14 to persons of the most diffe rent masonic systems, was succeeded by another one of Novembber 13. The contents of the note was a summon to all Masons of all countries and systems, to give their view and knowlkedge of Freemasonry on the base of ten questions. The note was sent to 128 well-known Masons, among them 2 8 Philalethes. The answer to these ten questions should serve as a foundat ion for a convent to be held on Feruary 15 1785 at Paris.

So there were 20 Germans: Duke Ferdinand von Braunschweig, the princes Ludwig and Christian von Hesse n-Darmstadt, the Count Brühl from Dresden, von Ditfurth from Wetzl ar, Dr.Förster from Halle, von Dalberg from Mannheim, von Rosskampf from Hei lbronn, Theden from Berlin, as well as Wöllner, von Wächter from Frankf urt, Starck from Darmstadt, Baron Gleichen from Regensburg, as well as Bo de and von Haugwitz; there were 5 Austrians: Prince Dietrichstein, Count Esterhazy and the Rosecrucian Matolay; four Italians: Count Albarey, Dr.Giraud and Diego Naselli, ,members of the Chevaliers Bienfaisants; the Swi ss Dr.Lavater; the Polish occultistThouz de Salverte from Warsaw; the Major of the Russian service Tiemann from Petersburg, and the Englishman Bousi e, and two Swedes: Count de Toll from Stockholm. The following Chevaliers Bieenfaisants were invited: J.B. Willermoz, Bernard and Jean de Turkheim, Millanois, Grainville, Virieu, Jose ph de Maistre. The following Elus Coëns orthodox, the so-called schismatics: Abb é Rozier, the brethren Mallet and Moet from Versailles, Saint-Marti n, de Pointcarré, 1. President of the parliament at Rouen, de Frémicourt, de Champollon and the Viscount de Tavannes. The Illuminates of Avignon were rep resented by Count Grabianka, Dr.Chastanier, Count de Corberon and Marqu is de Thomé. It goes without saying that the following were also present: C agliostro, Saint- Germain, Mesmer, Chevalier de Barberin, the occultist To uzay-Duchanteau, ‘professor of theosophy’ ‘professor of algebra’ and ‘goo d magic’ Eteila (anagram of Alliette, a former whigmaker). The following questions were sent to each attendant: 1 Which is the essential base of the Masonic science and its d iscerning character? 2 Which period and which origin can intelligently be a scribed to it? 3 Which societies or corporations or individuals may have po ssessed it in the past, or through which corporations did it pass, in order to proceed through al l times? 4. Of which societies, corporations or individuals can be sup posed, that they are really in their possession? 5. Is the tradition, it possessed, in writing or by word ? 6. Does Freemasonry have a relation with secret or well- known sciences, covered by their names? 7. With which of these sciences is it connected most, and whi ch are those connections? "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 225 8. Which kind of advantages can be expected from Masonic Art ? 9. Which of the contemporary types of doctrines is most ad visable, not to be regarded as the general standard, but in order to have zealous and industrious young people make quick and useful progress in the real Freemasonry? 10. Why do Freemasons give unanimously the name Lodge t o their meetings, to the places, where they are held? Which is the origin and the true definition of the word lodge; the word Temple, by which also is i ndicated the place of meeting; of the expression: to open or to close the work; of the word Scottish for the high degrees; the name of Worshipful and Maste r of the lodge, by which the French, respectively the Germans call the master? In their invitation the Philalethes pretend to possess th e most important Masonic, hermetic and theosophic documents. The invited have to agree in principle, that there is but one God, that they belie ve in the immortality of the soul, as well as the punishment or recompense after death ; finally that there is a primeval science or knowledge, which in its tradition is promoted by separate individuals through the whole history of Man. The Mother Lodge of the Rite philosophique, which is t o some extent a direct competitor of the Philalethes, forbid on Janary 25 178 5 its members, the Marquis de la Rochfoucauld-Bayer, Grand Master of the M other Lodge of the Scottish-philosophic Rite, and Doctor Lafisse to participat e in the convent, pretending that ‘it does not allow some Brethren to i nform about their doctrines, and that such information can only be procured by the head office of the system, if it shows to be proper to give such inside information’. A further three invited persons denied in writing their participation. They were the Duke Ferdinand of Braunschweig, Saint-Martin, who averted in the meantime practically from Freemasonry, devoting himself completely to theosophy and his own circl e, the Martinists, and the famous magnetizer Mesmer, who by his doctrine o f animal magnetism and his large support was fully occupied. The convent was opened on February 15 1785 by Savalette . It lastet until May 26. In 30 sessions discussions were held among participants fr om France, Germany, Switzerland and some other countries about th e presented questions about the origin and essence of Freemasonry. Th e also invited Cagliostro had his participation depend on his conditions being accep ted. So he wished f.e. that the archive of the Philalethes had to be bur ned. In turn he promised the audience to have, with the aid of his secret knowledg e, the essence of true Freemasonry presented by his spirits. These spirits we re according to his claim, using the magical tradition of evocational magic o f the Middle Ages, the intermediaries between Man and his Creator, and could be made useful to mankind. However, all experiments failed, and it also fa iled to make an arrangement with Cagliostro, who just reached the summi t of his fame. Besides, they could only agree in general terms, that t here be a Masonic"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 science. The majority of the attendants was of the opini on, that the hermetic sciences and at this time also the Christian theosophy were the primeval source of the search. Magic should also be regarded as part of the hermetic sciences, as do all other classic secret sciences. An interim committee maintained the contacts by correspon dence with the foreign participants. As a third note they received info rmation about the intentions of the convent. A printed resume of the minu tes of the first convent and an index to some copied addresses were added. Finally it was decided to have a second convent. Tassin d’Estang went in charge of the Paris Philalethes to Lausanne, in order to have the directing committee summon for the convent, which was rejected on July 16 1786. Only after so me problems it became possible to have a second convent in the next year, a t a far smaller rate. It was held from March 8 until May 26 1787. The ultimate proof should now be given that theosophy, alchemy, kabbala and magic have to be regarded as serious sciences. The symbols and ritual acts of Freemasonry a re to be regarded as means, in order to disclose ‘to the youth th e most hidden Knowledge of the last things of the true Royal Art’. With the invitation to this convent, which for economy reasons was held in the private rooms of Savalette, 13 new proposals were sent as themes, which shou ld produce the proof of the above assumptions. This convent too could not bring the elucidation nor the consentment. The Freemason and enemy of the Jesuites Johann Christoph Bode (1730- 1793) wanted to participate. He believed that the myst ical high degrees of Freemasonry were influenced by the Jesuites, and had alr eady tried to prove this in a publication ‘Essay on the origin of Freemasonr y’. He entered the convent too late, and could no more influence it. The L andgraf Christian von Hessen-Darmstadt (1763- 1830) sent a plan to reform Fre emasonry, which had no response. England, was reconsidered. It was suggeste d to investigate in the archives there to find the origin of Freemasonry , and inquire about the truth of the book with questions of Henry VI. But also the tendency to occult doctrines was still strong among the members of the convent , so that maintaining a continuous committee was decided to. It asse mbled on June 8, but ended then its activity. The French Revolution caused a violent end. The archive an d library, manuscripts and correspondence, as well as parts of the alche mical laboratory were dispersed to all sides. Part of them cou ld be recovered after the Revolution and became the property of the Mother Lodge of the Rite Philosophique, which as will be described still existed in the 19 century. There is no special literature about the Philalethes. There a re information’s in various German and French Masonic encyclopaedia, periodical s and magazines. "}]
