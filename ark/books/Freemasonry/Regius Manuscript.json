Here begin the constitutions of the art of Geometry according to Euclid. Whoever will both well read and look He may find written in old book Of great lords and also ladies, That had many children together, certainly; And had no income to keep them with, Neither in town nor field nor enclosed wood; A council together they could them take, To ordain for these children's sake, How they might best lead their life Without great disease, care and strife; And most for the multitude that was coming Of their children after great clerks, To teach them then good works; And pray we them, for our Lord's sake. To our children some work to make, That they might get their living thereby,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Both well and honestly full securely. In that time, through good geometry, This honest craft of good masonry Was ordained and made in this manner, Counterfeited of these clerks together; At these lord's prayers they counter- feited geometry, And gave it the name of masonry, For the most honest craft of all. These lords' children thereto did fall, To learn of him the craft of geometry, The which he made full curiously; Through fathers' prayers and mothers' also, This honest craft he put them to. He learned best, and was of honesty, And passed his fellows in curiosity, If in that craft he did him pass, He should have more worship than the less, This great clerk's name was Euclid, His name it spread full wonder wide. Yet this great clerk ordained he To him that was higher in this degree, That he should teach the simplest of wit In that honest craft to be perfect; And so each one shall teach the other, And love together as sister and brother. Futhermore yet that ordained he,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Master called so should he be; So that he were most worshipped, Then should he be so called; But masons should never one another call, Within the craft amongst them all, Neither subject nor servant, my dear brother, Though he be not so perfect as is another; Each shall call other fellows by friendship, Because they come of ladies' birth. On this manner, through good wit of geometry, Began first the craft of masonry; The clerk Euclid on this wise it found, This craft of geometry in Egypt land. In Egypt he taught it full wide, In divers lands on every side; Many years afterwards, I understand, Ere that the craft came into this land. This craft came into England, as I you say, In time of good King Athelstane's day; He made then both hall and even bower, And high temples of great honour, To disport him in both day and night, And to worship his God with all his might. This good lord loved this craft full well, And purposed to strengthen it every part, For divers faults that in the craft he found; He sent about into the land "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ After all the masons of the craft, To come to him full even straight, For to amend these defaults all By good counsel, if it might fall. An assembly then could let make Of divers lords in their state, Dukes, earls, and barons also, Knights, squires and many more, And the great burgesses of that city, They were there all in their degree; There were there each one always, To ordain for these masons' estate, There they sought by their wit, How they might govern it; Fifteen articles they there sought, And fifteen points there they wrought, Here begins the first article. The first article of this geometry;- The master mason must be full securely Both steadfast, trusty and true, It shall him never then rue; And pay thy fellows after the cost, As victuals goeth then, well thou knowest; And pay them truly, upon thy faith, What they may deserve; And to their hire take no more,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ But what that they may serve for; And spare neither for love nor dread, Of neither parties to take no bribe; Of lord nor fellow, whoever he be, Of them thou take no manner of fee; And as a judge stand upright, And then thou dost to both good right; And truly do this wheresoever thou goest, Thy worship, thy profit, it shall be most. Second article. The second article of good masonry, As you must it here hear specially, That every master, that is a mason, Must be at the general congregation, So that he it reasonably be told Where that the assembly shall be held; And to that assembly he must needs go, Unless he have a reasonable excuse, Or unless he be disobedient to that craft Or with falsehood is overtaken, Or else sickness hath him so strong, That he may not come them among; That is an excuse good and able, To that assembly without fable. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Third article. The third article forsooth it is, That the master takes to no 'prentice, Unless he have good assurance to dwell Seven years with him, as I you tell, His craft to learn, that is profitable; Within less he may no be able To lords' profit, nor to his own As you may know by good reason. Fourth article. The fourth article this must be, That the master him well besee, That he no bondman 'prentice make, Nor for no covetousness do him take; For the lord that he is bound to, May fetch the 'prentice wheresoever he go. If in the lodge he were taken, Much disease it might there make, And such case it might befall, That it might grieve some or all. For all the masons that be there Will stand together all together. If such one in that craft should dwell, Of divers disease you might tell;"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ For more ease then, and of honesty, Take a 'prentice of higher degree. By old time written I find That the 'prentice should be of gentle kind; And so sometime, great lords' blood Took this geometry that is full good. Fifth article. The fifth article is very good, So that the 'prentice be of lawful blood; The master shall not, for no advantage, Make no 'prentice that is deformed; It is mean, as you may hear That he have all his limbs whole all together; To the craft it were great shame, To make a halt man and a lame, For an imperfect man of such blood Should do the craft but little good. Thus you may know every one, The craft would have a mighty man; A maimed man he hath no might, You must it know long ere night. Sixth article. The sixth article you must not miss "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ That the master do the lord no prejudice, To take the lord for his 'prentice, As much as his fellows do, in all wise. For in that craft they be full perfect, So is not he, you must see it. Also it were against good reason, To take his hire as his fellows do. This same article in this case, Judgeth his prentice to take less Than his fellows, that be full perfect. In divers matters, know requite it, The master may his 'prentice so inform, That his hire may increase full soon, And ere his term come to an end, His hire may full well amend. Seventh article. The seventh article that is now here, Full well will tell you all together, That no master for favour nor dread, Shall no thief neither clothe nor feed. Thieves he shall harbour never one, Nor him that hath killed a man, Nor the same that hath a feeble name, Lest it would turn the craft to shame. Eighth article."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ The eighth article sheweth you so, That the master may it well do. If that he have any man of craft, And he be not so perfect as he ought, He may him change soon anon, And take for him a more perfect man. Such a man through recklessness, Might do the craft scant worship. Ninth article. The ninth article sheweth full well, That the master be both wise and strong; That he no work undertake, Unless he can both it end and make; And that it be to the lords' profit also, And to his craft, wheresoever he go; And that the ground be well taken, That it neither flaw nor crack. Tenth article. The tenth article is for to know, Among the craft, to high and low, There shall no master supplant another, But be together as sister and brother, In this curious craft, all and some, That belongeth to a master mason."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Nor shall he supplant no other man, That hath taken a work him upon, In pain thereof that is so strong, That weigheth no less than ten pounds, but if that he be guilty found, That took first the work on hand; For no man in masonry Shall not supplant other securely, But if that it be so wrought, That in turn the work to nought; Then may a mason that work crave, To the lords' profit for it to save In such a case if it do fall, There shall no mason meddle withal. Forsooth he that beginneth the ground, If he be a mason good and sound, He hath it securely in his mind To bring the work to full good end. Eleventh article. The eleventh article I tell thee, That he is both fair and free; For he teacheth, by his might, That no mason should work by night, But if be in practising of wit, If that I could amend it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Twelfth article. The twelfth article is of high honesty To every mason wheresoever he be, He shall not his fellows' work deprave, If that he will his honesty save; With honest words he it commend, By the wit God did thee send; But it amend by all that thou may, Between you both without doubt. Thirteenth article. The thirteenth article, so God me save, Is if that the master a 'prentice have, Entirely then that he him tell, That he the craft ably may know, Wheresoever he go under the sun. Fourteenth article. The fourteenth article by good reason, Sheweth the master how he shall do; He shall no 'prentice to him take, Unless diver cares he have to make, That he may within his term, Of him divers points may learn."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Fifteenth article. The fifteenth article maketh an end, For to the master he is a friend; To teach him so, that for no man, No false maintenance he take him upon, Nor maintain his fellows in their sin, For no good that he might win; Nor no false oath suffer him to make, For dread of their souls' sake, Lest it would turn the craft to shame, And himself to very much blame. Plural constitutions. At this assembly were points ordained more, Of great lords and masters also. That who will know this craft and come to estate, He must love well God and holy church always, And his master also that he is with, Whersoever he go in field or enclosed wood, And thy fellows thou love also, For that thy craft will that thou do. Second Point. The second point as I you say,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ That the mason work upon the work day, As truly as he can or may, To deserve his hire for the holy-day, And truly to labour on his deed, Well deserve to have his reward. Third point. The third point must be severely, With the 'prentice know it well, His master's counsel he keep and close, And his fellows by his good purpose; The privities of the chamber tell he no man, Nor in the lodge whatsoever they do; Whatsoever thou hearest or seest them do, Tell it no man wheresoever you go; The counsel of hall, and even of bower, Keep it well to great honour, Lest it would turn thyself to blame, And bring the craft into great shame. Fourth point. The fourth point teacheth us also, That no man to his craft be false; Error he shall maintain none Against the craft, but let it go;"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Nor no prejudice he shall no do To his master, nor his fellow also; And though the 'prentice be under awe, Yet he would have the same law. Fifth point. The fifth point is without doubt, That when the mason taketh his pay Of the master, ordained to him, Full meekly taken so must it be; Yet must the master by good reason, Warn him lawfully before noon, If he will not occupy him no more, As he hath done there before; Against this order he may no strive, If he think well for to thrive. Sixth point. The sixth point is full given to know, Both to high and even low, For such case it might befall; Among the masons some or all, Through envy or deadly hate, Oft ariseth full great debate. Then ought the mason if that he may, Put them both under a day;"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ But loveday yet shall they make none, Till that the work-day you must well take Leisure enough loveday to make, Hinder their work for such a fray; To such end then that you them draw. That they stand well in God's law. Seventh point. The seventh point he may well mean, Of well long life that God us lend, As it descrieth well openly, Thou shalt not by thy master's wife lie, Nor by thy fellows', in no manner wise, Lest the craft would thee despise; Nor by thy fellows' concubine, No more thou wouldst he did by thine. The pain thereof let it be sure, That he be 'prentice full seven year, If he forfeit in any of them So chastised then must he be; Full much care might there begin, For such a foul deadly sin. Eighth point. The eighth point, he may be sure, If thou hast taken any cure,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Under thy master thou be true, For that point thous shalt never rue; A true mediator thou must needs be To thy master, and thy fellows free; Do truly all that thou might, To both parties, and that is good right. Ninth point. The ninth point we shall him call, That he be steward of our hall, If that you be in chamber together, Each one serve other with mild cheer; Gentle fellows, you must it know, For to be stewards all in turn, Week after week without doubt, Stewards to be so all in turn about, Amiably to serve each one other, As though they were sister and brother; There shall never one another cost Free himself to no advantage, But every man shall be equally free In that cost, so must it be; Look that thou pay well every man always, That thou hast bought any victuals eaten, That no craving be made to thee, Nor to thy fellows in no degree, To man or to woman, whoever he be,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Pay them well and truly, for that will we; Therof on thy fellow true record thou take, For that good pay as thou dost make, Lest it would thy fellow shame, And bring thyself into great blame.

Tenth point. The tenth point presenteth well good life, To live without care and strife; For if the mason live amiss, And in his work be false I know, And through such a false excuse May slander his fellows without reason, Through false slander of such fame May make the craft acquire blame. If he do the craft such villainy, Do him no favour then securely, Nor maintain not him in wicked life, Lest it would turn to care and strife;"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ But yet him you shall not delay, Unless that you shall him constrain, For to appear wheresoever you will, Where that you will, loud, or still; To the next assembly you him call, To appear before his fellows all, And unless he will before them appear, The craft he must need forswear; He shall then be punished after the law That was founded by old day. Eleventh point. The eleventh point is of good discretion, As you must know by good reason; A mason, if he this craft well know, That seeth his fellow hew on a stone, And is in point to spoil that stone, Amend it soon if that thou can, And teach him then it to amend, That the lords' work be not spoiled, And teach him easily it to amend, With fair words, that God thee hath lent; For his sake that sit above, With sweet words nourish his love.

If he any strife against them make, Into their custody he shall be taken. Thirteenth point.

And all these points here before To them thou must need be sworn, And all shall swear the same oath Of the masons, be they lief be they loath.

And they shall enquire every man Of his party, as well as he can, If any man may be found guilty In any of these points specially; And who he be, let him be sought, And to the assembly let him be brought.

But they were steadfast in Christ's law, And to their craft without doubt; They loved well God and all his lore, And were in his service ever more. True men they were in that day, And lived well in God's law; They thought no monuments for to make, For no good that they might take, To believe on that monument for their God, They would not do so, though he was furious; For they would not forsake their true faith, And believe on his false law, The emperor let take them soon anon, And put them in a deep prison;"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ The more sorely he punished them in that place, The more joy was to them of Christ's grace, Then when he saw no other one, To death he let them then go; By the book he might it show In legend of holy ones, The names of the four-crowned ones.

For covetousness after good, spare thou not To worship him that all hath wrought; For glad may a man that day be, That once in the day may him see; It is so much worth, without doubt, The virtue thereof no man tell may; But so much good doth that sight, That Saint Austin telleth full right, That day thou seest God's body, Thou shalt have these full securely:- Meet and drink at thy need, None that day shalt thou lack; Idle oaths and words both, God forgiveth thee also; Sudden death that same day Thee dare not dread by no way; Also that day, I thee plight, Thou shalt not lose thy eye sight; And each foot that thou goest then, That holy sight for to see, They shall be told to stand instead, When thou hast thereto great need; That messenger the angel Gabriel, Will keep them to thee full well."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ From this matter now I may pass, To tell more benefits of the mass: To church come yet, if thou may, And hear the mass each day; If thou may not come to church, Where that ever thou dost work, When thou hearest the mass toll, Pray to God with heart still, To give thy part of that service, That in church there done is. Furthermore yet, I will you preach To your fellows, it for to teach, When thou comest before a lord, In hall, in bower, or at the board, Hood or cap that thou off do, Ere thou come him entirely to; Twice or thrice, without doubt, To that lord thou must bow; With thy right knee let it be done, Thine own worship thou save so. Hold off thy cap and hood also, Till thou have leave it on to put. All the time thou speakest with him, Fair and amiably hold up thy chin; So after the nurture of the book, In his face kindly thou look. Foot and hand thou keep full still,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ For clawing and tripping, is skill; From spitting and sniffling keep thee also, By private expulsion let it go, And if that thou be wise and discrete, Thou has great need to govern thee well. Into the hall when thou dost wend, Amongst the gentles, good and courteous, Presume not too high for nothing, For thine high blood, nor thy cunning, Neither to sit nor to lean, That is nurture good and clean. Let not thy countenance therefor abate, Forsooth good nurture will save thy state. Father and mother, whatsoever they be, Well is the child that well may thee, In hall, in chamber, where thou dost go; Good manners make a man. To the next degree look wisely, To do them reverence by and by; Do them yet no reverence all in turn, Unless that thou do them know. To the meat when thou art set, Fair and honestly thou eat it; First look that thine hands be clean, And that thy knife be sharp and keen, And cut thy bread all at thy meat, Right as it may be there eaten,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ If thou sit by a worthier man, Then thy self thou art one, Suffer him first to touch the meat, Ere thyself to it reach. To the fairest morsel thou might not strike, Though that thou do it well like; Keep thine hands fair and well, From foul smudging of thy towel; Thereon thou shalt not thy nose blow, Nor at the meat thy tooth thou pick; Too deep in cup thou might not sink, Though thou have good will to drink, Lest thine eyes would water thereby- Then were it no courtesy. Look in thy mouth there be no meat, When thou begins to drink or speak. When thou seest any man drinking, That taketh heed to thy speech, Soon anaon thou cease thy tale, Whether he drink wine or ale, Look also thou scorn no man, In what degree thou seest him gone; Nor thou shalt no man deprave, If thou wilt thy worship save; For such word might there outburst. That might make thee sit in evil rest."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Close thy hand in thy fist, And keep thee well from \"had I known.\" Hold thy tongue and spend thy sight; Laugh thou not with no great cry, Nor make no lewd sport and ribaldry. Play thou not but with thy peers, Nor tell thou not all that thou hears; Discover thou not thine own deed, For no mirth, nor for no reward; With fair speech thou might have thy will, With it thou might thy self spoil. When thou meetest a worthy man, Cap and hood thou hold not on; In church, in market, or in the gate, Do him reverance after his state. If thou goest with a worthier man Then thyself thou art one, Let thy foremost shoulder follow his back, For that is nurture without lack; When he doth speak, hold thee still, When he hath done, say for thy will, In thy speech that thou be discreet, And what thou sayest consider thee well; But deprive thou not him his tale, Neither at the wine nor at the ale. Christ then of his high grace, Save you both wit and space,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International LodgeRoom International admin@lodgeroomuk.com  http://www.lodgeroomuk.com http://www.lodgeroomus.com www.lodgeroomuk.com/forum/  www.lodgeroomuk.net/forum/ Well this book to know and read, Heaven to have for your reward. Amen! Amen! so mote it be! So say we all for charity. "}]
