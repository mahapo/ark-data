[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE HIGH ER DE GREE S HANDB OOK by J.S.M. Ward PREFACE. In attempting to give a n ou tline sketch o f the various degrees in Freemasonry in a book o f his description, I am face d b y many difficulties, no t the least of which is how to write in an interesting way abou t degrees, which many of my readers have not taken, withou t giving way more than is permi ssible. One of my reasons for writing this book is to encourage Brethren to take these “ Advanced degrees.” We still m eet Brethren who say that there is nothing b eyond the Craft worth taking. As one who h as taken all t he degrees for which h e is qualified, I can state from personal experience that, with on e or two small exceptions, p ractically all t he degrees are of the greatest value. Of course, my readers must bea r in mi nd that a Brother gets out of Masonry in p ropo rtion to what he brings into it. If he a pproaches it with a keen intellectual mi nd, b ased on a reasonable a moun t of study of the meaning of symbolism, h e naturally will l earn far more than if he a pproach es it m erely from t he point of view of a man who kno ws a good d inner when h e ea ts one, and cares nothing abou t the meaning of the ce remonies which take place in the Lodge Room.

HISTORICAL SURVEY. The ea rly history of the so - called “Higher Degrees” is even more obscure than that of the Craft, and in consequence a tendency has grown up to regard them as “Manufactured” during the 18 th century. In my opinion this i s too h asty a c onclusion, for some of these degrees at any rate bear every evidence of antiquity, and contain that wisdom which h as been h anded do wn from generation to generation. The third d egree c learly foreshadows a subsequent degree, wherein the lost s ...s will be finally recovered, in fact withou t such a degree the whole of the Craft ceremonies would b e meaningless. Moreover, as we shall show later, the most im portant Higher Degrees use Sns. o f great antiquity, which h ave been clearly handed do wn from ancient days in precisely the same way as have our Craft Sns., o f which full evidence has been given in the History Handbook. There is also do cumentary evidence to show that the legends of some of these degrees were well kno wn b y our medieval ancestors, a nd actually incorporated in the Ancient Charges. As, for example, the two p illars which were set up b efore the flood, survived that deluge, and were subsequently re - discovered b y masons. This legend forms the theme of the 13 th degree of the A. and A. Rit e which is called the Royal Arch o f Enoch. The ea rliest printed references to any of the Higher Degrees are to the Royal Arch in 1741, and to the Royal Order of Scotland in 1743, when it was in such a vigorous s tate of health that it had a Provincial Grand Lodge in London, with at l east t wo Chapters und er its control. The Higher Degrees appear to fall i nto three main group s: - (1) Those that extend the story of the Craft; (2) Those which pu rport to restore the lost S..s; and (3) The Chivalric Degrees. With r egard to the first group two tendencies s eem t o h ave been at work du ring the 18 th century. The one being to cut out of the Craft various parts of the legend, and the other being to enlarge ce rtain incidents referred to in the Craft stories, add p icturesqu e detail, and evolve out of them a new degree. My own conv iction is that the root m atter of nearly all the Higher Degrees comes from t raditions and legends cherished b y our medieval predece ssors. There is no doub t that all our rituals, the Craft included, und erwent considerable revision during the 18 th century. In the ca se of the Craft Degrees a c onsiderable a moun t of excision was nece ssitated b y the a lteration o f the c lause in the c onstitution which changed Masonry"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"from a Christian to a non - Christian b as is. This process of excision o f all Christian references was not completed un til t he tim e of the Treaty of Union, in 1813, and on e example for England will suffice. Dunckley, in the second h alf of the 18 th century, declared that the “ Blazing Star” meant t he star at Bethlehem which guided the wise men to the infant Christ. In Scotland to this day there still survives a distinct reference to the Christ in the Craft Degrees, for the V.S.L. is opened b y the D.C. with a quo tation from t he opening verse of the gospel of St. John, - “In the beginning was the Word,” - whilst the Lodge is closed with the following quo tation from t he same source, “And the Word was with God. ” Now this clearly indicates the e xistence of a Christian explanation o f the lost S..s which, thou gh no longer coun tenanced in the Craft Degrees in England, survives in such d egrees as the Rose Croix. We thus s ee that anything Christian was elimi nated from t he lower degrees, and this explains the probable origin o f some of the Higher Degrees. At t he same tim e, the general style of our Craft Rituals has been altered. Apparently in early days the ac tual part taken by the ca ndidate during the ce remony was comparatively small, and the bulk o f the work consisted o f lectures, some parts being by questio n and answer, while other parts contained various legends conn ected with the Order. Gradually the tendency arose to make the candidate take a more ac tive a nd d ramatic part in the ce remony, and in o rder to do this legends and incidents which d id no t imm edi ately conn ect with the main theme began to b e dropp ed. These parts were prized b y the older members, and rather than see them perish they made them i nto side Degrees, no r are we justified in assumi ng that they invented the Sn..s to go with these degrees. In the Royal Order of Scotland to - day the bulk o f the ceremony consists of questions and answers put by the M. to the Wardens, and include the giving of S..ns at certain po ints in the ca techism, which S..ns, ho wever, are not specifically taught to the ca nd idate. No doub t when simil ar portions were c ut out and b eca me Christian degrees the Sns. went with them, and n aturally beca me tests to p rove that a Brother had taken this new Side Degree, which was nevertheless in reality very ancient. A characteristic e x ample of a degree which h as been cut out of an existing craft degree is the Mark, which was alm ost certainly part of the ce remony of a F.C., althou gh no doub t it has been amplified since it started on its independent career. On the other hand some of the intermediate degrees of the A. and A Rite, such as the Knights Elect of Nine, are merely amplifications of incidents dismi ssed in a few w ords in the Craft ceremony. The Knights Elect of Nine relates in d ramatic form t he a pprehension o f one of the c rimi nal s. To an entirely different order belong degrees like the Royal Arch, the Royal Order of Scotland, and the Rose Croix. Each o f these in its own way claim s to b e the c ompleting degree, in which the lost s..s are discovered. The e xplanation in the ca se of the last two is Christian, in the ca se of the R.A. non - Christian, whilst their survival indicates the e xistence of two d iametrically oppo sed traditions. The Christian Degrees represent the solution pu t forward in Medieval tim es, whereas the R.A., thou gh n ow overlaid with Jewish matter taken from t he O.T. in the 18 th century, h as s till within it t race s of a tradition which goes"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"right back to p re - Christian tim es, and clearly comes in p art from Egypt, and in p art from India. The third group claim t o carry on the teac hing of the Chivalric Orders of the Middle Ages, and contain evidence of a mystical t radition which was not entirely orthodo x. A characteristic e xample of these degrees is the Knights Templar. With regard to these Chivalric Degrees, it m ay at fir st sight appear difficult t o justify the claim of a building g uild to b e linked in any way with the proud est Order of Chivalry kno wn to exist in the Middle Ages, bu t those who h astily brush away this tradition ignore certain salient features of the Templar organization. The Templars contained at least three sections, o r sub - orders, within their ranks, i.e., the Knights themselves, the Templar Priests, and the so - called Serving Brethren, among whom were m any Masons. When the Order was s upp ressed thou sands of Knights escaped the general persecution, and sim ply disappeared from history. How did they do it, and what beca me of them? The most reasonable e xplanation is that t hey disguised themselves as Serving Brothers and Lay Brothers of the Temple, and were sh ielded b y these humbler members of their own Order, who entirely escaped p ersecution. I have gone into this question at great l ength in “Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods,” a nd will t herefore c ontent m yself by saying here that there was undoub tedly a link between Masonry and the Templars, which is quite sufficient to explain a partial survival of Templar Rites among the Masonic Brotherhood. The Templars certainly had a mystical teac hing very simil ar to that enshrined in Freemasonry, and trace s of it can st ill be detected in the present rituals of the Masonic Knights Templar, despite the fact that they have been considerably revised in the last half century . CHA PTER 2. THE MARK D EGREE . Those of my readers who h ave a lready studied the first three Handbook s of this s eries will realize that the true S..s of a M.M. are not restored to them. The real S.. which was lost was comprehension o f the Nature of God, and ou r Third Degree quite c learly indicates that, despite popu lar beliefs, we shall not be a ble to co mprehend God as s oon as we a re dead. The Craft degrees, in short, take us through b irth, life a nd d eath, and shadow forth the Creative, Preservative a nd Destructive sides of the Deity. The majority of the other degrees either deal with what befalls a man after death, o r else e ndeavor to explain, o r f ill i n, certain gaps in that historic narrative which is the a llegorical basis of the Craft Degrees. The Mark d egree in p art belongs to the latter group, and is in reality the c ompletion o f the Second Degree. Unqu estionably a Brother shou ld rece ive his M ark when h e becomes a F.C., and the degree itself still shows s trong operative influence."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" It is ruled b y Mark Grand Lodge, which meets and h as its offices at the Temple in Great Queen Street, n ext doo r to the Co nnaught Rooms. All who love the Higher Degrees owe a debt of gratitude to Mark Grand Lodge, which h as acted as Fairy Godmother to many of the Higher Degrees which were left stranded after the Treaty of Union in 1813. Indeed, in many cases it has more or less taken them und er its wing, and in consequence we shall have to refer again and again to the fact that the Grand Body which rules a particular degree has its Head Quarters at “Mark Mason’s Hall.” The Mark Degree has its own regalia a nd a special j ewel, and p erhaps our youn ger Brethren will be glad o f the warning that, with the e xception o f the R.A., no jewels of the Higher Degree may be worn in a Craft Lodge. The jewel of the Mark Degree c onsists of a keystone, made usually of white c ornelian, on which are e ngraved certain mystic letters, the meaning of which are revealed to members of the Degree. It is s uspended from a blue a nd red ribbon. The a prons and collars are a lso made of blue a nd red silk. The teac hing of this Degree is largely an amplification of the Second, and tells of education and reward for labor. It also contains a dramatic warning against attempting to ob tain wages to which we a re not justly entitl ed, and there is a Messianic hint in the fact “That the stone which the builders rejected has become the headstone of the c orner.” Incidentally the stone is a keystone, hence the origin o f the jewel of the degree. Several facts lead u s to suspect t hat at one tim e the Degree may have been more pronoun cedly Christian than it i s to - day. We kno w t hat it was flourishing as far back as 1760 in Lodges attached to the Ancients, who were unqu estionably strongly pro - Christian. The legend as now given relates to a period in the building of the Temple previous to the tragedy, althou gh there is abund ant evi dence to show that as late a s the tim e of the formation o f Mark Grand Lodge, 1856, many Mark Lodges in the North h ad a somewhat simil ar legend to that now used, bu t associated it with the second Temple instead o f with the first. Mark therefore, is, o r shou ld b e, really part of our Craft system, and in Scotland Craft Lodges s till have the power to confer it, and constantly do so. In that coun try it i s a nece ssary qualification for the Excellent Master which itself is an essential qualification for the Royal Arch. We shall refer to the Excellent Master more fully when we c ome to the Royal Arch, bu t it i s desirable to po int out that in Scotland Royal Arch Chapters also h ave the right to confer the Mark Degree, if a ca ndidate has not already taken it i n h is Cr aft Lodge."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Mark, as we have said, is the c ompletion o f the Second Degree, and in itself contains what are practically two d egrees, n amely, Mark Man and Mark Master. There has been much learned controversy as to whether the Mark Master was at one tim e conferred on a man as s oon as he rece ived h is Second Degree. Since it i s im possible a t the moment to decide when the Mark Degrees arose in their present form, all we ca n say definitely is that so far as documentary evidence goes, i.e., b ack to 1760, it ap pears as if there were a lways the Degrees of Mark Man and Mark Master, and that althou gh at any rate in theory, Mark Man mi ght be c onferred on a F.C., Mark Master seems always to h ave been restricted to Master Masons. In modern tim es both Mark Degrees are conferred together, and always on a M.M., althou gh the Mark ritual throughou t emphasizes the c onn ection with the Second Degree. THE ARK MAR INER. The Mark Degree, o r Degrees, also h ave a ssociated with them, bu t in a separate “ Lodge,” the Royal Ark Marine r Degree. This appears to b e old “Operative” work, p robably built up in the 18 th century by genuine operative masons in the North o f England, anxious to h ave some way of distinguishing a real “Working” mason from a “ Speculative.” The same explanation p rob ably brought i nto existence the Degree of St. Laurence the Martyr, o f which more a non. The Ark Mariner legend relates to the Deluge, and is taken d irect from the Bible. The most interesting features are the use of a stone, instead o f the V.S.L., on whic h to take the Ob.. The reason for this is explained in the ritual, bu t it m ay be that we have here a survival of the old custom of swearing on a stone a ltar, which was the ea rliest form of a binding oath. There is also some interesting work with a triangl e, bu t in the main it m ust be c onfessed that t here is not m uch really deep teac hing in the Degree. It is, however, qu ite a pretty littl e Degree, and h as many ardent suppo rters. It is und er the direct rule of Mark Grand Lodge. CHA PTER 3. THE HO LY R OYA L AR CH O F JERU SALE M . The Mark completes the Second Degree, bu t to the youn gest Master Mason it m ust be obv ious that a further degree is needed to complete the Third Degree. The genuine S..s were lost; but were they never re - discovered? Moreover, since they w ere kno wn to three people, why could no t the two survivors have a ppo inted a succe ssor and given h im t he lost S..s? The Royal Arch sets out to give a t any rate one a nswer to the question - “What were the Gen. S..s of a M.M.?” Briefly, it i s a lost W., bu t t hat W. conv eys in symbolism a most i nteresting and illumi nating explanation o f the nature of God. Indeed, the teac hing of the Craft m ay be summ ed up b y saying that it t eac hes a man h is duty to h is neighbo r, whereas the “ Arch”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"instructs him i n h is duty tow ards God. What is the nature of God therein d epicted? It is a trinity, bu t not t he Christian Trinity; it i s more like the Hindoo Trinity of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. It also clearly indicates the union o f Body, Soul, and Spirit, and shows that b y that Union we become united with God. Thus, in its very essence the Royal Arch is s upremely mystical, and teac hes of the Beatific Vision. The legend d eals with the “ Discovery” of the lost S..s at the re - building of the Temple a fter the return from t he C aptivity. It will t hus be seen that the “ Setting” of the degree is from the Old Testament, and this fact m ust be noted, for there is another explanation o f the “ Lost Word” which is given in some of the other “Higher” degrees, n amely, that the “ Lost Word” is Christ, the Logos. But we have not yet obtained an answer to the very natural question, “Why could no t the other two, who kn ew the S., appo int a succe ssor?” The full exoteric e xplanation, and also how it was that the S.s came to b e deposited in a place of security is given in on e of the “Cryptic Degrees,” to which we shall refer later in this book. Briefly however, three persons were nece ssary in o rder to conv ey it, bu t in reality, o f course, this is s ymbolism, and im plies that Body, Soul and Spirit m us t be in un ion b efore t hey can fully comprehend the Divine Trinity. While, on the one hand, no living man, tramm eled b y the bond s of the flesh, can really comprehend the nature of God, no r even do so imm ediately after death, for our souls will not yet be sufficiently evolved, on the other, h and it i s clearly taught that our bod y does not completely perish, bu t is rather transmuted, even as St. Paul him self says will t ake place a t the day of judgment. This is no doub t a very profound do gma a nd difficult fo r us to und erstand, bu t if we ca n realize the fact that m atter as well as Spirit i s in its original a manifestation o f God, and therefore a part of Him , we shall perceive that Matter also is indestructible, althou gh its form m ay change. This fact is perfe ctly well recognised b y modern science. In the original form of the Royal Arch, which still survives in Bristol, in Scotland, and in America, the Candidate must pass through four veils, which correspond to v arious s piritual states of existence which lie be yond the grave, eac h b eing a littl e nearer to the Divine Being than was the previous one. The four Veils are c oloured respectively Blue, pu rple, red and white, and at eac h Veil t he Candidate is challenged b y a “ Guardian o f the Veil” who d emands of him t he W. and Sn. o f the previous Veil. This ceremony in Scotland forms a distinct degree kno wn as the Excellent Master, and the Jewel thereof is a pentacle set with b rilli ants, which jewel, o f course, represents, among other things, man and h is five senses. T he penal S. o f this degree is of great antiquity, and is made by Vishnu when in the form of the Lion Incarnation. Vishnu d escended to earth to ov erthrow an evil giant which was opp ressing the world, and slew him by disemboweling him . In Scotland no Engli sh Royal Arch Mason can b e a dmitt ed to a Scotch Chapter unless he previously rece ives the Degree of Excellent Master, which d egree he ca nno t rece ive unless he has first taken the Mark."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Passing of the White Veil i s really an integral part of the Arch ce remony, and the Sn. correspond ing to the S.s of the other Veils is one well kno wn to English Royal Arch Masons. It is only after having passed this barrier that the ca ndidate is enabled to ob tain the real S.s of an M.M., the ce remony being very simil ar to ou r own Royal Arch. In o ther words, it i s only when we have passed through v arious s piritual stages of existence that we shall at length b e a ble to comprehend the nature of God. The deletion o f the Veils from our ceremony has tended to ob scure this im po rtant lesson in the English form of the R.A. A slightly different lesson is taught us by the fate of our predece ssor in the Craft. He c ould not have revealed the S. even if he had wished to do so, for it was an experience, and therefore c ould no t be c omm u nicated b y words to any living man. We ca nno t go into a detailed explanation o f this deeply mystical ceremony in a book o f this nature, bu t a brief explanation o f a ce rtain v ault which p lays a promi nent part therein is essential. Like a ll symbols in Free masonry it has s everal m eanings, bu t the two most im portant are (a), the und erworld, o r the grave into which man d escends at death, and from which h is Soul ultim ately ascends to realm s of Light. (b) The Mystical interpretation is that it i s the M.Ch., that dark rece ss of the Soul, where dwells the Divine Spark. The jewel of this degree depicts quite c learly the nature of God. The Doub le Triangle within the Circle a nd the Point therein, which is represented b y the All - Seeing Eye, is the age - old symbol for G od. The triangle within the Circle represents the Spirit within the Circle of Infinity, and is peculiarly associated with God the Creator. R.A. Masons will perceive the significance of this fact in conn ection with the Altar. The Point within a Circle, a mong the Hindoo s, stands for Paramatm a, the All - pervading , the Source a nd End of All. The triangle with the point downwards is the symbol of rain (water) and represents the preservative side of God (Vishnu ), while the triangle with the point upward repre sents fire, whose flames go up to Heaven, and is therefore the e mblem of the Destructive, o r rather the Transformative, side of God (Shiva). This great symbol was s acred to Babylonian, Egyptian and Jew, and h ad to eac h the same inner meaning. It is also sacred to the modern Hindoo, and was s o to the a ncient Mexican, and indeed is one of the most venerated symbols in the world. It will t hus be seen that the jewel of the R.A., far fr om being a mere ornament, contains in itself a summ ary of the sublim e teac h ings of that degree; the more so as it also h as a triple tau. With regard to the tau cross, we have a lready shown in ou r earlier handbook s that in its origin it was a Phallic symbol representing the Creative power. We shall remember also that we make a t au cross every tim e we rece ive the S.s in the Craft Degrees. Thus the M.M. h as him self made the triple tau. It is also worth remi nding our r eaders that only those who h ave passed the c hair and actually ruled a Lodge a re e ntitl ed to wear three tau crosses on their aprons. As a Phallic symbol it beca me a n emblem of the Creator, and also, in tim e, o f our anim al passions, which must be trampled und er foot if we a re to advance in Spiritual kno wledge."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"By the tim e we have reac hed the Arch, symbolically this has been don e, and we a re remi nded o f this by the Union o f these three taus beneath the triangles, emblems of the spirit. Thou gh this is essentially a non - Christian d egree we ca nno t forget that there were three Crosses on Calvary. The presence of the triple tau, after the e xperience we have had o f it i n the Craft, shows how carefully eac h d egree leads on to the next, and it also conv eys this im portant lesson. Each d egree in the Craft taught the e volution and pu rification o f (1) the bod y; (2) the soul; (3) th e spirit. These three, no w in p erfect union, rest und er the Shadow of the Supreme Being depicted b y the Doub le Triangles. Thus the presence of the tau crosses teac hes us that Man will ultim ately rest in the Presence of the King of Kings. In fact the Roy al Arch is full of interesting symbolism: t he c olours of the regalia, red and purple, the shape of the a ltar, the position o f the three Principals, all conv ey im portant lessons, bu t we ca nno t spare the space in a small Handbook like this to enlarge further on this degree. Nevertheless, on e ca nno t omit pointing out t hat as in the Craft t he W.M. represented the Spirit, the S.W. the Soul, and the J.W. the Body, so do the c orrespond ing officers in the R.A., althou gh h ere they are no longer separated, bu t are si de by side, and in all cases act as one. The reason for this is that the R.A. d epicts that sublim e state wherein Body, Soul and Spirit are truly one, and are a t Peace in the Presence of God – no w properly comprehended. Our readers will t hus perceive that n o Craft Mason can consider he has fulfilled h is duty as a Mason, un til he has taken the Royal Arch, for he has not recovered those lost S..s which he has promi sed to try and find. The regalia includes apron and a sash o f purple a nd red. CHA PTER 4. THE CR Y PTIC D EGREES . The Cryptic Degrees are four in nu mber and are ruled b y a Grand Coun cil of their own which, ho wever, in reality is in close a lliance with Mark Grand Lodge, whose Hall i s their Head Quarters. They are “ The Most Excellent Master,” “ The Royal M aster,” “ The Select Master,” a nd “The Super - Excellent Master,” a nd their legends bridge the gap, h istorically, b etween the first Temple a nd its destruction. The “ Most Excellent Master” must not be c onfound ed with the “ Excellent Master” which is worked in Scotland and is really the “ Passing of the Veils” in the Royal Arch, althou gh it i s kept separate a nd given first. Its Legend, therefore, is associated with the Second Temple, while the “ Most Excellent Master” on the c ontrary deals with the c ompletion and dedication o f the first temple. The a pron, which is s eldom worn, is white e dged with pu rple, and there is a purple c ollar. The c olour refers to the grief felt by the Brethren for the loss of the third Principal, whose c hair is vaca nt. The most"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"striking feature in the Lodge room i s a small replica of the Ark o f the Covenant. In theory the qualification for the “ Most Excellent Master” is only Mark, bu t as it i s always followed by the “ Royal Master,” for which the Qualification is M ark and Arch, in p racti ce the Cand. must hold bo th these degrees. The Royal Master is a most interesting degree, for it shows how the R.A. S..s came to b e deposited in the place in which they were subsequently found. Thou gh H.A.B.’s chair was vaca nt in the “ Most Excellent Maste r,” in the Royal Master he is the c hief character, and his disquisition on the subject of “Death” is one of the most beautiful piece s of r itual in Freemasonry. The a pron in this degree is black, edged with red, bu t it i s s eldom worn. The three Principals, ho wever, wear robes s imil ar to those worn b y the same officers in the R.A. The “ Select Master,” unlike the prece ding degrees, h as a special jewel of its own, n amely a silver trowel within a triangle of the same metal, which is s uspended from a black coll ar edged and lined with red. The a pron is white, edged with red and gold, and is of a triangular shape, bu t in England n either it nor the jewel are usually worn. In Scotland the jewel of the Cryptic Degrees combines the triangle a nd the trowel, whereas i n England we wear the Jewel of the “ Super - Excellent Master” to represent all four degrees. The “ Select Master” is s uppo sed to b e held in a c rypt (hence the name “ Cryptic Degrees”) which is the same c rypt in which the S..s of the R.A. were a t a later date discovered. The legend is s imil ar to that of one of the degrees of the Ancient and Acce pted Rite, and relates how a well kno wn mason employed b y K.S. acc identally intruded into this crypt when K.S. and H., K. o f T., were present. The intruder was s ubsequ ently pardon ed, bu t the O.G. who shou ld h ave prevented h is entry, was pun ished in h is place . This is undoub tedly an o ld legend which crops up again in a third d egree, n amely, the “ Grand Tyler of K.S.” one of the Allied Degrees. Its s ymbolic meaning is that those who pu sh their occult i nvestigation beyond reasonable limit s, and withou t the a ssistance a nd p rotection o f more e xperienced investigators, run serious risks. The “ Super - Excellent Master” is s hort and no t very interesting, bu t it brings the story of the first Temple down to the tim e of its threatened d estruction and so b ridges the gap b etween the “ Most Excellent Master” a nd the R.A.. The lesson taught i s unswerving loyalty to Jehov ah. The c olour of this degree is crim son, and a c rim son collar shou ld be worn. In practice, ho wever, this is worn on ly by members of the Grand Coun cil. The Jewel of these degrees is a white e namel triangle with the point downwards, that is, the triangle of the Preserver, and is as a rule the only regalia worn. The most int eresting part of this degree is a ca rpet on the floor with the following design thereon. Inside a square is a c ircle, within which is a triangle pointing towards the West,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and within the triangle is the C. o f the C. on which rests an altar, and on the a lt ar is the a rk of the c ovenant. As the “ Floor” design is not adequately explained, the following will be of use. The triangle pointing West is the symbol of the Preserver, and h as been adop ted as the jewel of all t hese degrees in England, and it certainly denotes the und erlying principle of the series. (1). The “ Most Excellent Master” teac hes us that despite the loss of the c hief architect God preserved the work o f the Temple a nd it was duly completed. (2). The “ Royal Master” tells us how the R.A.S..s came to b e preserved. (3). In the “ Select Master” the over zealous friend o f K.S. was preserved from t he dire fate which threatened h im . (4). In the “ Super - Excellent Master” we a re shown ho w G od p reserved a remnant of the people beca use they preserved their fa ith in Him . The triangle within a square denotes the Descent of the Spirit i nto Matter, while the Circle symbolizes Infinity - whence the Spirit comes. The point li nks the Infinite with the emblem for the All - Pervading - it also refers to eac h individual “Ego.” The whole symbol, therefore, means that God the Preserver descended from Eternity, and entering into Matter beca me flesh, and He is one with the All - Pervading. It is therefore a most sacred emblem, and the fact that the Ark o f the Covenant stands o n the C. shows that the New D ispensation arises out of the old, and the Proph etic reference to this fact is emphasized b y the real g. which shou ld remi nd u s of Him Who d ied upon the Cross. Thus this degree has a Messianic, esoteric meaning, o ften ov erlook ed b y t hose who h ave taken it. CHA PTER V. THE ALL IED D EGREES . Under this heading are group ed a number of different degrees having littl e in comm on.

Most of these degrees are of second ary im portance, bu t t he Red Cross of Babylon and the High Priest are old and im portant. The degrees are a s follows: - (1). St. Laurence the Martyr. The Jewel is a gridiron, and it i s quite possible that it i s to this fact that we owe the riba ld tales current in the outside world as to what befalls a man at his initiation into Freemasonry. The legend o f this degree in reality has nothing whatever to do with Freemasonry, and is well kno wn to every student of Medieval legends of the Saints. The lesson taught is that of f ortitude. This degree a ppears to b e a piece of old Operative ritual brought from Lancashire, and o riginal only worked up into a degree in o rder to enable a genuine “ Working mason” to d istinguish o ther Operatives from “These newfa ngled Speculatives.” (2). The Knights of Constantinop le is associated with the Emperor Constantine, and inculcates the useful lesson o f universal equality. The Jewel is a c ross s urmoun ted b y a crescent m oon, h ardly a happy choice, for it suggests the triu mph o f the Crescent over the Cross. (3). The Secret Monitor is very simil ar to the first degree of the Secret Monitor as worked by the Grand Conclave, and is associated with David and Jonathan. Its presence a mong the Allied Degrees bears testim ony to an u nfortunate split which o ccurred du ring the ea rly years of the organization o f the Grand Conclave of the Secret Monitor. It is the only degree in English Freemasonry which is und er the c ontrol of two entirely distinct bod ies. The Jewel is a “ Hackle” suspe nded from a c rown, and on the ribbon abov e the jewel is a bow. (4). The Grand Tyler of King Solomon relates the story of the acc idental intrusion o f a F.C. into the secret vaults where K.S., K.H. o f T., and H.A.B. were met in consultation. The legend is very simil ar to that related in the “ Select Master” thou gh there a re interesting variations, in p articular. “The Period” of the legend b eing earlier. The Jewel is the triangle of the Preserver, po int downwards, with certain Hebrew letters engraven in gilt upon a black enamel background. All t hese degrees are interesting, bu t can h ardly be ca lled really im portant, whereas the next two stand in qu ite a different category. (5). The Red Cross of Babylon is undoub tedly old, and the sixteenth d egree of the A. and A. Rite a lso b ears on the same theme, while simil ar incidents likewise occur in the Royal Order of Scotland. The Degree in h istorical order follows, and is closely associated with, the Royal Arch and the rebuilding of the second Temple, and in Scotlan d is actually controlled b y the Supreme Royal Arch Chapter.

In all the great religions of the world there is a tradition that soon er or later after death the soul must cross a ce rtain “Bridge.” Clearly this “ Bridge” means the passing from one state of existence in the world b eyond the grave to another, and indicates a further advancement of the Soul away from earth cond itions and towards God. The Japanese, Chinese, Parsees, Mahomedans, and Medieval Christians , all speak o f this bridge. For example, the Parsees say that the mourners must rise a t dawn on the third d ay after the death o f their fr iend and pray for him , for at that hou r he c omes to the bridge which h e must cross to reac h Paradise. The bridge span s the gulf of Hell, and in the mi ddle of the Bridge the Soul will be met by a female form. If his life has been good this form will be that of a beautiful woman who will lead h im i nto Paradise, bu t if his life has been evil it will be a hideous hag who wi ll m eet him and fling him from t he bridge into the bottoml ess pit. In England this bridge was called “The Brig of Dread,” a nd is depicted in a twelfth century fresco at Chaldon Church, Surrey, where it i s s hown as if built li ke a saw. Among those attempti ng to cross it i s a Mason with h is tools in h is hand. It is also spok en o f in an o ld Lancashire dirge which relates what befalls the Soul of the dead man imm ediately after it has left it s dead bod y. “When thou from hence a way art passed Every night and alle; To whinny - muir thou comest at last And Christ rece ive thy soule.” “ From whinny - muir when thou mayest pass Every night and alle; To ‘Brig of Dread’ thou comest at last And Christ rece ive thy soule.” The e xoteric lesson o f the degree is “Great is Trut h,” but the hidden reference to the Bridge of Testing which the soul m ust pass on its journey towards Paradise is the most striking feature. The Jewel is two crossed swords on a dark green b ackground o f enamel. (6). The High Priest, un like the other degre es, can on ly be c onferred on a mason who h as been a 3 rd Principal in a R.A. Chapter. It deals with the Priesthood “after the Order of Melchisedic,” a nd the jewel is the triangle with the point upwards, on which is im posed a mit re.

The qualification for the 18 th is one year a Master Mason, and for the 30 th it has usually been Prelate or M.W.S., the latter being the titl e of the ruler of a Rose Croix Chapter. The 18 th degree is a highly mystical degree a nd full of the deepest interest, and in England is restricted to p rofessing Christians. In the U.S.A. and on the Continent of Europe, ho wever, it i s not usually regarded as Christian, and non - Christians can b ecome members. One schoo l of Masonic research h as propound ed a theory that t he Rose Croix was originally Roman Catholic, and invented b y the Jacobites. Personally, I have, after very careful search, b een un able to find any evidence in suppo rt of this view, and frankly I canno t conceive of any conscientious Roman Catholic taking part in the ce remonies. It seems more probable that the degree is due to Rosicrucian influence, and the ea rliest historic e vidence we ca n find o f these mystics s hows that they were Lutheran, bu t it i s quite probable that t hey inherited an earlier t radition. There a ppear to b e references to Rosicrucian do ctrines in Dante, and the Comm acine Masons carved the Rose a nd Compasses over their Lodge doo r at Assisi i n the opening years of the 15 th century. Moreover, the a ncient Aztecs who likewise venerate d the c ross had a very simil ar Rite with the same Sn..s and many of the same incidents. Finally, we ca nno t ignore the fact that Henry Adamson, M.A., in “The Muses Threnod ie” written in 1636, says: - “For we a re Brethren o f the Rosie Cross, We have the Maso n’s Word and Second Sight:” Now this s hows an association o f the “ Mason’s Word” with the Rosie Cross. Personally, I think this refers, no t to the present 18 th degree, bu t to the Rosy Cross of the Royal Order of Scotland. It indicates, ho wever, Rosicruci an influence on Freemasonry long before the rise of the Jacobite movements, and is in a poem describing Protestant Perth. To revert to the 18 th degree a s we kno w it t o - day, we find it has four distinct sections. The first consists of the c onferring by na me of the intermediate degrees, and the other sections form t he Rose Croix Degree itself. It i s a highly mystical piece of symbolism, and expresses the passage of Man through the Valley of the Shadow of Death acc ompanied b y the Masonic Virtues F.H. and C. .

All it s essential features are found in the Bora Ceremony of the Australian Aborigines, on e of the most primi tive race s s till li ving. In India a nd China the Sns. o f this degree a re a ssociated with God the Preserver. In Ancient Egypt certain p arts of the Book o f the Dead cover the same ground and show the same Sns. in u se. The Ancient Aztecs in Mexico appear to have had p ractically the same ce remony, as already stated, and some of the Sns. which they make have survived among the Red Indians to this day. In Medieval Europe we find constant examples of the use of the two p rincipal Sns. employed, as for example a t Coire Cathedral, - in bo th 12 th and 15 th century work, - in a fresco at Basle, p ainted in the opening years of the 16 th century, and in a 17 th century paneled room now in the Engadine Museum at St. Moritz. Moreover, a ce rtain Sn. associated with the 9 t h degree of the A. and A. Rite which indicates s orrow is also found side by side with these Rose Croix Sns. in every one of the a bov e mentioned cases in Europe. Facts like these canno t be brushed aside lightly, and p reclude us from acce pting the view that the Rose Croix was invented in the 18 th century. Indeed, the Mexican Codices, which p ractically show the c omplete ce remony, are a t least two and a half centuries earlier than the date a t which it has been suggested that this degree was invented.

"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHA PTER VII THE ROYAL ORD ER OF SCOTL AND This O rder rules two d egrees, the Harodim and the Rosy Cross. The Harodim i s conferred in a bod y called a Chapter, and so in this Order a Chapter is below a Lodge. In p ractice, however, these two bod ies are the same. The Royal Order has many peculiar f eatures , and it i s im possible to do it j ustice in on e chapter of this book. Firstly, we may note that the Order is unique in that it has one governing bod y for the whole world, and is the only English Masonic bod y of which this is true. Grand Lodge must always m eet in Scotland. Qualifications, as laid do wn b y the Grand Lodge in Scotland, is five years a Master Mason, but the Metropo litan Provincial Grand Lodge in p ractice will only admit m embers of the 30 th degree of the Ancient and Acce pted Rite. London Masons , who h ave not attained to that degree, must therefore go to the Provincial Grand Lodge of the Southern Coun ties, which meets at Windsor. These degrees are of great antiquity, and, p ersonally, I consider them t he greatest of all our masonic degrees. They are not so d ramatic a s certain o thers, such as the Order of the Knights Templar, bu t they have a unity of purpose a nd an ancient ritual which is full of the most profound mystical teac hing. It is in curious old Border verse, for the most part, and from i nternal evidence would appear to ante - date our present form of even the Craft degrees, thou gh it clearly presuppo ses their existence. From historical records we kno w that these “ Scotch” degrees were a t work in 1743 in London, for there is a record o f a Pr ovincial Grand Lodge in London, h aving at least two Chapters und er its control, at that tim e. The mere fact t hat t here were a t l east t wo Chapters of Harodim at work at t his date precludes the possibilit y of the Order having come into existence in 1743, an d the fact that it had to travel from Scotland, and then establish itself and spread in London, justifies us in considering that it can h ardly be later in o rigin than the date of the formation o f the Craft Grand Lodge of Scotland itself, which was in 1736. Seven years is, I consider, far too short a tim e to allow a new degree to spread from Scotland to London and establish itself firml y therein, bu t if we take this date we shall see that the Royal Order takes prece dence in antiquity of any high d egree. Bu t, in v iew of these facts, we ca nno t dismi ss lightly the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"evidence of Henry Adamson’s metrical description o f Perth, “The Muses Threnod ie,” written in 1638, p ractically a ce ntury earlier, in which h e writes : - “For we a re brethren o f the Rosie Cross We hav e the Mason’s Word, etc.” Note. - He uses the phrase “ Rosie Cross,” the e xact titl e of the 2 nd degree of the Royal Order, and adds that “We have the Mason’s Word.” Now the Royal Order purports to give its members the lost “Mason’s Word.” Therefore, if la nguage means anything, it m eans that t he brethren o f the Rosie Cross claim ed to h ave the true Mason’s Word, a c laim still m ade by the Brethren o f the Rosy Cross of the Royal Order. My firm conv iction is, therefore, that Adamson, who was a M.A. and a c lerg yman, was a member of the Royal Order of Scotland, and since the style a nd language of the ritual fits in with this period, o r with on e e ven earlier, I consider that the Royal Order goes back to that period at least. In conn ection with this it i s well t o r emember that the first record o f the initiation o f a speculative into Freemasonry in England is on the 20 th May, 1641, when Robert Moray, “General Quartermaster of the a rmi e of Scotland, ” was initiated at Newcastle by members of the Lodge of Edinbu rgh, who were with the Scottish Army, which h ad entered England in arms against King Charles. Moreover, Moray, was “Protector” of Vaughan, the famous 17 th century Rosicrucian. If therefore beyond the Craft lay a Rosicrucian Masonic Order, which could on ly be e nte red by those who h ad first qualified as Freemasons, then we ca n see a n excellent reason why Moray, who was clearly interested in Mysticism i n general, and Rosicrucianism i n particular, shou ld troub le to b e initiated into a Lodge despite the fact that the A rmy of which h e was Quartermaster - General was actually on a ca mpaign. Incidentally, these facts go clean coun ter to the theory still held b y a few students that the Royal Order was Jacobite. Indeed, the c loser one studies this Order the less ground s can o ne find for this view. In such a ca se one would n aturally look for some reference to the Martyr King him self. Be it noted this could h ave been don e with p erfect safety, for in the Prayer Book o f the Established Church o f England there was, du ring the Eig hteenth Century, a special service in memory of Charles, King and Martyr. Thus the inclusion o f r eference to the White Rose, or Charles the Martyr, could easily and safely have been worked into this ritual. Second ly, let us consider the teac hing of the d egree. Both the Old and the Youn g Pretender were Roman Catholics; we shou ld therefore e xpect that either there would b e trace s of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Roman Catholic teac hing in the ritual, o r at least that care would b e taken to avoid anything that would b e in d irect oppo siti on to the faith o f the hero o f the Jacobites. Yet, on look ing into the ritual, we find certain most significant omi ssions. There is no mention o f the “Holy Catholic” Church, no r of the “ Comm union o f Saints,” both relies of medieval days left standing int act in the Episcopal Churches of Scotland and o f England, bu t further, the ritual goes out of its way to d eclare we shall obtain salvation through Christ only, thus hitti ng at the doctrine of the Intercession o f the Saints, and even says that our salvation is by Faith alone. Now this is just one of the particular points of cleavage between Protestantism and Catholicism, for the latter always has maintained the nece ssity of f aith b eing proved b y good works. Salvation b y faith alone was one of the outstandi ng tenets of the Presbyterians, and shows clearly that t he ritual i n its present form i s Presbyterian, and emphatically so. Would men who were inventing a degree to foster the Jacobite ca use go ou t of their way to insert phrases which must wound their her o, and many of his loyal suppo rters? This aspect is further emphasized b y the fact that among all t he paraphernalia e mployed in the degrees there is neither cross nor crucifix, althou gh we find them i n o ther Masonic High Degrees. The omi ssion must be del iberate, for fr om t he nature of the ritual these emblems mi ght well have been employed. Against these facts, no word in the ritual of a pro - Jacobite nature ca n b e a ddu ced, and so I can see no reason for claimi ng these degrees were made up to h elp the Jaco bites. The degrees themselves are highly mystical, and take the ca ndidate from t he Master Mason stage, through the Old Testament, ov er the “ Bridge,” onto the second Temple, and finally trace Christ’s life a nd d eath, and show that He is the L.W. . There a re c lear trace s of that outlook on life which is called “Rosicrucian,” a nd so they are good argument for those who claim t hat Rosicrucianism did influence Freemasonry.

The writer considers that a strong probabilit y exists that there is a definite conn ection, and h as given h is reasons at considerable length i n “Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods.” It is not propo sed to go fully into this controversy in this book, since its purpose is to indicate, so far as is permi ssible, the meaning of the Degrees, rather than their history. Certain facts, ho wever, deserve to be place d on record: (1) That in England, and still m ore in Scotland, the Order, thou gh no mi nally supp ressed in 1307 et seq., d id no t suffer the merciless s laughter of its members which fell upon them i n France. Moreover, o wing to the fact that Scotland was in op en revolt against Edward II., who was s uppo sed to rule it, enforcement of the e dicts against t he Knights was quite im possible.

(3) The Charter of Transmi ssion claim s to carry on the succe ssion in France. That Charter now hangs in Mark Masons’ Hall, and if it were generally acce pted as genuine it would practically settle the matter. The fact that it anathematizes the Scotch Templars, if it i s genuine, would indicate a separate organization o f the survivors in Scotland, and therefore explain whence Scotch and English Templary derive.

In v iew of the fact that the Royal Order has its Knightly Degree of the “Rosy Cross,” these points are of special significance. The Legend o f the found ation o f the Royal Order is that Bruce, after Banno ckbu rn, created the Degree of the Rosy Cross s o as to reward those Masons who h ad assisted h im i n the battle, and conferred on them t he honou r of Knighthood. Now w e kno w that the Templar Knights, instead o f surrendering themselves to Edward II. when h e sent his commi ssioners into Scotland to arrest them, joined h is enemy, Bruce. Is it t hen no t probable that Bruce, b y the fou ndation o f this new O rder, thus rewarded these Templars and restored to them t he Knighthood which b y the a boliti on o f the old Order had lapsed? The Ritual as used to - day has und ergone drastic revision rece ntly. To give but one example, there a ppears no d oub t that the a ltar in the East is a modern innov ation, b eautiful thou gh it i s. Formerly there was only a sepulchre, and there a re still a few prece ptories where the old Ritual is permitt ed. Even in the modern Ritual m embers will recollect that they took the O. at the sepulchre, which significantly is in the C., and no t at the East. This is a matter of great im portance a s we shall see in a moment. In Scotland the Degree is divided into Novice, Esquire, and Knight. In England there a re still t hree points correspond ing to these Medieval divisions, thou gh the fact is rather slurred ov er. If we recollect (a) The Robe marks the Novice; (b) The Tunic marks the Esquire; (c) It is only the Knight who is invested with the Mantle; we shall perceive that the Ritual still bears witness to these three stages. The Cup o f Remembrance in the U.S.A. is s till drunk from an unu sual rece ptacle, and is emphatically the Cup o f Mystical Death. The Ritual of the Knight Templar, as we kno w it t o - day, h as obv iously an exoteric a nd an esoteric meaning. The e xoteric lesson, and a very good lesson too, is that the Christian soldier must have e ver before his eyes in h is s truggle with the world the prece pts of the Master - Christ. He must be a good soldier of Christ outside the doo r s of Temple; he must upho ld truth and justice, d efend the weak, and set a fine e xample of chivalrous condu ct in his daily life. In short, he must not only profess Christianity but really live it. It will t hus be seen that a ca ndidate would n eed to b e a C hristian, even if he was not definitely called upon to d efend the Christian faith - which h e is. But within this s ound practical lesson there lies a high mystical m essage. We a re taught of the Lamb who was"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"mystically slain b efore the beginning of the wor ld. We e nter as a pilgrim striving to escape from t he worldly spirit. We dedicate ourselves to Christ at the C., that is to say, in the hidden rece sses of our souls. In that hidden p lace our past li fe of sin lies dead, even as the ea rthly bod y of the Re deemer lay in the tomb. Therefore, on it we dedicate ourselves, finding that over our dead p ast rises, as it were, the figure of The Crucified. Armed with the weapon s of the Spirit we go forth on ou r spiritual journey, and after long and p ainful travels return v ictorious from our conflict with the spiritual foes of man. Note the symbolical three years, correspond ing with the three years of Christ’s life of mi nistry on Earth. But after action must come penance a nd meditation, and abov e a ll we must m edita te, no t merely on ph ysical death, bu t still m ore on that greater mystery, the mystical death; and being thus prepared, we must offer our sacrifice. Nay, more, we must be marked with the sign o f His s acrifice, bu t in Christian mysticism we a re taught that the true mystic must spiritually crucify him self, even as the Great Master physically suffered on the Cross, and this is the mystical death. Is that last incident in the life of the mystic forgotten in the Ritual of this great Order? Think it over, Brother Knights. This is veiled language, and as far as is permi ssible, I have e ndeavored to indicate that Masonic Templary has a great m ystical lesson. There a re c oun tless s mall points in the Ritual which suppo rt t his view, bu t for obv ious reasons I have omitt ed them, e.g., the gradual investiture of the ca ndidate indicates the ac quisition b y degrees of certain spiritual qualiti es. THE KN IGHTS OF MALT A. If we regard the Knights Templar as one Degree we find that the Order has two, o r possibly three Degrees in all. After the K.T. comes the Mediterranean Pass. It is now, p ractically, merely a passing Degree leading to the Malta, bu t it has a significance of its own. The sign, to b egin with, is undoub tedly old. Major Sanderson found the same sign in u se amon g the Yaos in Central Africa, and it was also kno wn and v enerated b y the Arabs. In view of the tradition conn ecting the Mediterranean Pass and the Malta Degrees with the Arabs, this fact is obv iously significant. Nor, esoterically, can we ignore the im po rtance of the serpent in conn ection with a mystical journey, and in like manner “The Sea” is a phrase well kno wn among mystics to im ply certain spiritual facts, and is always s aid to lie beyond the mystical resurrection. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"To make myself clear to non - mystic al readers, let m e a dd that m ystical death and resurrection are well recognised stages in the development of the soul of the man who, while still i n the bod y, is s triving to reac h spiritual union with God. St. Paul says that he died d aily in Christ. When we reac h the Hall i n which the degree of Malta is to b e worked, we pass certain emblems which we a re told indicate birth, life, d eath, resurrection and ascension. These are a symbolic summ ary of our whole Masonic ca reer fr om t he tim e we e ntered the Craft till t he tim e we a xe finally made a Knight of Malta. Further, resurrection is a new birth which, in itself, p resuppo ses a new life, and in the mystical world we must, like St. Paul, b e prepared to d ie daily in Christ. The Malta, then, is a Degree of mys tical, no t physical resurrection, and the fact i s emphasized b y the linking up o f the symbolical acts with the true history of the old Knights of St. John o f Malta. The symbols on the table shou ld b e studied with this key, particularly that of the galley which bo re the souls to safety thou gh it perished itself. Our bod y must one day die, bu t if we have lived aright it will bring our souls in safety to the “Islands of the Blest.” This is true whether viewed mystically, o r in regard to life in the world o f action. The Sns. u sed in this Degree a re ce rtainly old, and the Pen. most peculiar and significant. It could h ardly have been invented in the 18 th century. The Sn. in the Templar degree is shown in the room of the Visconti Venosta to which we have a lre ady referred, and in the same room are to b e seen figures making the Sn. o f the Knights of Malta. The c olour of the Templar robes are white with a red cross, i.e., the “ Blood o f the Lamb,” in which we have washed and b ecome thereby as white a s s now. But those of Malta a re black, with a white c ross: out of the black n ight of the Soul, ou t of the darkness of mystical death, the c ross of Salvation rises, no longer a c ross of suffering, bu t one of r esplendent glory. CHA PTER IX. THE REMAINING DEGREES . There still remains another Order of Christian Chivalry and its outstanding feature is that it is the only Order open to English masons which avowedly sets out to give a Christian interpretation o f the Craft and Royal Arch. The degrees which constitute this Ord er are: - (a) The Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine, and (b) The Knights of St. John and the Holy Sepulchre."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Like the Knights Templar this Order has its Head Quarters at Mark Masons’ Hall. The Knights of the Red Cross of Constantine teac h u s the well - kno wn story of how Constantine ca me to b e c onv erted, bu t the Lecture c ontains a most interesting reference to the Roman College of Architects, whom I personally regard as the direct ancestors of the Comacine Masons, from whom Freemasonry descends. I must admit , ho wever, that I shou ld require fairly strong evidence to conv ince me that Constantine him self was a member of one of the Collegia. But in any case this degree is merely a stepping stone to the really great degree of the Knights of St. John and the Holy Sepulchre. This degree a ppears to h ave c onsisted on ce of three degrees and even no w has at l east t hree “ points,” in it, thou gh these may be interpreted as correspond ing to nov ice, esquire, and kn ight. The ce remonies are solemn, dramatic a nd o f deep mystical significance, bu t their most striking feature is an attempt to explain the Craft and Royal Arch Ceremonies in a Christian sense. While not prepared to admit t hat this is the only, o r even the original inner meaning of these degrees, I do con sider that t he interpretation given is of a most i nteresting and instructive nature, and if we realize that all t hrough the mi ddle a ges Freemasonry was avowedly Christian, and d emanded o f its members belief in the e ssential doctrines of the Church, we shal l see that this interpretation is deserving of very great respect. Since those desirous of obtaining this interpretation can do so b y joining these degrees, no good pu rpose would b e served in d isclosing the points interpreted, b eyond saying that the Archi tect of the Temple is identified with Christ, and the various incidents in the history of our hero are simil arly interpreted in the light of the Christian story. The outstanding fact, however, is that here we a re definitely told that our ceremonies have a secret inner meaning and this is the only degree in English Freemasonry, o f which I am aware, which do es endeavou r to give the meaning of the Craft and Arch. The degrees enumerated up to this point are a ll t hat can b e ca lled strictly masonic which are op en to the a verage English Freemason, bu t there a re several quasi - masonic Orders, o r Societies as they are usually called, which for all practical purposes are masonic, since they require a masonic qualification, and like other masonic degrees work a ritual with special secrets. These we will now consider. QUA SI - MASONIC D EGREES . The Secret Monitor which works und er the Grand Conclave is one of the best kno wn o f these Societies, on ly Master Masons are a dmitt ed, and there a re two d egrees and a Chair"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"degree. Attached to it i s the order of the Scarlet Cord, which h as no less than seven degrees. The real object of the Secret Monitor is to strengthen the bond s of Brotherhood and enforce the principle that a Brother shou ld, whenever possible, h elp another Broth er. The Conclaves often do po ssess more warmt h than the a verage London Lodge , bu t there is not m uch inner meaning in the ce remonies and no v ery valuable lessons will be learnt from them. Of quite a different type is the Soc. Ros. in Anglia. This, like t he Secret Monitor, admit s non e but Master Masons, and its rulers are e mi nent m embers of the Craft. There a re nine degrees and the higher ones are said to b e c onferred on ly for merit. The Order always has a Lecture a t eac h o f its meetings on some a bstruse subject. The Soc. Ros., as it i s affectionately called b y its members, claim s to h ave the same objects as the Medieval Rosicrucians, and it seems probable th at there is s ome historical con nection. It is, ho wever, not the only bod y which pu ts forth this claim , even in England, bu t these a re in no sense Masonic. The Soc. Ros. is also linked with the Illustrious Order of Light which works only at Bradford, at present, and with another Order. It is not so much that these orders are und er the c ontrol of the Soc. Ros. as that the leading spirits in eac h are c losely associated with the Soc. Ros. and that the members of the Orders are derived on ly from t hat Society. CONC LUSION. Thus it will be seen that practically all t he degrees in Freemasonry have a definite lesson to teac h, and an inner meaning to their ceremonies. Some, no doub t, are more im portant than others, d egrees but the man who h as never gone beyond the Craft has still m uch to learn. He has made no real effort to recover that which was lost, and th erefore has s ignally failed to make a daily advancement in Masonic, kno wledge. If he has not tim e to take a ll the degrees, at least let him try to complete his s econd d egr ee by taking the Mark, and ob tain one a nswer to the question o f what was lost, by t aking his Royal Arch. If he has don e this, and h as gone no further, let him still avoid saying “I don ’t think much of the Higher Degrees” Until he has taken them he is in no po sition to form any kind o f opinion, and after he has don e so I feel sure that he will no longer speak slightingly of some of the greatest m ysteries of this or any Age.
