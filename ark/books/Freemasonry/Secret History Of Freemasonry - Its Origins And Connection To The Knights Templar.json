Far too often these studies have consist ed of only an iso- lated, contemporary, and literal reading of documen ts with which most students of this subject are already familiar. Symb olism, which is the capital rule of Freemasonry, has often been either systematically over- looked or cursorily addressed on the broader histor ical plane. Some scholars have even believed Freemasonry's symbolism and history to be two separate domains, while others, conversely, hav e confused symbol- ism and history, boiling down both to a single redu ction and seeking to deduce the meaning of one from the other. The veil formed by these symbols—words, figures, and signs— has concealed th e structures and realities from them. We must hasten to pay a well-deserved homage to thi s research, however, specifically to the remarkable works publi shed since 1886 by the London Study Lodge Quatuor Coronati no. 2076, w hich has brought to light a significant number of old, speci fically British docu- ments.

Their works are quite valuable for their probity, the precision of their notes, and their observations re levant to the factual study of the beginnings of Freemasonry in Great Bri tain. This intellectual harvest has encouraged me to inte nsify the search for a way to better situate the masonic institution and its origins in their gen- eral historical and structural context, especially given that the facts related to the institution are inseparable from the social context, mind- sets, and motivations surrounding it. Further, whil e modern Freemasonry has grown directly from an exclusively British fram ework, its origins and development extend far beyond Great Britain and tha t nation's history in both time and space, a fact that deserves some expl oration.

Quite often this research has led me to subject areas that might seem quite foreign to the topic at hand, such as archaeology, ethnography, sociology, law, and political economic s. History, however, is traced not only through documents, but also thro ugh reconstructing the institutions, mores, and lifestyles in the past . The historical method is, by necessity, multidisciplinary in its theories and hypotheses. Nothing can be examined in complete isolation, in a bstracto. Life is unity within diversity. I have consistently sought to gather what was scattered in order to reconstruct a living past and , consequently, one that is as close as possible to reality and truth. Setting off on my journey objectively and without a ny preconceived notions, I have had to surrender to the evidence sh owing that certain opinions expressed in what are accepted as fundamen tal works on Freemasonry are actually lacking any basis of suppo rt. Conversely, the same rectitude of thought and judgm ent led me to the opposite conclusion: that certain legends whose credibility had been greatly shaken among positivist minds were, in trut h, based on sound arguments. This is especially the case for the Temp lar origins of Freemasonry. It should be clearly stated, though, t hat this does not mean I believe modern \"speculative\" Freemasonry is a direct survival of this vanished Order.

As such, it includes an exami nation of various spheres—social, juridical, religious, and philosoph ical—that have con- ditioned these events. From a chronological perspective, the most certain sources of Freemasonry have emerged as the following: 1. The Roman collegia, the remnants of which remained in the West following invasions and survived in the East a s institutions discovered by the Crusaders at the end of the eleve nth century. 2. The ecclesiastical associations of builders formed by the bishops of the early Middle Ages, especially the Benedictin es, the Cistercians, and the Templars. 3. Trade-based freemasonry, which was born under the a egis of these associations and followed the form of lay bro therhoods or guilds. The history of Freemasonry and its origins will for m the first part of this book. In the second part, we will study the evolution of the pro- fessional organization; its purposes, both operatio nal and speculative; its initiatory and spiritualist nature; its gradual transformation from an organization of those who worked in the art of buil ding to those who engaged in a stricto sensu art of thinking and livi ng; and the creation of modern Freemasonry under the influences of and in c ircumstances con- nected to British history. The greatest common denominator that we can disting uish across the centuries, truly the millennia, is the coexiste nce and interdepend- ence of masonic objectives and a sense of the sacre d. In fact, it is the sacred that is the effective and ultimate cause of these objectives, how- ever different from one another they may appear in the various stages of their evolution. This is an exemplary illustrati on of an important truth: Faith lives only through works and works are worth only the faith that moves them."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PART 1 The Origins of Freemasonry from Ancient Times to the Middle Ages "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1 The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in Rome The Religious Character of the Ancient Corporations The corporative organization of labor goes back to distant antiquity, and associations of builders are among t he most ancient. When humans abandoned the nomadic lifestyle, they f ormed builders associations to erect durable shelters, protective ramparts, and temples in which to worship their gods. Architecture became an art—a difficult one demanding unique empirical knowledge prior to t he development of the exact sciences. In some ways builders create d the first aristocracy of jealous exclusivity whose services were indispen sable to the gradu- ally forming states. The association proved necessa ry because isolated individuals were incapable of erecting large struct ures by themselves and because this work required extensive general, t echnical, and artis- tic knowledge. Here it is necessary to make an impo rtant, preliminary observation if we truly wish to understand the hist ory of labor and trades: First and foremost, this association always had a religious basis. For the people of antiquity, every action of life w as commingled with religion. Humans considered themselves the playthin gs of higher pow- ers without whose help it was impossible to succeed at anything. Work was notably invested with a sacred nature. Oswald W irth, in Les Mysteres de l'Art Royal, translated this religious sentiment with great skill:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 5 The hunter sacrificed to the guardian spirit of the animal he sought to kill, just as prior to chopping down a tree, the carpenter won the approval of the hamadryad. The quarryman, in tu rn, would have felt he had committed a sacrilege if he began cutting into rock without beforehand obtaining the consent of Mother Earth, whom he was mutilating. This is not the entire story, be cause avoidance of inspiring the hatred of a deity corresponds only to the negative side of worship by the professions. For his labor t o be successful, the worker additionally had to ensure the positive support of the gods who dispensed the talents required. A pact was therefore nec- essary: By devoting himself body and soul to the se rvice of the deity of the particular profession, the artisan wou ld bilaterally contract sacred obligations, because by fervently s triving to do his best in the domain of art, he compelled the god of his trade to come to his aid ... So a union was therefore effect ed between the humble mortal and the god who worked through him, u sing him as an intermediary, therefore deifying the human throu gh work . . . Each trade exalted its tutelary deity . . . Rich in imagination, the ancients were able to poeticize the actions of dail y life and give their professional occupations a celestial aura. Th us were born the mysteries of the different trades. 1 The cult of the ancient builders must have been of a distinct scope, for the noblest object of their labor was the const ruction of temples in which the gods were worshipped. In addition, human dwellings had religious significance. Rituals were an indispensab le part of their con- struction. Among the Romans the home was the temple of the lares gods. This was true for all ancient peoples and sti ll survives in the tra- ditional societies of the East. \"The dwelling was n ot an object, a 'machine to inhabit': It was the Universe that man built in imitation of God's exemplary creation, the cosmogony.\" 2 The home was not merely a geometrical space; it was an existential and sacr ed place. When trade associations were indispensable, as was the case with those of the builders in ancient times, they were o f a sacerdotal nature. Among the Egyptians, the priest embodied a special branch of human knowledge. Each grade put its students through a pr edetermined series"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES of studies specific to the art or science that it p rofessed. In addition, for each novitiate degree, students were subjected to t rials of initiation the purpose of which was to ensure them a vocation and which added to the mysteries whose teaching was hidden from the pu blic. It must be assumed that architecture, like all other sciences, was taught in secret. Louis Hautcoeur writes: The first architects known in Egypt, in Asia Minor, performed sacred duties independent from their role as builde rs . . . Imhotep, who built the first large stone complex in Saqqarah , was counselor to the pharaoh Sozer (circa 3800 B.C.), but was als o priest of the god Amun. Sennemut, architect of Queen Hatseput, wa s the head of the prophets of Monthu in Armant and controller of the gardens and domains of Amun. Dherti was the director of bui ldings and a high priest. In the Louvre there are seated statues of Goudea, who was both a patesi, meaning a governor representing the gods, and an architect. . . . The architects seem to have bee n inspired by the gods they served. 3 The Books of I Kings (5:13 ff and 7:13, 14) and II Chronicles (2:14 and 4:11) inform us that in Judea during the constr uction of the Temple of Jerusalem, under the direction of master builder Hiram of Tyre and Adoniram, Solomon had 70,000 men to carry loads and 80,000 to carve the stones from the mountains, not to mention those who had managed each job, who numbered about 3,300 and gave orders to the workers. Though we have no actual historical inform ation on the sub- ject, this story reveals that among the artisans bu sy on the construction of the temple there was a professional hierarchy an d an organization, if not a corporation. In Greece, professional organizations were known as hetarias. One of the laws of Solon (593 B.C.), the text of which was preserved for us by Gaius in his De Collegiis et corporibus (Digest) , allowed the various colleges or hetarias of Athens to make rules for th emselves freely, pro- vided none of these rules went against the laws of the state. Although the sacred nature of the builders appears to have become somewhat blurred among the Greeks, it survived all the same, notably"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 7 in the legends concerning architect kings such as D adaelus, Trophonius, and Agamedes. A typical example is that of the prie sts of Dionysius or Bacchus. They were the first to erect theaters in G reece and to institute dramatic representations principally linked to wors hip of the god. The architects responsible for the construction of thes e buildings maintained a priesthood through initiation; they were called D ionysian workers or Dionysiasts. We know through Strabo and Aulu-Gelle that the Dionysiasts' organization in Teos was assigned to t hem as a residence by the kings of Pergama around 300 B.C. They had a specific initiation as well as words and signs by which they recognized one another and were divided into separate communities called synod s, colleges, or soci- eties. Each of these communities was under the dire ction of a teacher and chairmen or supervisors who were elected annual ly. In their secret ceremonies the Dionysians made symbolic use of the tools of their trade. At certain times they threw banquets during which the most skilled workers were awarded prizes. The richer mem bers gave help and assistance to the indigent and the sick. In Greece the Dionysians were organized in the same way, and Solon's legislation gave them some spe- cial privileges. 4 It is important to note that banquets have held a r eligious and sacred significance from the time of greatest antiq uity. Even the members of primitive clans gathered together to eat the sac red animal. \"They communed,\" Durkheim wrote, \"with the sacred princip le that dwelled within it and they assimilated it. . . The purpose of sacrificial banquets was to bring about communion of the believer and hi s god in one flesh in order to knit between them a bond of kinship.\" T hus we may say that dietary communion was one of the earliest form s of religion. 5 The Roman Collegia It is supremely important to establish the connecti on between operative freemasonry and the collegia artificum et fabrorum of Rome, for the collegia exerted a major influence over trade broth erhoods of the Middle Ages, which more or less directly descended from them. According to Plutarch, colleges of artisans were fo unded in Rome by King Numa Pompilius around 715 B.C. Plutarch cit es nine colleges,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES including that of the carpenters, but says nothing about masons. 6 This is explained by the fact that Roman society did not then acknowledge a very extensive division and specialization of lab or. As an example of the sociological law of the development of human so cieties, the Homeric era recognized only four specialized trades : woodworking— that is to say, the building of houses (so there ca n be no question of masons); metalworking; certified leatherworking; an d clayworking (making vases and pottery). Going through the centu ries, we find house builders falling under the term carpenters. Yet the oldest code of laws to have come down to us , the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi discovered in Susa and dating back to about 2000 B.C., reveals even in its time a certain division in the art of building. It mentions architects, carpenters, stone cutters, masons, and bricklayers, and building seems to have been the on ly art to have con- tained this degree of specialization. 7 The Roman collegia formed one of the essential part s of the consti- tution attributed to King Servius Tullius (578-534 B.C.), which remained in force until 241 B.C. This constitution is characterized by a system of organization according to centuries. It c ites three collegia, each of which formed one century: the tignarii (car penters and, conse- quently, home builders), the oerarii (workers in br onze or copper), and the tibicines (flute players) or cornicines (trumpe teers). Titus-Livy and Cicero ranked carpenters in the first and most fort unate class of citi- zens, consisting of 98 centuries (9,800 carpenters) and holding a major- ity in the cornices.* The other two collegia also b elonged to the first class of citizens. These three colleges of privileg ed artisans, endowed with political prerogatives and made up of a number of state bodies, were called upon to render the greatest service to a people who lived in an almost perpetual state of war. Were they not sol diers almost as much as they were artisans, these oerarii who forged shi elds and weapons, these cornicines whose martial fanfares called the Roman hosts to com- bat, and especially these tignarii who built, repai red, and, if necessary, maneuvered the engines of destruction such as balli sta and catapults * [This Roman term designates an elective or legisl ative assembly of the people. — Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 9 and who built the fortified walls and camps and reb uilt, always better than before, what the combatants had destroyed? Wer en't the Roman legions builders as much as they were soldiers? Ser vius Tullius himself commanded two centuries of workers as men at arms u nder the title of military companies. 8 Sometime between 67 B.C. and 64 B.C., the Julia Law abolished a certain number of collegia and sodalita (associatio ns founded on a sol- idarity of interests) because of the abuses that ha d accompanied their meddling with the comitia, namely the corruption of bureaucrats and the purchase of votes. The Julia Law, however, did exempt the college of tenuiores, or artisans who were purely professio nal. There were a number of these for the tignarii. The collegia that survived were subject to more rigorous regulation (one banquet a month at most and admin- istrative oversight). Most important, they were mad e more subordinate to the state, something that did not hinder their d evelopment. Quite the contrary: Under Alexander Severus (208-235 B.C.), t here were thirty- two collegia. By this time the collegia had become essential stat e institutions wed to strong municipal organization. During the third century these insti- tutions preserved their traditional importance but lost much of their former independence. They became cogs in the imperi al administration, albeit the most important cogs, for they were in di rect contact with the population. With the empire now an absolute monarchy, the gover nmental authority was gradually assuming the task of assuri ng not only law and order, but material prosperity as well. To do t his, it set up a vast system of social classes in such a way that all the services necessary to survival and living had sufficient personnel. The u tmost effort was made to maintain the individual authority of each m an in his duty or profession, which is how the collegia happened to b e called upon to play a role of primary importance in this system. W e will see how the lesson of this absolute and centralizing administra tion based on municipal organization and professional groups even tually inspired European sovereigns in their fight against feudalis m and in their quest to strengthen their authority at the time of the Cr usades, when they found Roman social institutions still in place in t he East."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES The Principal Collegia In the latter days of the Roman empire, Christian i nfluences brought about both a decline in slavery and the development of free labor. This labor remained completely organized under the corpo rative form of the collegia and each professional was compelled to joi n the college of his trade. The institution realized the height of its d evelopment in the fourth century. 9 At this time a distinction was made between public and private col- leges. Public colleges included all the professions that were indispensa- ble to sustaining the people: arms manufacture, hor se breeding, public transportation (naviculars), bakers, butchers, manu facturers and sup- pliers of basic construction materials such as bric ks and lumber. These trades were regarded as public services. Their memb ers called them- selves not collegiati but corporati and, if it was necessary, they were recruited from among the ranks of the condemned. An y individuals involved in these services remained so their entire lives and at no time had the right to sell their work. The other professions made up the private colleges, which were actually semi-public bodies. These included mainly the dendrophori and tignarii, artisans specializing in woodwork. The co llege of the tignarii, homebuilders, remained hugely important and was wid espread through- out the empire. Among the other colleges were the a rgentarii (bankers), the lapidarii and marmorii (various categories of s tone and marble workers), the centonarii (garment manufacturers), t he negotiares vini (wine merchants) and the medici (doctors) and profe ssori (teachers). Generally speaking, the state granted each collegiu m a monopoly on its trade. The members enjoyed certain advantage s. For instance, they were exempt from certain taxes and from being drafted for labor. It was forbidden, however, for collegiates to chang e professions under pain of surrendering all their property to the coll egium. They could sell their real estate and their slaves only to their co lleagues. Moreover, membership in a collegium was hereditary. If a memb er died with no heir capable of taking his place in the profession, then the collegium would inherit his assets."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 11 The Legal Organization of the Collegium A collegium could exist only if it had been authori zed. While members could freely question its statutes, provided they d id not contravene pub- lic order, these statutes had to be monitored and s anctioned by the state, which gave them the force of obligation. For each collegium a general list (album) of the me mbership, or col- legiate, was kept. Above the simple collegiate were the magistrates of the corporation, elected by their peers: the decuri ons (heads of ten member groups), curators, procurators, syndics, and questeurs (judges of the corporation instituted by Alexander Severus) . The effective lead- ers of the corporation, the duumviri, quinquennali, and magisti, sat above these various magistrates. Each college also included honorary members who made offerings and patrons (patroni), p rominent figures who interceded with the authorities on behalf of th e college. The organization of the college appears to have bee n quite demo- cratic. A common house (schola or maceria) was assi gned for assemblies and the installation of the college's departments. It normally had a tetrastyle (a four-sided portico) on which the coll ege rules were posted. The arca or cashbox of the community was kept there . It was in the schola, before altars or images of the gods, that s acrifices were pre- formed and where artisans of the same craft or the enthusiasts of a cult would join together in pious solidarity on certain days. One of the prin- cipal rites was the repas presided over by a magist er coenoe. There can be no doubt that these meals had religious meaning, at least originally. Their degeneration into something lesser did not oc cur until later and was one reason why the Julia Law (67-64 B.C.) limit ed their number. Professional Worship in the Collegia and the Conversion to Christianity We now return to the fundamental nature of ancient trades. Originally, as was the case in other cultures, the laws and ins titutions of Roman society were essentially based on religion. This wa s also true for the col- legia, whose activity was dominated by professional worship. It was natural—and indispensable—for each Roman col legium to have its tutelary deities, just as every family had its lares (household"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES gods). It was in this celebration of common worship that the affiliated members recognized each other—often through the emp loy of gestures, signs, and ritual touch that had a sacred and psych ological, perhaps even physiological, aspect. These signs also became the means used by members to recognize their colleagues, thereby guar anteeing the sanc- tity of craft secrets and protecting them from the profane. This neces- sity must have made itself felt in the collegia of builders who followed the legions on their campaigns. A collegium's divine protectors could be chosen by the order from almost anywhere. Often a college chose a god whose attributions were related to the daily labor of its members (for exam ple, Sylvanus, god of woods, for the dendrophori, or wood carvers). In ot her cases it might choose a deceased emperor or even a foreign deity. We know that the Romans often adopted the gods of other peoples. We can surmise what deity the Roman tignarii, or carpenters, chose for themselves by look- ing at a stone discovered in 1725 in Chichester, En gland, that bears the dedication (52 A.D.) of a temple to Minerva, goddes s of wisdom, and Neptune, god of the sea. The latter may well have b een invoked both for the protection of the tignarii, who frequently had to cross the Channel, and for the construction of boats. 10 A similar inscription dis- covered in Nice-Cimiez shows the lapidarii making a vow to Hercules, their tutelary deity.* It is also likely that the worship of Roman builder s had experienced the influence of foreign peoples because of the iti nerant nature of these artisans and the fact that the Romans benefited fro m the architectural knowledge of the Greeks, who in turn had been influ enced by the Persians, Egyptians, and Syrians. In fact, the infl uence of the Syrians must have been considerable following their signifi cant immigration into the Roman Empire, to Rome particularly, during the later years of its existence. \"It was especially in the first cent ury that the Syrian exer- cised his activities, charged with almost all the m inor crafts . . . The Syrus (Oriental in the broad sense of the term) ent ered everywhere, introducing with him the tongue and mores of his co untry.\" 11 Indeed, * For more on the symbolic myth of Hercules and its connection with builders, see my book Les Loges de Saint-Jean (Paris: Editions Dervy , 1995), 71 ff."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 13 the best propagators of Christianity in the working classes were the Syrians. \"Christianity in the third and fourth cent uries was preemi- nently the religion of Syria. After Palestine, Syri a played the greatest role in its foundation.\" 12 The community of worship and more or less religious or ritual prac- tices had the natural effect of strengthening the t ies bonding the faithful. A kind of solidarity compelled members of the same collegium to lend help and assistance to each other when life's circu mstances so dictated. One of Trajan's letters responding to Pliny in 93 A . D . establishes that the eranos (association) of Amisus, a free city of Bith ynia, concerned itself with, among other things, easing the misery of its poor members. Like some inscriptions, certain texts from the Theo dosian Code (a 483 A . D . compilation of earlier texts) reveal the germinatio n of several of the charitable institutions that spread so widel y during the Middle Ages. Law 5, for instance—de pistoribus—offers the example of a kind of adoption performed by craftsmen of certain colle gia if a colleague left any orphans upon his death. As a testament to the collegiates' rela- tionship and the charity it inspired, these colleag ues are described as brothers (fratibus suis) in an inscription of the c ollegium of Velabre from the time before Christianity. At the death of one of its members, the collegium c ould be counted on to step in to ensure honorable obsequy and to ov ersee the fulfillment of the prescribed rites. Among the Romans, the sepu lcher, intimately connected to the sacra gentilitia, or family rites, held great importance. People wanted assurance that they would not be toss ed into one of the atrocious mass graves common to that era and that t heir college would see to their funeral arrangements.Those who were bu ried together con- tracted a kind of intimate fraternity and kinship. 13 The sacred character attached to labor continued wi th the rise of Christianity and in fact was reinvigorated and reju venated by the new religion, which enabled labor subsequently to acqui re an even higher value. This effect, which is often overlooked, is o f the utmost impor- tance, for it appears in all the social and politic al upheavals that have taken place throughout the history of labor. Throug hout the centuries the Church unfailingly proclaimed and continually d eveloped this principle: Labor is the image of Divine Creation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES The influence of the Church was first felt on the e thical plane, resulting in the dignification of labor and the pro tection of the humil- iores against the powerful in institutions. The ear liest constitutions ordered that work be remunerated, and little by lit tle slavery dimin- ished and the fate of serfs gradually improved. According to the Christian concept of labor, each t rade was placed under the protection of a patron saint, who acted a s an intercessor with the power on high. Over the centuries these saints became increasingly involved with people's everyday lives. But the rela tionship between arti- san and the higher power extended much further than this. Christian religion teaches that we carry within us the divine virtues; we are, in effect, a temple for them. In following the exempla ry life shown by Christ, we are able to attain perfection and, throu gh the action of Christ within us, ensure that Christ lives. In our work we are thus a par- ticipant in the creative labor of God. For more than a millennium, this Christian truth pe rmeated more and more of human life. In the Middle Ages it becam e one of the prin- ciples of social organization. Even at the beginnin g of the fifteenth cen- tury, Fra Angelico's contemporaries would say that angels came down to paint his painting during the inspired slumber o f this incomparable Dominican monk. On the social and practical plane, it is not out of the question that traditional rites of the collegia survived during t he time of the late Empire, despite the triumph of Christianity and its transformation into the state religion. With their initiatory and sacre d value adapted to the new spirit of the age, these rites had in their fav or the strength of pop- ular custom and the people's interest in retaining them as signs of iden- tification and professional secrets. It is generall y thought that it was for reasons of this nature that early Christianity read ily adopted pagan rit- uals, symbols, and even gods, whom it made into leg endary saints. By giving these deities souls, they assured the perpet uation of the values the gods symbolically represented.* * Baronius, Annates (XXXVI): \"It was permissible fo r the Holy Church to appropriate rituals and ceremonies used by the pagans in their idolatrous worship because it regen- erated them with its consecration.\" Saint Gregory d id not wish to see these customs sup- pressed. \"Purify the temples,\" he wrote to his miss ionaries, \"but do not destroy them, for so long as the nation witnesses the survival of its former places of prayer, it will use"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Ancient Corporations: Colleges of Builders in R ome 15 The Collegia of Craftsmen in Roman Gaul Roman institutions were actually established quite easily in Gaul, as were the collegia. Specific traces of their existen ce have been detected in Nice Cimiez. Collegia were also quite numerous in P rovence and the Narbonnaise, as well as in the Lugdunaise, where th e collegia of the tig- narii and the dendrophori, closely tied to municipa l life, were located. A list of trade colleges existing before the fourth century mentions the presence of these institutions in Marseille, Aix, A ries, Vienne, Valence, Nimes, Marbonne, and Lyon. Although the collegia ap pear to have had less success penetrating northern Gaul, it can be a ssumed that colleges of craftsmen were formed in the majority of the lar ge towns in the region. In Paris, excavations beneath Notre Dame in 1715 unearthed an inscription dedicated to Jupiter by the nautoe pari siaci. It is likely important colleges of builders were also located in Lutece after Emperor Julian selected it for his dwelling and und ertook important construction there that has survived into the prese nt. These colleges must also have flourished in Treves, a rich Gallic capital; in Rhenanie, where Roman remnants are so numerous; and in the Du chy of Nassau. 14 The Collegia in Great Britain Given that modern Freemasonry can be traced directl y to British origin, there is good reason to linger more extensively on the history of the col- legia of builders in Great Britain. Several brigades of construction workers stationed with the Roman legions in the countries bordering the Rhine were s ent into Great Britain by Emperor Claudius in 43 A.D. to protect R omans from Scottish raids. Before their arrival, there were no towns or cities in this them out of habit and you will win them all the eas ier to the worship of the true God.\" This same saint said, \"The Bretons perform sacrific es and give feasts on certain days: Leave them their feasts; suppress only the sacrific es.\" We can conclude, with Eliphas Levi (Histoire de la magie, Editions de la Maisnie, 1974): \"Far from encouraging ancient superstitions . . . Christianity restored life and soul to the surviving symbols of univer- sal beliefs.\" This explains how Celtic traditions m aintained in Gaul were later to be found again in Romanesque art.

The builders collegia were charged with th e construction of camps for use by the legions.

In all places where legions established permanent camp s, these camps eventually became the core of more or less importan t cities, including York (the former Eboracum), which holds a prominent place in the his- tory of Freemasonry. This was one of the first comm unities in Great Britain to gain significance and to be promoted to the rank of a Roman city. Constant raiding from the mountains of Scotland for ced the Romans to erect huge walls in the north of Britain on three separate occasions. The first great wall was constructed by order of the general Agricola in 90 A . D . The second was built under Emperor Hadrian in 120 A.D.

In 287 A.D., Carausius, commander of the Roman flee t stationed off the coast of Belgium, rebelled and took possession of Great Britain, where he declared himself independent of Rome and a dopted the title of emperor. Fearing attack from Emperor Maximianus, he likely sought to earn the favor of the collegia, particularly the most important one, that of the builders. This is why in Veralum (the m odern Saint Albans), where he resided, Carausius, through the mediation of the Roman knight Albanus and the Greek architect Amphibolus, confirmed to the corporations their ancient privileges conferred upo n them by Numa Pompilius and Servius Tullius, who had formed them. Not only would he have abrogated the restrictions that had been en forced since the Julia Law, but he would also have added the right of spec ial jurisdiction. Freed from the power of the emperors, Carausius use d his wealth to increase the well-being of the country. He espec ially kept the collegia busy with the construction of public buildings wort hy of competing with those of other imperial residences.

It was with the aid of the Franks that the Roman general Aetius fou ght Attila in 451 on the Catalaunic Fields near Chalons. But this acc ord, born of a com- mon danger, was temporary. The Franks, both Ripuari ans (who lived south of the Rhine) and Salians (who settled north of the Rhine), grad- ually infiltrated from the Paris basin to take a pr edominant position in northern and eastern Gaul. In 464 the Ripuarians oc cupied the diocese of Treves once and for all. Following this time and lasting more than a century, Christian inscriptions disappeared in this diocese, a certain sign that the Christian—in other words, Roman—populace h ad been deci- mated, forced into exile, or reduced to the conditi on of Germanic serfs known as lites. From this point on we can no longer find any trace in these Ripurian-ruled lands of the collegia that had built the monuments in the Gallic capital of Treves. But in the regions subject to the authority of the Salian Franks, of whom Clovis became king in 481, it seems that the G allo-Romans retained their property and civil rights. Albert Es mein proposes the the- ory that during the Frankish era, corporations of c raftsmen and espe- cially merchants survived, no doubt freer than befo re, maintained by their members' common interest. In support of his o pinion he cites an allusion made by Gregory of Tours in the sixth cent ury concerning the kingdom of Austrasia.* This text may not be so defi nitive, however. The Gallo-Romans' loss of some freedoms in these re gions during the rule of Clovis, even when subsequently recovered, c asts doubt on the possibility of a complete legal continuity of the c ollegia. Additional notable facts provided by Gregory of Tou rs, however, lead to a more subtle view of matters. While the Ro man institution of the collegium disappeared, it is quite possible tha t remnants survived long afterward.

It is likely that some of these were remarkable builders who were actually aided by the Frankish kings. In 472, through the ef forts of Perpetue, or Parpet of Tours, a first-class basilica, the most b eautiful in the West, was completed to house the tomb of Saint Martin. A century later in Paris, Chidebert I (d. 558) kept masons busy on the magnificent Saint Vincent Church (now Saint Germain des Pres). In Nan tes, the bishop Felix (550-583) focused his concern on useful publi c works such as roadways, bridges, and canals, and consecrated a ca thedral that is said to have been as beautiful as Saint Martin Basilica. In his city and dio- cese, Gregory of Tours built several churches, nota bly Saint Maurice Cathedral, which was consecrated around 580.' All t his attests to the survival of not only Roman traditions, but also imp ortant associations of builders, artists, and specialists. The Fate of the Collegia among the Visigoths and Burgundians Roman institutions persisted to a great extent in t he kingdoms of the Burgundians and the Visigoths, who had established themselves in the empire as foederati and hospites (billeted mercenar ies). Roman laws continued to apply to Gallo-Roman citizens in these lands. In fact, Visgoth and Burgunidan kings had compilations of Ro man law drafted for the use of barbarian judges responsible for adj udicating among Gallo-Romans. These were the lex romana visigothoru m or the Breviary of Alaric (505-506) and the lex romana bur gundionum from the same era. This situation did not change when Clovis, in 507, with the help of the Burgundians, fought the Arian Visigoths in Voui lle, resulting in his annexation of Aquitaine and Languedoc minus the Duc hy of Septimania, which, under the hegemony of Narbonne, would remain Visigothic for two more centuries. Despite Clovis's victory, the Breviary of Alaric continued to be applied. Its clauses rema ined in practice and contributed to the formation of the law set down in central France, where it supplanted the lex romana burgundionum.

The Visigoths, who were in the Narbonnaise from 413 or 414, did not succeed in con quering Auvergne until 475, by which time they had become more than half Romanized. The Franks did not become masters of this area unti l the expedition of Thierry I in 531. Following the death of Clotaire i n 561, the region returned to the control of the Austrasian kings and , as a result, from 566 to 613 it was under the domination of the daugh ter of a Visigoth king. Queen Brunehaut shared her family's predilect ion for Latin cul- ture. In the sixth century Auvergne still possessed its own senate and Gallo-Roman bishops continued to hold sway there un til the reign of Pippin the Short. Though this king trampled and rav aged Auvergne during his bitter struggle against Aquitaine, Auver gne still had the dual advantages of the spirit of its inhabitants, who we re tenacious, organ- ized, and level-headed, and its geographic position far from major roads. More than any other region, Auvergne was pro tected from dis- tant influences and infiltrations. Roman institutions were also strongly maintained in the territory of the Burgundians after it was annexed by the Franks in 533. In fact, the Gombetta Law (517), which applied to Burgundians (w hereas the lex romana burgundionum applied only to their Gallo-Rom an subjects) was strongly influenced by Roman law.* In the Burgu ndian kingdom, we see educated families rising to assume the top p osts of the state and supply the highest dignitaries of the Church. One e xample is Enius, also known as Mummolus, a general under King Gontran. This survival of Gallo-Roman institutions in the Ro man-influenced regions south of the Loire, in the Rhone and Saone Valley, and in Auvergne in particular, allows us to presume that t he collegia survived in these areas. We can find proof of this in the bu ildings erected in these regions at that time and in the celebrity and influ ence of some of their architects. * Research has supplied evidence of the persistence of Roman legal precepts in the social life of southern Gaul (Narbonnaise and Aquitaine) u ntil the end of the seventh century.

During the following century, Agricola, bishop of C halon sur Saone (532-580), had a number of buildings erected in thi s city, including houses and a church supported by columns and decora ted with colored marble and mosaic paintings. The Gallo-Romans were not the only ones who were sk illed at building, however. The barbarians also distinguishe d themselves in the art of building, a significant fact: Toward 475 a governor of Auvergne saw to the buildi ng of Saint Julien de Brioude, with its superb columns, on the orders of King Euric. It eventually became a popular pilgrimage si te. Around 530-535, the terrible Clotaire employed Goth archit ects to build the Church of the Holy Apostles (Saint Ouen) in Rou en. This work was described as admirable by the people of the tim e. Under the reign of Clotaire's son, Launebode, the governor of Toulouse, the former Visigoth capital, guided the construction of a church dedi- cated to Saint Saturnien. According to the poet For tunatus, this project was attended to by more talent than a Roman outside of Italy would display. A large portion of the eastern ramparts of Carcassone are attributed to the Visigoths for very plausible rea- sons. And finally, there are Saint Marcel near Chal on and Saint Martin of Autun, two important buildings connected to the mem- ory of King Gontran and Queen Brunhilde. 2 The last of the Gallo-Roman provincial leaders may well have been a bishop of Cahors, Saint Didier or Gery, who died in 654. He won fame as a builder and was regarded by his contempor aries as having rediscovered the ancient mechanical system for prod ucing large cut stones, which had been abandoned during the final y ears of the empire.

Ac cording to Bede, in the year 675 Bishop Benoit of Weymouth in England w as forced to go to France to find builders capable of building in t he Roman style. 3 Toward the end of the seventh century and the begin ning of the eighth, Anglo-Saxons went to foreign lands, primarily Rome and France, to recruit those skilled in the art of building: mason s, glass workers, and other craftsmen. 4 If we assume that this art of building more Romanu m was indeed preserved in France, and that artists an d workers were there in great number and enjoyed great renown, then we c an deduce that Goth architects had Roman teachers and that associa tions still existed that had inherited the traditions of the Roman coll egia. It is also worth nothing that the influence of these associations oc curred in an era con- temporary with that of Charles Martel, who, as lege nds in France and England have it and as we shall see, played a promi nent role in the for- mation of Freemasonry. It is necessary, however, to stress that Gallo-Roma n and Goth art of that time had evolved. The basilicas of Gaul did in fact differ from those of Rome in that Goths and Visigoths introduce d Eastern influ- ences, particularly those from Egypt, Palestine, Sy ria, and Sassanid Persia.

In the absence of texts we are forced to envision the most plausible hypothesis. We can theorize that these associations were nothing more or less than Roman collegia adapted to new circumstances. Put forth by A. Esmein, this notion, which remains a doubtful explanation for th ose associations in the Frankish regions, does appear acceptable for th e regions south of the Loire, where Roman institutions persevered. These collegia, or at least their remnants, probabl y continued at least until the seventh century. At that time they were forced if not to disappear, then at least to transform. Even in land s where Roman law survived, however, it is not possible to speak of c ollegia in the strict sense of the term, for we must take into account th e social, economic, and political evolution that led to the formation o f feudal society. In the feudal world, individuals and groups must be envisi oned in light of the bonds of suzerainty and vassalage that characterize d the society of that time. There was no legal framework permitting the e xistence of autonomous professional associations. More importan t, individual freedom no longer guaranteed the work of the indepe ndent craftsman. An individual could become only a serf. The remnant s of the collegia no longer offered any refuge except that provided b y the bishops, who remained builders, and they were integrated primari ly into monasteries, which were multiplying throughout the Christian wor ld. The bishop's authority or conventual grip extended even into the cities. Withdrawing into themselves in response to the shock of inva- sions, cities had become veritable fortresses almos t everywhere. The possessions of the Church expanded there until the secular populace became a minority and urban life took on an increas ingly clerical nature. 6 All of these factors explain the formation of the monastic asso- ciations, which we will look at in chapter 3. The Fate of the Collegia in Italy In 493 the Ostrogoths became masters of all Italy. They maintained Roman laws there just as did the Visigoths and the Burgundians in their kingdoms. But when it came to the question of adaptation, the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Collegia and the Barbarian Invasions 25 Ostrogoths went even further. Not only did they lea ve the Romans their own laws, but also King Theodoric subjected his bar barian subjects to the force of Roman law at the beginning of the sixt h century. This case of assimilation by barbarian conquerors remains uni que. The reign of the Ostrogoths was temporary. In 554, Narses, Justinian's lieutenant, succeeded in driving them o ut of Italy. This liber- ation, however, was equally ephemeral. In 568, othe r Germans, the Lombards or Longobards, invaded the peninsula. The kingdom they founded lasted until it was destroyed in turn by Ch arlemagne in 774. Their conquest in 568 was not complete, however. Se veral regions of Italy escaped, including Rome, Ravenna, Venice and the south, and remained legally attached to Byzantium. Before stud ying the fate and evolution of the collegia that continued to exist i n those parts of Italy that remained free, as well as the collegia in the Eastern Empire, we need to look at what happened to them in the Lombar d kingdom. This region has left behind the memory of renowned archi tects, the comacine masters. The Comacine Masters The Lombard kingdom was divided into three classes: free men; aldions, or those who were semi-free, protected, an d represented by their superiors; and serfs, who were completely und er their superiors' subjugation. As in other countries occupied by the barbarians, Roman laws could have continued to be in effect for Roman subjects in the Lombard region, but the Edict of Rotharis abolished these laws in 643. 7 Articles 143 and 144 of this edict were dedicated t o master masons, known as magistri comacini (masters of Como). It re cognized their right to stipulate contracts and salaries, a right that belonged only to free men. We can therefore see that in 739 a certai n magister comaci- nus named Rodpert gave up one of his businesses wit hout the interven- tion of any superior, 8 despite the fact that Law 253 of the Rotharis Code forbade aldions from selling the smallest plot of l and without permission of their superior. It seems, then, that Rodpert enj oyed total freedom. We possess another document that is relevant to the magistri comacini, King Liutprand's (712-744) Memoratorium i n eight articles."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES This text underscores the importance of these maste r masons. It com- mands the magister who leaves his land, whatever th e nature of the job, to return there within three years, and if illness makes it impossible for him to comply, then at the very least he must send news. If he fails to comply with this legal obligation, his property is transferred to his fam- ily or, if he has no family, to the Royal Court, as though he were dead. It so happens that Law 224 in the Rotharis Code sti pulates that the goods of the free man who dies leaving no heir are bequeathed only to the Royal Court, so it is quite clear that in King Liutprand's mind, the traveling magister comacinus was considered a free man, entirely his own master.* The question that arises is whether these magistri comacini—who were free men, unlike other craftsmen classified as serfs—were grouped in a corporation similar to a collegium. Without he sitation we can answer in the affirmative. First, it is quite likel y that the maintenance of a particular tradition and art during several centu ries assumes some kind of permanent organization. Second, we have an eleventh-century Lombard text that its last editor entitled Institut a regalia et ministerial Cameroe Regnum Longobardorum et Honorantioe Civitat is Papioe. 9 This text reveals that long before the communal mov ement of \"trades,\" there existed in Pavia ministeria similar to the co llegia of the late empire. Composed of free men, these ministeria enjo yed an absolute monopoly. Of course, this text makes no mention of ministeria of masons. It appears only to focus on the collegia we have described as \"public colleges.\" Still, it shows nothing less tha n that the Roman insti- tution of the collegia opificum had traveled throug h the entire Lombard era and that continuity exists between these associ ations and the cor- porations of the Middle Ages. 10 The importance attached by the Rotharis and Liutpra nd laws to the magistri comacini allow us to believe that the Lomb ards permitted * These authentic documents are well known to legal historians but are apparently unknown to historians of Freemasonry such as Knoop and Jones (Genesis of Freemasonry, Quator Coronati Lodge No. 2076, 1978, 60-61). In their opinion, the word comacinus does not derive at all from Como, bu t from the English co-mason! This logic reveals how circumspect the use of earlier wo rks can be.

As their name allows us to pre- sume, it seems that their principal seat was in the town of Como, which must have been granted certain privileges, no doubt the same enjoyed by a sanctuary. The comacine masters were recognized as particularl y skilled archi- tects. They contributed a great deal to the gradual development of architecture in northern Italy over the course of t he seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries. Nevertheless, their art hardly evo lved at all. Their churches were faithful copies of the Roman basilica , testament to the workers' knowledge of traditional rules. They did i ntroduce into their ornamentation, however, all kinds of animals and mo tifs derived from Byzantine and Eastern sources, proof of their conta cts with the Roman collegia and the Byzantine regions of Italy. They m ade particular use of the endless cord, woven into complicated designs an d known as the comacine knot. The houppe dentelee [serrated tassel ] of the Freemasons is strangely reminiscent of this decorative element . The comacines did not, however, take advantage of other Byzantine tea chings in the art of building. The Collegia in Regions of Italy Free from Lombard Rule In those regions on the Italian peninsula that were dependencies of the Eastern Empire, Roman laws remained in effect. Craf tsmen were still trained in collegia and were governed as they had a lways been. In time, the name collegia was changed to scholoe or scuole (schools), but the system and its workings did not undergo any substan tial changes. In Ravenna, capital of the Exarchat, the charters of t he tenth and eleventh centuries mention schools of merchants, butchers, a nd fishermen; and in the reformed statutes of the city (1213-1253) th ere is mention of all the other trades in general, in particular the scho ols of house roofers and the magistri lignaminum, or builders, as very a ncient institutions worthy of great protection. 11 That Roman laws always governed these schools is proof of the survival of the institution of the collegia through the ups and downs of the centuries. The same may al so be noted regard- ing the craftsmen of Venice, a city that never fell into the hands of the Lombards. 12 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES In Rome the spirit of association was quite commonp lace. The entire populace was divided into schools according to social status, nationality, duties, and professions. Each school h ad its own insignia, patron, statutes, offices, and assigned duties in t he public demonstra- tions of devotion and rejoicing. These associations were not organized solely to advance the progress of arts and trades, but also to encourage piety. Each had their own church in which to hold g atherings, common burial grounds, and the responsibility to fulfill c ertain duties in proces- sions, station displays, and other solemnities and festivals. In compen- sation, they received remuneration twice annually, at Easter and Christmas. For example, the masons of Saint Peters received eight solidi provisini and the masons of other schools received five. 13 The schools also offered charity and assistance in a variety of ways. Eventually, Roman schools of builders attained such prosperity that they were able to send a good number of their maste rs elsewhere, espe- cially to England, as we shall see. The Fate of the Collegia in Great Britain Following the invasions of the Picts, the Angles, a nd the Saxons, Roman institutions collapsed in Great Britain. It i s likely that the colle- gia, which had been so important, were not able to survive this upheaval intact. Their influence, however, could no t disappear com- pletely. It was preserved within the sect of the Cu ldees, or Colidees. The Culdees originally consisted of a community of Celtic Christians who, in order to better propagate their religion among the people of the North, retained in their doctrine a f amiliar simplicity and loyalty to autochthonous traditions that made i t understandable and accessible to all. Their name seems to be the r esult of a merger of two Latin words, colitores and Dei, which together mean Servants of God. These Culdees would have infused their doctrine int o the collegia that had been in existence from the time of Carausi us to the final depar- ture of the Romans. After the disappearance of the collegia following Britain's invasions, these Christians were forced t o seek refuge in Wales, the Orkneys, Scotland, and especially Ireland, coun tries that had never"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Collegia and the Barbarian Invasions 29 experienced Roman occupation and that medieval auth ors often referred to together as Little Scotland, Scottia Mi nor. The Culdees were the source of Celtic or \"Scottish\" art. A distinc- tive and unique style rather than the survival of R oman techniques is what is most visible in their work. In the transmission of Roman traditions it is impor tant to under- score the action of Saint Augustine, or Austin, dur ing the second evan- gelization of England, which was started by his imp etus. This country's architectural art then underwent a period of very o bvious influence of the Roman collegia, now scholoe, and that of the ar chitectural associa- tions that survived in Gaul under the Goths. Roman architects and workers built the monasteries and churches founded by Saint Augustine and also built the cathe dral of York, which was erected at the command of Edwin, the first king of Northumbria, who converted to Christianity in 627. Saint Wilfrie d built the famous Saint Andrew's Cathedral in Hexham (completed in 67 4)* and founded those of Ripon and Hagulstead among others, but it was Rome that provided the blueprints and workers to perform the labor. Saint Benoit Biscop, a Benedictine monk of Lerins who made the j ourney to Rome five times, constructed the monastery of Wearmouth more Romanum in 675. To do this, he visited Gaul in search of bu ilders and glasswork- ers whose art was unknown in England. It was the op ere Romanum (Roman work) that raised the ancient church of Cant erbury.

In 3 95, at the death of Theodosius, the empire was divided in half and C onstantinople became the capital of the Eastern Empire. Rome was hence primed for invasion and ruin. Those parts of the Western Empir e that did manage to escape barbarian invasion fell under the authori ty of the Eastern Empire and formed the Exarchat, with Ravenna as its capital. The Eastern Empire became the keeper of Greco-Roman secular traditions. It was also—perhaps even more than Rome —the seat of Christendom, for which, after all, it had been the cradle. Located at the gates to Asia, it could easily receive the teaching s of the old Eastern civ- ilizations that Sassinaid Persia had harvested and reformatted into audacious and scholarly inventions cast in gripping phrases. Byzantium and Alexandria, the other spiritual capital of Chri stianity (before it fell into Arab hands in 640), were the natural vessels o f these brilliant civilizations. Philosophical thought flowered during this time int o great syncretic Neoplatonic and Hermetic theories. It was also the acme of Roman law, the complete development of which took place in the sixth century under Emperor Justinian. Roman institutions experie nced their fullest development at this time. The collegia were no exce ption, becoming some of the principal cogs of Byzantine life. Relig ious at their founda- tions, these collegia had to transform their pious practices under Christianity's influence, but it is very likely tha t they preserved their rites and symbols, principally those connected to t heir operational secrets. Symbols remain but their interpretations c hange: This is a law of evolution. Nor is it to be doubted that Eastern influences were at work in this area as they were in others. In fact, they became so imbed-"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Collegia and the Barbarian Invasions 31 ded that several centuries later, the Crusaders had trouble recognizing their own religion among the various Christian sect s of Asia Minor. Architecture also transformed at this time. The cur ved shapes of circular churches replaced the straight lines of th e Roman basilica, and eventually the domes, each more audacious than the one built before, took on an appearance that indicated their architec ts had found mod- els among the Persian Seleucca and Ctesiphon. This period marked the birth of Byzantine art, a synthesis of Greco-Latin art and the teachings of Asia Minor, Egypt, and Syria, which themselves w ere descended from Persia. The same synthesis that took place in art and architecture also affected philosophy. Under the influence of th e collegia, Byzantine art spread throughout the empire. There was an Asia Minor school of Byzantine art (the churches of Ephesus, Sardes, and Philadelphia in the fifth century), a Syrian Byzantine art (the cathedr als of Basra and Ezra in the sixth century), and a Byzantine art of Egypt . The most powerful marvel of this architecture is Santa Sophia of Cons tantinople, which was built from 532 to 537 by Anthenius of Tralles a nd Isidorus of Miletus. Never had the genius of Rome and the East been combined in a more amazing and harmonious whole. Byzantine builders at this same time erected church es in Thessalonica, Parenzo, and Ravenna, the city where the collegia endured, and followed this with a prodigious blosso ming of monu- ments that spread throughout the entire empire: the Byzantine palaces of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries and the churches of Constantinople, Thessalonica, and Greece built in t he tenth and eleventh centuries. Because the Byzantine capital w as located at the cen- ter of the civilized world, Byzantine art could not help but wield great influence both far and wide. It was this art that l eft its imprint on the oldest structures of Christian Russia, such as Sain t Sophia in Kiev (eleventh century). Armenia and Georgia also have a n abundance of Byzantine buildings. The Arabs of Syria and Spain a nd the Christians of the West also experienced this influence. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the scholoe of the builders of V enice, which was entirely Greek with respect to mores, built a cathe dral in the purest Byzantine style in honor of Saint Mark. Works that are admirable tes- taments to Byzantine art can also be found in centr al Italy and Sicily,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"32 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES and in France, in the area of the former Visigoth k ingdom, we find the example of Saint Front of Perigueux. In the kingdom of the Franks, where the art of buil ding had disap- peared, Frankish kings, as we have seen, resorted t o hiring Visigoth architects. Later, Charlemagne was struck with admi ration for Italian monuments, which aroused his desire to have similar buildings erected in his own country, but a dearth of workers forced him to seek assis- tance from the Italians and the Byzantines. In 796, when he undertook the construction of the admirably designed Basilica of the Holy Mother of God in Aix la Chapelle (Aachen), history informs us that he gathered together for this labor master workers and laborers (magistros et opi- fices) who had the greatest renown \"this side of th e sea\" and placed at their head the extremely skilled Ansigis, abbot of the abbey of Fontanelles (abbey of Saint Wandrille). 15 The same text tells us that among the most expert workers who were laboring on the cathedral and buildings of Aix la Chapelle there were also se rfs who had been sent by their lieges. We should note this oppositio n between the masters and workers from \"this side of the sea,\" who were f ree and no doubt products of a Byzantine college, and the autochthon ous workers of servile status—proof that no association of free bu ilders existed in the Frankish kingdom. Notre-Dame of Aix la Chapelle is modeled on Italo-B yzantine structures. The role played by the Greeks in its co nstruction is reported by a fourteenth-century author who informs us that Bishop Meinwerk of Paderborn (d. 1036) had a chapel erected in the style of a similar, older monument that he claimed Charlemagne had orde red Greek craftsmen to construct per operarios groecos. 16 According to the Chronicle of Leon of Ostia (III, 2 9), Didier, abbot of Monte Cassino, ordered from Constantinople at gr eat expense mas- ters in the art of mosaic and hired them to decorat e the church. He also desired that some of the inhabitants of the monaste ry would take pains to learn that art, which was almost lost in Italy.

Is this not a Byzantine influence? Those who spread this influence were the members of the collegia of builders, keepers of the secrets of the original co llegia in Rome that were subsequently enriched with Eastern traditions. It was the lessons provided by these Byzantine collegia that formed th e basis of the indige- nous schools in various parts of the empire. Outsid e the Byzantine empire, this influence is particularly noticeable i n the regions where similar builder's associations existed: the Middle East; the parts of Italy not under Lombard control;* and those former kingdo ms of the Burgundians and Visigoths in which Roman institutio ns had not disap- peared. We will soon see how it was in these same r egions that Romanesque art first bloomed. Finally, there is one important fact that produced its own ramifica- tions: The still-thriving Byzantine collegia, with their traditions, rites, and symbols, were later discovered by the Arabs and the Crusaders, a discovery that both turned to their own advantage. * We have seen how the art of the magistri comacini betrayed a Byzantine influence, but this is secondary.

First, they contributed—and this is critical—to the preservation and transmission of the traditions and secrets of the colle- gia that had been more or less overwhelmed by the b arbarian invasions, then legally dissolved by the formation of feudal s ociety. Second, the monastery schools trained the lay masters, who, sta rting in the twelfth century, took over the brotherhoods of builders joi ntly with the ecclesi- astical masters. These brotherhoods were precursors to later trade guilds and corporations; they were able to be trans formed into these new structures when social evolution offered a lega l framework that supported this change. The history of monastic associations is primarily l inked to that of two religious orders: the Benedictine Order and its various persuasions (Cluny and Citeaux), and the Templar Order. The rol e of the Benedictines was especially prominent up to the twe lfth century. They can be credited with not only the propagation of Ro manesque art but also the birth of Gothic art. As for the Templars, initially students of the Benedictines, with whom they always maintained a co nnection, their"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 35 activity extended well beyond the time of the monas tic associations. From the twelfth century on they were involved with the organization of lay communities of builders that enjoyed specifi c franchises, earning them the name francs metiers (free craftsmen; see c hapter 6). In this chapter we will study these monastic associ ations specifi- cally. The role of the Templars, which appears to b e closely tied to the birth of operative freemasonry, will be developed i n chapters 5-7. The Formation of Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associ ations in the Goth Regions and Their Extension into the North We have seen how in England and the Frankish kingdo ms the advocates of Christianity appealed to the Roman collegia and their remnants in the Visigoth regions. This was widespread due to the fa ct that members of the collegia were regarded as the best artisans for pro pagating the faith by erecting churches in all areas where Christianity h ad spread. When their existence became incompatible with the state of the society, however, it was around the Church that new groups of builders b egan to form. As a self-contained body, the Church had retained its ow n rights. It remained subject to Roman laws. At this time, the Church did not merely represent a belief and a form of worship; it also constituted a political organization. As a veritable state, it exercised all the attribut es of one and extended its authority over all Christian countries. Its legal a nd institutional rights, combined with the zeal of faith, explain how the Ch urch became a pole of social and political attraction. As Etienne Gils on rightly argued, the Roman Empire was dead, but the Church saved its cul ture from destruc- tion and then imposed it upon the peoples of the We st. This universal role of the Church and the relative security it pro- vided were much more in evidence in and applicable to the great reli- gious orders than to the bishops, who were more oft en compelled to confront temporal requirements and whose nominal au thority stopped at the borders of their dioceses. The builders from the collegia, who, as we have see n, found refuge with the bishops, discovered themselves to be bound simply by close personal ties to these prelates.

While their for- mer status had vanished, they were better able to s urvive corporatively, preserving their practices and traditions and even their rites and secrets, which allowed them to form veritable schools whose influence often radiated quite far. The expansion of monachism appeared in the East tow ard the end of the third century. In the West it dates from the time of Jean Cassien (d. 432), founder of two monasteries in Marseilles; Saint Cesaire (470-543), a monk of Lerins, then bishop of Aries, who set down a rule for the monasteries of his regions; and especially Saint Benoit (480-547), abbot of Vicovaro and founder of Monte C assino, whose rule was imported into Gaul by his disciple, Saint Maur. The development of monasteries in sixth century Gau l, which gen- erally followed the rule of Saint Benoit, gradually moved from the cen- ter of the country to the north. At that time, eith er bishops or kings founded them. Monks were always lay individuals. During the seventh century, the high nobility (duke s and counts) multiplied their founding of monasteries. A regular clergy to attend them appeared by order of Pope Gregory I, with abbo ts serving as their heads despite the opposition of the bishops. Many a bbeys, which had become quite wealthy, were the greatest landowners in the kingdom. In Paris, the domain of Saint Germain des Pres covered 50,000 hectares and numbered some 25,000 inhabitants. Population centers grew around the monasteries as p eople settled near them in search of both protection and the poss ibility of a liveli- hood. Agriculture and all trades were practiced the re and builders were numerous, working primarily for the monks. In this world where social and legal constraints imposed immobility and attach ment to a fief, the status of the Church allowed an escape from this se rvitude. For builders it included a precious right, one that was indispen sable to the practice of their trade: the right of circulation, the freed om to travel. The most famous of the ecclesiastical architects of the Merovingian era, for his science and his virtue, both connected to his education and his role in the monastic movement, is Saint Eloi. H e was born in 588 in Cadillac, near Limoges, where he took lessons from a teacher named Abbon. He then moved to the kingdom of the Franks, where he became"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 37 the minister of King Dagobert. He designed the blue prints for several churches and monasteries (Solagnac Monastery near L imoges, a convent for nuns, and Saint Paul and Saint Martial Churches in Paris). His name is especially prominent in connection with the famo us abbey of Saint Denis (631-637). He also created superb works in go ld and silver. In eighth-century Spain, in monasteries founded by the architect and mason Saint Fructueux, there were masters who t aught theory and, if need be, directed construction. Special compartm ents were assigned to the art of decoration. 1 During the darkest hours of the Middle Ages, the mo nastery of Saint Gall in what is now Switzerland distinguished itself by the skilled teachers who flourished there. It was this monaster y that produced the monks Tutillon, Notker, Adalberne, and Durand of Ut recht. We must pause here for an observation: Our investig ation relates essentially to religious architecture, but what of civil construction? It should be noted that during these centuries there w as a considerable slowdown in the construction of significant buildin gs. Ordinary houses were built of wood, cob, and mortar made from straw and clay. From the seventh to the tenth centuries, there was a nee d to erect castles, large constructions indeed. Of course, in those years som e building special- ists, architects and sculptors still existed, but t hey were few in number and were largely itinerants. Bound to a noble, king , or archbishop, they were \"lent\" by their patron to individuals requirin g their services. Therefore, as noted earlier, a number of architectu re schools whose masters moved north to ply their trades were locate d in the former kingdoms of the Goths and Burgundians, where many R oman institu- tions endured; we have already stressed how this re gion preserved the art of building passed down by the collegia. There is perhaps no reason to seek elsewhere for the origin of the architectur al term Gothic. Today this word defines a very specific building style. I t is thought that the Renaissance Italians originally used it in complete derision. In reality, the term goes back to a much earlier time. It can b e found in the writ- ings of Fridegode, a historian who wrote in Latin i n 950. Fridegode said, in speaking of the Saint Ouen Church of Rouen ,* that it was built * As we have seen, this was built by \"Goth\" archite cts."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES in quarried stone with a kind of magnificence in th e Gothic manner: \"muro opere quadris lapidibus, manu gothica . . . o lim nobiliter con- structa.\" 2 The word Gothic continued to be used subsequently to label what we now call Romanesque art, which was later di stinguished from the new, ogival ribbed style by names such as Old G othic and New Gothic. These terms indicate with extreme precision the origin of these styles and the relationship that exists between the m. In fact, it is a mis- take to oppose the two. Romanesque Art and Monastic Associations Romanesque art of the Old Gothic style was born aft er the year 1000 in regions south of the Loire—the former Gothic Gau l. It seems fairly well established that the oldest Romanesque school was that of Auvergne. Romanesque architecture is Roman architec ture that has been refined and \"finished\": \"While a time of decad ence saw a retreat from Roman art, a more progressive era returned to it, but it was a free Roman art that had been emancipated from the yoke o f entablature. The Romanesque style was regarded as a self-evident innovation by the Roman as well as the Gothic.\" 3 Romanesque art has been labeled monastic art in opp osition to the Gothic, a secular art. It is an undeniable fact tha t the propagation of Romanesque art was the work of monastic association s, particularly the Benedictines. But there were no builders outsid e of these associa- tions. Later we will consider more closely how Goth ic art emerged and spread. The Order of Saint Benoit first contributed to the spread of the art of building through its preeminent role in the prop agation of the sci- ences. Until the tenth century, churches were prima rily built of wood. The art or science of framework construction, altho ugh complicated, is still less difficult than that of cutting and const ructing with stone. The progress of this latter method brought about the ov erall advancement of architecture. Stonecutting in fact leads to stat ics, the science of bal- ance, and mathematics is the basic element of this discipline. Toward the end of the tenth century, a man renowned for his posi- tion, character, and worth, the Benedictine Gerbert (a native of Aurillac"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 39 and, under the name of Sylvester, the first French pope) brought about great progress in science and mathematics through h is broad knowl- edge, which contributed greatly to architecture's a bility both to embel- lish and to be lighter and bolder. Gerbert had stud ied architecture with the Arabs of Spain in Cordoba and Grenada and broug ht what he had learned to his own country, where he entrusted its teaching and prac- tice to the ecclesiastical schools. Gerbert himself taught in Reims and his knowledge spread rapidly. Abbot de Fleury, Fulbert (founder of the theologica l school of Chartres), and Beranger (creator of the schools of Tours and Angers) continued Gerbert's work. Lanfranc, who moved to Fr ance from Pavia, established a monastic school at the Bec Abbey in N ormandy, which became the seat of a renaissance in the sciences an d the arts. An era of excitement in the minds of people began at this tim e, which far from being hostile to the arts, only gave added impetus to them, especially to architecture. The reading of Aristotle's metaphysic s, also brought back from Spain by Gerbert, initiated Christians into th e Pythagorean sym- bolism of numbers. Thus the symbolism of numbers an d dimensions in churches dates from this time. The Benedictine Order to which Romanesque art owes the greatest debt is definitely that of Cluny. During the twelft h century the abbey of Cluny was the center and regulator of civilization. Solely from an archi- tectural standpoint, the Cluny monks carried their art as far as the East. The churches they erected in Jerusalem and elsewher e in the Holy Land during the time of the First Crusade were Burgundia n. In this land of great relics and Byzantine art, France remained nai vely faithful to its genius. Though the Knights Templar contributed most to the spread of Eastern influences on an operational level, the Ben edictines were sub- ject to the influence of these regions, and the Rom anesque style does indeed have a Byzantine feel. The statutes from the Cluny monastery are divided i nto two books. The second volume contains the rules to be followed in founding and constructing new abbeys. According to the legislato r, among the com- partments that the body of the abbey contains, ther e should be a house 45 feet long by 30 feet wide designated to be the d welling of all those who toil on behalf of the monks. There should be an other building"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES 125 feet long by 25 feet wide intended for the gold smiths, inlayers, marbleworkers, and other artisans. The magnificence of Clunisian churches, including e xcesses of dec- orative art that lacked any symbolic meaning, shock ed Saint Bernard (1090-1152) early on. This sensitive soul, enamored of inner perfec- tion, felt it was a betrayal of the gospels to give any sops to the senses. In reforming the order of Saint Benoit, he imposed on the architects of his order a principle of total simplicity. Thus the monks of Citeaux, faithful to the spirit of the great reformer, sprea d an austere and bare style of art throughout Europe. These strict, plain churches are not sad, however, for they hold a kind of mathematical beaut y that comes from the harmony of their proportions. The prodigious and symbolic art of light was not pr oduced until the bays of churches were cunningly pierced i n coordination with the proper orientations of the entire structur e. Favorable to con- templation, these resulting buildings defy time. Th is stripped down but suggestive and magisterial layout marvelously a ssists the sensibil- ity to share in the comprehension of the liturgy. T he physical sensa- tions awakened in these structures also awaken the soul turned toward God. Gothic Art as an Evolution from the Romanesque It is important to understand that Gothic art does not oppose Romanesque art; instead it has evolved from it. Nor did it spring from the imagination of a single master; it was the grad ual and slow work of collective faculties who ripened their concept litt le by little, through implementing and modifying it. The Gothic style supplied the solution to a technic al problem that had arisen for Romanesque architects: The weight of the vault forced them to give their buildings squat proportions. Thi s problem \"inspired them to perfect their balance system, which was how they were led to the discovery of a system of intercrossed buttresse s that would carry the vault while disguising its weight; the Gothic cathe dral continues and completes the Romanesque church.\" 4 The distinctive feature of Gothic art is essentiall y the use of inter-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 41 secting ribbed arches that support the vault like a kind of armature based at the tops of the supports . In the art of building, this feature constitutes th e great discovery of the system of active stability resulting from the u se of paired vaults, like that inaugurated by the Romans, as opp osed to the sys- tem of inert stability, which emerged from the use of heavy mate- rials and monolithic beds without the lateral thrus ts used by the Greeks and Egyptians. The discovery of this miracul ous artifice was not at all the result of luck; it could have em erged only from profound causes, a kind of imperious necessity, and a series of tri- als and errors. 5 In actuality there is an art of transition characte ristic of that period of time marking the passage from the Roman and Roma nesque groined vault to the vault constructed from the crossed rib s and broken arches associated with flying buttress. This transition oc curred only in France, the country where Gothic architecture was born. In the other schools during this intermediary period there were only ble nds—\"Romano- Gothic\" monuments. It is an error to regard the broken arch or tiers-p oint as a charac- teristic innovation of the Gothic style, however. A ncient Persia, the Orient (mainly Armenia), and Muslim Spain knew it b efore the West did. The pilgrims of the end of the ninth century, the Crusaders of 1099, or those who had fought against the Moors of Cordob a in the Iberian peninsula were able to propagate it on their return . \"It was accepted by Roman architects not as a thing of beauty but as a necessity. The bro- ken-arch vault in fact had a weaker thrust than the groined vault.\" 6 Because there was technically no opposition of Goth ic art and Romanesque art, there was no opposition of Gothic a rtists and Romanesque artists. The antitheses, in their seductive clarity, are a d anger of erudition, which they compromise in seeking to overly simplify everything. Few of these are more subject to caution than the d ouble antitheses creating an absolute opposition, an incompatibility , and antagonism"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES between Gothic and Romanesque art, between secular architects and monks, the latter authors and stubborn preserve rs of Romanesque style, the former revolutionaries of the ogival style.* In fact, there were secular Romanesque architects, such as Walter Coorland, a native Englishman, who provided in the second quarter of the eleventh century the blueprints for Saint Hilai re in Poitiers. Others include Benoit, architect of Saint Eutropes de Sain tes around 1075; Gislevert, who worked on Saint Ouen in Rouen around 1100; Jean, a bourgeois of Saint Quentin in 1113; and Gervais, wh o built a cathedral in Beziers in the second half of the twelfth centur y. In any case, what is at play here is a partial appr oach to the facts. In medieval society, whether twelfth or thirteenth cen tury, Romanesque or Gothic, art in both its concept and creation was re ligious at heart. It expressed only the directives of the Church, which gave long and detailed guidelines for artists and their works, priests, an d liturgists. Nothing was left to the artists except for their skill and abil ity to execute. To dispel any misunderstandings that may linger, it should be emphasized that the Benedictines at Cluny and Citea ux were by and large the source of the Gothic style. One author, a lluding to the roughly 350 monasteries that made up the religious communit y of Citeaux in the middle of the twelfth century, suggested that \"than ks to their coloniza- tion practices ... they were the first missionaries of Gothic art. In archi- tectural technique if not in decor, though, the two branches of the order were quite opposite. The Cistercians, however, who came later, played the main role in the propagation of the Gothic styl e. They did for Gothic architecture what the monks of Cluny had done for t he Romanesque. + It is in Norman territory at the end of the elevent h century where we must search for the first manifestation of the F rench ogival rib.

Among the most ancient attempts of currently existi ng paired vaults, especially praiseworthy are the capitulary of Jumieges (1101) and the venerable apse of the church of Morienval ( Oise), which dates from around 1125 and which is the rudimentary proto type of the Gothic style. As for monuments of the transition, w e can cite the ancient Saint Benoit Chapel in the Lerin Abbey and the choir of Saint Martin des Champs in Paris, which was a priory of t he Cluny Order. The oldest of the Gothic monuments marking the end of the tran- sition is the choir of the Benedictine church of Sa int Denis, begun in 1129 under the impetus of Abbot Suger. Consecrated in 1144, ... it was the first building in which the new syst em appeared in all the potentiality of its consequences, in the ju venile vigor of its methods, in the conviction of its ambition. Its ina uguration—cele- brated in the presence of a throng of bishops and h igh dignitaries from the four corners of France, a large number of foreign prelates, and the king himself—was the ostensible and echoing sign of a major architectural event, the departure point for an enthusiasm that would prove irresistible. 7 Among the monks who were the first Gothic architect s, we can cite Hilduar and Giraud, first mentioned around 1160, th e former for the choir he designed at Saint Peters in Chartres, the latter for his nave at Saint-Benoit sur Loire. The Cistercians, too, playe d an important role. They were the first to spread the knowledge of Goth ic art throughout Italy, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. And we cannot over- look the Templars, students of the Benedictines, am ong the architects of the Romanesque-to-Gothic transition. Their church o n Fleet Street in London (1165), more or less influenced by the Templ ar Church in Paris, is in fact one of the more unusual buildings from t his transitional period. We can see, then, that there was no gap existing be tween Romanesque (or Old Gothic) art and the New Gothic.

Gothic and Romanesque also coexist ed chronologically. The first applications of the ogival rib, in Durham and Saint Denis, were coincident with the golden age of Romanesque art, a period to which the great cathedrals of the second half of the twelfth century still belong. Some still see significance in the geographical rif t between the two styles. Romanesque churches are the exception rathe r than the rule north of the Loire, in those regions where the Goth ic style first made its appearance. There are concrete reasons for the fact that the Romanesque style spread only south of the Loire: th e continuation of Roman institutions and traditions in the south, the remnants of the col- legia that existed there, and the possibility of bu ilders creating associa- tions allied with monasteries. Perhaps the best pro of may be found in Auvergne, the last of the Roman provinces and the o ne that remained faithful to the genius of Rome for the longest time . It is precisely here that the greatest Byzantine influence can be seen a nd it is here, at Limoges, that we can discover the traces of a seven th-century architec- tural school. The Romanesque school of Auvergne is one of the oldest and most characteristic of its kind. While churches covered all the lands south of the L oire, they were noticeably scarce in the north. It was impossible f or the art of building to spread in the north. We have seen how Roman institu tions came to grief in the Frankish kingdom. In addition, the capitular ies of the Garolingian kings and even the Church stood in opposition to as sociations and guilds. Building there began to blossom only when, in conju nction with the evo- lution of mores and customs, new forms of associati on became possible, exemplified by brotherhoods that included both cler ics and laypeople as their members. In northern regions, where architect ure changed slowly, artists continued to perfect Romanesque art and did not cross through it, so to speak. From this we should not conclude that the \"crossed rib\" and Gothic architecture that appeared in the Ile de Fra nce region was the spontaneous creation of that area's genius. In looking at the existence and growth of architect ural schools, we should pay specific attention to Lombardy in Italy.

The lessons of Byzantine architecture, however, although close at hand, did not make themselves felt in Lombard construction; the political separat ion between the bar- barous world of the Lombards and the Byzantine worl d of Venice and Ravenna was simply too great. But at the end of the eleventh and throughout the twelfth centuries there appeared vau lting that, unlike the round-rib vaulting found in France, was made up of square ribs that formed beneath the vault they held up—suggesting a large, branched archaic cross. An interesting French example of thi s structure, undoubt- edly of Lombard origin, is the ogival square crossi ng erected in 1178 on each of the transepts of the ancient cathedral of M aguelone, in the Herault. Another is the large, square-ribbed crossi ng on the porch of Moissac. This Lombard ribbed crossing is fairly contemporay with or appeared even a little earlier than the ribbed cros sing found in the struc- tures of northern France. But because the two style s are completely dif- ferent, neither one can be regarded as the precurso r to the other. Perhaps they may be viewed as the results of simila r research and trial and error. Perhaps the crossed ribs had been envisi oned by the Romans and employed later by the Lombards. Although Lombar d builders knew of this style at the end of the eleventh centu ry, however, and even exported it, it must be pointed out that its use re mained a limited con- struction procedure for them. Thus we cannot see in it the principle of a new architecture and get a sense of its power and prodigious future.* * The same could be said of Armenian construction. As the first Christianized region of the East, it was subject to the strong influence of Rome and Byzantium. The use of square crossed ribs, as in the Lombard model, appeared the re at the end of the tenth century in the fullness of its architectural function. It is n ot impossible that the West was familiar with it at this time. It would have adapted it to its pr inciples and existing architectural styles. Here again, we can assume the role of monks in its propagation—cf. H.

Their relation is much like that of the Roman esque and Gothic styles. Here we must acknowledge again that the ini tiative for realizing and executing works was not connected solely to the imagination and talent of artists. The Benedictines and Cistercians were generally the master builders and overseers of all work in religi ous buildings. It was on their orders and directives and through their co ordination that dif- ferent kinds of expertise were utilized as determin ed by place and cir- cumstance. It is thus both an exaggeration and a li mitation to classify architectural art simply according to geographical locale and time period. The Fratres Pontifices During the Middle Ages the erection of civic struct ures—bridges, in particular—for public use was considered a work equ al in piety to the building of churches. Religious institutions were f ormed with this pur- pose in mind, some of which have remained famous, l ike the Hospitaller congregations of the Fratres Pontifices . 8 These monks of the Benedictine Order were involved particularly wi th the construction of bridges and roadways, as well as with the defens e of travelers against the assaults of criminals, noble or common, who infested the roads at this time. The Hospitallers were establish ed in Avignon in 1177. Saint Benezet, who left his name on the bridg e made famous by song,* was one of the most renowned of these pontif f friars. The con- struction of regional bridges such as those of Bomp as (which earned a congratulatory bull from Pope Clement III in 1189 a nd franchises from the counts of Toulouse in 1203 and 1237), Lour marin, Malemort (the name of which brings to mind the dangers faced by travelers cross- ing the Durance), Mirabeau, and Pont Saint Esprit i s attributed to them. \"In 1277 the community of Bompas, whose pri or was one * [This refers to the bridge of Avignon. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 47 Raymond Alfantim, delegated one of its members, Pie rre de Regesio, to go to the Holy See to request that it join with the Templar Order.

Over the course of three or four centuries, the Fra tres Pontifices were responsible for the construction of almost all the bridges of Provence, Languedoc, Auvergne, Brittany, Lorraine, and the Lyon region, as well as those of Ratisbonne, Dresden, Lu zern, and Prague. They were considered a religious order but accepted laypeople into their ranks. As the result of a decree enacted in 1 469, individuals belonging to the order were conferred the status of tradesmen. The Fratres Pontifices also existed in Lucca, Italy, wh ere they remained until 1590. The head of the order had the title magister meaning \"master.\" Jean de Medici was the master of the order in 1562. Monastic Associations in Great Britain and Ireland, Including the Culdees Benedictines spread throughout Great Britain under the impetus of the monk Austin or Augustine, who came from the monaste ry in Lerins. This English apostle became the first bishop of Can terbury in 596. In England, as on the Continent, the creation of build ers associations allied with monasteries was becoming quite commonpl ace. Saint Augustine himself left behind a reputation as a gre at architect. What exactly were the relations between the contine ntal Benedictines, who had traveled to Britain across th e English Channel, and the native Culdees, who had remained on their h ome soil and were very much attached to their own traditions? Are the re really grounds for maintaining, as has always been done, the exist ence of a specifically Culdeen art and architecture that would have greatl y influenced the Benedictines and their monastic brotherhoods of bui lders?

First, let us look at the specific religious elemen ts of Culdee belief. The Culdees followed a rite that was different from but not fundamen- tally at odds with the Roman rite. There are six pa rticular points on which the two differ: the date when Easter is celeb rated, the importance of the tonsure, the Episcopal consecration, baptism , the use of the Gaelic language, and the marriage of priests. There was no truly doc- trinal divergence or heresy on the part of the Culd ees, but they main- tained a spirit of independence that could and did inspire conflict. As an example, after Benedictine monks in 710 succeede d in converting the Pictish king Nectan to the Roman rite, the king the n commanded the monks of Iona to adopt the Roman date for Easter an d the Roman ton- sure. They refused, however, and were forced to lea ve their monastery and scatter throughout the mountains. Through their actions, two men—often confused with one another—have come to epitomize this Celtic Christia n community: Saint Columba (known in Ireland as Columkill) and S aint Columban. Saint Columba (521?-597) was the founder of the mon astery of Derry and, in 563, of the monastery on the isle of Iona, which he trans- formed into the center of Irish Christianity and th e brotherhood of the Culdees. His missionaries evangelized as far afield as Iceland and Feroe and were responsible for restoring the Christian re ligion in Britain. Saint Columban (540-615), one of the fathers of the Culdeen Church, preached the Christian gospel to the Picts and the Scots. Later, in the company of twelve monks, he arrived in Franc e, where he founded the Luxeil Abbey. In 613 he also establishe d the monastery of Bobbio in Italy, where he died. Columban wrote a mo nastic rule urging asceticism. He declared the preeminence of the Roma n pontiff, but not his authority. \"The pope,\" he wrote, \"is not someon e who holds the keys to absolute truth and whose words carry the se al of the Holy Ghost. He is a bishop, a weak man whom one can advi se and rebuke. Above the authority of Rome there is the authority of the truth.\" The Culdees were connected with King Athelstan, who played a large role in the legendary history of Freemasonry. In 936 this king, in his march against the Scots, made a stop in York, w here he found the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Ecclesiastical and Monastic Associations 49 Culdeens officiating as the clergy of Saint Peter's Cathedral. He asked that they pray for his victory and consequently, on his return from a vic- torious campaign, gave them a special donation or t ithe on wheat throughout the entire diocese to aid them in their pious and charitable works. Their history also tells how Edwin, Athelstan's son , gave York a masonic charter in 926. This Celtic or Scottish (in the broad sense) Rite, pronounced by the Synod of Cashel, persisted until 1172, the date when Henry II had gained enough power to enforce its con demnation. Certainly the contributions of Celtic Christians we re significant. Historians have often stressed the importance of Ce ltic art in the early Middle Ages. Architecture, carving, and the applica tion of metals onto objects of worship were among the practices at that time. Because they are so widely reproduced, the best-known Celtic wor ks of the time remain the illuminated manuscripts that traveling I rish monks, the peregrini Scoti, transported throughout Europe. 10 With respect to architecture specifically, Dom Fern and Cabrol, in his Dictionnaire d'archeologie chretienne (Paris: L etouzy, 1924), in the article entitled \"Art celtique,\" provides a thoroug h list of the buildings constructed by the disciples of Saint Columban, suc h as the first abbeys of Jumieges and Saint Wandrille. In general, howeve r, this aspect of Celtic art, far from denoting progress, seems inste ad to represent a backward or decadent technique. Culdeen architectur e testifies to the inadequate mastery of Roman traditions by the Celts . The particularly local character of these structures may be seen as evidence of an incom- plete science. For a long time the Culdees built on ly in wood. They decried the use of stone in construction as being G allic or Roman, though this disdain of stone may have had no other cause than their own inability to utilize it competently. In additio n to the divergence of the Culdeen and Roman rites, lack of skill with sto ne was very likely the reason that compelled seventh-century missionar ies to select the Roman scholoe as their source for qualified workers . In the eighth century, the Venerable Bede recorded in his Historia Ecclesiastica that Nectan, king of the Picts, who h ad converted to the Roman rite, no longer wanted wooden churches like t hose built by Celtic architects. He asked the abbot Geolfrid (an Anglo-Saxon who"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"50 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES also followed the Roman rite) to send him architect s to build a church in the style of the Romans. Culdeen influence is much more noteworthy in orname ntal art, mainly in sculpture, many examples of which have su rvived into the present. This art greatly contributed to the transm ission of ancestral Celtic symbolism to Romanesque art, where its prese nce is quite visible. Romanesque art brings us up to the eleventh century . But with respect to earlier centuries, there is little remai ning architecture by which we can judge the Culdeen influence. Neverthel ess, it must be acknowledged that the Culdees had acquired some ren own in this field, as demonstrated by the expressions used to characte rize their works or those that followed their style: more Scotto, or \"a ccording to the Scottish Rite\"; opus Scotturum, or \"the work of the Scots\"; and even juxta morem Hibernioe nationis, or \"according to th e custom of the Irish nation.\" Most important, these phrases and the other remnant s we have looked at in this chapter attest to the survival of organized building associations with traditional roots through the cen turies of barbarian dominance."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"4 Secular Brotherhoods: The Germanic and Anglo-Saxon G u i l d s In examining the rise of secular brotherhoods and g uilds in the Middle Ages, we move into the realm of new associat ions in which pro- fessional objectives became predominant and secular elements became oriented in a technical direction. The Secular Brotherhoods The first secular brotherhoods appeared in the midd le of the twelfth century. Their appearance is connected to two inter dependent factors: the enthusiasm of faith and the communal movement. Born from vast religious and social upheavals that were then taking place, the brotherhoods first assembled with a gene ral common pur- pose of uniting all people from all trades. As thei r goals became more precise, they became more specialized in the profes sional sphere, gath- ering together individuals of the same profession, starting with trades- men, then craftsmen.

Triggered in the eleventh cen tury by precepts of the Church, this emancipation was given a general i mpetus by the Crusades at the beginning of the twelfth century, b ut the specific motives for this action in the domains of kings, du kes, counts, and barons, as well as in the realms of bishops and abb ots of monasteries throughout Europe, was an enthusiasm for Christian sentiment and the necessity of finding ways to meet expenses generate d from waging the Holy War: The richest of the serfs could buy their freedom and continue to pay rent to the nobles, their former masters, wh o could then use this money to organize their expeditions to the East. The effects of this movement varied depending upon the region. In France, serfdom disappeared utterly from the lands of the West (Brittany, Normandy, and Anjou). On the other hand, it remained quite active in southwest France and the Languedoc. In no rthern and eastern France, serfdom continued to affect almost the enti re rural populace, whereas the incidence of serfdom in the Ile de Fran ce region was quite variable. Even where it did exist, however, the con ditions of serfdom were no longer what they had been. In the ninth and tenth centuries, they were very near those of slavery, but in the th irteenth century serf- dom affected entire segments of the population and was characterized by responsibilities that benefited the serf's sovereig n lord. This kind of serf- dom did not definitively vanish until the time of t he French Revolution. The Crusades, concurrent with this broad serfdom, e ngendered a commercial cosmopolitanism that encouraged the deve lopment of a class of merchants and a kind of social and cultura l intermixing, which brought about a rebirth of ideas that we will explo re in more detail later. These phenomena set off a powerful movement toward the forma- tion of associations with the specific purposes of defense, protection, and independence. These led first to the immigratio n of tradesmen toward towns, then to the development of cities, an d eventually to the emancipation of these areas, which put the finishin g touches on the emancipation of individuals. A veritable urban revo lution was under- way. Life, activities, and knowledge that had found refuge for centuries around monasteries and castles was now concentrated in cities. This regrouping of the populace in fact inspired the for mation of law, municipal bodies, universities, brotherhoods, and g uilds to respond to"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Secular Brotherhoods: The Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Guilds 53 new economic, social, cultural, and political needs and aspirations. In France, north of the Loire River, the most remar kable and elo- quent illustration of this enormous evolution is ap parent in the con- struction of cathedrals and churches. In this era, religious sentiment asserted itself and was symbolized in monuments tha t also reflected the life and soul of the Middle Ages. These works were executed by thou- sands of volunteers sharing the same piety and pers evering together in a common effort, which strengthened the ideas of un ion and solidarity. Next in significance to all the merchants and artis ans who ensured the necessities of subsistence and daily life were maso ns and workers who built the large churches and who founded brotherhoo ds that were both mystical and corporate in nature. It was in Saint D enis between 1130 and 1140, then in Chartres in 1145, that we can first d etect the organization of these popular brotherhoods. In Chartres, history has preserved the name of one of the most skilled of the secular arch itects, Beranger, who worked on the cathedral and died in 1180. The examp le of the faithful church builders of Saint Denis and Chartres was imm ediately copied at the abbey of Saint Pierre sur Dives (Calvados) and, soo n after, throughout Ile de France and Normandy. The cathedrals of Strasbour g, Laon, Noyon, Senlis, and Soissons were cradles of similar associ ations, whose members were both ardent Christians and artists beyond comp are. In a letter of 1140 addressed by the abbot Aymon to the masons of Tuttebury in England, we have testimonies of the bu rsts of faith that animated these men.* This piece of correspondence p rovides us with * Hist. Litt. de la France par les Religteux Benedi ctines, vol. 12 (Paris: M. Paulin, 1865-1866), 356; Mabillon, Ann. Benedict., vol. 128 , (Paris: Billaine, 1668-1701), n. 67. It should be noted that the English legend places a mong the ancestors of the order a cer- tain Aymon, son of Hiram, who was the greatest of m aster masons. Should we view as a coincidence the fact that the elements of the legen d of Hiram are also present in the earlier chanson de geste, \"The Four Sons of Aymon\"? In this text we see Renaud de Montauban, who, after following a life that has been hardly ed ifying and wishing to atone for his sins, hires on to the construction of the cathedral of Co logne. His uncommon strength and dex- terity create a situation about which all the maste rs argue. But then his fellow workers become alarmed and find common cause: They fear he will spoil their trade. They plot to knock him over the head with a hammer when he is no t looking and then put his body in a sack, and throw it into the Rhine. At the time th ey customarily eat, when \"the master masons and the top workers\" leave the construction site to go to osteaux (vespers), they put their plan into operation. Their crime does not remain a secret for long, however. The fish in the Rhine, gathered together by a miracle, push up the body, now lit by three tapers. The murderers, in complete confusions, have no alte rnative but to make penitence."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"54 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES some very valuable clues: It seems that any individ ual, regardless of per- sonal status, could become a member of one of these brotherhoods. At this time, there was one in every diocese of Norman dy. An individual of proven virtue stood at the head of each one and the Most Holy Virgin was selected as the patron saint of each. In order to be accepted it was nec- essary for an individual to meet three conditions: sacramental confession, the fulfillment of whatever penitence was imposed f ollowing this confes- sion, and reconciliation with any personal enemies. When word went out about a new church to be built, the brotherhoods tr aveled in groups to the designated site. Their first concern was to for m a wall with the carts that had carried them there, and then settle inside as if it were a spiritual campground. There they spent the first night, singi ng hymns in the light cast by hundreds of torches. Once they had begun wo rk, there was not a single task, no matter how painful, to which they d id not submit with good heart and unshakable steadfastness. During wor king hours, silence and order reigned, and the time of rest was devoted to prayer, charitable acts toward the sick, and pious discourse. Abbot Ay mon began his letter like a man completely stupefied at the sight of so much abnegation among his colleagues. He described their manner of living as \"a com- pletely new kind of piety that is unknown to all th e centuries.\" Piety and fervor do not explain everything, however . These folk migrations and regroupings also implied economic, s ocial, political, and juridical causes and effects. The construction of r eligious edifices is a phenomenon that cannot be separated from the genera l context in which it occurs. Enthusiastically erected with extraordinary fervor, churches and cathedrals were not merely places of prayer. Built to the scale of their respective cities that were constructed and organiz ed around them, peo- ple gathered there to argue freely about matters th at concerned them. They were houses of the people placed under a benev olent and tutelary protection. As much if not more than the belfries, they were the centers and guarantors of freedom. Even political assemblie s concerning the life of the kingdom were held at cathedrals, notably Not re Dame of Paris, as was the case in 1302 with the famous assembly of the General Estates.

T he same was true in the traditional civilizations of ancient peoples. Each of the brotherhoods to which Abbot Aymon refer s was not yet strictly composed of artisans of one trade who had banded together to perform their profession. Instead, for work that wa s not planned in advance, brotherhoods were formed spontaneously on the construction sites themselves and were concerned with numerous a ctivities. In their composition they were often temporary or itinerant associations. Special- ization and regionalization took place as the popul ace became fixed in cities and as the cities organized around their gro wing populations. As we consider their formation, some important ques tions arise regarding these brotherhoods: Where did their peerl ess artisans and artists come from, especially in the specialized tr ades of construction, sculpture, decoration, and glasswork? Where and fro m whom had they received their training that allowed them to achiev e such heights in their work? It is obvious that the majority and the most skilled could only originally have been members of monastic associatio ns. Who else indeed would have been able to pass on the torch th at only those asso- ciated with monasteries had taken pains to keep ali ght? The secularization of monastic associations had act ually been underway for a long time in preparation for their t ransformation into independent brotherhoods when the social setting wa s ready to permit their existence. By virtue of the fact that the mon astic schools had given people an education and training from which it had derived enormous profit, the monks gradually lost their monopoly on knowledge and art. These fields had become popularized; the lay master builders, who had learned their secrets and traditions from ecclesias tics, grew greater in number until they were soon the majority. According to Springer, out of 210 artists' names found in the period spanning the ninth to the twelfth century, there are 64 monks or clerics and 146 layp eople. To be more precise, there were 20 ecclesiastical architects, 1 9 ecclesiastical sculp- tors, and 26 ecclesiastical artists as opposed to 5 5 lay architects, 61 lay sculptors, and 32 lay painters. 1 The fact remains, however, that quite often the ent repreneurs, direc- tors of construction, and teaching masters were mon ks whose intellectual and religious influence incontestably dominated the master builders."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"56 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES Jean d'Orbais, Villard de Honnecourt, and Pierre de Corbie were among those who had received their training in the school of the monks and as such, were heirs to the entire science of th eir teachers. In sharing a similar origin in monastic association s, all the lay brotherhoods respected the same religious spirit an d the same tradition. The professional rules were identical everywhere, o ften down to the last detail. The work left no room for innovation. Never theless, the status of these brotherhoods and the position of their mem bers were often quite varied depending upon their training and the means by which they had become established. Evolution had led to adapta tion of feudal law, but it had not altered the principles of this law. The brotherhoods that had emerged directly from mon astic associ- ations and that remained in the abbey's domain rema ined subject to the sovereign jurisdiction of the abbey and often conti nued to benefit from great franchises and privileges issued by the Churc h. It is within these brotherhoods that we can see the birth of the franc s metiers (free crafts- men) and freemasonry. The \"communal\" brotherhoods, on the other hand, dev eloped in the cities and became the cogs of their urban setti ngs. Despite their autonomy, they were far from holding the same exten sive franchises enjoyed by their monastic colleagues. The restricti ons imposed upon them came either from the high lord and dispenser o f justice, the city itself, or from the sovereign who took the bourgeoi sie of the town under his protection in order to fend off feudal lo rds and under his tute- lage so that they would serve his policies. In any event, the rights of these artisans never extended beyond city limits. Yet within these limits, the franchises connected t o the power and patronage of the Church were reduced to a singular degree. The local authority of the bishop and lay clergy generally re placed the spiritual and lordly supervision of the monks, which had serv ed as a guarantee for territorial universalism. Only later, in recollection of Roman law and the in stitutions of the Roman Empire and in order to strengthen absolute mo narchy, would the royal powers in France and England attempt to g roup trades into their own communities that tended to extend over th e whole of the nation and contribute to its unification."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Secular Brotherhoods: The Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Guilds 57 The Guilds The guild constituted a legal form of association t hat allowed manual laborers to form the kinds of autonomous groups tha t had been impos- sible to maintain in the West since the annihilatio n of the collegia. Origins of the Guild The etymology of the word guild has provided fuel f or much debate. The term appears to derive either from the German v erb gelten (to be worth) or the Anglo-Saxon gylsa (worship, sacrifice ). The institution seems to have a tie to one of the m ost ancient of German customs, that of convivium. 2 Tacitus had made note of the dis- tinctive custom of the Germans to handle their most serious affairs at the table, during a time marked by the drinking of repeated toasts. Born amidst the clamor of blows and the sound of song we re fraternities whose membership was made up of warriors who had dr unk together from the cup (Minne) of friendship. A passage from the Icelandic Gisla Saga maintains that it is a duty to avenge fellow d rinkers as if they were brothers. Also notable in this regard are texts in which colleagues (Bruderschaft) unite by blending their blood and dr inking together. In the custom of convivium observed in the Roman colle gia we find these same religious and sacred elements of meals eaten t ogether. It remains to be seen how and at what time the idea s connected to the convivium became more specific and eventually l ed to the formation of legitimately constituted societies. Various theo ries have been offered on the subject of the origin of guilds. For some, t he guild owes its ori- gin to the influence of Christian ideas and fratern ity. For others, the guild was once the Roman collegia, specifically the kind imported by the apostles of the Christian faith into southern l ands, where it was sub- sequently transformed. It is quite possible that th ese two hypotheses can be reconciled by the acceptance of a third fact or: pagan traditions. The coincidence of the first manifestations of the guild and the con- quests of Christianity are especially notable in En gland. Christianity, which had been preached anew by Saint Augustine of Canterbury start- ing in 596, triumphed definitively in 655 with the victory of Bretwada Oswin, king of Northumbria, over the last pagan kin g of Mercia.

An important fact to note before we begin an overvi ew of the three different categories into which guilds fell (religi ous or social, merchant, and craftsman) is that with the advent of these ass ociations came the ability of women to gain membership in them. 3 Religious or Social Guilds The first guilds to appear were associations founde d for the purpose of either mutual defense or religious association. Thi s is the case for those cited in the laws of Ine from the end of the sevent h century. The oldest mention on the Continent of the institution of the guild (which, as it so happens, forbade their organization) is in a capitu lary issued by Charlemagne in the year 779. Despite this, there ar e sufficient grounds to deduce that guilds may have appeared initially o n British soil. The judicia civitatis Londonioe, redrafted under th e reign of King Athelstan (895-940) make reference to this institut ion: Every month the members of the guild shall assemble for a feast in which their common interests, the observation of st atutes and other similar matters shall be discussed. On the de ath of a mem- ber, each associate must offer a piece of good brea d for the salva- tion of his soul and sing fifty psalms within a mon th's time. All participants in this league shall not give allegian ce to any other; they are expected to make common cause of their aff ections and their hates and to avenge an insult given to one of their brothers as if it had been addressed to all. It is interesting to find these indications concern ing the guilds in a text dating from the time of King Athelstan, given that according to leg- end it is to the era ruled by this king that Freema sons attribute their old- est charter. It was in 926 in York that Edwin, adop ted son of Athelstan, gave a charter to the masons.

It is doubt ful that the craftsman guild was formed in the tenth century. While traces of religious and social guilds are qui te ancient, their oldest known statutes—those of the guilds of Abbots bury, Exeter, and Cambridge—date back only to the beginning of the el eventh century. These statutes offer an analogy to those described by the judicia: \"Once a year in Abbotsbury and three times a year in Exet er, the member fel- ows will gather together to worship God and their p atron saint. They will share a meal together, with one portion going to the poor. Mutual assistance will be given in the case of illness, fi re, or during a journey; the insults given by one member to another will be punished; members will attend the funeral service of a deceased colle ague.\" 4 Social guilds can also be found in Germany, and \"in Denmark they played an important role as demonstrated by this hi storic fact: Magnus, son of King Nicholas of Denmark, had killed Duke Ca nut Lavard, alderman or protector of the League of Sleswig, kno wn as a Hezlag oath-bound fraternity). In 1130 the king wished to visit Sleswig, and despite being defended by the congildi, he was mass acred with his entire retinue.\" 5 The statutes of the Danish guilds—especially those of Saint Kanut, Flensbourg, and Odense (which were written in 1200) —included clauses quite similar to those of the English guild s: right of entry, close solidarity, mandatory assistance to assemblies, a p rohibition on inter- rupting a brother (Law 33 of Flensbourg), mutual as sistance among brothers, and arbitration of other members in the e vent of a dispute among congildi.

On Ja nuary 30, 1189, the Council of Rouen banned the societies and brotherho ods of clergy and laypeople that swore an all-encompassing oath of ai d and protection to each other that could lead them to take actions tha t ran counter to canonical law and that might even lead to perjury. A century and a half later, on June 18, 1326, the Council of Avignon con demned certain fra- ternities and brotherhoods. From this action we hav e learned that these societies possessed particular insignia and a speci al language and writ- ing with which members could recognize one another. The tenets of these groups obliged members to render to each othe r aid and protec- tion in all matters and suggested that those who br oke this oath would incur punishment. With regard to leadership, they e lected a master as well as associate leaders who took the titles of ab bots and priors. These societies, composed of nobles, laypeople, and eccle siastics, were con- demned by the council as having committed all manne r of depredations against the life and property of their fellow citiz ens. 6 There are no traces of guilds like these having exi sted in Great Britain during the Saxon period. Their history begi ns with the Norman Conquest, which was ensured by the Battle of Hastin gs in 1066. Merchant Guilds and Artisan Guilds. The merchant guild is mentioned for the first time in England in a char- ter granted to the bourgeois of Burford (1087-1107) and in Flanders in both a charter given by Count Baudoin and Countess Rachilde to the Guild of Valenciennes in 1167 and one from the twel fth century approving the statutes of the Guild of Saint Omer.* The primary pur- pose of these merchant guilds was to guarantee the protection of their members and their property. * In his Description des Pays-Bas (Anvers: 1582) Gu ichardin claims to have seen docu- ments attesting that Flemish corporations were esta blished as early as 865 by Baudoin, son of Arnould the Great. There are solid grounds f or doubting this assertion."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Secular Brotherhoods: The Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Guilds 61 The first artisan guilds or trade guilds (craft gui lds) appeared in England and Normandy during the reign of Henry I (1 100-1135).

These craft guilds (made up of b akers, carpenters and builders, tailors, weavers, and so on) were fir st started as associa- tions for protection and mutual aid and gradually e xpanded until they became veritable professional corporations. The origins of the craft guilds, as for the French brotherhoods, fol- lowed a line of descent—at least indirectly—from th e collegia and monastic associations such as the Benedictines. Lik e their earlier coun- terparts, merchant and craft guilds were important cogs in the emanci- pation of cities. The case has even been made that municipal governing bodies and merchant guilds were one and the same fr om the very beginning. In fact, in the town of Saint Omer the m erchant guild went on to become the commune.* In the second half of the twelfth century, London m ay not yet have had a builders guild. In fact, we know that craftsm en and artists capa- ble of building in stone were few in number in that city. In chapter 5 we will learn that in order to build their church on F leet Street, the Templars had to import an architectural brotherhood from the Holy Land and thus may well have been responsible for th e formation of the original masons guild in London. The statutes of the earliest Germanic, English, and Scandinavian guilds include precious little information on their professional hierar- chy. In the twelfth century in the Norwegian city o f Bergen, however, there existed the classic tripartite division of di scipuli (apprentices), for- muli (journeymen), and magistri (masters).

Together they drew t heir authority from the patriarch Theocletes, sixty-seventh successor o f the apostle John, for whom the Templars maintained, along with the Ho ly Virgin, a spe- cial worship. These men took the three vows of obed ience, poverty, and chastity and swore an oath to do all in their power to safeguard the roads and protect pilgrims against the attacks of b rigands and infidels. Initially the Order, which at first followed the ru le of Saint Augustine, did not expand greatly. In the ninth yea r of the order's exis- tence, however, as Guillaume de Tyr notes, \"during the council held in France at Troyes [in 1128], attended by the lord ar chbishops of Reims and Sens; their suffragans; the bishop of Albano, l egate to the apostolic see; and the abbots of Citeaux, Clairvaux (Saint Be rnard),* and Pontivy ... a rule was instituted for the new knights.\" The chronicler adds, Their affairs had prospered so well that at this ti me they had in their monastery three hundred knights, more or less , all wearing the white robe, + not including the brother servants, whose number was almost infinite.

The primary question—one t hat has always been subject to controversy—is this: Did the Templa rs wield any influ- ence over these brotherhoods and communities and, i f so, what was the nature of this influence? In this chapter we will examine: 1. The direct influence of the Templars on the art of the builders. In this sense they followed the example of religiou s communities such as the Benedictines and Cistercians. 2. The influence that the Eastern world—Byzantine and Islamic— exercised over Western civilization at the time of the Crusades and the primary role assumed by the Templars in thi s social and cultural influence, including the close ties they d eveloped to Byzantine and Muslim guilds. 3. The Templars' specific involvement in the formation in Europe of professional communities, primarily those of bui lders, which includes our discovery of the source of the francs metiers in gen- eral and operative freemasonry in particular. The Templars, Creators of the Brotherhoods of Build ers The Templars, protectors of the Holy Land and guard ians of the faith- ful, were great builders of churches and fortified buildings. The task they undertook in the areas of protection and defense evolved into a real need during the Crusades. The e arliest Crusades had very few qualified workers at their disposal. In 10 99, during the siege of Jerusalem, their efforts suffered particularly from the lack of equipment, war machines, and qualified workers. 1 In 1123, at the siege of Tyre, the Crusaders paid a king's ransom to an Armenian named Havedic to come build ballista for them. 2 On entering Tyre in 1124, the Christians greatly admired the fortifications, the solidity of the buildings and ram- parts, the height of the towers, and the elegance o f the port—proof that these kinds of works were novel to them and were re garded as revela- tions. 3 This is precisely the time when the Order of the T emplars began to extend itself throughout the Holy Land with the building of fortresses, called kraks, which can still be admire d today."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Crusades and the Templars 65 The first krak appears to have been built in 1141 i n Ibelin, between Ascalon and Jaffa. Numerous workers participated in its construction, outfitting it with four towers just like the tower of the Templars in Paris/ This project was followed in 1142 by the krak of Mo ab, or the Stone of the Desert, in Transjordania; 5 in 1143, the fortress of Geth near Lydda; and in 1144, on the shining Mount or Hill near Asca lon, a high fortress that was flanked by four towers. The local people c alled this important construction the \"white guard\" and the Latins, citi zens of the Latin states in the Holy Land, called it the \"white workm an's hut.\" 6 In 1148, the Christians, especially the Templars, u ndertook the reconstruction of ancient Gaza. \"With the buildings finished and well- kept, the Christians resolved unanimously to place the town and all the land surrounding it in care of the brothers of the Temple and granted it to them in perpetuity. The brothers, strong men who were valiant in battle, have to the present day preserved this trus t with loyalty equal to their wisdom.\" 7 The Templars fulfilled prominently and for all time this role of builders on behalf of the Crusaders. The importance of this was empha- sized a century later, in 1240, during the construc tion of the castle of Safed on the instigation of the bishop of Marseille s, Benoit d'Alignan, who had gone to Acre to visit the Templar master Ar mand de Perigord and tell him that he must at any cost build the for tification in Safed. The master of the Temple, who was ill at the time, answ ered that he did not have any money. \"Stay in bed,\" Benoit told him, \"bu t tell your brothers that it is your desire that this construction be un dertaken—I am con- vinced that the action you inspire from your bed wi ll be greater than that of any army.\" 8 In fact, the fortress was rapidly erected under th e direc- tion of the Templar Raymond de Caro.

During the time of the Council of T royes, Hughes de Payens went to London to found the first Templar ho use at Holborn Bars, and during the second half of the twelfth cen tury, the Templars built their famous chapel on Fleet Street on the ba nks of the Thames. In France, they had maintained an establishment in Paris since the reign of Louis VI the Fat, who died in 1137. The Templars devoted themselves to the laying out a nd mainte- nance of roads and the construction of bridges and hospices, which responded to their mission of protecting and facili tating journeys of the faithful to the holy sites. According to F. T. B. G avel's Histoire pit- toresque de la Franc-Maconnerie: One of the routes of Spain that comes out of the Py renees goes through Roncevaux, and ends in Lower Navarre has re tained the name of the Path of the Templars. It owed its const ruction to these knights, who, furthermore, protected travelers alon g its entire length. The Templars were given the task of maintai ning the three Roman roads that existed beyond the Pyrenees. Also attributed to them is the building of most of the bridges, hospic es, and hospitals from Rousillon all the way to Santiago of Compostel la. One cir- cumstance that should be noted, because it establis hes the rela- tionship this Order had with corporations of constr uction workers, is that the old churches in Italy that had once belonged to the Order traditionally retained the name churches della massone or della maccione [of the masons].\" 11 The Templars most certainly gained their earliest k nowledge of architecture, and consequently its trade secrets, f rom the Benedictines and Cistercians.* In fact, we have already pointed out the Romanesque Cistercian style of the basilicas built by the Crus aders in the East. The Templars behaved much as the monastic builders associations had, though their construction talent was displayed in venues beyond just churches intended to propagate the faith. The first concern of these \"warrior monks\" was the erection of construction th at could be used * The Templars recognized themselves as \"brothers a nd companions\" of the Cistercians, to whom they owed assistance and protection."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Crusades and the Templars 67 for purposes of attack and defense. Rather than bei ng assumed by the knights, who were primarily soldiers, the role of a rchitect must have fallen upon the chaplains, who were religious cleri cs, as well as upon actual specialists. Each Templar commandery, though under the orders of a single commander, was managed by a certain num ber of officers, one of whom was a master carpenter. 12 In addition to their servant brothers, the Templars also employed Christian workers who were not officially members o f the Order. These persons were sometimes Crusaders, but might also be local operatives, especially in northern Syria, where the Armenian an d Syrian population had remained entirely Christian and welcomed the Cr usaders as libera- tors.\" According to the chronicles, these workers h eld free status, rather than that of serfs, and enjoyed consideratio n beyond that accorded the simple manual laborers. Bernard the Treasurer, the continuer of Guillaume d e Tyr, recounts how in 1198 when the Christians laid siege to Beiru t, the Saracens \"emptied the castle of women, children, and weakene d individuals and sent as hostages to the land of the pagans the wive s and children of all the slaves and a carpenter they held therein, so th at these would not commit any treachery.\" Thanks to a ruse, this carpe nter made it possi- ble for the Crusaders to successfully capture the c astle. Amaury, king of Jerusalem, \"honored him greatly, giving to him and his heirs a large private income inside the castle and ensuring that his wife and children, who had been sent to the land of the pagans, were f reed.\" 14 The useless precautions of the Saracens and the honors bestowed by King Amaury on this \"carpenter\" show that this title must have concerned a man of a certain high social standing, most likely a maste r builder. Hugues Plagon, the second continuer of Guillaume de Tyr, writes that in 1253 the Saracens of Damascus came to Acre, destroyed Doc and Ricordane and captured Sidon, \"and slew eight h undred men and more, and took prisoners, including masons as well as other folk, some four hundred persons.\" 15 This quote from a contemporary underscores the regard held for the masons on the part of the C rusaders. What might have been the nature of this true crafts comm unity? Was it a monastic association formed by the Crusaders or an association of the type that then existed in the Byzantine and Islamic world?"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES The Influence of the Eastern World Byzantine Influences The Christians of the East, subjects of the Byzanti ne Empire, were still grouped in the ancient Roman collegia, keepers of t he Greco-Latin tra- ditions that had evolved through contact with the p eople of the East. These associations—particularly those of the builde rs, which had dis- appeared as legal entities in the West as a consequ ence of the barbarian invasions but of which traces and remnants still re mained in the monas- tic associations—appeared to the Crusaders as signs of progress and dispensers of valuable teachings. The Byzantines we re the first to edu- cate the Crusaders in the art of constructing war m achines. In 1137, during the siege—also a fratricide—of Antioch, Empe ror John Comnenus employed \"immense instruments of war, mach ines that hurled blocks of stone that were of enormous weight and size.\" 16 These machines were a novelty to the Crusaders, but beyon d their service dur- ing battle, they could also be used to lift the sto nes necessary to con- struct churches and fortresses. The Templars, the Crusaders' legion specializing in the building of military works, did not fail to absorb the lessons from the Byzantine collegia. Some in the Order, trained in the Cisterc ian school, were already of a mind to fraternize with the Eastern bu ilders. Byzantine lessons gave them the knowledge to erect their defe nse works and kraks. \"The Templars, always suspected of a leaning toward mysterious Eastern arts and heresies, took up the mantle of Ju stinian as represented by the degenerate fortresses in Northern Syria and, in simplifying it, served to amplify it.\" 17 When they set aside their arms and when truces in the fighting left them leisure time, the Templars, mindful of their religious vocation, turned to erecting church es dedicatd to the glory of the Lord. Like their Benedictine teachers, they first built in the Romanesque style, but here again Byzantium prev ailed and Eastern churches often served as models for those o f the Templars.

The rediscovery of the Byzantine world actual ly gave impetus to a broad and profound cultural and social movement. The contact with Byzantium established by the Crusades made it possi ble to rediscover the legal compilations, in all their originality an d potency, that the emperor Justinian applied as the foundation for his empire. It was now possible to conduct a direct and detailed study of Roman law, both public and private, and Roman institutions. The Cru sades thus revealed a vast new world rich in less tangible though enorm ously significant treasures. Teachers soon carried into other lands this new und erstanding of Roman law. Schools focusing on its teachings were f ounded in Italy and France. This rebirth became one of the most importa nt factors in the development of European civilization, not only resu lting in a great influence on the development of private law, but al so exercising a pro- found influence on public law and on the thought of Western nations. This, says A. Esmein, is a fact of the first order from both the political and scientific point of view.\" Legists of the time not only considered Roman law a s the science and law of the past. They endeavored, with deep fai th, to bring these laws back to life, to restore them to common practi ce in both institu- tional and private arenas. In France, especially, g overnment and administrative personnel were soon recruited primar ily from among these legists. This evolution reached its full flow ering under Philip the Fair, when French legists strove to reformulate the power of the Roman emperor for the king's benefit. \"The king of France is emperor in his kingdom,\" legal counselor Boutellier declare d at that time. We should recall, however, that absolute imperial powe r was also based on the strong municipal organization that had been cre ated and on the economic and social role of the collegia, both of w hich effected the policies of the king concerning cities and the trad es. In fact, the Temple took part in this game—for its own benefit, of cour se—and though it contributed to the greatness of the Order, it ultim ately abetted its downfall."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"70 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES The Influence of the Muslim World Crusaders and Templars, and through them the Wester n world, were subject to the overall influence of Byzantium and p articularly that of its secular institutions, notably the collegia. But occ urring at the same time was Islam's powerful ascendancy and its influence w as as profound as that of the Byzantine Empire. Nor was it limited to the operative plane of construction. Born from a social and practical v iewpoint, its effects overflowed widely into the speculative, intellectua l, and spiritual domains until its message was propagated, just like that of Byzantium, throughout the entire Christian West. It is important to note that there was never a cons tant state of war- fare between the the Christian and Muslim camps. In fact, a strong, neighborly relationship was created between them. T here were even alliances concluded between the two sides. The nece ssities of war led the Crusaders to profit from the divisions that exi sted among the \"infi- dels\" and to exploit the offices of one to combat t he others—so much so, in fact, that the first lessons learned from th e Muslims were prima- rily utilitarian and military. From the very beginning of the First Crusade, the F ranks reached a military understanding with the Fatimids of Egypt a gainst their com- mon enemy, the Turks. The Fatimids were far from vi ewing the Frankish invasion adversely because they deemed tha t it would stop the advance of the Turks in the direction of Egypt. Arab historian Ibn al-Athir accused the Fatimids of having summoned th e Franks into Syria in order to use them as defense against the T urks. In 1099 the Crusaders signed an accord with the emir of Tripoli , Ibn Ammar, which stipulated that they would spare the city in return for the emir's deliv- ery of three hundred pilgrims who had been held cap tive in his city; 15,000 bezants; and food, supplies, and guides. The emir even went so far as to promise the Crusaders that he would conve rt to Christianity. 20 Other alliances were similarly concluded. In 1100 a veritable modus vivendi, both political and economic, was establish ed between the Franks and the Arabs in Palestine. In 1102 the grand maste r of the Assassins (see page 74) sent an ambassador to Baldwin, King of Jer usalem.

Turkish warriors, assisted by Tur kish workers and carpenters, taught the Christians how to erect sieg e apparatuses and to assault the besieged site with machines called ston e throwers. 21 On the Christian side the Templars were always the most active artisans of these kinds of alliances. In 1129, the Templar grand master urged Baldwin II to come to an understanding with t he Ismaili Abu Fewa. Under the terms of their agreement, Baldwin e xchanged Tyre for Damascus. In fact, \"for some eighty years, the Temp lars maintained close relations with the heads of the Ismaili sect. \" 22 Similarly, in 1136 the Templars of Saint John of Acre became friends w ith the Turkish capitain Unur. In 1167, a peace treaty was concluded in Cairo betw een the Christians and the caliph of Egypt. The negotiators for the Crusaders were Hugues de Cesaree and Geoffroi, a Templar knig ht. The event was noted by Guillaume de Tyr, who recounts in dithyram bic style all the marvels that struck them with admiration in the cap ital of Egypt. During that same year, however, the Christians brok e the peace treaty and invaded Egypt on the instigation of the Hospita ller Order. \"The brothers of the Temple, whose grand master was then Bertrand de Blanquefort, wished to take no part in this expedit ion, saying that it was most unjust to wage war against a kingdom whose alliance was based on our good faith, and to misinterpret the te nor of a treaty and the sacred principles of law.\" 23 In 1187, in order to obtain the surrender of Ascalo n and other Christian strongholds, Saladin employed as negotiat ors his prisoners, Guy de Lusignan, king of Jerusalem, and Gerard de R idefort, grand master of the Templars. Though these negotiations w ent nowhere, a short time later the grand master succeeded in havi ng Gaza turned over to Saladin, who then freed his prisoners as a sign of thanks. While R. Grousset views this as a cynical transaction, perha ps this negotiation occurred in response to the needs of the day and fr om a desire to avoid the useless spilling of blood. The Greek Orthodox c ommunity of Jerusalem acted from a similar attitude, with a for tunate result: Saladin, once master of the kingdom of Jerusalem, behaved to ward the city's Christian populace with feelings of loyalty, humani ty, and chivalrous grace, which struck the Latin chroniclers with admi ration. 24 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES Bernard the Treasurer indicates in his chronicle th at in 1198 the \"Lord of the Assassins\" (the Old Man of the Mountai n) treated the Christians and their leader, Count Henri, as royalt y. The same author informs us that in 1227 the sultan Coradin, at the time of his death, entrusted his land and children to a Spanish knight who was a Templar brother. \"He was fully aware that this knight would faithfully protect his land. He had no desire to leave it to the Sarac ens, for he knew full well that they would entrust it to his brother, the Sultan of Babylon.\"* It was through the intervention of the Templars in 1243 that the Christians were able to conclude an accord with the malek of Damascus and take possession of Jerusalem. In the following years, the Franks made an alliance with the malik of Horns, al-Mansou r. The Templars made themselves noticeable by their eagerness to ar range this union. In fact, they celebrated in their strongholds to such an extent that Islamic prayers could be heard echoing beneath the roofs of their monasteries. 25 In 1247 the Templar grand master Guillaume de Sonna ce got along so well with the Turkish emirs that a chronicler wrote : \"The master of the Temple and the sultan of Egypt have made so strong a peace between them that they bled themselves together every two y ears in the same bowl.\" + When the different branches of the military, govern ed mainly by common interests, gave way to a peaceful coexistenc e, the Christians found in the Muslim world a favorable milieu and cl imate.

On the Muslim side, the princ iple artisans of this action were the Ismaili sects, particularly th e Karmates and the Assassins. The Ismaliens were a bough of the Shiite branch of Islam. Karmate propaganda, born from Ismailism, took on the form o f a large reform movement that was both social and religious in scop e. From the ninth to eleventh centuries, this movement shook the Musl im world, includ- ing Syria, Persia, India, and especially Egypt, whe re it led to the instal- lation of the Fatimid dynasty. It was in Egypt that a command center for the majority of Ismailian sects, the Dit ul Hik mat, was founded. In the social sphere, Karmatism is characterized by the organization of labor and groups of workers into professional co rporations (sinf; pi. asnaf), which seem to have been in existence since the tenth century and were connected with religious brotherhoods (tariqa; pi. turuq). It is important to note that the contemporary recollectio ns of asnafs and turuq in Shiite sects emphasize both the spirituall y and socially educa- tional value of labor. 26 The hierarchical degrees—apprentice, worker, foreman, and master—were the rule, as were the obli gation to mutual assistance and the initiatory oaths. 27 Trade secrets were gradually passed on to each grade in accordance with a legal custom (dustur), which was transmitted orally. The kinship of these professional brotherhoods with the Christianized collegia of the late Roman empire is obvious. Among their members could be found not only Arabs but con verts—mainly Christians and Jews. In lands that had become Musli m it seemed that there was some sort of transformation taking place in the various mod- els of Latin and Byzantine institutions that had su rvived. The Karmati movement, which is the source of these Muslim insti- tutions, stands out both religiously and philosophi cally in its intro- duction to Islam of basic foreign assumptions—prima rily those that were Hellenic, Neoplatonic, pseudo-Hermetic, a nd \"Sabine.\" By"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"74 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES spreading these elements through an esoteric method of initiation based on reason, tolerance, and equality, the Karmates fa cilitated ties among all races and castes.* A conversion to Ismailism is the basis for the crea tion of the broth- erhood of the Assassins: the conversion of its foun der and first grand master, Hassan Sabah, a highly educated man who was a minister of the Sultan of Isfahan.

(Sheik means \"master,\" \"teacher,\" or \"head of a brotherhood\" and \"old man\" as in a person worthy of respect.) 28 The higher adepts within the Assassins devoted thei r time to the study of philosophy in the fortress of Alamut, whic h was located in a Persian domain. When the Mongols of Kubla Khan defe ated the Assassins in the twelfth century, the victors found an immense library and an astronomical observatory there. Outside of the Holy Land, there was another region where Chris- tians had contact with Arab civilization and Ismail ian sects in particu- lar: Spain. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, an Ismaili group similar to the Assassins, the Brothers of Purity, l ived on the Iberian peninsula. We possess fifty-one treatises left by t hese brothers and know that their initiation consisted of four grades . The objective they pursued was the propagation of a philosophy inspire d by that of Aristotle with Neoplatonic interpretations.

In fact, the very first Crusade was the eleventh century Crusade in Spain, the advance post of Christianity against the Muslim world. This effort was the work of the Benedictines of Cluny. The Crusades into Spain and the Middle East served to i ntensify and expand the propagation in the West of Arab influences trig gered two centuries earlier by the initial contact between the two civi lizations. These influ- ences were especially attributable to the initiator y movements that maintained the best and most long-lasting relations with the Crusaders: those of the Karmates, Ismailians, Fatimids, Assass ins, and Brothers of Purity. It was perfectly natural that spiritual and social interpenetration would be the outcome of the extensive relationship between the two cultures. It is this extensive Arab influence, twin to that o f the Byzantine world, that prompted the first cultural and philoso phical renaissance that took place in the West during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, especially in France. Along with the rebirth of the studies of Roman law, the royal role enjoyed by theology, which had ruled as sovereign over the world of ideas and provided society with i t principal leaders, was strongly undermined. A new science was born tha t, rather than being fundamentally opposite to its theological pre decessor, was instead independent of it. This was not the science of soci ety such as the one the Romans had let loose. Despite the official resi stance of the Church, this science was a synthesis, a joining: The great renown of the Roman empire, like the wisdom of Greece or Egypt, had nev er vanished from the memory of men. The Church was the direct heir t o Rome and retained its dominance in this new world. But now n ext to the theolo- gian stood the jurist, the philosopher, and the sch olar. This conjugation, a return of authentic traditions, was the collectiv e work of the Latins (Europeans or their descendants living in the Latin States in the Holy Land), the people of the East, and the Arabs. We have seen a broad view of the role played by the Byzantine world in the growth of culture in the West. It was the Arabs, though, who reintroduced Aristotle in a form permeated with Neopythagorism and Neoplatonism. It was also the Arabs who passed on the knowledge of mathematics in general, particularly algebra and the works of Euclid."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"76 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES Nor should we overlook the considerable influence o f alchemy. This science, which took shape in the syncretic milieus of third-century Alexandria as a synthesis of Egyptian, Chaldean, Je wish, and Hellenic speculations and practices, evolved rapidly before entering Byzantium and from there the Arab world, notably in the Fatim id and Ismailian sects. It was among the Arabs in the thirteenth cen tury that Arnaud de Villeneuve, Saint Thomas, Raymond Lulle, and Roger Bacon studied alchemy, which took on considerable importance in E urope during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. We should also note that its symbol- ism is closely tied to that of philosophy and const ruction. In the architectural domain, European builders were subject to the direct influence of the Arab world. In fact, masons ' marks, those sym- bolic markings left by European masons on all their work starting at the end of the twelfth century, had been in common use throughout the East since the remote past. 29 Those in the East and Muslim Spain were familiar wi th the broken arch and the tiers point long before the Europeans. In some portions of France (especially in central France and the Midi r egion), in Spain (as seen in the portal of Santiago de Compostela and th e San Pablo del Campo Cloister in Barcelona), and in Germany, (prim arily along the banks of the Rhine), Romanesque buildings, some of which date to before the twelfth century, have architectonic form s borrowed from the Arabs. These forms, which are most often seen above compartments such as bays, doors, and windows, consist of severa l sections of circles combined in various ways. Examples are trefoil arch es and arches with multifoil festoons and two-color archstones. The ch urches of Auvergne and of the Velay, particularly the apse and tribune s of Notre Dame du Port in Clermont Ferrand and the cloister, transept , and chapels of the cathedral Notre Dame du Puy, provide some character istic examples that have inspired several imitations in the surrou nding areas.* Other examples include the triforium of the meridional tr ansept of the Cluny * Bands, archivolts, modillons a copeaus [the conso le figures that have a design element. copeaux, resembling wood shavings], multifoil porch es, and polychrome stonework give Notre Dame du Port and Notre Dame du Puy a resembla nce to the mosque in Cordova, which left such a strong impression on Emile Male ( Arts et Metiers du Moyen Age, 33 ff)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Crusades and the Templars 77 Abbey; the bell tower, the tower of the crossing of the transept, the tri- forium of the nave, and the choir of the church of La Charite sur Loire, a former Cluny priory; the bell tower of the transe pt of Saint Philbert of Tournus; the apse and transept of the cathedral of Valence; the bell tower of Saint Peter's Basilica in Vienne; the nave of the church of Champagne (Ardeche); and the multifoil portals of n umerous churches in the southern half of the former Bourges diocese. The same influences have also been detected in the dormitory of the con vent of Saint Gereon in Cologne, in the church of Saint Quirin in Neuss, in the church of the Holy Apostles in Cologne and in many of the houses of this same city, and in the church of Limburg. 30 No less curious are the borders and frames that derive from Arabic letters and that eve n carry transcriptions in Kufic of passages of the Qur'an (which can be se en in Moissac, Puy, and Saint Guilhem le Desert in the Herault region). Templars and Muslims On the Christian side, the Benedictines and Templar s played an impor- tant role in the propagation of these Muslim influe nces. Of course, the Templars, recipients of Arabic knowledge and cultur e, which they then passed on to others, did not necessarily explore th ese influences through high scientific and metaphysical speculatio n. They were pri- marily men of action, warriors and builders.* From their extensive rela- tions with Ismailian sects and Arab corporations, t he Templars were at least aware of and largely adopted—if only on an op erative plane—cer- tain Arab organization structures, rites, symbols, practices, and trade secrets. Many brother servants had already been ini tiated in their secu- lar lives to similar operative rituals. They were p articularly open to receiving this new contribution and transplanting i t to the West, where the social fabric had become propitious for its int roduction. It is a fact that the architecture of the castles a nd fortified churches built by the Templars show clear evidence of ancien t Arab lessons. \"It *The Templars were not completely uneducated, howev er. In one sermon, Jacques de Vitry speaks of \"educated brothers who the commande rs pointed in the direction of the- ological schools and secular studies\" (Marion Melvi lle, La Vie des Templiers, Paris: Gallimard, 1951, 175)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"78 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES was in the east that the Crusaders learned from the Byzantines and the Arabs the art of fortifying a castle, a millenarian art in Asia that went all the way back to ancient Assyria.\" 31 The Templar master builders and workers had to have been in contact with their Assassin colleagues, who were also great builders. These Assassins, we a re told by Guillaume de Tyr, possessed notably ten fortified c astles in the province of Tyre. 32 Going beyond simple architectural instruction, the influence of the Ismailians and the Assassins also left its mark on Templar ceremonies as well as on many of their customs. \"Ismailism cle arly seems to have been the practical model that the Templars adopted almost immediately after the formation of the Order, with respect to i ts hierarchy and the obedience to a grand master and commanders on whom the Order firmly established its discipline.\" 33 This hierarchy in fact was derived from the Pythagorians and the Egyptian mysteries. T he same could also be said about other customs and symbols that the As sassins and Templars had in common. For example, couldn't the w hite garb of both the Assassins and the Templars be modeled on that o f the disciples of Pythagoras?* It is also acceptable to believe that outside the r espective dogmas of Assassins and Templars there were flexible interpre tations of ideas and doctrines. Members of the two groups managed to mak e the transition from one faith to to another: Muslims became Christ ians and Christians became Muslims without experiencing any disorientation. There were affiliations of Ismailians and Saracen r ulers in the Temple and perhaps Templars among the Muslim brotherhoods. This becomes all the more likely given that the faith of Eastern Christians showed such distinctive features that it was almost imposs ible to discern any demarcations between these Christian sects and the derivatives of Islam. Both sides came closer to one shared ideal. The Fatimids of Cairo imagined the possibility of a peaceful universalism that was the rebirth of the thought of the pharaoh Amenhotep IV. The Tem plars echoed * We should recall that the Essenes also dressed in white linen and practiced a form of solar worship. The uniform of the Assassins consist ed of a white robe, red cap, belt, and boots. The Templars, at least the knights in the Or der, wore a white robe with a red cross on the chest.

Despite the considerable influence of the Arab worl d, however, there are no grounds for concluding that the Templa r Order underwent a secret Islamization, even if only relatively, as some are prone to think. Quite a few of the more subtle aspects of Christian ity that were not deemed suspect or condemnable before the Council of Trent became so afterward. Free thinking was not considered heresy during the Middle Ages, as can be shown by the fortunate Raymond Lull e. He spent time with Muslims, was influenced considerably by the Su fis, and sought, naturally outside of dogmas, to bring Muslims and C hristians closer together. The Templars did the same. Among all the Crusaders they were the ones, writes Gerard de Nerval in Les Illum ines, who tried to realize the broadest alliance between Eastern ideas and those of Roman Christianity. The name the \"Militia of Christ and the Temple of S olomon\" that the Templars assumed immediately after the creation of their Order was evocative not only to Christians. While i t recalled the Holy Sepulcher, it also recalled to Jews and Muslim s the Temple of Solomon (Wisdom), which was furthermore reproduced on the seal of the grand master. A sacred sanctuary, it sp oke simultane- ously to the sons of Shem, Cham, and Japhet. 34 So the reason for the condemnation of the Templars is not to be sought in a heretical deviation. In fact they were never condemned by the pope—who was satisfied with simply dissolving t he Order—but by the temporal authority. Philip the Fair could not t ake action against the Templars, a sovereign and independent religious ord er, without a con- demnation or dissolution of the Order by the Holy S ee. Dissolution was forthcoming from Rome in payment of a debt of grati tude owed the king of France. The action Philip the Fair took aga inst the Templars had nothing to do with the struggle against heresy, a p retext, at any rate, that no one believed. Nor can the trial of the Temp lars be explained simply by the greed of the king. It certainly seems that the destruction of the Order in France was justified by reasons of national politics.

The Temple was in fact a sovereign entity of great power; its domains, great in number , with their own legal, political, and social armatures, formed auto nomous enclaves inside the territory ruled by the crown. At the end of the thirteenth cen- tury, the Templars owned almost a third of Paris, a vast part of the city that escaped royal jurisdiction and authority. The jurist Guillaume de Nogaret was especially concerned with defense of th e French monarchy. His purpose was the pursuit of national unity under the sole authority of the king. It is not possible to take seriously t he accusations of heresy lodged against the Templars. It should certainly be acknowledged, how- ever, that without the destruction, or at least the weakening, of the Holy Land's Latin states, whose great strength derived n ot only from their ties to the top feudal families, but also from thei r wealth, immense domains, perpetuity and mysterious prestige, and di vine character that had no equal on earth, the French kingdom—that is, French unity— never would have prevailed.

Whether they were brother servants or lay work ers, everyone con- tributed to the construction of Templar buildings; in short, they labored for the Temple. While remaining under Templar tutel age, however, these associations soon became more independent of the Order. They expanded their field of activity by working not onl y for the Templars but also for the inhabitants of their domains, whic h continued to develop in both population and wealth. The bond tha t tied operatives to the Temple was now simply one of a manorial orde r. In this insecure time, tradesmen flocked to the commanderies, where, in addition to its powerful protection, the Temple offered to operativ es considerable advantages, including the right of asylum, the righ t of franchise, and fis- cal privileges. The Privileges of the Temple: Asylum and Franchise Like the majority of religious orders, the Templars had the privilege of asylum, meaning that they could protect those indiv iduals who sought refuge in their domains from any legal proceedings against them. One of the oldest legal documents that offers evidence of this is a papal bull from Innocent III dating from 1200 and stating that those who used violence against the colleagues and liegemen of the Temple who had entered into an area under God's truce as preached by the Church would be excommunicated. \"The Bible of the Lord of Berze,\" a poem composed d uring the early years of the thirteenth century, expresses it as follows: Dare not strike one of its knights Its Sargents nor its squires Threaten not to slay them or to the Hospital he shall flee Or to the Temple, if he can manage to do so.

The inhabitants of the Templar commanderies were al so exempted from the majority of tariffs and taxes imposed by t he king, the lord of the area, or the municipality. In Paris this is how they were able to avoid the tallage, the corvee,* and a very unpopular kind of servitude, the watch, something in which the bourgeois residents o f Paris were com- pelled to participate. The trades that benefited fr om such franchises were known as the francs metiers [free craftsmen]. Francs Metiers and Freemasonry It is perhaps within these privileged francs metier s that we should place the origin of operative or traditional freemasonry. Apparently, the term freemason was imported from England. In that countr y there are texts from 1376 and 1396 in which the word ffremasons or ffreemaseons appears for the first time. In reality, however, th e English had borrowed the term from the French language, as is evidenced by its etymology. We should not forget that under the Norman monarchs an d for three cen- turies following William the Conqueror's victory at Hastings in 1066, the official language of England was French. The ol dest statutes of English workers to have come down to us (from 1351 and 1356) were still written in French. Throughout the Middle Ages on into the Renaissance, French was also the international lang uage of crafts and the esoteric language that craftsmen used. Thus it is in France where we actually must look to find the origin of this term. 1 In the Middle Ages the word franc served not only t o qualify what was free—in opposition to that which was servile—an d what bore the mark of purity and high quality, but it also and mo re specifically desig- nated every individual or property that was exempt from manorial servitudes and laws. Thus a franc-alleu was a land completely owned as property and owing no lord any right, faith, homage , or investiture. Opposite the franc-alleu were the servile status an d the fief that made * [Corvee is the unpaid labor owed by peasants and bourgeois to their sovereign lord. —Trans. ]"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"84 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES its owner or lord a vassal to a suzerain. At the be ginning of the four- teenth century, Boutillier wrote in his Somme rural e (1, 84): \"[T]o hold as a franc-alleu is to hold land from God alone and ow e neither cens, allowance, debts, service, nor any fee; the tenant holds the land freely from God.\" In the sixteenth century the legal counselor Guy Coquille pro- claimed, \"The franc-alleu is called free because it is not in the sphere of any landed lord's influence.\" Among the different k inds of franc-alleu there was the franche-aumone, a land donated to the Church free of any charge. Because this property ceased to be feudally dependent upon a lord, its transfer could be made without the lord's conse nt. With respect to individuals, a franc homme or franc hons [free man] was not only the opposite of a serf but also t he opposite of a vil- lain. 1 This latter was free, but lived as the dependent o f a lord. The free man, although a commoner, escaped this state of dep endency. The term is found in Beaumanoir's Coutume du Pantagrue: \"A f ranc hons who is not a gentleman\". . . In the prologue to the fourth book of Pantagruel, Rabelais speaks of francs gontiers. These individua ls were most likely peasants benefiting from specific franchises. Free Archers were an order of soldiers who were onl y to serve dur- ing times of war and were created for that purpose by Charles VII in 1448: This ruler [Charles VII] commanded that the most re liable inhabi- tant in each parish of the kingdom be elected for t raining in the bow, and that this individual also be under the obl igation to fur- nish a crew . . . Each of the Archers would receive 4 pounds a month when serving in war . . . But they enjoyed a general exemp- tion from all manner of taxes or fees. It is for th is reason that they were known as Free Archers. 2 The inhabitants of towns and cities who had obtaine d charters of exemption were called the bourgeois—in other words, free men. They were, however, distinguished from the francs bourge ois \"who did not have to pay and did not pay any to the lord for any bourgeois right, and were free and quit of him,\" to use the terms employ ed by the Coutume de Berry.

It earne d its name from the notches or cuts made into the pieces of wood th at served as receipts for paid debts. Originally it was due to the suzera in lord, but later it was owed to the king. Tallage did not exist in the Temp lar commanderies. The watch, a Roman institution introduced early on in Gaul, was responsible for the surveillance of the city while it slept. In 595 King Clotaire II had established the rules for its pract ice, but Henry II sup- pressed this police service. It was reorganized by Saint Louis in 1254, and again by John II in 1364 and Francois I in 1540 , but was eliminated in 1559 by Henry II. Mandatory for all individuals to participate in until the age of sixty, the bourgeois watch had bec ome the function of guards known as the assis [seated ones], who were a ssigned specific posts. Comprising almost sixty men, they met every three weeks. The royal watch, another company maintained by the king , made daily rounds. Both watches were under the sole command of the Knight of the Watch. Only those living in the domain under th e control of the Temple were not compelled to fulfill this watch ser vice. As for those who pursued various crafts and trades, in the rural areas they were either serfs or villains, while in the towns they held the status of bourgeoisie. Free craftsmen, however, mea ning either villains or bourgeois, did not perform their trade under sim ilar conditions everywhere. As a general rule, the artisan owed tax es and allowances to the king or lord. In Paris, at the time the crafts were organized during the reign of Saint Louis, the artisan was subject t o community regula- tion. Quite often entrance into a craft was not fre e; it was necessary to purchase this right from the king.

Along with the trades performed by free men were th e free and exempted crafts performed by francs metiers, meanin g those entirely free and exempt from the majority of taxes and mand atory services. In Flanders, a land where the Templars had established some of their first and most important commanderies, the four cities of Bruges, Gand, Audenarde, and Alost, where crafts operated in fran chise, were metonymically known as the \"four free crafts.\"* One canton [adminis- trative district] in Bruges long retained the name of Franc and in 1579 it still included a jurisdiction called the Chambre du Franc de Bruges. 3 The terminology relating to the franchises of craft s and free crafts stands out in Etienne Boileau's Livre des Metiers ( 1268). As we shall see, the texts it codifies apply only in the case o f the royal provostship, meaning a unique part of Paris where free crafts we re the exception. Thus, when speaking of pewtersmiths, Boileau writes , \"Whosoever desires to be a potter in pewter in Paris can do so freely so long as he does good and loyal work.\" The same expression can be found refer- ring to some forty other crafts, among which are cu tlers, silver- and goldsmiths, smelters, tapestry makers, dyers, cloth es tailors, image mak- ers, lantern makers, button makers, saddlers, hatte rs, and bowers (or the makers of bows and arbalests). In their edition of the Livre des Metiers, Lespinasse and Bonnardot write: \"To be freely maste r of a craft is to have the right to set up an establishment and take on apprentices.\" 4 For the duke of Levis Mirepoix of the French Academ y, craftsmen who exercised freely in this way fell under the cat egory of francs metiers. \"Within the crafts,\" he writes, \"some indi viduals are 'francs,' meaning that the only requirement is that they show suitable proof of their ability to become a master. Others purchased at a set price the right to perform their trade, with this fee being d etermined by regula- tions or by the lord who allegedly holds the owners hip of the craft in question.\" 5 This does not correspond entirely to the definition of franc metiers * La Curne de Saint Palaye, Dict. hist. de l'ancien langage francais (1879), who quotes here a text by Froissart.

It is therefore easy to understand how these crafts men who were dependent on ecclesiastical jurisdictions—particula rly those who moved most often, such as masons and boatmen—could be labeled as francs when compared to the craftsmen of other lord s or of the cities. These latter, even when free, could acquire exempti ons only from their lord high justice. Their rights existed only on the sufferance of this lord and their freedom did not extend beyond the city li mits.

The king, however, especially in England, sometimes conferred more or less extensive exemption to certain crafts, gran ting them charters that encompassed all members of the same craft throughou t the entire king- dom and subjected them to the same regulations. In the fourteenth cen- tury, this was the case for the weavers, and it is possible that the Company of the Masons of London enjoyed certain pri vileges outside the city, among them more or less acknowledged suze rainty over all other guilds forming part of this trade. 7 English masonry was then known as franc-maconnerie, but the term at this time had a much more exten- sive acceptance than its original meaning. At the time when crafts communities were initially being formed, the first religious order whose abbeys gave birth t o free communities was that of the Benedictines, who for centuries ove rsaw the art of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"90 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES construction. This role and its effects on social o rganization were already in decline when existing monastic brotherho ods began trans- forming into secular confederations. The number of craftsmen, espe- cially builders, diminished considerably near Bened ictine abbeys. As we have seen, craft associations enjoyed specific exem ptions in Benedictine jurisdiction. Thus in Paris we have Saint Germain d es Pres, Saint Martin des Champs, Saint Eloi (Saint Maur), and Sai nt Magloire. Yet it does not appear that a large number of lay craftsme n benefited from this, for proof has been offered showing that the B enedictine censive districts remained sparsely populated for long peri ods of time. The religious order that appears most prominently a t the origin of the francs metiers is that of the Templars, a fact that has largely gone unnoticed.* In the jurisdiction of its commanderies , free craft was the rule, just as the bourgeois residents of Templar-co ntrolled areas were free bourgeois. In the cities where the Templars ha d establishments, a distinction can be made in the same craft between t he \"franc\" crafts- man (who were free and enjoying certain exemptions) living in the Templar's domain, and artists who were merely free who worked in other quarters and were subject to royal and manori al charges and taxes as well as to their own trade regulations. Th is was the case in Paris with respect to the masons. Clearly in this d istinction between \"franc\" craftsmen and free artists, we can seek the origin of the term francs-macon (franc-maconnerie), for with this term , the noun that labeled and distinguished the worker eventually bec ame one with the name it qualified, quite opposite to a simple free mason who did not enjoy the benefits of any exemptions. It can also be said that because of the spiritual a nd temporal auton- omy and authority of the Temple, as well as that of a large number of its commanderies spread throughout the land, the fr ancs-macons and all other free, exempt craftsmen in Templar jurisdi ction could move about freely. They enjoyed freedom of passage and w ere confident both of receiving assistance and protection everywhere a nd of their right to settle in one location and find work there. * Abbe Auber sensed this and drew some tendentious conclusions from it in his small tract, Francs-Macons du Moyen Age (Tours: 1874)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Templars, the Francs Metiers, and Freemasonry 91 The European Mastery Associations and the Templars The exemptions and privileges that craftsmen benefi ted from in Templar commanderies were particularly propitious f or increasing the Order's influence and popularity. In the troubled t imes of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the craftsmen and bo urgeois of the cities sought protection for themselves and their properti es by freeing them- selves from their cities' control, the Temple offer ed them not only asy- lum but also the model of a free professional organ ization. The status of the inhabitants of commanderies could only inspi re those outside to benefit from the same rights and to obtain their re cognition—if need be, by force—from the lords. There is no doubt that under these conditions the T emplars exer- cised, directly or indirectly, an important influen ce on the formation of craft communities. This is not to say that the acti vity of the Templars and the example they set was the sole origin of gui lds and mastery asso- ciations, whose creation was largely a response to profound political, economic, and social needs. But the Templars and th eir franchises, while they may not have been the primary cause, wer e at least a deter- minative cause. It is striking to observe that the first crafts gui lds appeared at the time and in the regions when and where the Templars were first in action and founded their earliest establishments. S uch a parallel goes beyond simple coincidence and any gratuitous hypoth esis to attribute the formation of these mastery associations to the Order. From the start of their existence as an order, the Templars held large domains in Flanders, Hainaut, Artois, and Picardy a s a result of dona- tions made by the first knights Templar such as Geo ffroi de Saint Omer. This was how such large commanderies like those of Ypres, Tournai, Bruges, Loverval, Moustier sur Sambre, Mesmin les M ons, Chantraine, Aires sur la Lys, Bailes, Arras, Abbeville, Saint Q uentin, Laon, and so forth, were created so quickly between 1130 and 114 0. The Templars owned a significant number of domains in these regi ons and their activ- ity here was intense. The construction of all major monuments in Picardy has been attributed to them. It is precisely in these northern provinces that th e first professional guilds made their appearance in the second half of the twelfth century"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"92 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIMES TO THE MIDDLE AGES (Valenciennes, 1167; Saint Omer, 1200). In fact, as we saw earlier, the importance of the francs metiers was so great in Fl anders that the four cities of Bruges, Audenarde, Gand, and Alost were c alled the \"four francs metiers.\" The exercise of crafts in franchis e was no doubt unknown in the West before the Templars introduced the free forms of craft associations that they had created earlier in the Holy Land based on Byzantine or Muslim models. It could be said tha t under the Templar influence, Flanders became the cradle for t he franc metiers. This explains and provides justification for the th eory, presented by some other authors, that freemasonry was created by the Templars in the kingdom of Jerusalem and imported from there in to Flanders and Hainaut and England as well. In England the Order received large donations, nota bly from King Henry I, and Hughes de Payans visited the country p ersonally to found a new province. 8 In London in 1154, when the commander of the Temple of London undertook construction of the Flee t Street chapel, he had at his disposal an architectural association th at had come from the Holy Land—proof that few workers in the English cap ital at that time had the qualifications necessary to realize this wo rk successfully, and that no community of masons existed there at that t ime. This builders' association from the Middle East remained in the En glish capital under Templar guidance until 1199. 9 During this time it may have become the constitutional core of the Company of Masons of Lon don. This trans- formation, which coincided with the social and poli tical evolution of that time, was achieved when the association became important enough to escape Templar tutelage and find in the guild th e legally autonomous structure its members were seeking. Indeed, the Com pany of Masons of London appears to date from the beginning of the th irteenth century. 10 The likelihood of this influence of the Templars in England is all the stronger when we consider that the Order was the be neficiary of the English kings' personal trust. Bernard Le Tresorier informs us that King Henry kept a treasury in the Temple to which he sen t large sums. The prestige of the Templars was especially great under the reign of Richard the Lionheart (1189-1199). When he took possession of the island of Cypress following his crusade with King Philip Augu stus of France, he commanded the Templars to guard it. After the captu re of Saint John"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Templars, the Francs Metiers, and Freemasonry 93 of Acre on July 12, 1191, Richard was given lodging in the house of the Templars, whereas the king of France was garrisoned in the castle. The chronicle of Bernard the Treasurer also informs us that Richard the Lionheart often took counsel from the Templars. * F urther, according to Guillaume de Tyr, the occasion of Richard's truce w ith Saladin on August 10, 1192 inspired the following: When the king of England had made a truce with the Saracens, he made ready his ships, to have his vessels loaded wi th people and provisions . . . then he told the Templar grand mas ter: \"Master, I know full well that I am not loved by everyone, and that if I set sail and it is known that I am at sea, there is no place I can land where I will not be killed or captured. So I ask you to l end me your brother knights and men at arms who will come sail with me. When we are far from here, they will lead me as if I were a Templar until I am back in my own country ...\" The grand ma ster told him he would do so gladly, and he secretly summoned his knights and men at arms and had them board a ship. The king too k leave of Count Henry, the Templars, and those native of that land and boarded the ship. During the evening he boarded the Templar ship and took his leave of his wife and her retinue. The y sailed off in one direction, and the others continued off in anot her direction.\" 11 These close ties between the Templars and Richard t he Lionheart (who did not hesitate to don Templar dress), were s uch that certain authors, Rebold for example, were of the belief tha t the king was a grand master of the Templar Order. + There is not a shred of truth in this, but the respective power and prestige of the king and the Temple, closely allied, served to make both parties even st ronger.

The establishment of the Templars in Normandy also extends far back in time, having been encouraged by Richard, ki ng of England, who also held the title of duke of Normandy. It was most likely Templar architects from Richard the Lionheart's entourage t o whom we can attribute construction of the remarkable fortress t hat was built in the space of sixteen months (1196-1197) above the Andel ys and on the right bank of the Seine and was gallantly baptized with the name Chateau Gaillard. It was so superior in constructio n to all its contem- poraries that on its completion the king was compel led to cry out in admiration, \"How beautiful she is, my one-year-old daughter!\" The Templars maintained numerous and important comm anderies throughout Normandy. In the Seine Maritime region t here was Saint Vaubourg; in the Eure there was Renneville, Chanu, and Bourgault; and in Calvados there was Beaugy, Bretteville, Voisinie r, and Courval. It so happens that in Normandy, as in Flanders, the same coincidence holds true: the simultaneous creation of the guilds and t he establishment of the Templars. Guilds did in fact exist in Rouen, wh ere privileged sites were known as franches aires, 12 and in Caen, since the first half of the twelfth century. Other characteristic examples of the formation of g uilds can be sin- gled out in France. One of the most important is th e oldest known mas- tery association of lay builders, the Cloture Commu ne of Montpellier, which grouped masons (maytres de payra or peuries), stone carvers, sculptors (ymagiers), and carpenters. In 1196 this association had received a written guarantee of assistance and prot ection from William VIII, lord of Montpellier. 13 The Templars established themselves at the same time in this city, where they too enjoyed the protection of the lords. For example, William VIII left them properti es in his will of September 29, 1172. Templars again appear in the Cu stoms of Montpellier conceded by King Pierre of Aragon, lord of the city, on August 15, 1204. 14 As a rule, the Templars had been long established in these regions of the Midi, where they were of consi derable importance.

It should also be noted that the lords of these provinces, just like those of Flanders and Hainaut, were particular ly numerous in the earliest Crusades. 15 In conclusion of our discussion of Templar influenc e on the exis- tence of associations, guilds, and the Freemasons, we can cite the case of Metz, where the Templars had installed a command ery in 1133. As Templar establishments in Cattenom, Gelucourt, Pier revilliers, and Richemont show, this initial commandery spread to s urrounding areas. In the framework of the territorial organization of the Order, the com- mandery of Metz included in its jurisdiction the es tablishments of the Trois Eveches, Lorraine, and the BarDuchy. By 1147, when Saint Bernard himself came there to preach the second Cru sade, the Temple had deep roots in the Metz diocese. Interestingly, toward the end of the thirteenth century a brotherhood of masons met in t he oratory of the Metz commandery. From 1285 we have the name Jennas Clowanges, li maires de la prairie des massons dou Temple [Jennas Clowanges, mayor of the brotherhood of the masons of the Temple]. In addition, a tomb- stone discovered in 1861 in front of the chapel and now on display in the Metz Museum recalls the memory of Freires Chape lens [Brother Chapelens.

As we have seen, the status of many abbeys, with th e exception of their manorial rights, was maintained for many cent uries and royal authority did not have the power to impose its edic ts in those areas under their jurisdiction.

Thus as far as the Templar comman deries were con- cerned, their privileges and exemptions remained un changed after the abolition of the Order. In fact, a bull issued by C lement V on May 2, 1312, decreed that all the properties, rights, and privileges of the Templars would pass into the hands of the Hospitall ers of Saint John of Jerusalem (who went on to become the Knights of Rho des and the still- existing Order of the Knights of Malta). This bull was applicable in all Christian countries and ratified by many kings, inc luding Philip the Fair. The privileges the Hospitallers inherited from the Templars were subse- quently and over the course of the centuries often confirmed by the popes,* and the Hospitallers continued to widely ap ply the right to asy- lum and the right of franchise so thoroughly that t he francs metiers were assured of their survival after the dissolution of the Templar Order. We have iconographic proof of this protection provi ded by the Knights Hospitallers to construction workers in a m iniature from the end of the fifteenth century depicting the ritual r eception of journeymen carpenters by the grand master of the Hospitaller O rder of Rhodes on the worksite of fortifications of the city that the Turks besieged in 1480. + While workers are busy on the ramparts, the grand master, attended by his officers, is preparing to give the collee to a carpenter who stands with hands clasped at the knees and a la rge ax on his shoul- der, followed by other journeymen carrying their re spective tools: com- pass, square, hammer, and chisel. All are wearing r itual ribbons tied around their heads. Moissac, connected to both the Benedictines and the Templars, pro- vides a characteristic example of how things remain ed in the communal context of the presence of freemasons. Very ancient in origin, Moissac was erected by Charlemagne as a Benedictine abbey e ndowed with all the rights to administer justice, which were subseq uently transferred to the \"Consuls and Leaders of City Hall.\" 17 Today we can still admire the church of this important abbey, a masterpiece of ea rly Romanesque art adorned handsomely with symbolic sculpture. * H. de Curzon, in La maison du Temple de Paris, ci tes fifteen bulls of confirmation that were issued from the time the Hospitallers assumed the Templar's position until 1629. + This miniature is reproduced in Pierre du Colombie r's book Les Chantiers des Cathedrales."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Templars, the Francs Metiers, and Freemasonry 97 There is no doubt that the Templars held a role of great importance in Moissac, for on the outskirts of the city discov eries have been made of towns with names like La Villedieu du Temple (th e seat of a com- mandery founded in 1137) and la Bastide du Temple, as well as farms that are still called \"the Temple.\" In Moissac itse lf there was until fairly recently a Temple Street (part of the current rue d es Mazels) that got its name from an old building alleged to have once been the \"seat of the Temple,\" which leads us to believe a Templar establ ishment once existed in close proximity. It just so happens that in this Benedictine and Templar city of Moissac—once a very important cross roads of different influences and one of the stations and pilgrimage c ities on the road to Compostella—there is a rue des Francs-Masons locate d in the old city. M. A. L. Bittard, the former master of conferences at the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts and president of th e Friends of Old Moissac, writes in regard to this subject: The rue des Francs-Macons in Moissac is the same st reet that bore this name in the past—and no doubt quite earlier th an the eigh- teenth century, the time when speculative Freemason ry first appeared in France. It therefore concerns corporati ve freemasons who, from the time of the Middle Ages in France, ha d inherited a name and professional traditions from the journeyma n of Hiram . . . Moreover, it was also included in the quarter of those corpo- rations that had probably been freed from the censi ve district of the abbey and whose old memory has been perpetuated by the names of other streets: rue des Mazels (butchers), rue de l'Escauderie (tripe butchers), and so forth.* *The current nomenclature of the old streets of Moi ssac dates from 1824, but the names used then would have been even older ones tha t had been suppressed at the time of the Revolution. See also Lagreze-Fossat, Etudes historiques sur Moissac (Montauban: Forestie Printers, 1870). This author believes that the \"seat of the Temple\" that could still be seen in the eighteenth century \"on the wes t side of the corner formed where rue Malaveille meets rue Saint Paul, was a vast buildin g that displayed all the appearances of a former monastery inside. This monastery, accor ding to tradition, had belonged to the Templars, which explains why rue Saint Paul was called rue des Templiers in 1824, in the alignment map of the city.\""},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES This old rue des Francs-Masons bears proof that in Moissac there once existed builder craftsmen benefiting from exem ptions; from this it is hardly an audacious jump to connect their origin to the Benedictines and Templars. The Introduction of the Templars into Builders Associations The last interaction the Templars had with the buil ders associations was their own introduction into these groups following the destruction of the Order. Certain authors have taken this even further, maint aining that after the execution of grand master Jacques de Molay, the Order continued and that he was succeeded by other grand masters wi thout interruption. Of course, the line of descent varies according to author. For Cadet- Gassicourt it was the grand master Molay himself wh o, foreseeing the tragic end of the Order and his own execution while in his cell at the Bastille, charged his nephew Beaujeu with the task of creating four great lodges in Paris, Edinborough, Stockholm, and Naples, whose pur- pose would be the destruction of spiritual power (t he pope) and tem- poral power (the king). 18 In the Acta Latomorum, Thory explains it as follows: Jacques de Molay, foreseeing the misfortunes that t hreatened an order whose existence he wished to perpetuate, desi gnated as his successor Brother Jean-Marc Larmenius of Jerusalem, who invested the grand masters destined to succeed him with patriar- chal authority as well as magisterial power by virt ue of the charter of transmission he was given in 1324. The original of this charter, consigned to the Treasury under the title Tabula au rea by order of the Temple, contains the acceptance, signed propria manu, of all the grand masters to have succeeded Larmenius. Baron von Hund, the 1756 creator of the Rite of Str ict Observance, provided this version of the story: After the Order 's downfall, the provincial grand master of Auvergne, Pierre d'Aumon t, fled with two"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Templars, the Francs Metiers, and Freemasonry 99 commanders and five knights. In order to avoid reco gnition, the men disguised themselves as masons and took refuge on a Scottish island, where they found the high commander, George Harris and several other brothers, with whom they resolved to continue the O rder. They formed a chapter on Saint John's Day of 1312 and Aumont wa s named grand master. To avoid persecution, they adopted secret s igns and passwords similar to those of masons and called themselves fr ee and accepted masons. In 1361 the residence of the grand master w as transferred to Aberdeen, and this is how the Order was saved and s pread. 19 Despite all that can be said about this direct cont inuation of the Templar Order, the entire story is purely hypotheti cal. It is legend that sees in modern Freemasonry, or at least in some of its chapters, a direct survival of the Templars. But it is nonetheless tru e that the Templar influence on traditional freemasonry is undeniable as is obvious from our earlier observations here. History tells us tha t following the disso- lution of the Order, the Templars entered the build ers corporations. It is possible to deduce from this that they would hav e thereby continued to exert their influence. Following the abolition of the Order in Germany, En gland, and Italy, the Templars were obliged to give up their religiou s garb and start earning a living, either as warriors and squires fo r their noble friends, or as architects, foremen, craftsmen, and workers accepted by the guilds according to the duties they had fulf illed in the Temple. The constant relations between the Templars and lab or associ- ations make it possible to grasp the rapid incorpor ation of the fugi- tives into the construction crews that were primari ly working on churches and castles.\" 20 Many Templars fleeing persecution took refuge in Sc otland; this was the case of those belonging to the Douai comman dery. Since 1274 the king of Scotland had been Robert the Bruce, who se family was of Flemish origin and some of whose members had been T emplar knights.

It is significantly noteworthy that in Bruges itself, where the Templar s had an important commandery, the guilds and others had welcomed fugi tive Templars The legend extends much further than does the histo rical data to support it. As recorded and handed down by several authors, 21 Robert the Bruce is said to have founded in favor of the F reemasons, the Royal Order of Heredom of Kilwinning. At this same time h e is said to have raised the lodge founded in 1150 (concurrent with t he founding of the Kilwinning Abbey) to the rank of Grand Royal Lodge of Heredom of Kilwinning. Ancient chronicles also say that the fu gitive Templars in Scotland enlisted under the flag of Robert the Bruc e, where they con- tributed mightily to the successful outcome of the Battle of Bannockburn, in which 30,000 Scots defeated 100,000 English. This can be taken as fact, but legend goes on to add tha t King Robert rewarded the Templars by creating, at their request , the Order of the Knights of St. Andrew of the Thistle, reserving for himself and his suc- cessors the title of grand master. Initiations into the Order were sup- posedly performed according to the style that had b een practiced among the Templars. During the time of the Reformat ion, the Order was suppressed and all its goods confiscated. In 16 85 the Stuart monarch James III restored it. In accordance with t he king's intent, it was to be a sign of distinction and reward for Free masons. Just what value can be ascribed to these legends?

Historically speaking, it is impossible to answer these questions. Any explanati ons that can be made belong to the domain of hypotheses.

The abbot had come in the name of Baldwin II, king of J erusalem, to ask if two Templars, Andre and Gondomard, whom Baldwin had sent as envoys of Jerusalem, could hope to find aid and pro tection in France and whether Louis was disposed to give them a roof for shelter and a chapel where they could pray to God. \"I understand,\" the king answered, \"that it is a ch urch you are ask- ing me for. I will think on the matter.\" The result of his thought was that he gave them a house next to the Saint Gervais Church, which was then outside the city walls.

This was the origin of the first two Templar establ ishments in Paris, the building near Saint Gervais and the Enclos of t he Temple. In 1147 the Order had some fairly spacious buildings in Par is near Saint Gervais, where a domain called des Barres was locat ed (Everard de Barris, or des Barres, was then grand master of the Order). This was used to hold a general chapter assembly, which both Pope Eugene III and King Louis VII attended. The domain of the Templars expanded considerably in short order, either through acquisitions and donations or throug h construction. A harvest record from 1247 1 shows that their holdings covered one third of Paris at that time. Superimposed over a map of mode rn Paris, the Order's domain would include part of the first arrondisseme nt (the areas approaching the Pont au Change and the Pont St. Mic hel, Chatelet, rue Saint Germain l'Auxerrois, rue Saint Denis, and the current area of Les Halles); part of the second arrondissement (rue Sai nt Denis and its imme- diate area); a large portion of the third arrondiss ement; a portion of the fourth arrondissement including the Saint Merri and Saint Gervais quar- ters as well as the central part of the cite* (betw een rue d'Arcole and the palace); a large part of the Sorbonne quarter (main ly Saint Julien le Pauvre, Saint Sevrerin, and Cluny) in the fifth arr ondissement; and, finally, part of the eleventh arrondissement in the north, which served as the Templar's farmland at that time and thus had no construction.

Inside this vast commandery lived a large number of knights and an even larger number of brother servants, among whom were the broth- ers who concerned themselves with construction proj ects and who were placed under the command of an officer called the m aster carpenter, magister carpentarius in domo templi parisiensis. T he rapid building of the quarters of the Templar censive district shows that numerous lay craftsmen, masons, carpenters, and other tradesmen had come to reside there. Inside this huge domain, the Templars ruled as mast ers. As was the case for such orders throughout the Christian world , the Order was sov- ereign both spiritually and temporally. With regard to the spiritual, just like the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Temp lars answered directly to the Holy See. The papal bull Omne datum optimum, issued on March 23, 1139, by Pope Innocent II and confirmed in 1162 by Alexander III, immediately transferred the affairs of the Order to the Holy See and removed them from the authority of the patriarch of Jerusalem—and the prelates of other countries. It also gave the Order complete authority to institute priests and chaplains to serve its church es.* Shortly afterward, another bull, this one issued by Gregory VIII in 11 88, declared that the Templars did not have to acknowledge the supremacy of any bishop other than the pope. This enabled them to avoid the pastoral authority of the bishop in Paris. By virtue of these privileges, the Order not only was spared the necessity of Episcopal visits, but it al so assumed visitation and jurisdictional rights over the dependent parishes o f its commanderies, except for the ordinances of diocesen bishop's conc erning the manage- ment of souls and the administration of sacraments. The Order had the power to consecrate its own oratories and churches without any inter- vention from the clergy and the right to possess it s own cemeteries and inter people in its parish churches. * This was the motive that prompted the bitterness of William, archbishop of Tyre."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Templars and the Parisian Builders 105 In the temporal sphere, the Templar Order asserted its full manor- ial independence by exercising in its domain and ce nsive district impor- tant rights concerning justice and authority over r oadways. Before we look at these rights in detail, a short d igression is neces- sary to examine several points in the history of pu blic law. In the Middle Ages, the justice handed down by the lords a ppeared in two dis- tinct forms: manorial justice and feudal justice. 2 Manorial justice was an infeudated dismemberment of public power. The lord served as the judge in civil, crimi nal, and administra- tive trials within his seigniorial borders and over all the inhabitants of his seigniorial domain. Not all lords had an equall y extensive authority, however. Two degrees were recognized: high and low justice. High jus- tice dealt with every criminal accusation that carr ied an afflictive penalty and all civil trials in which a legal battl e could take place—in other words, all major criminal cases. All other ca ses were the purview of low justice. It could be quite possible that one lord administered high justice while another lord in the same location was responsible for met- ing out low justice. During the fourteenth century an intermediary—middl e justice— appeared. This feudal or land-based justice was the result not of public authority but of feudal contracts and tenures and t he relationships they created between men. It had two applications. In th e first, the vassal, through homage, was subject to the jurisdiction of the lord of the fief, and it was this lord alone that was recognized as a judge in civil or crim- inal proceedings. In the second, any lord ruling ov er a feudal tenure had the exclusive authority to resolve any litigation c oncerning this tenure. The lord of the fief was the natural judge of any a ctions against the vas- sal by virtue of his authority over that fief. Like wise the lord censier (who received a censine's taxes) knew the causes co ncerning the censive area. We should note that in towns and cities, feud al tenures applied to houses. We should also be aware that in terms of pu re feudal law, manorial and feudal justices were all of sovereign jurisdiction; their ver- dict stood as final and there was no right to an ap peal. Now we can look at precisely how the Temple exercis ed these rights of feudal and manorial justice in its censive distr ict.

The growth of the Templar's dom ain, however, called for a modification of this authority. The propertie s belonging to its cen- sive district but located inside the Parisian encei nte (the wall built by Louis VI that determined the city limits of Paris u ntil Philip Augustus's construction of another in 1190), were subject only to the feudal justice of the Temple or, at most, its low justice. After t he construction of the new enceinte, Philip Augustus, along with all high justice lords, chal- lenged the Temple regarding its rights of high just ice over the part of its domain located inside the city's walls. This confli ct lasted for close to a century until an agreement was finally reached betw een King Philip III and the Templars in August 1279. This accord was on the whole favor- able to the king, though it did establish the right s of the Templars in a solemn and definitive manner. After that time, all the patent letters of the king as well as all the claims of the order wer e based on this docu- ment, summarized as follows: 3 In Paris the Templars will hold posses- sion of, in peace and perpetuity, all their houses, gardens, streets, and squares, with the rights to all land taxes and rent s incumbent to them as well as the domain and property justice attached to them . . . outside of which the king reserves to himself all other rig ht of high or low jus- tice. Outside the walls, they will retain over thei r lands, houses, and streets, over their subjects and goods, all their r ights whatsoever with all high or low justice . . . The king promises for him self and his successors never to lay claim to any of these rights mentioned , and never to demand any tally, military service, watch, and so forth. This legal agreement carefully established the limi ts of of high jus- tice left to the Temple. It consisted of everything located outside the enceinte erected by Philip Augustus, between the Te mple and the Barbette Gates, up to the line that would later dem arcate the new wall of Charles V. The incorporation of this area into t he city at that time did not effect any of the privileges that had been attached to it. Here an important observation must be added: It is not out of the question that the rights of the Temple to administe r justice—mainly high justice—remained much more extensive in the ar eas directly dependent on the Enclos, such as Saint Gervais and the Barres. Similarly, it is quite possible that they retained these rights of adminis- tration over the fiefs that entered into the Order' s possession by means"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Templars and the Parisian Builders 107 of donations or purchases.

On the right bank they had properties in the Saint Merri, Saint Opportune, and Saint Honore encl oisteres. The Temple was not the sole sovereign jurisdiction in Paris to exist before the fall of the Ancien Regime; other abbeys and religious orders in the city enjoyed the same prerogatives, + but the Templars' jurisdiction was by far the largest. Because of this sovereignty , the Temple was inde- pendent of the king and he had no power over the in habitants in this high justice area—which we could easily call a stat e. There the laws of the police were enforced and justice was exercised by a civil officer named by the Templar commander. This officer origin ally held the title of procurator, then mayor, then later, at the time of the Hospitallers, the title of bailiff. ++ His powers corresponded to those held by the king's provost in the rest of the city. For a long time th is mayor or bailiff would pronounce his verdicts at the foot of the famous el m of Saint Gervais. This tree, located in front of the church, is known to have been there since the thirteenth century. It had long been the site of the rendering of justice as well as the fulfillment of certain civic duties, such as the pay- ment of rents or tenant farm dues. The tree was cut down in 1811. The Paris municipality was well inspired when it electe d to plant a new elm on the Place Saint Gervais to recall the tradition of this historic site. 5 * It should be noted that the Saint Eloi Monastery first followed the rule of Saint Columban, then later that of the Benedictines of Sa int Maur (cf.

The Paris Temple and Craftsmen Circumstances eventually prompted many craftsmen to seek protection in the sovereign censive district of the Temple. It was a fact that until the time of Saint Louis and the drafting of the Liv re des Metiers in 1628 by the king's provost, Etienne Boileau, the working class suffered greatly from a lack of genuine laws whose texts cou ld serve as reference when grievances were raised. The taxes and fees tha t weighed down working individuals were levied unequally with no s tandard rate. Eventually the situation became so intolerable for workers that many abandoned the quarters of the city belonging to the king to settle as best they could in quarters that fell under different ju risdiction. 6 The Templars' quarter, which was in full development at this time, must have been particularly appealing to them. \"Because of the great hurt and great rapines they suffered in the provostship, \" writes Joinville, \"the 'little people' dared no longer remain on the grounds of the king, but sought instead to dwell in other provostships a nd manorial hold- ings; and thus it was the lands of the king that be came so sparse that when he held his plebiscite, no more than ten or tw elve people would elect to attend.\" Craftsmen were all the more inspired to dwell in th e Temple's juris- diction, for doing so, let us recall, gave to those who came seeking assis- tance and protection the benefit of two important p rivileges: asylum and trade exemptions. These privileges were express ly confirmed in Paris by the accord of 1279. Right to asylum was no t unique to the Temple, however. The free lands of other abbeys and religious orders also offered this privilege. A manuscript from the beginning of the six- teenth century provides the following list of these other jurisdictions: the Notre Dame de Garlande land and all the land of the chapter of Notre Dame inside the city of Paris, the Evesque la nd, the land of the franc-fie of the Rosiers, the Saint Marcel land on Mount Saint Hilaire, the Saint Victor land outside the gates, the Sainte Genevieve land out-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Templars and the Parisian Builders 109 side the gates, the Saint Germain des Pres land out side the gates, the Saint Benoit Cloister, the Saint Eloi land on Ile d e la Cite, the Saint Symphorien land, the Saint Denis de la Chastre land in the city, the Ostel Dieu land, the Dougnans land, the Saint Merri Cloister, the Sainte Opportune Cloister, the Saint Honnoure Cloister, th e Saint Germain l'Auxcerrois Cloister, the Saint Martin land outsid e the gates, the Temple land outside the gates, the Saint Eloi land in the old Tisseranderie, the Saint Victor land at the crossro ads of the Temple, and several easements in the city of Paris.\" 7 Saint Jean de Latran can also be added to this list. It should be noted that the Temple's right of asylu m applied only to its lands outside the city walls. These were the ve ry terms laid out in the 1279 accord. But certain parts of the privileged en claves listed above that were located within Paris entered into the Tem plars' possession. It is certain that the right of asylum necessarily fol lowed the right of pos- session. Ultimately, of course, the right of asylum , which was so wide- spread in Paris during the Middle Ages, gradually d isappeared. At the end of the Ancien Regime, there was no spot other t han the Enclos of the Temple that existed stricto sensu as a sure pla ce of asylum. The right of craft and trade exemptions was much mo re excep- tional. It existed in the censive districts of the Hospitallers of Saint John and the large Benedictine abbeys: Saint Germain des Pres, Saint Martin des Champs, Saint Eloi, the Enclos of the Quinze Vi ngts, and the rue Nicaise (Tuileries). But in these jurisdictions, wh ere asylum was more or less limited in fact or in law, it was gradually beaten down com- pletely by royal power as well as by city and commu nity authorities. To avoid competition from free craftsmen \"outside the walls,\" the Parisian bourgeois periodically pushed back the enceinte of the cite. This prac- tice hindered the settling of the suburbs, especial ly the Faubourg Saint Germain.* Only the Temple granted and had the power to guarantee a very extensive franchise to craftsmen. The right of franchise allowed the exercise of any craft or commerce * Seine Prefecture, Commission d'Extension de Paris Apercu historique, 1913, 12, 16, 17.

The exact territorial limits covered by the Temple' s franchise are not known. It is quite certain that they went well beyo nd the Enclos itself. The 1279 accord stipulates in fact the rights and f ranchises for those artisans who lived and worked in the courts and the Enclos of the Temple. The franchise privilege obviously was exerc ised throughout the area where the Templars had the authority to admini ster high justice, a domain that was much more extensive than the Enclos and its direct dependencies. It is likely, however, that originall y all the taxpayers of the Temple benefited from it. 8 By virtue of this right of franchise, the entry int o a craft would have been free in the Temple censive district, whereas i n the royal provost- ship many crafts and trades had to be purchased fro m the king. Generally speaking, the subjects of the Temple, at least those in its high justice domain, were exempt from royal and municipa l charges and most taxes: those attached to the tally, conscripte d labor (the corvee), regulations concerning weights and measures, the gi ving of free gifts, and so forth. After 1279, they all escaped the serv itude that the bour- geois and crafts masters found so unpleasant: the w atch. In the provost- ship, on the other hand, it was quite rare that tho se crafts described as francs metiers in Etienne Boileau's book escaped th is obligation. Among those that did were the mortar makers and stonecutt ers, but not masons and carpenters. In the Temple jurisdiction, all cra ftsmen were francs metiers and the masons who were established there w ere freemasons. The bourgeois there were known as francs bourgeois, such as a certain Simon le Franc, who lived around 1200 and left his name on a street in the censive district that neighbored the rue des Fr ancs Bourgeois. Thus privileges of asylum and franchise were not co mmon. They long made the Temple highly popular among craftsmen . It was the influx of these artisans that helped populate and e nrich the Parisian establishment of the Order—so much so that it was c hosen to be the Order's headquarters when the Christians lost the H oly Land.

The religious seat of the Order, where the worship ceremonies of the Brotherhood were performed, was the Sainte Made leine Church on the rue de la Juiverie, in the cite. This street, w hich was originally part of the censive and justice district of the Saint El oi Priory and the order of Saint Eloi, had passed into Templar possession f ollowing the agree- ment reached by the two orders in 1175. As for the church, it was a for- mer synagogue that had been converted in 1183, when Philip Augustus had driven out the Jews. It was in this church wher e the Brotherhood of Water Merchants would meet, followed by the Grea t Brotherhood of the Bourgeois of Paris around 1205. Abbe Lebeuf ind icates that the church was not a dependency of any secular or regul ar body. 10 Such a franchise, irreconcilable with feudal law, could ha ve been conferred only by the lord high justice of the Templars. The Great Brotherhood had its own censive district and an enclave in the Jacobin area near the rue Saint Jacques, the Clos des Bourgeois. It seems that the office of the Brotherhood, what w e could call its temporal seat, was originally in the Templar censiv e district, in the Maison de la Marchandise [Merchandise House] in the Valley of Misery, bordering the Seine to the west of the gran d Chatelet. It was then transferred in 1246 to the Parloir aux Bourgeo is, between the grand Chatelet and Saint Leufroy, still in the Temp lar censive district. It was in 1357 that the municipality was installed in the Maison aux Piliers [Column House], bought from the dauphin and located on the Place de Greve, neighboring the Templar domain.* * It seems an error to place the Parloir aux Bourge ois of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries on the left bank near the former Saint Ja cques Gate.

At the time the Livre des Metiers was written in 12 68, a Templar known as Master Fouques held the office of the king 's master carpen- ter and, by virtue of this title, had jurisdiction over the carpenters of the royal provostship. At the same time Master Fouques was the master carp enter of the Temple. In fact, the preamble to the rules for carp enters (tit. XLVII from the Livre des Metiers) states: \"These are the ordinances of the crafts that belong to carpentry in the suburbs of P aris, in accordance with how Master Fouques of the Temple and his prede cessors have used and maintained them from times past.\" The jurisdict ion of Master Fouques, then, as for his \"predecessors,\" was outsi de the provostship of Paris. In this regard, the rule was not exercise d by virtue of the king's master carpenter, but by virtue of similar but earl ier powers conferred within a sovereign censive district that could only be that of the Temple. The mention of predecessors shows that their origin —and consequently that of a Templar carpenter association—was already old history. Master Fouques's dual role is again confirmed by th e first article of the rule: \"Firstly, Master Fouques of the Temple sa ys, when the crafts- men and the masters of the said carpenter trade of the king was given him, he was sworn to all the masters of said crafts ...\" There is quite a distinction between the \"trades (of the carpenter of the Temple)\" on the one hand, and the trades of the \"king's carpent ers\" on the other. It also appears that the custom of Temple carpenters, which became the rule of the organization of carpenters of the provo stship when Master Fouques was placed at its head, went back to an alr eady remote past. This underscores the importance of the Temple in th e construction craft—and it is not foolhardy to venture that the c arpenter's association of Paris originated with the Templars.

In fact, in the epitaph record of Saint P aul Church we can read: \"Jean, son of Jacques Barbel, known as de Cha strel, sergeant of arms, carpenter of the king for his kingdom, who di ed on November 24, 1882\" (emphasis mine). We know what kind of authority over the building cr afts was held by the magister carpentarius, the master carpenter, in the Templar domain. As a result, Master Fouques had oversight o f both carpenters and masons in the Parisian domain of the Temple. By way of contrast, in the royal provostship his authority extended onl y to the carpenters. This provostship in fact had a king's master mason, at this time Guillaume de Saint Palu, who held authority over al l the masons in the provostship. The two trades of carpenter and mason were nonetheless connected throughout the entire city and the influe nce of the Templars is equally evident where masons are concerned. This Templar influence is noticeable in the rule of the masons in the Livre des Metiers. It was because of the Templars t hat the masons enjoyed free status, which, as we have seen, was th e rule for all trades exercised in the jurisdiction of the Temple, wherea s in the royal provostship, the majority of trades had to be purch ased. \"He who so wishes can be a mason in Paris, provided that he kn ows the craft and that he employ it according to the usages and custo ms of the trade\" (tit. XLVIII, art. 1). An even rarer privilege characteri zed the franc metier in Etienne Boileau's book: The trades of mortar maker and stonecutter were exempted from watch duties. The drafting of the Livre des Metiers in 1268 by th e king's provost, Etienne Boileau, did not result in unification of a ll organizations for a Particular craft existing in different jurisdiction s. The autonomy of these areas stood in opposition to any such unifica tion. The Livre des Metiers and the system of sworn confraternities it instituted were appli- cable only within the jurisdiction of the city's pr ovostship.

The identical nature of th eir statutes and craft mastery were circumstantial in nature; they could c ease to be so, which did not fail to happen on an individual basis to st art. The kings could have the tendency to regulate the trades—including those of carpenters and masons—with greater strictness by creating swor n carpenters and masons who had purchased their craft, but in the ju risdiction of the Temple all crafts would retain their freedom. Furth ermore, the fran- chises given Temple craftsmen went beyond the profe ssional frame- work, touching on personal status, fiscal authority , and exemption from the watch. Under these conditions, the influence of the Temple continued to make itself felt, as we can see from the creation o f craft associations, the maintenance of free associations, and the francs me tiers, all contrasted to sworn trades of the royal domain.

The Survival of Templar Communities and Their Franc hises after the Dissolution of the Order The Templar Order was abolished by Pope Clement V o n March 22, 1312. In a bull issued on May 2 of that same year, he decreed that all Templar properties, with the rights and privileges granted their owners, would be transferred to the possession of the Hospi tallers of Saint John of Jerusalem. Philip the Fair ratified this transfe r in France on August 24, 1312.* The Hospitallers, who were known as the Knights of Rhodes since 1309 and later the Knights of Malta (1530), were th us made surrogate holders of the manorial rights of the Templars and over the centuries preserved them with all the privileges of their pre decessors.

It is important to note that the 1279 accord, which included a tran sferring of rights to the Hospitallers, was confirmed by all subsequent k ings of France from 1287 to 1718—thirty-four confirmations in all. The last were made by Louis XV in 1716 and 1718.

This meant that Te mplar communi- ties of craftsmen, who were otherwise laypersons an d outside the Order, did not disappear with the Order. The right of asylum in the Templar domain was confi rmed for the Hospitallers by numerous papal bulls, notably in 15 23 and 1539. We have some interesting texts from the eighteenth cen tury showing how far this right extended. A November 3, 1701, memora ndum of the high prior Philippe de Vendome 13 attests that not all were suffered to seek sanctuary in the Temple Enclos and that the officer s there were charged with quelling any misuse of this privilege. A polic e regulation from the high prior of Crussol on February 5, 1780, stipulat es that asylum was not granted to exiles, fugitives from justice, bad- faith debtors, fraudu- lent bankrupts, and those who led criminal lifestyl es. These kinds of individuals would be given twenty-four hours to lea ve the Enclos. Sometimes, for opportunistic reasons, the Temple re fused to grant to craftsmen the right to asylum in the Enclos. Thu s in 1645 the Compagnons Cordonniers du Devoir [Companion Cobbler s of Duty] were denounced among the Sorbonne's faculty of theo logy because of initiation practices they employed to make an appre ntice into a jour- neyman.

A council decision on J anuary 28, 1678, declared the rights of high justice belonging to th e Enclos would be respected and added that it would not allow \"the cr aftsmen and work- ers plying their trade or crafts to settle in the E nclos without being sub- ject to inspection by masters, guards, and the swor n servants of the city.\" Overall, however, the right of franchise appears to have remained fairly intact through the years, as can be seen by another passage from a 1701 memorandum of the high prior Philippe de Ven dome: It is not without good reason that it pleased the k ing to confirm said privileges . . . because it is obvious to each and all what the famous merchants and traders of Paris are in a posi tion to con- firm—that is, if said Enclos was not an asylum and a free retreat for different merchants and other folk for whom a f all from grace was precipitated by an unexpected misfortune in bus iness that not all the prudence in the world could have avoided, t here would be an infinite number of merchants and traders in Pari s, and likewise outside, who would find themselves forced to move i nto foreign lands and carry with them their effects because the re is naught but this place in Paris that is regarded as an establis hed haven. This would be a consequence more dangerous than it is po ssible to say."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"118 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIME S TO THE MIDDLE AGES Only the crafts masters' visits to the Enclos were authorized. Thus we can read that on June 28, 1705, a declaration fr om the king to the carpenters association granted: [permission to the sworn syndics of said community to make their visits to all the studios and worksites, whether in the Faubourg Saint Antoine, the Enclos of the Temple, of Saint J ohn of Latran . . . and other privileged places.

These crafts men formed more or less marginal communities in relation to the swo rn confraternities and corporations of the city of Paris. It is certainly much harder to find traces of these Templar associa- tions than of the sworn associations. The latter we re regarded as legal entities: They had statutes, they possessed propert ies, and they con- tracted and operated under terms provided by the ju stice system. It is therefore possible to rediscover documents concerni ng them. The Templar communities, however, were not legally form ed groups. There could be no question of this in the area of the Tem ple; such a legal entity would have been irreconcilable with the exer cise of francs metiers, which was the rule of the Temple—they were de facto commu- nities. Yet these groups were more than simple asse mblies of workers, craftsmen, and merchants of the same status within the same quarter. That a trade was franchised did not mean it could n ot be regulated. The rule that existed for carpenters, for instance, was modeled on the sworn association that preceded it. Franchise merely mean t that a master did not have to purchase the trade, that he was exempt from royal and municipal fees and charges, and that every journeym an could freely establish himself as a master, but it did not mean that a trade was no longer subject to traditional rules concerning leng th of apprentice and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Templars and the Parisian Builders 119 journeyman status, operative oaths, and celebration of patron saints' holidays—all specifics that clearly imply an organi zation. To compensate for the absence of a judicial body ch arged with pro- tecting common interests and ensuring that the rule s of the profession were respected, craftsmen of francs metiers were li kely more inspired to follow traditional and symbolic rites and practices . Such customs are much more strictly respected when they take on the force of law. The free craftsmen living in the Temple commandery did not, then, scorn the prospect of becoming part of a sworn conf raternity. With it they were able to exercise their talents in two are nas. As Templar sub- jects, they benefited from certain privileges and f ranchises. As associates of the community, they were assured of being able t o work and of being protected throughout the territory of the city. \"It was in the best interest of the worker who, placed under the jurisdiction of an abbey, shared the legal status of the area in which he lived, to subm it at the same time to royal jurisdiction so that his affairs would prospe r.\" 17 Joint allegiance— to the Templars and to the royalty—ensured commissi ons from both. This state of affairs does not make the historian's task an easy one. Templar documents are fairly scarce.* We do have us eful testimonies that help us pick up the trail of craftsmen in the forme r Templar censive dis- trict: the old epitaph records in Paris churches; s treet names; records of pious and charitable foundations, chapels, and trad e groups.

It is known that, much to the chagrin of Philip the Fair, the general archives of the Templars, as well as those concerning individual houses—just as the cons iderable treasure of the Order— mysteriously disappeared before the arrest of Jacqu es de Moray. Were they destroyed? Housed in a safe place? Their disappearance is one of the great enigmas of history. Henri de Curzon surmises that the disappearance was to so meone's personal advantage. The most likely hypothesis is to view the Templars them selves as the architects of this dis- appearance some time prior to the fall of the Order .

To this extent we can safely claim that the Temple survived, even und er its own name, the destruction of the Order. This fact has escaped mos t of those studying the history of Freemasonry, for they have often been ov erly prone to focus- ing on only the religious and spiritual aspects of the Templars and to seek—or refute—the survival of the Order within wha t can be character- ized as chivalrous or philosophical organizations. Templar Traditions and Parisian Builders The bond between the Templars and the masons and ca rpenters was so strong that traces of it remained for centuries. Th e Templar's domain in Paris was, throughout its entire existence, the pre ferred dwelling place for these builders. Convincing evidence of this can be found simply by taking a stroll through time and space within this former Templar area. We will begin our walk at the Temple itself. From t here we will go to Saint Nicolas des Champs and Notre Dame de Bonne No uvelle, then down toward the Seine by way of Saint Gilles, Saint Leu, and Saint Merri. We will linger momentarily at Saint Paul, Sa int Gervais, and Saint Jean en Greve before crossing the Seine to Il e de la Cite. We will then end our visit to the Templar commandery on the left bank of the Seine, at Saint Julien le Pauvre and Saint Severin. The House of the Temple inside the Enclos, the chur ch, and the famous Templar tower were built on the territory of Saint Nicolas de Champs parish. The Templars' original church, the r otunda, was built some time around 1140 and was modeled on the Holy S epulchre. The nave and choir were built at a later date and the c hurch was definitively consecrated on January 11, 1217. This rotunda is comparable in every respect to the one built later in London and dedicated in 1185. It seems that the sam e architect designed both churches. 18 We know that a Christian architectonic association brought over from the Holy Land by the Templars bui lt the Temple on Fleet Street in London. Could this same association be credited with con- struction of the Temple in Paris? It is almost a ce rtainty that no mason and carpenters association existed at that time in Paris.

It could be that it was only the Templar community led by the magister carpentarius and that this organiza tion was the source of the Parisian matrises of masons and carpenters. It is also within reason to suggest that the Parisian metier was organized befo re that of London and that the craftsmen in the English capital were infl uenced by it. One bit of proof within the Templar rotunda suggest ing a link between the Parisian builders and the Templars is t he Saint Anne Chapel or Altar that lies to the left of the nave and choi r and is maintained by the toicturiers (roofers) of Paris. 20 There was also a small Saint Nicolas Chapel in the Templar Church at one time that may h ave been the seat of a confederation of carpenters. Masonry, carpente ry, mortar making, stonecutting, plastering, and other trades involved in the construction of buildings would have required a number of patron sa ints among which are Jesus Christ, Saint Blaise, Saint Nicolas, Sain t Anne, Saint Thomas, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint John the Evangeli st. Right next to the site of the former church of the Temple on the rue Saint Martin, we find the church of Saint Nicolas d es Champs, which is also dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. A chur ch dedicated to Saint Nicholas had already been built on this spot at the beginning of the twelfth century, before the arrival of the Templars . The parish district was always under the jurisdicti on of Saint Martin des Champs, a priory of the Cluny Order. A b ull from around 1119 issued by Calixtus II mentions a parish Saint Nicolas Chapel that was separate from the convent church. 21 With respect to the adminis- tration of justice, the parish territory was divide d between the priory of Saint Martin and the Temple—another example of the closeness of Templar and Benedictine neighbors in the city itsel f. An agreement con- cluded in 1292 confirmed the rights of the Temple o ver the moat of the Saint Martin Convent (on rue Frepillon, or today's rue Volta). 22 We are quite certain that until the Templars settled there , the town was only a collection of peasant huts around the priory of Sai nt Martin. The monks, who mainly devoted themselves to intellectual tasks customary of Benedictines, hardly inspired any craftsmen to sett le in their censive district. This situation changed when the Templars moved onto parish"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"122 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIM ES TO THE MIDDLE AGES territory. The increased peopling of the area seems to have been a direct result of the arrival of brothers of the Militia of the Temple. In fact, population growth in this area was so great that in 1220 it proved nec- essary to create a new parish cemetery. In 1399 the church was expanded: The church wardens of Saint Nicolas des Champs . . . decided, after obtaining the consent of the priest and the b ishop of Paris and the counsel of the king's sworn representatives of masonry and carpentry—masons Kenton du Temple [emphasis mine], Jehan Filleul, Regnault Lorier, and Adam Ravier (known as de Moret), and carpenters Robert Focuchier and Philippe Milon— to see to the construction of the masonry of the three chapels in the alley between said church and the hostel of said priest. . P The mention of Remon du Temple, sworn master mason, must be singled out. This master, better described as an ar chitect and sculptor, practiced between 1363 and 1404. He was the master builder of Notre Dame in Paris and built the famous Beauvais College on rue des Carmes. His seal depicted a shield bearing a hammer flanked by a square and trowel, with both crowned and flanked by fleurs de Iys. 24 While working on the Louvre and performing construc tion miracles there, he drew the recognition of Charles V, who ca lled him his \"beloved sergeant of arms and mason.\"* At this time there could be no question of any kind of alliance with an order that had been suppressed since 1312. Maste r Remon must have belonged to an operative organization of the T emple, such as the one that survived in Saint Gervais Parish in the se venteenth century. Builders continued to show an affection for the chu rch and parish of Saint Nicolas des Champs for years to come. The entire quadrilateral * With regard to Notre Dame, it should be noted tha t two of its most famous architects, Jean de Chelles and Pierre de Chelles, were natives of Chelles, where the Templars had one of their centers. During the thirteenth century , Chelles was considered a franche commune, a franchise similar to that of the Templar s that went back to Louis VI. After the dissolution of the Order, this franchise was lo st in 1320 by an act of the Parliament in Paris, at which time it fell under the subordina tion of the women's abbey that also existed in Chelles.

This same holds true for the neighborhoods near Saint Sa uveur, Saint Gervais, and Saint Paul, as we can see from epitaph records from these parishes. Near Saint Nicolas des Champs was the small parish of Saint Sauveur, throughout whose territory the Temple had its domains. Here again, Saint John the Evangelist served as the seco nd patron saint. The church here was demolished in 1787 and its site is now occupied by a house on the rue Saint Denis. As the short epitaph record suggests, the parish of Saint Sauveur was home to numerous masons: Pierre Morin, mason an d bourgeois of Paris (December 15, 1623); Gilles de Harlay, master mason and sworn mason to the king (February 24, 1579); Jeanne Legra nd, his wife (July 13, 1580); Pierre Breau, employed on royal construc tion projects and excelling in masonry (January 8, 1606); Anne Breau, his wife (October 18, 1617). An intriguing indication of the connection of Saint Sauveur to the Templars is its proximity to Trinity Hospital, loca ted on the corner of rue Saint Denis and the rue Darnetal or Greneta in the censive district of the Temple.* This hospital, one of the oldest in Paris, was founded in 1202 by two private citizens, Jean Palee and Gui llaume Estuacol, to take care of \"poor pilgrims.\" Sometime around 1210 a chapel was erected at the hospital, which was long administere d by the members of a religious community, the Premontres d'Hermieres. \"This order,\" writes Pierre Bonfons, \"was continued charitably fo r a good length of time until the abbot of Hermieres placed there othe r monks who were more inclined to seek their own personal profit tha n to give charity of * This is indicated from the status of the Templar domain according to the harvest record of 1247: \"It is in a splendid site before th e Trinity.\" Also: \"In the year 1217, there was mention of the church of the Trinity, in front of which church there were houses of the Episcopal censive district belonging to the Tem plars\" (Lebeuf, vol. 1, 115).

It may be more likely, however, that this w as the seat of a con- federation of stonecutters, for the Ascension of Ou r Lord was depicted on the coat of arms of the association of masons an d stonecutters. 29 According to a trade legend, it was a stonecutter w ho unsealed the stone that covered the tomb of Jesus and a mason wh o demolished the rest of it to enable Jesus to ascend to Heaven.' 0 Trinity Chapel was also the seat of the Confederation of the Passion and Re surrection of Our Lord, which received patent letters from Charles V awarding them the privilege of staging the Mystery of the Passion and other Catholic mys- tery plays. Such performances, which were very popu lar during the Middle Ages, offered religious and initiatory amphi bological sense rel- evant to the rituals of craftsmen. Over time, howev er, their meaning was lost and they eventually became spectacles deem ed impious by the clergy and justice authorities. Nonetheless, the at traction of these plays survived for an audience of diverse quality made up mostly of the \"mechanically minded,\" meaning artisans, according to Pierre Bonfons, who was a contemporary of this era. (The first edit ion of his book, itself a revision of the 1532 book by Gilles Corrozet, was published in 1586.) Eventually, similar Passion confederations were for med in Paris and its suburbs, causing the confederation of Trinity Churc h to assert its priv- ilege and request the authorities to ban these riva l associations. With an act of November 17, 1548, the Parliament of Paris s atisfied this request by forbidding the staging of all sacred mysteries, including those of the Passion of Our Savior, and permitting the staging o f only \"profane, honest, and licit mysteries.\" Trinity Hospital, originally intended to give succo r to \"poor pil- grims,\" was eventually also used to house transient s, 31 a term that is worth some additional attention.

At the time of the hospital's reorganization, suppo rted by an act of Parliament on July 1, 1547, it was decided that chi ldren of the poor would also be raised there and educated in craft te chniques by male and female workers in return for the privilege of obtai ning, in six years' time, recognition as masters in their crafts withou t the requirement of any fee or masterpiece. Justification for their sta tus would be provided by the professional skills of their eventual studen ts, who would them- selves enjoy the status of the sons of masters.* By a declaration of Henri II given in Paris on February 2, 1553, craft master s in the city of Paris could take on a second apprentice only from among t he children raised at Trinity Hospital. Two acts of Parliament, one of December 3, 1672, and one of August 22, 1798, specifically confirmed \"the rule over the rights and privileges of those who taught the art o f craft and masonry in the hospital of the Trinity and those who have l earned it in said hos- pital.\" 32 These institutions prove the long existence of soci al work among craftsmen, notably masons. Other examples can be fo und in connection to Saint Gervais Hospital and a second Trinity Hosp ital located on the left bank. Bordering the Saint Nicolas des Champs and Saint Sa uver Parish were Notre Dame de Bonne Nouvelle on the north and, to the south, the parishes of Saint Gilles and Saint Loup and Sai nt Merri, located in the Templar's domain. The church of Notre Dame de B onne Nouvelle is the most recent church, having first been erecte d from 1624 to 1628. The masons who lived in neighboring parishes likely came to settle in this quarter under construction in fairly large num bers.

The Templars owned important properties in the terr itory of the Saint Leu Parish, providing another piece of evidence tha t testifies to the rela- tionship shared by the Benedictines and Templars.* Saint Leu was formerly the seat of a confederation of Saint Anne— who, we know, was venerated by roofers—and also hou sed chapels dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. In addition, it served, for several different periods of time, as the sanctu- ary of the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulch er of Jerusalem, who were instituted in the fifteenth century by Pop e Alexander VI. This church's neighborhood had always been a frequent ha unt of the Compagnons Strangers du Devoir de Liberte [Foreign Companions of Duty to Freedom]—the Loups [wolves]—perhaps because of the patron saint of the parish, Saint Loup. Even into the nine teenth century the compagnons still met in cabarets located on two col orful streets: the rue du Grand Hurleur (formerly the rue Grand Hue Leu, o r Hue Loup) and the rue du Petit Hurleur. 33 The term hurler, meaning \"to howl,\" is still a compangonnage term, which is significant given th at these streets were already in existence in the thirteenth century . From 1242 to 1540, the rue du Petit Hurleur was known as rue Jean Pale e, referring to the name of the founder of Trinity Hospital.

Saint Merri Church is also of ancient origin. In th e seventh century there was already a chapel by this name built on a site that was then part of the territory of Saint Gervais.

In older eras, chapels could be found in Saint Merri dedicated to Saint Blaise, the patron s aint of masons and carpenters; Saint Nicholas, patron saint for carpen ters alone; Saint Anne, protector of home roofers; Saint John the Bap tist; and Saint John the Evangelist. 36 Saint Merri was dependent on the priory of the sam e name, but was contiguous to the Temple's censive di strict. The rue de la Verrerie, which was shared by the priory and the Te mple, was inhab- ited by a specific category of artists working on t he construction of churches and fine homes: the glassworkers and paint ers on glass, whose confraternity, according to Rochegude, was establis hed there in 1187. Within the territory of Saint Merri was the chapel of the Holy Sepulcher, erected in 1326, where sculptors and sto ne and plaster engravers had a confraternity that celebrated Saint Jean Porte Latine on his feast day of May 6. This church also housed an altar dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Giles and a chapel of Sain t Nicholas. The chapel of the Holy Sepulcher belonged to a confrate rnity who shared its name. It was originally administered by pilgrims wh o had been to the Holy Land, then later by four directors elected by the confraternity of Saint John and assisted by a council.

Its division into parcels prompted a legal action between the church wardens of Saint Gervais and the grand p rior of Malta, act- ing in the name of the \"Noble Lords of the Temple.\" The subsequent trial ended in an agreement following two acts of P arliament on February 6 and 24, 1618. + The house, rebuilt in 1623, was demolished in 1945. Following the transfer of its seat, the Temple reta ined its port, mills, and barns in the Barres area. In 1250 the road was called the ruelle aux Moulins des Barres; in 1293, the ruelle des Moulins du Temple; then the rue Barres or Barris. Historical dictionaries of Pa ris remain mute on the origin of this name, though it is possible that it derives from Evrard des Barres or Barris, who was grand master of the Templ e from 1146 to 1149, the exact time a general chapter of the Order existed in this area. In the middle of the thirteenth century, a large bu ilding, the Hotel des Barres, was erected on the rue des Barres, occu pying a large site on what is now the corner of rue des Barres and rue de l'Hotel de Ville. Remnants of this Hotel des Barres are still in exis tence: At number 56 of rue de l'Hotel de Ville (the former rue de la Mo rtellerie), we can see a strange ogive-shaped cavern in two bays. One of t he arch keystones adorning the first bay is adorned with a crest that includes a cross; the keystone of the second bay is decorated with a rose window with a leafy border. 40 In three parishes with confused borders—Saint Paul, Saint Gervais, and Saint Jean en Greve—the number of properties ow ned by the * J.

The 1632 list made by t he grand prior of Malta showing the definitive status of the censive district of the former Templar commandery notably indicates these holdings : \"rue Frognier l'Asnier; rue Gamier sur l'Eau (Grenier sur l'Eau); rue des Barres or Barrys; Saint Gervais Church, cememtery, chevet; Be audoyer Gate; rue du Gantelet; rue Jean en Greve; Martlet; chevet of the church (Saint Jean); Hotel de Ville of Paris; Greve; old Saint Je an Cemetery, rue de la Mortellerie: the Seine River: the Vannerie and Jean de l'Espine: rue Vielle Tissanderie (today Francois Miron).\" 41 The presence of organized builders in this quarter is visible from the time the Templars installed themselves, long before the existence of a sworn association of masons in Paris. Toward 1170, according to Lebeuf, a mason named Garin and his son Harcher, pr iest of the parish district of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie, founded a hospital on rue de la Tissanderie (Francois Miron). 42 This hospital was created \"to shelter poor travelers, to whom bed and board were given fo r only three nights.\" Originally, the institution had a master a nd brothers to provide hospitality. It is possible to believe that the mon ks who managed this hospital, called Saint Gervais, were affiliated wit h the Temple, for in the fourteenth century, following the dissolution of th e Order, the bishop of Paris entrusted its administration to the clergy. T he chapel of Saint Gervais Hospital was rebuilt in 1411 and consecrate d in the name of Saint Anastasius. In 1657, the hospital was transfe rred into the Hotel d'O at 60 rue Vielle du Temple. Abbe Lebeuf states that in his day (1754) nothing remained of the old hotel except its chapel, which peo- ple called the Saint Nicholas Chapel. The number of guests it sheltered, which varied every year from 15,000 to 16,000, reac hed the astound- ing figure of 32,238 people in 1789. These \"poor tr avelers\" just like the \"transients\" we saw earlier in relation to Trinity Hospital, were origi- nally pilgrims, most often those beginning the jour ney to Saint James of Compostella. Later, it was more than likely that th ese transients and travelers were not only the faithful on pilgrimage, but mendicants and vagabonds as well. A vagabond was one who had no pr ofession, trade, or sure abode, while valid mendicants were \"the hom eless who wan- dered the land.\" 43 The police always acted ruthlessly against these me ndicants and"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"132 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIM ES TO THE MIDDLE AGES vagabonds: In 1270 the ordinance of Saint Louis pro nounced the penalty of banishment against them; Henri II's ordi nance of April 18, 1558 declared the crime of being a vagabond to be p unishable by hang- ing; and a declaration of August 27, 1702, banned t hese homeless from the jurisdiction of the provostship and viscounty o f Paris and, in the case of repeat offenders, sentenced them to three y ears in the galleys. 44 Through the declaration made by the grand prior of Vendome, we also know that such individuals could not benefit from t he right of asylum in the Temple's jurisdiction. Finally, a police ord inance issued on February 19, 1768, made it \"a crime for mendicants and vagabonds, and persons without the proper credentials, and so forth, to seek lodg- ing at Saint Gervais Hospital, and for pilgrims and travelers to present themselves there without certificates and passports in the proper order.\" 45 We can easily deduce from these texts that the \"poo r transients\" and \"travelers\" housed in such large number at Trin ity Hospital and especially at Saint Gervais Hospital were in posses sion of a trade. Quite often they were nothing more or less than transient journeymen in search of a master to employ them. We could maintai n they were sim- ply a \"Tour de France\" of guildsmen. Their wanderin g of the country- side echoed the route taken by those on pilgrimage, which was how they would obligatorily visit Saint Baume to pay ho mage to Saint James, in whom they saw their patron saint (Maitre Jacques ), who would have lived near Saint Magdalene and been buried in her f amous cave.

A confession of belief in the divinity of Jesus Chr ist was required to be accepted into the rites of Master Jacques or Father Soubise. It was the Companions who gave particular honor to the Ascensi on and the Holy Savior. The Compagnons Etrangers du Devoir de Liberte (the Loups), ++ however, accepted into their ranks men of all natio ns and creeds. According to Agricole Perdiguier, in his book on co mpagnonnage, the Compagnons Passant [Traveling Journeyman] lived on the right bank of the Seine and the Compagnons de Liberte lived on the left bank. What we find here is actually an entire quarter inh abited by masons. Both were obliged by their conventions to work on t he side of the river where their homes were located. The \"traveling journeymen\" housed at Saint Gervais Hospital * The Gavots, or \"compagnons of liberty,\" were accu sed of supporting the Reformation in the seventeenth century, while the \"children of Master Jacques\" supported the Catholic Church. —Trans.] + From an historical point of view, another more rec ent comparison could be made. In 1667, the grand prior of Malta and the Temple was J acques de Souvre. He saw to it that the former walls of the Enclos were demolished and that large mansions (Hotels des Bains, de Guise, de Boufflers, and so on) were tran sformed into houses that were rented to private individuals. He also entrusted to Mansar t the task of rebuilding his palace (cf. J. Hillairet, Evocation du vieux Paris. 352). Could this Grand Prior Jacques de Souvre have been the journeymen's \"Master Jacque?\" It shou ld be added that the Hotel de Bason, built on the grand worksite of the Temple (t he current rue des Archives) was acquired by the Soubise family in 1697. The Hotel d e Soubise or Rohan Soubise (today the National Archives) was built from 1705 to 1709 on the site of the former gardens at the same time that the Hotel de Rohan was built alo ngside on the rue Vielle du Temple. Gould (A Concise History of Freemasonry), does not hesitate to connect the origin of the \"children of Father Soubise\" to the illustrious Roh an-Soubise family. Whether true or not, it is certain that these magnificent dwellings were built by masons who lived in the censive district of the Temple. ++ According to Macrobe, the wolf represents the init iate, he who has received the light, because of the kinship the ancients felt existed be tween the wolf and the sun. \"In fact,\" they said, \"the flocks flee and disappear when the wolf approaches just like the constel- lations, flocks of stars, disappear before the ligh t of the sun.\" (Cavel, Histoire pit- toresque de la Franc Macnneire, 361.)"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"134 THE ORIGINS OF FREEMASONRY FROM ANCIENT TIM ES TO THE MIDDLE AGES could easily find work with the numerous master mas ons residing in that quarter, notably on rue de la Mortellerie (lat er the rue de l'Hotel de Ville), which earned its name from the many mort ar-maker work- shops located along its length. Rue de la Mortellerie was cited under this name as early as 1212 in the act establishing the parish district of Saint J ean en Greve, 48 which serves as proof that during the time of the Templar s it was already inhab- ited by numerous masons. In 1348 of the following c entury, a certain Richard \"the mortellier\" [mortar maker], who lived on this street, estab- lished the seat for a society of masons in his hous e. The Office of the Master Masons remained fixed there for centuries, u ntil the French Revolution. In 1787 the building also housed the of fices of the carpen- ters, joiners, cabinetmakers, miniature furniture m akers, and turners. This house stood there until the nineteenth century , when it was removed to accommodate the expansion of the Hotel de Ville. Close by it, also on the rue de la Mortellerie at the current location o f the garden of the Maire de Paris, stood the so-called chapel of the Haudrie ttes, which the society of masons and carpenters bought from the Sisters of the Assumption on December 22, 1764, in order to install the confeder ation of Saint Louis and Saint Blaise there after it was transferred fro m the rue Saint Jacques. 49 Other streets in this quarter that formed part of t he Templars' cen- sive district also evoke the presence of builders: the rue du Platre or Plastriere, or the rue du Jean de Saint Paul, still in existence today.

The rue des Masons was part of Saint Benoit or Holy Trinity parish, whose church was located on the rue Saint Jacques, near the Palais des Thermes. Saint Benoit Church housed a chapel dedica ted to Saint Blaisel, the patron saint of masons and carpenters, and two chapels to Saint Nicholas, two to Saint John the Evangelist, a nd one to Saint John the Baptist. 56 This veneration of the two Saint Johns was primari ly- related to printers and booksellers, who also resid ed in this quarter. We know that patronage of Saint John was also invoked by sculptors and engravers, the ancient \"ymagiers\" who worked with s tone and plaster. The rue de la Bucherie dates from the twelfth centu ry and owes its name to the numerous merchants who lived there duri ng the Middle Ages and sold wood for both heating and building pu rposes. The wood was floated on the Seine to Paris, where it was rec eived and collected on the Left Bank at the spot called the port aux bu ches. The thirteenth century Livre de la Taille provides the names of nu merous buchiers, carpenters, masons, and joiners who lived in this a rea. 57 The greater portion of this Templar quarter on the Left Bank was a dependency of Saint Julien le Pauvre Parish, which later became Saint Severin Parish. It was also placed under the protec tion of Saint John in memory of an old baptistery that once existed near the original church built in the eighth century by Saint Julien the Hos pitaller (or Saint Julien the Poor), bishop of Brioude.

As the result of some hig hly complex legal maneuvering, the General Hospital's claim was dismi ssed, but because it strongly desired ownership of Saint Blaise Chape l as well as the two houses adjacent to it, it purchased this property f rom the master masons and carpenters in 1764. At that time the cha pel was threaten- ing to collapse and it was totally demolished aroun d 1770. 61 The serv- ice of the Brotherhood of Masons and Carpenters was then temporarily transferred to Saint Yves Chapel on the rue Saint J acques before being installed once and for all at the old Haudriettes C hapel on rue de la Mortellerie. It also seems that around 1760, a brotherhood of ma sons and car- penters met in the Chapel of the Nation of Picardy on the rue de Fouarre (rue Lagrange) and that their corporation k ept an office on rue de la Harpe at this time. 62 The Temple's domain ended south of the rue des Math urins, which formed part of their district. The area beyond this point fell under the jurisdiction of Saint Jean de Latran—that is, the K nights Hospitallers. This street owed its name to the Hospital of the Ma thurins or the Trinity, which had been created around 1206. This f acility was admin- istered by the Mathurin Order, the donkey driver br others founded by Saint Jean de Matha with an eye to ransoming prison ers held captive by the Muslims. This indicates that it had a relations hip with the Templars, although it was a direct dependency of th e chapter of the Paris Cathedral. The Templars, who were not priests , were affiliated furthermore with several religious orders, such as the Mathurins or the Carmelites, from whom they recruited their chaplain s.

Saint Benoit lists the famous Claude Perraul t, architect (October 9, 1678), and Mathurins Chapel has Claude Roman, ar chitect and entrepreneur of buildings (1675). This brings us to the end of our excursion through the old Paris of the Templars. It seems, from the evidence we have e ncountered, that dur- ing the entire time of the Ancien Regime it was als o the Paris quarter of masons and carpenters. Here they had their homes an d their religious and charitable foundations; here they enjoyed excep tional rights and privileges. Royal authority definitely sought to re strict them and limit them ratione loci to the area of the Enclos and its immediate dependen- cies, such as the Old Temple, near Saint Gervais. E lsewhere, in fact, the necessity of police and the maintenance of public o rder strictly prohib- ited the overlapping of authority. Nonetheless, the singular legal system instituted by the Templars during the twelfth and t hirteenth centuries survived inside the Enclos until the Revolution; th roughout the rest of the former commandery, it survived in the form of t raditions. To be absolutely thorough and give this demonstrati on all its con- clusive value, it is important not only to establis h, as we have done here, the bonds that existed between the Templars a nd craftsmen builders, it is also necessary to demonstrate that there are no profound traces of masons and carpenters having settled outs ide the boundaries of the Temple's former jurisdiction. In other words , it is just as impor- tant that we look closely at the other neighborhood s of ancient Paris for signs of populations of builders. Having researched fifty-eight of the main churches of Paris during this same time, here is what we can con- clude: To be precise, there were neither evocative street names nor chapels or brotherhoods of masons and carpenters in any other areas of the city.

We learned earlier that Saint Nicolas des C hamps Parish, a dependency of the Saint Martin Priory, was only a p easant village before the Templars installed themselves there. The settlement of the abbey of Saint Germain des Pres was also quite slow . A 1523 cartulaire confirms that the abbey exercised the right of all justice in its censive district and specifically stated that \"said religio us lords can make sworn masters of every trade in the forsbourgs of said Sa int Germain, just solely as bakers, wine sellers, butchers, fishmonge rs, drapers, couturi- ers, stocking makers, cobblers, locksmiths, chandel iers, grossiers, apothecaries, barbers, surgeons, and generally of a ll other trades as it pleases said lords, with neither the king nor any o thers having the right to prevent it.\" 63 Not a single building trade figures in this list, which implies that none were practiced within the abbey's jurisdiction.

In a work that was pub lished in 1840 64 we can read the following text, illustrated by an e ngraving made from a daguerreotype: During ordinary times, when it is not troubled by m oments of pub- lic unrest, the Place de Greve is fairly calm but s till not in a state of perfect tranquility. This is the place where wor kers, primarily masons in search of employment, have chosen to rend ezvous . . . Around six in the morning one can see a crowd of in dividuals emerging from all the tiny streets in the neighborh ood of the square. They are all clad in a garb that, because o f its many patches, would rival the clothes of a harlequin if it were not for the whitish layer that is uniformly spread atop the gar ments' surface. They all carry on their backs what could be well ca lled their insignia: a small basket inside of which sits a woo den spade whose handle emerges from a small hole contrived in the b ack of the bas- ket. This is how the entrepreneurs who come there i n search of workers recognize the men they need.\" In 1835 the name of rue de la Mortellerie was chang ed to rue de l'Hotel de Ville. But it's character still remained that of rue de la Mortellerie. Before the concerns of hygiene and urb anization that fol- lowed the Second World War led to the razing of thi s old quarter, at that time referred to by the bureaucratic title of insal ubrious block number 16, numerous suppliers of mason's tools—trowels, brolly s, squares, plumb- lines—could be found there, as was the case during the time of the mortar makers. 65 There were also numerous rooming houses where many of these workers in stone, plaster, and cement lived. Being for the most part natives of the provinces of central France who had come to Paris to ply their trades, these men were popularly known as lig orgneaux or limousins. The names of several of hotels in the area are quit e significant in this regard: no. 7, Restaurant du Batiment; no. 33, Au r endezvous de la Haute"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Templars and the Parisian Builders 143 Vienne; no. 51, Au rendezvous des Creusois; no. 73, Au rendezvous des enfants de Limoges; no. 12, Au chantier de l'Hotel de Ville; no. 36, Au rendezvous des Cimentiers; no. 50, Au rendezvous de s Compagnons; no. 52, Hotel de la Creuse; no. 74, Au rendezvous des M asons. Several of these establishments must have served as meeting places (cayennes), for the Journeymen of Duty. Until the e xpropriations moti- vated by the renovation of \"block 16\"—a small hotel and restaurant— the Rendezvous des Masons on the rue de Brosse at t he very chevet of Saint Gervais served such a purpose. It sat partial ly on the former site of the Old Temple or Small Temple, or the Garrison Hotel. The facade of this building, whose enseigne remained until 195 5, fortunately escaped the pickaxes of the demolition team, though not, incidentally, for the memories it evoked but to \"shore up\" the so uthern side of Saint Gervais Church.

We will also look at how modern speculative Freemasonry suc- ceeded the operative freemasonry of the past. First, though, an observation concerning terminolog y: It is custom- ary when characterizing the trades of the past to u se the generic word corporation. It is important to emphasize that this term, which is ety- mologically English, is of modern origin. When this kind of group appeared at the beginning of the twelfth century, t he name it assumed, depending on the region, was either guild or brothe rhood, the terms for the associations from which it emerged at a time wh en, in addition to their origional religious and social purposes, they took on a secular and professional nature. In the thirteenth century, notably in Paris, a divi sion occurred"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 147 between the religious and charitable organization—t he brotherhood— and the professional organization that the Livre de s Metiers calls the trade, the trade body, or the regular tradesmen. La ter, in the seventeenth century, trade was denoted in France as the trade c ommunity, then in the eighteenth century, as the corporation. \"This w ord is not used in official acts before the memorandum of January 1776 in which Turgot presented to the king the edict that would abolish, over the following months, mastery associations and oathbound groups.\" 1 So this term can be employed only in the broad sense, which is h ow we will use it: to designate the former professional organization. We will examine in succession these organizations i n France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and in Great Britain, concentrating partic- ularly on those of masons and builders. The Origins of Mason Corporations in France As we have seen, guilds and secular brotherhoods of craftsmen appeared during the twelfth century. Though the statutes of these sometimes make reference to earlier guilds, their existence is not certain. These guilds and brotherhoods gradually organized i nto trade com- munities under a sovereign authority, generally the king. We know that Flanders, Picardy, and the Artois region witnessed the organization of craftsmen into corporations very early on and we ha ve determined the synchronism between this organization and the estab lishment of the Templars. In Rouen the cobblers guild was confirmed by a charter granted by Henry I of England (1100-1135) while tho se of the tanners and furriers were confirmed by Henry II (1154-1189) . The origins of crafts in Caen and Coutances go back to a date in t he remote past. The oldest statutes for a community of builders are those we have already cited, coming from the common cloister of M ontpellier, which date back to 1196 and which were sanctioned by Guil laume VIII, lord of Montpellier.* The names of several particularly skilled architects of this \"mastery association,\" such as Bertrand, maist re de piera, and Guillaume Alesta, magister lapidum in 1273, 2 have been preserved It seems that the masters of stone (magistris lapid um) of Nimes * These statutes were reformed in 1284."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"148 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING formed a community at a very early date. In 1187 Ra ymond V, count of Toulouse, granted them jurisdictional privileges in return for certain fees and for personnel to give military service aid ing in the demolition of enemy castles. 3 In Paris the oldest brotherhood, that of the mercat ores aquae [water merchants], is first mentioned in 1121. It m aintained its seat at the church of Saint Mary Magdalene. Royal certifica tes from 1162 mention the privileges enjoyed by butchers of the L a Grande Boucherie Parisienne. These privileges were confirmed by pate nt letters issued from 1182 to 1183 by Philip Augustus. The drapers h ad established themselves in the community in 1183 and in 1188 the y founded the Brotherhood of Saint Peter in the chapel of Saint M ary the Egyptian. In all the relevant documents of this era the members of this Parisian brotherhood are called fraters, which is exactly th e case in a 1219 char- ter, conserved in the city archives of Paris, conce rning the acquisition of a house sitting behind the butcher shop of the Peti t Pont next to the brotherhood of drapers. Everywhere, just as single individuals were, these groups of mer- chants and craftsmen remained subject to the public authority of the land—that is, to the lord chief justice. Thus in a city such as Paris that was under the jurisdiction of several chief justice s, we can see the devel- opment of several different communities according t o the rights they were able to enjoy in their respective jurisdiction s. This subordination is often displayed by a very clear feature: in Pari s, for example, the king quite frequently \"sold the trade,\" meaning he levie d a tax on the mer- chant or craftsmen who was setting up in his trade. But all the dis- memberments of public law that were so skillfully e nacted during the Middle Ages had an effect on the rules and policing of trades. As was quite often the case, in order to better establish legal autonomy of a trade, a lord would entrust jurisdiction of it to a master of that trade. In Chartres, the post of master of taverners design ated by the count had been in existence since 1147. In that same year, Lo uis VII gave the bak- ers of Pontoise a monopoly on the making of bread a nd in so doing put them under the authority of a master he had chosen.

Thus the masons were under the master builder of masonry and the carpenters under the kin g's master carpenter. 4 The Corporative Organization in Paris According to the Livre des Metiers The drafting of the Establissements des mestiers de Paris, known as the Livre des Metiers, in 1268 under the direction of E tienne Boileau, provost of the king, sheds full light on the corpor ative organization. 5 With the creation of this book in mind, Etienne Boi leau asked the representatives of the brotherhoods to give him the rules of their trades. This book is therefore a codification of earlier ex isting statutes. The sys- tem of the Livre des Metiers placed labor under the control of Church and state. But it is important to remember that thi s regulation was valid only within the royal provostship. It did not apply in the jurisdictions of other sovereign authorities that essentially derive d from the Church and the Ecclesiastical Orders, among which the Templar quarter figures prominently, especially with regard to jurisdiction s where trades were exercised in franchise. These francs metiers, escap ing royal or sovereign tutelage, did have their own rules and rites howeve r, and we know they even served as models for the sworn trades. The int ernal organization is thus equally valid for both kinds of trade associat ions. According to Boileau's book, trade taken in its ent irety is based on a fundamental division made up of three classes: ap prentices, valets (the term journeymen later replaced this), and masters. The length of apprenticeship varies from two to twelve years, dep ending on the trade. Once his time of apprenticeship had ended, a young artisan could immediately become a master. It was only in the fif teenth century, or at the end of the fourteenth at the very earliest, tha t the disposition was introduced into the rules that made journeyman a se parate stage of apprenticeship that the artisan was expected to und ertake before obtaining the brevet of mastery. According to the Livre des Metiers, the master coul d and should require the worker (valet) he hired to produce cert ain justifications of his skills, first giving notice that he had completely finished his apprentice- ship, and then establishing that he was free of any earlier commitment."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"150 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING The contract was concluded orally, but before this the valet swore on the saints that he would perform the trade \"faithfu lly and well.\" Depending on the profession, this swearing might in volve the relics or images of the patron saints of the trade or the Hol y Gospels. 6 A. Lantoine is therefore mistaken when he claims th at the oath could not have been made on the Bible in the lodges of op erative Catholic masons. We find this oath on the Bible in corporati ve English masonry, which was also Catholic. The \"Bible upon the altar\" is therefore not an example of \"Huguenot contraband\" smuggled to freema sonry. 7 To obtain the grade of master it was first necessar y that an appren- tice show proof that he had fulfilled his apprentic eship. The idea of the masterwork did not yet exist in the thirteenth cent ury, but candidates for mastery were required to show guarantees of ano ther order, such as taking an exam in the presence of wardens of the tr ade. Candidates were also required to acquit the taxes or fees impo sed by royal or manorial authority when the trade was not one that was free and exempt of such obligations. The recipient would the n swear an oath on the \"saints\" to conform to established usages and c ustoms and provide good and loyal work. It should be noted that women were accepted into th e rank of mas- ters in two very specific cases. There were certain trades that were exclusively composed of women (silk seamstresses, s ilk fabric makers, and so forth). In some other professions, women wer e accepted to the rank of master just as as men were (they could be f ringe makers, linen makers, or poultry breeders). Further, the widows o f masters were authorized to continue the trade of their deceased husbands. It was gen- erally assumed that they had acquired sufficient pr ofessional experience to do so. 8 The reception of a new master was occasion for a ce remony, though only the statute of the talemeliers [bakers] provid es any details of this ceremony. Candidates for master gathered at the doo r of the trade war- den's house. While standing outside, they answered questions asked of them concerning professional customs, and after wit nesses gave their approval, they broke a pot of nuts and oublies* on the wall as a sign of * [These are thin, wafflelike pastries that have be en rolled on a cylinder. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 151 emancipation. They then entered the house, where a place had been reserved for them at hearth and table. A group meal was served to which all masters contributed one denier, even if t hey were not attending. It is probable that similar ceremonies took place i n other trades, although Etienne Boileau's book remains mute on thi s subject. In addi- tion, while this is what could be seen from the out side regarding initia- tion, it is likely that esoteric rites were also in cluded but were not revealed in public, falling instead under the headi ng of trade secrets. The practice of these rites eventually alarmed both civil authorities and the Church, which considered them sacrilegious. An interesting allusion to this subject appears in the 1548 arret of the pa rliament of Paris con- cerning the Brotherhood of the Passion of Paris. It forbids any staging of sacred texts, mainly the Mysteries, which consis ted of episodes from the Passion of Christ. The Officiality of Paris eve ntually confirmed this condemnation. We will see that this ban was not at all the case in England, where the Mysteries became standardized an d where the word mystery eventually acquired the meaning of the word craft. 9 A responsibility that the masters had to support in the royal provostship of Paris was also one they found highly irritating: that of the watch. Several trades had obtained an exemption from this duty, notably the stonecutters and mortar makers. The nominal heads of the trades, as we said earlier , were the craft masters, great officers, or private citizens to who m these trades were pledged. Their role was chiefly honorific while the actual leaders were wardens and sworn members who held and exercised au thority in the name of the group. It should be mentioned that trad e assemblies were also held, sometimes on a regular basis, and someti mes as an extraor- dinary event. The Communities of Masons and Builders According to the Livre des Metiers of Paris, exerci se of the trades of carpenter and mason was free in the jurisdiction of the king's provost. Craftsmen were expected to pay a fee only to the mo narch. We can understand this point through its application to th ose professions with francs metiers regulations in the jurisdiction of t he Temple."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"152 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING The masons were dependents of an officer of the roy al house, the master of the works of masonry. In 1268, during the time Etienne Boileau lived, this individual was Master Guillaume of Saint Paul. He had under his jurisdiction masons, stonecutters, mo rtar makers, and plasterers. We do not know to what exactly the trad e of mortellier cor- responded. This word has long since vanished from s peech, but it most likely concerns what are today called dressers—work ers who, after the architect and master mason have finished, oversee t he cutting and lay- ing of stone, preparation of mortar, and so forth. 10 This illustrates how far things were then from the specialization of today. For a long time, even extending into modern times, architecture consisted only of this division mentioned by the Ca non Hugues de Saint Victor in the eleventh century: masonry (cementaria ), which included stonecutters (latomos) and masons (cementarios), an d carpentry, which included carpenters (carpentarios) and joiners (tig narios). One fact should not be overlooked: Until the seventeenth cen tury, private archi- tecture was made of wood—long beams, then short bea ms after the fif- teenth century. Only sacred or public buildings wer e constructed of stone. Rare indeed were the houses built of stone. 11 Architects were merely workers of a higher degree, master builders who worked personally either as sculptors or as sim ple stonecutters. Until the Renaissance, they were designated by the term master mason or that of master of the work, magister aedificans, or magister aedifi- ciorum, when they were the head supervisors of work sites. The word architect received scant use during the Middle Ages . Pierre de Montreuil gave himself the distinction of the title doctor lathomorum. Like their fellow workers, architects were paid by the day, but benefit- ing from a well deserved consideration, their salar y was higher and included tips as well as gifts (robes, hoods, glove s, pipes of wine, and so forth). These masters of the work were generally men of higher learning. They were in no way technical specialists ; rather they worked simultaneously on architectural constructions, war machines, furnish- ings, and sculpture. Like Villard de Honnecourt, wh o was quite fluent in Latin and highly knowledgeable about different s ciences, and like Tetillon, a monk of Saint Gall Abbey, who was known throughout Germany in the eleventh century as a preacher, prof essor, Latinist,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 153 Hellenist, painter, architect, carver, and astronom er, they often pos- sessed extensive knowledge of all fields. Proof of the high esteem in which they were held is shown by the many commemora tive monu- ments to the memory of the masters of the works tha t were erected in the cathedrals and other buildings they built. Amon g these we can cite figures of masters of the works carved on the medal lions of the cathe- drals of Amiens and Reims, the inscription carved i n 1257 on the por- tal of Notre Dame in Paris in honor of Jean de Chel les, and that of Pierre de Montreuil in the Chapel of the Virgin in the Parisian church of Saint Germain des Pres. According to the Livre des Metiers, mortelliers and stonecutters were exempt from watch duties. These craftsmen claimed t o have enjoyed this privilege since the time of Charles Martel: \"The mo rtar makers have been exempt from the watch and all stonecutting since th e time of Charles Martel, as men of integrity have heard it passed fr om father to son.\" This declaration presumes an existence of privileges goi ng back to the eighth century, which is an exaggeration if we take into c onsideration the time- frame of the existence of that actual community. It may have a basis in fact though, to wit the existence of large and infl uential architectonic associations in Gothic Gaul during the seventh and eight centuries. This assertion becomes even more interesting once we kno w that, according to the oldest documents of English freemasonry, this a rt was introduced in France by Charles Martel before he crossed over int o England. The length of the apprenticeship period for masons was six years. The statutes of the community of carpenters in the Livre des Metiers are uniquely based on the deposition of an important fi gure, the king's car- penter, Master Fouques du Temple, who stated that h e governed the mas- tery from the time the king had entrusted him with that responsibility, and this declaration became a craft regulation from that time forward. Under the unique title of carpenters were gathered all workers who, according to the text, euvrent du trenchant en merr ien, which means \"who worked wood with tools.\" The different categor ies under this heading were numerous, amounting to ten in all. The y included stan- dard carpenters, huchiers,* court clerks, coopers, cartwrights, carters, * [A huchier is a carpenter specializing in furnitu re and interior design. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"154 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING house roofers, crochetiers [boatwains], turners, an d panelers. The king's carpenter, who was the head of all these spe cialities, assigned a lieutenant to administrate each one. He himself rec eived eighteen deniers a day for his services along with a livry r obe on All Saints' Day (title XLII, art. 1, and 8). The apprenticeship period for a carpenter was four years. In 1292, according to the Talliage Registry, there were 104 master masons, 98 master carpenters, and 12 stonecutters listed in Pa ris. The Extension and Evolution of the Corporative Syst em The Parisian-type craft community could also be fou nd in a certain num- ber of towns known as \"sworn towns.\" At the end of the fourteenth cen- tury Loyseau, in his Traite des Offices, explains t hat the sworn towns are those in which \"certain sworn crafts exist, meaning those that have the right to exist as a body and a community in which m embership is gained by oath.\" Up until that time, sworn towns were fair ly rare. In the major- ity of towns throughout the north, central, and Mid i regions of France, and even in Paris in the areas of sovereign jurisdi ction, including that of the Templars, entry into a profession was free. It was the same through- out Provence until the end of the fifteenth century . In Bourdeaux, fran- chised trades were exercised in areas called sauvet es or sauvetats. In Lyon, crafts people were subject only to their own customs and to the police regulation of the municipality or the manori al authority to whom the masters were required to swear an oath of fealt y. This last restriction shows that absolute freedom in the trades did not e xist anywhere. There were only different systems of rules. An individual could oppose either the sworn trades or the trades goverened by municip al or manorial authority. Even the francs metiers, despite the gre at privileges attached to them, fall into this second category. In all cases where trades were performed in franchi se, there was only one grouping, and it was both religious and pr ofessional in nature: the brotherhood. Affiliation with it was obligatory . In addition to its religious and charitable mission, which was led by clerics, the brother- hood mainly concerned itself with its material inte rests and saw that respect was paid to trade customs. There were offic ers who were given"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 155 authority in this matter, such as those known as pr iors in Bordeaux, for example. At the end of the sixteenth century, the royal auth ority in France attempted to extend the system of sworn trades over the entire king- dom. This effort appeared in the measures of an edi ct issued by Henri III in December 1591 and in another edict of Henri IV in April 1597. These edicts prescribed the entrance of all people into a sworn trade where that form was in common use, and establishmen t of sworn trades where there were none. But these edicts were applie d in a manner that was far from perfect. According to a 1673 edict, the number of officially recognized state bodies amounted to 73. Another edict of 1691 fixes the number of crafts at 127 and divides them up again, in accorda nce with their importance, into four classes. At the same time, it establishes the impor- tance of each of these classes with respect to the importance of the king's right during each reception in the city. In the cities where a par- liament sat, the masters received in first-class co mmunities paid the king 30 pounds, while those in fourth-class communi ties paid 6 pounds. The first class consisted of 25 corporation s, including those of the masons, carpenters, and sculptors, along with t hose of the painters, surgeons, apothecaries, booksellers, goldsmiths, an d so on. In the fourth class, we find the spike makers, the boatmen , the flower sellers, the patenotriers,* fishermen, and maitres fifis [ga rbage collectors]. The masons were always placed under the jurisdictio n of the mas- ter of the works of royal masonry, buildings, and c onstructions, later called the master general of the king's buildings, bridges, and roadways of France. In the terms of an ordinance of May 17, 1595, they held the right to pass judgement on all transgressions of th eir statutes. It seems that these mason statutes were the same as those de scribed by Etienne Boileau, which had been confirmed in 1574. The mast ers continued to be able to ply their trade freely without having to buy that right from the king. But the king, while avoiding any appearan ce of suppressing this traditional franchise, had restricted its exte nt by creation of sworn expert masons of the king, veritable public officer s whom he designated. * [These are the manufacturers of rosaries, buttons , jewelry, and so forth. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"156 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING These sworn masons purchased their charge and in re turn they alone were responsible for appraisals, reports, toises, a nd estimations. According to the Guilde des Corps des Marchands of 1776, the duration of the apprenticeship period among masons was six years by the terms of their statutes, but was in fact only t hree years. There was no required period established for work as a journe yman; an apprentice could graduate directly to the status of master. Like masons, carpenters, too, were divided into ord inary masters and those sworn to the king. Philip the Fair abolis hed the post of royal carpenter in 1314. It was subsequently restored for a brief time before being definitively terminated. In the terms of the 1649 statute that replaced older statutes dating from 1454, the commu nity was governed by a syndic elected every two years from among thos e sworn to the king. The elections, reviews, and the settling of b usiness matters took place on March 20, the day after the feast day of S aint Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters. The examination of an aspiring member consisted of one drawn geometrical design and a masterpiece. The sons of m asters and appren- tices paid the same rights for master status, 20 po unds total. Six years of apprenticeship were required and journeyman stat us was intended to last six months. The sons, nephews, and cousins of a master did not count as apprentices. A foreigner to France had to work for an addi- tional four years in Paris before achieving the gra de of master. Carpenters' workshops were known as lodges. An arre t issued by Parliament on August 30, 1631, mentions the lodge i n its rejection of the appeal of an earlier sentence \"that forbade all journeymen carpen- ters from carrying away from the worksites and even the lodges and workshops of the bourgeois the trimmings, chips, wo od ends, and blocks, if it is without the wishes and consent of said bourgeois and carpenters . . .\"* * The term lodge was contemporaneous with Etienne B oileau's Litre des Metiers- Masons also used it: \"A document in the archives of Notre Dame de Paris records an incident that took place in the works lodge on the eve of the Feast of Assumption in 1283.\" [J. Gimpel, The Cathedral Builders (New York : Harper and Row, 1984), 77.] Concerning the existence of a lodge in Paris under Louis IX, see Marcel Olle, Le Symbolisme, July/September 1960."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 157 The Brotherhoods The trade or community remained coupled with a brot herhood, a group that was assembled for religious or charitabl e purposes, placed under the protection of one or more patron saints, and established in the chapel of a church. The brotherhood was thus su bject first and fore- most to ecclesiastical authority. Long before the c ommunity, it was the first form of trade organization, reflecting the cr aft's traditional and spiritual elements. While labor retained the supern atural values it had held since time immemorial, religious bonds closely committed the members to God and their fellows in the fulfillment of their daily tasks. We have seen that in many regions and for a long ti me there were no trade communities, but only brotherhoods. These also remained the sole professional organizations of the francs metie rs. When both groups coexisted, as was the case in Paris, they were no l ess distinct. They sometimes shared the same directors, but ordinarily their management and resources were clearly separate. Moreover, memb ership in the brotherhood was obligatory, as was membership in th e community. The Builder Brotherhoods of Paris In the same city, mainly Paris, a trade would often engender several brotherhoods, who sometimes had different patrons. This was a result of the distance separating some artisans from other s. Another conse- quence was that not all craftsmen were subject to t he same statutes. In Paris, some were connected to the community and pla ced under juris- diction of the king's provost, while others were de pendent on the Temple or some other abbey or sovereign religious o rder. In the provostship of Paris at the time of the Livr e des Metiers, a common brotherhood of masons and carpenters existed , placed under the patronage of Saint Blaise (title XLVIII, art. 2 ). This patronage had been adopted a good deal earlier and continued to b e invoked for sev- eral centuries. The seat of this brotherhood was th e Saint Blaise-Saint Louis Chapel on the rue Galande near Saint Julien l e Pauvre. Another Saint Blaise Chapel, connected perhaps to the same if not to another brotherhood of masons and carpenters, also existed in the neighboring Saint Benoit or Holy Trinity Church on the rue Sain t Jacques. It is in"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"158 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING fact not out of the question that builders formed s everal brotherhoods at this time. What is certain—and this is something that happened quite quickly—is that Saint Blaise was not the only saint to have their worship. Carpenters gladly invoked the patronage of Saint Ni cholas and shared his worship with the watermen or water vendo rs. According to Dulaure, this patronage went far back to the distan t past, to a time even before Christianity, for Saint Nicholas simply repl aced Neptune. This opinion appears well-founded—simply recall that the Roman builders who settled in Great Britain placed their collegium under the protection of Neptune. Saint Joseph was also ardently worshiped by the car penters and seems to have supplanted Saint Blaise. The Litre de s Confreries indi- cates that Pope Alexander VII (1655-1667) granted o ne Brotherhood of Saint Joseph to the carpenters, though it is lik ely that this was actu- ally a confirmation of a brotherhood that was much older in origin. It was installed in the church of Saint Nicolas des Ch amps, near the Temple, a parish where builders were numerous, and its coat of arms was an azure field behind a golden image of the inf ant Jesus holding a compass and measuring a drawing given to him by Sai nt Joseph. The Livre des Confreries also mentions an organizat ion of stone- cutters: \"Brotherhood of the Ascension of Our Lord, erected in the parish church of Notre Dame de Bonne Nouvelle for t he brotherhood of journeymen stonecutters, having then in charge P hilippe Hubert and Pierre Jouanne in 1663.\" Its coat of arms \"was a co mpass, triangle, plumb line, hammer, and chisels.\" The Ascension dep icted on the coat of arms of the community of masons (\"an Acension of the Son of God, all in gold\") compels us to accept the fact that it refers to the craft of masonry. 12 Certain craftmen in the building trade, such as roo fers, worshipped Saint Anne. In fact, in the Temple there was an alt ar dedicated to her.

In the Midi region they were called charites. In Montpellier, f or example, benevo- lent institutions that gave assistance had develope d rapidly starting in the thirteenth century. Each trade had two ordinary centers consisting of a chapel and an office. Ceremonies and common pr ayer took place in the chapel, while the office was used for discus sing the organization's business activities and for distributing aid to its needy members. The charities had at their disposal the resource of tax es deducted from apprenticeship fees as well as what they took in fr om various dues. From this fund they gave assistance to the poorer m embers of the trade and celebrated Masses for their dead. All the trade s of Toulouse had their own brotherhoods during the thirteenth centur y, each established in a different church in which a symbolic lamp, per petually lit, was placed before the altar. The community and brotherhood of the carpenters of Angers was undoubtedly of ancient origin. In fact, the statute s of 1487 made men- tion of the long period of time this craft had been a sworn trade. It elected the two masters that guided it on the feast day of Saint Joseph, and on that same day each master paid the brotherho od the sum of eight sols and four deniers. Each journeyman gave o ne denier per week to the community. The group's statutes included con tingencies for granting brotherhood assistance to indigent foreign journeymen: \"For the honesty of said trade, if it should happen that anyone traveling through the region, as long as he is a worker of th is trade, finds himself in need and gives his sworn oath that he lacks the wherewithal to meet his travel expenses, the sworn members will be boun d to administer to"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"160 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING his wants for only one meal and to give him two sol s and six deniers.\" 15 The same patron saints found in Paris were also wor shipped by the brotherhoods of these provincial builders, with the addition of Saint Gregor, Saint Alpinien, Saint Martin, Saint Marin, Saint Etienne, Saint Barbara, and especially the apostle Saint Thomas, w ho is often depicted holding a square. Purposes and Traditions of the Brotherhoods The purpose of the brotherhoods is defined as follo ws in an edict issued on March 1319 restoring a brotherhood of Saint Jame s and Saint Louis that had been abolished in 1306: \"To provide throug h one's work the gifts of large alms, to feed the indigent brothers, to have Masses said for both the living and the dead, and to busy oneself w ith various charita- ble works.\" But the primary goal, not said outright here yet implied in all that was said and done, was \"to elevate man to God and let him earn the Lord's infinite grace.\" We know about the organization and life of the brot herhoods thanks to eighteenth-century documents. Each trade community placed under the protection of a patron saint owned a priv ate chapel in a church, where it held its meetings. Each had specia l officers who were elected to their posts—sometimes a provost and chai rman or two sworn masters would share the position. Following Mass ev ery year on its patron saint's feast day, the brotherhood held elec tions and nominated a collector and a clerk. 16 \"The provost would then receive the congrat- ulations and praise of all the brothers, who would lead him solemnly to his home. The chaplain, escorted by choir boys, wou ld then turn over to him, as a sign of his taking possession of the o ffice, the brotherhood's cross, old and new candles, the notes of meetings, and the coffer hold- ing the deniers, property deeds, and the bulls of f oundation.\" 17 The provost alone had the power to convoke the brothers for assemblies, the selection of new members, and the burying of th e dead. \"Sometimes the election of the new chairman would b e the occa- sion for a fairly unique ceremony. Everyone would g o to the patronal church and sing vespers. When they reached the verse of"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 161 the Magnificat where it says \"Deposuit potentes de sede,\" the chair- man who was stepping down from his post would leave his seat, which was located in the center of the choir, and f ind himself a new seat among the elders. At the same time and continu ing through the end of the verse, \"et exaltavit homilies,\" the newly elected chair- man would take possession of the baton, the emblem of his station, and sit down on the chair vacated by his predecesso r.\" 18 Every year the brotherhood sang a solemn Mass, whic h was fol- lowed by a procession in which one member carried t he candle and baton of the trade. The following day, another serv ice was celebrated and a Novena was begun for the souls of deceased ma sters. In addition to this annual ceremony, the divine service with so lemn vespers was cel- ebrated on fixed days and a Low Mass was said each day of the year for deceased brothers. At the death of a member, a High Mass was sung and attended by all the brothers. Despite the persistence of these pious customs, how ever, the admirable spirit of Christian charity that had anim ated the brother- hoods during the time of Saint Louis was weakened. Yet it was still con- sidered a matter of honor to give assistance to tho se craftsmen in the trade who were suffering from misfortune. The Brotherhoods and Civil and Religious Authoritie s The brotherhoods did not always remain inside their pious and chari- table provenance. In the beginning of their existen ce they were often accused, at least under certain circumstances, of d egenerating into superstitious practice and belief. There were sever al cases of this that led to them being banned by town councils in Montpe llier (1214), Toulouse (1234), Orleans (1238), Bordeaux (1248), V alence (1255), and Avignon (1326). A more serious matter was that these brotherhoods w ere sometimes condemned for fomenting leagues, factions, and diso rder. At the begin- ning of the fourteenth century, they became involve d in political agita- tion and formed federations among themselves, which ultimately led to the temporary abolition of the Parisian brotherhood s in 1306.

Fol lowing the distur- bances and riots of 1380-1382, an ordinance issued on January 27, 1382, suppressed the brotherhoods again, but again, only temporarily. Through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the brotherhoods seemed to have become merely pretexts for holding f easts funded by monies taken in to assist the poor.* In 1524, the C ouncil of Sens declared that these trade communities existed only to encourage monopolies and base debauchery.

Finally, brotherhoods were banned through out the kingdom by the law passed in 1539, on pain of corporal puni shment for those who defied this ruling. The law was initially put i nto effect and a cer- tain number of brotherhoods were dissolved, but the y were not long in reforming. New coercive measures were taken in 1576 and 1579, but the brotherhoods survived all of these condemnation s, each of which remained circumstancial at best. Starting with the seventeenth century, the brotherhoods no longer dared rouse the suspicio ns of an absolute authority and concentrated solely on their charitab le aspects. The Compagnonnages The compagnonnages* formed another kind of associat ion existing on the margins of the trade communities and brotherhoo ds. Historically speaking, the compagnonnages responded to two dif- ferent intentions. The first, and oldest, seems to have been to group together in a kind of de facto federation all the a rtisans of one craft— master, apprentices, and journeymen—above and beyon d all geograph- ical, political, administrative, and jurisdictional divisions. The term guild was as of then unknown. Much more than an ass ociation, it involved a state of mind, a bond, and a means by wh ich workers shar- ing a profession could recognize one another and th ereby maintain the unity and traditions of the trade. The compagnonnages therefore fulfilled duties that were never intended for the brotherhoods and communities. By c easing to be monastic organizations, the brotherhoods simulateno usly lost the uni- versal nature thay had shared with religious orders . At best they only grouped together the craftsmen of one city. Further more, the trade com- munity did not exist everywhere. As a result, the v ast majority of work- ers in the countryside remained isolated as individ uals or small local * [It is preferable to retain the French expression here, for the association has some fea- tures that sharply distinguish it from the term gui ld, which is how this word is often translated. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"164 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING groups. The compagnonnage was in fact a response to the necessity of uniting. In this regard it was the continuation of the ancient collegia. This role played by the compagnonnage diminished in exact pro- portion to the spread of the sworn community, which maintained the sole right everywhere to represent the trade. With respect to spiritual and moral interests, it was the king and Church's i ntention to see that these were managed solely by closely supervised bro therhoods. This meant that the original and spontaneous form of the compagnonnage soon lost its reason for existing. As a group whose purposes were self- contracting, and as a de facto association in headl ong collision with associations that had the full backing of law and c ivil and religious authorities, it could only disappear or become almo st clandestine. But economic and social evolution soon gave the com pagnonnages a new purpose. More and more, the exercise of a tra de was becoming the privilege of masters and their sons. The journe ymen could no longer move up to the status of master nor buy their craft . They were con- strained to remain salaried employees forever. They also lost what few rights they did have—mainly in Paris, Rouen, Reims, and Arras—to take part in trade administration, such as that per taining to writing statutes or nominating sworn members. 19 It was then that the com- pagnonnages transformed from simple de facto connec tions into verita- ble organizations whose membership was restricted t o valets or journeymen determined to defend their class interes ts. This is the reason compagnonnages became more or le ss prohib- ited. The sworn or regulated craft, the sole organi zation of a public nature, had to suffice to promote the legitimate in terests of members of the profession. The coalition formed for the sole p urpose of increasing prices or salaries was forbidden because it carried the risk of a work suspension that would run counter to the public int erest. Beaumanoir, in his Coutumes de Beauvais (written around 1280), considered it a serious crime to ally against the common good for t he purpose of demanding a higher salary. Going on strike was puni shable by prison and a fine of 60 sols. A law passed on March 18, 13 30, mandated the severe punishment of journeymen who, by banding tog ether, had suc- cessfully obtained several additional hours of leis ure from their masters while still earning the same pay."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Mason Corporations in France 165 In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, incident s of this kind were numerous, accompanied even by incidents of collecti ve revolt by jour- neymen against their masters. These flare-ups, howe ver, involved cir- cumstancial coalitions, not permanent associations. The guild, properly speaking, did not appear prior to the beginning of the sixteenth century and it was immediately characterized by its spirit of protest, as illus- trated by journeymen rising up against their master s or by all the arti- sans of a trade joining together against the author ities. Even the journeymen brotherhoods transformed into c enters of revolt that could incite popular fanaticism. In Lyo n, the printers elected a captain, a lieutenant, and ensigns and put togeth er a large league com- prised of all the craftsmen in the city. This leagu e was the soul of the revolt of 1539—nor did the repression it unleash st op new plots and new disturbances from occurring. The Villiers Cotte rets ordinance of 1539, which prohibited brotherhoods, also banned co alitions. A decree of December 28, 1541, also forbid journeymen from \" swearing any oath or monopoly, having any captain or group leade r, assembling out- side the houses of their masters, or bearing swords or daggers.\" Despite these general and individual prohibitions, the brot herhoods of Lyonnaise journeymen and others continued to intrig ue, as is shown by patent letters from 1561. More judicial decisions forbidding the compagnonnag es were handed down in the seventeenth century, such as the counci l arret of June 19, 1702, prohibiting journeymen printers from forming \"any communities, brotherhoods, associations, or common exchanges.\" Despite the general ban on coalitions, however, and taking into account evolution, the police eventually began tole rating the com- pagnonnages as long as their actions did not pose a ny threat to public order. The civil authorites were in fact forced to acknowledge that these associations responded to legitimate concerns that were not being sat- isfactorily addressed in the conventional organizat ions of sworn crafts dominated by masters.

It was in the best interest s of these itinerant jour- neymen to organize in order to ensure for themselve s the availability of lodging in those various towns and places where the y could learn of local job opportunities. The Church was even more poorly disposed to the com pagnon- nages than the civil authorities, condemning them u nder the pretext that their observance of symbols and traditional ri tes parodied that of holy objects and rites and violated their sworn oat hs. There are records of some interesting sentences handed down on May 30 , 1648, and on March 14, 1655, by the Theology School (Sorbonne) c ondemning and at the same time describing the impious, sacreligio us, and superstitious practices of journeymen cobblers, saddlers, tailors , cutlers, and hatters. Some raised the objection that these traditional ri tes had been prac- ticed for centuries by the former religious brother hoods who were guided by the clergy. The Church responded easily t o this objection, however, suggesting that for the propagation of the ir art, especially with respect to symbolic teachings and the preserva tion of their trade secrets, the monks had been under an obligation to preserve them. Furthermore, these rites were traditionally followe d and monitored in a sacred and orthodox fashion. These conditions did n ot apply to the compagnonnages, which no longer included any cleric s among their members and which appeared in the eyes of the Churc h as impious associations when compared to those brotherhoods it once accepted and directed. Finally, and this was the Church's be st justification, it is plausible that even if the compagnonnage rites did not disfigure tradi- tional symbols to a great extent, their deeper mean ing was nonetheless ungrasped by the humble journeymen. It is merely on e step from incom- prehension to superstition. Condemned by royal power and ecclesiastical authori ty, the com- pagnnonages still had one safe haven: the Temple co mmanderies, which, until the Revolution, offered traditional ri ght of asylum to those pursued by the king or Church.

To conclude our look at French professional organiz ations, we must note that starting from the fifteenth or sixte enth centuries, neither the trade communities nor brotherhoods could be con sidered the keep- ers of the traditions of the ancient collegia. The collegia's regulations were meticulous and their role was limited strictly to matters of the pro- fession. The brotherhoods, for their part, had lost sight of their reli- gious, spiritual, and charitable purposes. They all owed themselves to become too often preoccupied by profane concerns, w hich served to justify the many interdictions levied against them by royal or ecclesias- tical authority. Finally, communities and brotherho ods had become individualistic and more or less local in scope. Th ey no longer held that character of universaiism that denoted the Roman co llegia or the brotherhoods of the High Middle Ages. Only the comp agnonnages remained partially faithful to traditions, ideals, and ancient rites, as well as to this quality of universalism. Their spre ad, however, was pro- hibited by the interdictions levied against them an d by their activity, which was restricted to the defense of the interest s of journeymen. The role they might have played in the transmission of initiatory values would go on to become the prerogative of Scotch and English corpora- tive masonry. These forms not only preserved the an cient legacy but also revitalized and enriched it with contributions from other initiatory sources. Also, by removing masonry from its operati ve contingencies, it became possible for it to benefit not just masons b ut everyone whose ambition was to build the ideal temple of Wisdom an d Beauty."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"9 Builders Corporations in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland Builders Corporations of Italy The appearance and development of trade communities in Italy (known as arti in Italian, a word that beautifully expresses the medieval and Christian concept of work) were closely bound t o the communal movement and its circumstances that were unique to this country.

The political process, however, was different from the communal movement in France, Flanders, and Great Br itain. In these countries liberalization was, from the onset, due t o the struggle of the bourgeoisie against the nobles, who often had the s upport of the king. In Italy, in the absence of any unified central aut hority, the source and form of communal institutions were first and foremo st aristocratic. Transforming these communes into states, which they governed, pro- vided nobles with the means to strengthen their pol itical power.

During the first years of the twelfth century, one was mentioned as already being established in B rescia. It is diffi- cult, though, to precisely date the appearance of t hese mastery associ- ations. They were not all in existence at the same time and did not all share the same circumstances. In several regions wh ere Roman influ- ences survived, there was probably a continuity in which the collegia gradually transformed into scholoe, or scuole, and mastery associa- tions. This is precisely what occurred in Ravenna, the capital of the Exarchat. It was possible for mastery associations to attain power by peace- ful means on a gradual basis, as was the case in Pi stoie, Florence, and Pisa. In some areas, however, they prevailed throug h violence, as in Milan (1198) and Bologna (1228). Subsequent battles for influence took place between social classes or between noble families whose members sought to gain government positions as eith er consuls or potentates. In 1165, Emperor Frederic I Barbarossa, when entrusting the earldom of Verona to the count of Saint Bonifac e, also gave him full jurisdiction over all crafts and trades. Similarly, these professions were subject to the commands of the consuls and nobility in the statutes of Parma. 1 In the flourishing cities of Genoa and Venice, the form of power remained aristocratic and its authority remai ned in the hands of the patricians. 2 We should note that this same Frederic Barbarossa, the emperor of Germany who was long at war with the Lombard cities , was finally defeated after many expeditions. Though generally s peaking, the emperors, in their political claims to Italy, were in opposition to the sovereignty of the communes, their choice to side e ither with mastery associations against the nobility or the nobility a gainst mastery associ- ations depended on the circumstances. The mastery associations were often divided into tw o categories: mastery associations of the higher arts and mastery associations of the lower arts. Their numbers expanded proportionately with the increased success of industry, leisure, and the multiplicatio n of wants, and at the same time middle arts made their appearance. The ma stery associa- tions of the masons (magistri lapidum, magistri mur i, muratores) were"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"170 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING sometimes categorized with the inferior arts and so metimes with the higher ones. 3 Thus in Florence there were twenty-one corporations divided into seven higher arts and fourteen lower arts.

The lower arts include d butchers, cob- blers, smiths, salt merchants or regrattiers, oil s ellers, wine merchants, innkeepers, masons and stone carvers, locksmiths, b reastplate mer- chants, leather merchants, wood sellers, bakers, an d stocking makers. Each of these arts had its own meetinghouse and ele cted syndics and consuls who held places of honor in official ce remonies. Each art also had its own color and its own banner or standa rd, which was car- ried at the front of processions. The standard bearer of the Republic was chosen from among citi- zens belonging to the higher arts, while those who were inscribed in the lower arts furnished one fourth of the city's magis trates. There are numerous traces of the builder mastery as sociations from the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth cent uries. For instance, we find them mentioned in town and city statutes, s uch as the masons (cementari) of Milan, the magistri murorum of Parma and Plaisance,4 the muratores of Modena, and the magistri lapidum a nd lignaminis of Florence and Lucca. The Italian mastery association s took on the form of brotherhoods, which is to say they pursued both religious and char- itable goals with the same intensity that character ized their pursuits of a more professional nature. Among the oldest statutes of Italian builders' mast ery associations are those of the Venice stone carvers, dating from 1317 and renewed in 1396. These statutes open with a prayer to the Very Holy Trinity and continue on to express a keen desire to contribute \"to the glory of God and the glorious Virgin Mother Mary, who is our con stant advocate. There is also evidence of the worship of the Four H oly Crowned Martyrs, protectors of the mastery associations. 5 This is quite possibly the earliest mention by builders of the individual worship of the Four Crowned Martyrs, a patronage mentioned in England a t the end of the fourteenth century or the beginning of the fifteent h century and in the statutes of the German stonecutters from the sixtee nth century.

It varies according to version, but this is how it was recorded in The Golden Legend: The four crowned martyrs were Severus, Severianus, Carpoforus, and Victorinus, who, by the commandment of Diocleti an, were beaten with plummets of lead unto the death. The na mes of whom could not be found, but after a long time they were shown by divine revelation, and it was established that their memor y should be wor- shipped under the names of five other martyrs, that is to wit Claude, Castor, Symphorian, Nicostratus, and Simpli cian, which were martyred two years after the four crowned mart yrs. And these martyrs knew all the craft of sculpture or of carvi ng, and Diocletian would have constrained them to carve an idol, but t hey would not carve it, nor consent to do sacrifice to the idols. And then by the commandment of Diocletian they were put into tuns o f lead all liv- ing, and cast into the sea about the year of our Lo rd two hundred four score and seven. And Melchiades, the pope, ord ained these four saints to be honoured and to be called the fou r crowned mar- tyrs before that their names were found. + The feast day of the Four Crowned Martyrs is celebr ated on November 8 and churches in some way dedicated to th em can be found in a number of locations.

Development of mastery associations in Italy was co nsiderably hampered by the extreme territorial divisions of th e country, the politi- cal struggles that endured for centuries, and occup ation of the country by foreign forces. During the sixteenth century, on the fringes of these mason corporations, academies were formed whose pur pose was to emancipate art from the shackles of the association and assert the inde- pendence of artists. The most famous is the Accadem ia del Disegno, the Academy of Drawing, inaugurated in 1563 in Florence under the aus- pices of Cosmo di Medici. Open to sculptors, painte rs, and amateurs (emphasis mine), it was chiefly concerned with the sciences related to architecture and/or the art of drawing—sciences tha t art historian Eugene Miintz (Florence et la Toscane) described as \"transcendent.\" This institution went on to become the Academy of F ine Arts, whose palace on Saint Mark's Square now houses some prest igious collections.

Sometime after the f irst half of the thir- teenth century, trade representatives were admitted into the municipal councils in, for example, Cologne (1259), Frankfurt am Main (1284), Fribourg (1293), and Magdeburg (1294). 6 The builders communities in Germany are among the o ldest.

The oldest of these brotherhoods, which were known as Hutten (lodges) after the name of the locations in which t hey held their meet- ings, is the one in Cologne, which was formed aroun d the year 1250.* Hutten recognized the supremacy of large lodges cal led Haupthutten (principal lodges). In 1275, a veritable masonic co ngress met in Strasbourg to coordinate efforts toward the continu ation of long-inter- rupted work on the cathedral. There the assembly fo rmed a principal lodge and named Erwin von Steinbach as the head arc hitect of con- struction and the master who held the chair (Meiste r vom Stuhl). 7 In total, there were five principal lodges in the a rea including Germany and Switzerland. They were located in Colog ne, Strasbourg, Vienna, Bern (then Zurich), and Magdebourg. Cologne was the first and foremost among them and the master builder of t he cathedral there was recognized as the head of all the masters and w orkers of Lower Germany. Similarly, the person holding this positio n in Strasbourg was recognized as the head of all masters for Upper Ger many. A central mastery association later established in Strasbourg disputed the primacy of Cologne on the basis that construction was less extensive there than in Strasbourg. The jurisdiction of this central ass ociation encompassed lodges from part of France, Hesse, Suavia, Thuringi a, Franconia, and Bavaria. Subordinate to the principal lodge of Colo gne were the work- shops of Belgium and another part of France. The gr eat lodge of Vienna governed the lodges of Austria, Hungary, and Styria , while those of the Swiss were subject to the grand lodge of Bern durin g the time the cathe- dral of that city was under construction, and then to that of Zurich when Bern's seat was transferred there in 1502.

The 1459 assembly, held in Ratisbonne, the seat of the German Diet, was con- voked by Jobs Dotzinger, master builder of the Stra sbourg Cathedral. Those gathered there also dealt with general busine ss concerning archi- tecture and the brotherhood. 9 The signatures affixed to the revised statutes indi cate that the lodges of northern Germany were not represented in Strasbourg or Ratisbonne. These lodges added their voice of suppo rt to the revision at an assembly held in Torgau in 1462 by crafting ordi nances that were described simply as reproductions of the Strasbourg statutes established on the ancient foundations instituted \"by the Holy Martyrs crowned in the honor and glory of the Holy Trinity and Mary Qu een of Heaven.\" 10 A second masonic assembly, also convoked by the Gra nd Lodge of Strasbourg, was held in Ratisbonne in 1464. Along w ith discussing gen- eral lodge business, including reports on buildings then under con- struction, the assembly gave more precise definitio n to the rights and attributions of the four existing grand lodges (in Cologne, Strasbourg, Vienna, and Bern) and named the master builder Konr ad Kuhn to the high mastery association of Cologne. In 1469, the grand lodge of Strasbourg convoked a n ew assembly, this time in Spire. According to Rebold, the object ives of this congress were as follows: 1. To share information concerning the status of all com- pleted religious buildings or of those still being built and those whose completion had been halted; 2. To study the situati on of the brotherhood in England, the Gallic lands, Lombardy, and Germany (which under- scores the international nature of the craft); and 3. To examine relation- ships between the different lodges and their attrib utions.

Germany, and Switze rland 175 assembly in that city to coordinate on measures tha t should be taken relative to accusations and the dangers threatening free masons. The result would have been a kind of charter, dated Jun e 24, 1535, written in Latin, drawn with masonic characters, and addres sed in the form of a circular by the Chosen Masters of the Order of Sa int John to all the lodges of their society.\" But this document would n ot be produced until 1819 by Prince Frederic of Nassau, who had in mind a reformation of Dutch and Belgian Freemasonry, for which he was the grand master. The resulting charter, known as the Cologne Charter , did, however, indicate the existence of a masonic hierarchy of fi ve grades (apprentice, journeyman, master, chosen master, sublime master) and was meant to serve the prince as the basis for the reforms he co ntemplated.* It would have been signed by nineteen illustrious individual s such as Coligny, Bruce, Falk, Melanchton, Virieux, and Stanhope. The se signatories were all present there as delegates from the lodges of London, Edinborough, Vienna, Amsterdam, Paris, Lyon, Frankf urt, Hamburg, and other cities. They decried the imputations of w hich masonry stood accused, notably the accusation of seeking to reest ablish the Templar Order. They believed it necessary to reveal the ori gin and purpose of masonry, so that subsequently, when better circumst ances prevailed, it could be reconstructed after having been forced to suspend its work on the original foundations of its institution. They s pecified that masonic society was Christianity's contemporary, and that i n the beginning it was known by the name of the Brothers of John. They also explicity stated that nothing indicates that they may have be en known under any other name prior to 1440, the year in which they to ok on the title of the Brotherhood of Free Masons, mainly in the Flemi sh city of Valenciennes because it was during that time that h ospices began to be constructed in Hainaut on behalf of the brothers of this order to care for the poor who had been afflicted with Saint Anth ony's Fire.

In 1563, the grand lodge of Strasbourg convoked an important assembly in Basel. This congress endorsed the statu tes that had been revised by a commission appointed by the grand lodg e of Strasbourg. These statutes, dated Saint Michael, 1563, were pri nted that same year. 12 The last large masonic assembly, also convoked by t he Grand Lodge of Strasbourg, appears to have been held in S trasbourg in 1564. Its purpose was to definitively iron out all points of contention between the different lodges. The decision was made there t hat future difficulties would be subjected directly to the grand lodge for final jusgement with no recourse to appeal. 13 The Statutes of the Stonecutters The ancient statutes of the Brotherhood of Stonecut ters (Steinmetzen Bruderschaft) dating from 1459 were not, apparently , the first; there is a good possibility that yet older ones exist. As we have seen, they were revised several times and endorsed by the emperors. Those published in 1563 were the final ones. The rules began thus: 14 \"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and the glorious Mother Mary, and also the Four Crowned Martyrs, their blessed servants remembered eternally.\" Findel writes that before 1440, the members of the origina l Strasbourg labor- ers society bore the name of the brothers of Saint John. He adds that Saint John the Precursor, along with the Four Crown ed Martyrs, had always been the special patron saint and protector of the association. Overall, the statutes of the German stonecutters pr ovide a gripping description of Freemasonry's essential characterist ics:"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Builders Corporations in Italy, Germany, and Switze rland 177 • The associates were divided into masters, journeyme n, and apprentices. • The governance of the organization was entrusted to certain leaders. • The profane was excluded. • Privileges extended to the sons of masters. • Their were conditions governing acceptance into the organization. • The principals of fraternal equality and mutual aid were primary. • Procedures were established for specific jurisdicti on and how lodge judgments would be handed down. • Procedures were established for how meetings would be opened and closed. • There were established initiation rites and forms o f greeting (Gruss) and customs to be observed at banquets. • There was a test that foreign brothers were require d to undergo. The guarantee of secrecy was assured by the way bro thers greeted one another as well as by how they shook hands (Sch enk), although Schenk appears instead to designate feast toasts. T he ancient statutes make no mention of a \"password.\" The sole time ther e is any reference to a password is in the rules of the Halberstadt ma sons, which were filed before the reigning prince in 1693: \"The mast er will tell the worker that he has been welcomed into the order and that he should lock within his heart, at the price of his soul's s alvation, the words (Worter) that have been entrusted to him and that b y no means will he let anyone else know them, save an honest mason, un der penalty of being disbarred from the craft.\" 15 The organization did not pursue only professional a nd social goals. Like the French brotherhoods, it included religious concerns among its objectives: No laborer or master shall be allowed admission int o the order who does not approach the Holy Sacrament once a yea r and who does not observe the Christian law.

On the news of the death of an associate [the maste r] will cel- ebrate a Mass for the comfort of the recently depar ted soul, and thoses masters and journeymen who are then present will attend this pious ceremony. The statutes established at Ratisbonne ordered the celebration of four Masses during the year, including the feast day of the Throne of Saint Peter. The tax imposed for this purpose was two lar ge sous for every work performed by the masters and a denier a week f or the journeymen. The statutes also prescribed fasts, vigils, and Mas ses to be celebrated in a chapel in Strasbourg dedicated to the Virgin. The b uilding of churches was to be performed by the associates, by virtue of the same rules, for \"the enlargement of divine worship and the salvatio n of their souls.\" The Decline of the German Brotherhoods The mastery associations in Germany never attained the same level of power that their medieval Italian counterparts did. Their efforts were sometimes opposed by the cities' aristocrats, somet imes by the feudal lords, and sometimes by the emperor himself. The Bu rgave of Strasbourg had the right to place the masters who h eaded the arts cor- porations. In Worms all such associations were supp ressed in 1233, with the exception of those of the coin minters and the furriers. The statute handed down by Frederic II to the inhabitan ts of Goslar in 1219 expressly forbade mastery associations. A decree is sued in 1232 by this same emperor from Ravenna banned associations throu ghout the empire. In 1378, Charles IV put a stop to the train ing and activities of the arts brotherhoods of Minden, which prompted no intervention by the Episcopal authorities; this decree was later co nfirmed by Charles V.

In sixteenth-century Germany and Switzerland, the s acrifices made by the populace to erect their churches, coupled wi th the blatant abuses commited by the clergy and the popes, had chilled t heir religious fervor, shaken their faith, and made it impossible to compl ete those churches still under construction. It was at this point that Luthe r's reformation occurred, which weakened the very foundations of pa pal authority and halted the construction of the great monuments of C atholic worship. This delivered a mortal blow to the masonic corporations here. By and large, they were greatly dispersed and their remnants were forced to join forces with the mastery associations of the towns' own tra des and crafts guilds. In 1522, the brotherhood in Switzerland was mixed u p in matters that were foreign to the building craft, leading to an order for its grand master, Stephan Rulzislofer of Zurich, to appear be fore the Diet. Because he failed to appear to defend himself, the brotherhood was sup- pressed throughout the territory of the Heovetic Co nfederations. 16 In Germany, those lodges that had not been formally dissolved remained isolated under the guidance of their respe ctive great lodges. After Alsace was made part of France under Louis VI V, the German princes sought to impose limits on the French king' s influence in Germany. It was natural that an association whose m embers were sub- ject to the jurisdiction of French authority—the gr and lodge of Strasbourg—would catch their eye. Accordingly, an a rret issued by the Diet in March 16, 1707, forbade German lodges from maintaining any relationship with the grand lodge of Strasbourg. Th e organization of a grand lodge of Germany failed to be realized. Incor rect intelligence and complaints prompted an edict on August 16, 1731, co mmanding that the grand lodges must henceforth cease being consid ered in that capac- ity. In the future, there was no longer to be any d istincton between them and the secondary lodges and judgment of any trade or organization disagreement was to be deferred to civil tribunals. 17 We should end by noting that in Germany, as in Fran ce, the initiatory traditions of the builders survived only in the com pagnonnages, albeit in a form that was distorted to defend professional or class interests."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"10 The Corporative Masonry of Great B r i t a i n It is in Anglo-Saxon masonry where we witness the b irth of mod- ern speculative Freemasonry. While the tradition wa s dying out on the continent, British masonry was up to the task of tr ansmitting the ancient legacy. We have now looked at the line of d escent: from Roman collegia to the Culdees to the Benedictine monks an d monastic associa- tions to brotherhoods and guilds. The last of these —the guilds—which first appeared in the northern countries, Normandy, and England, offered an instant legal framework for trade organi zations. The first advantage offered by the guild was that i t presented both the professional character of French trade organiza tions and the pious and charitable nature of brotherhoods. Second, even ts in Great Britain favored its development. Not only were British guil ds spared the strict oversight that French kings strove to impose on the trades, but also they were spared the kinds of restrictions and interdict ions that struck the brotherhoods. To the contrary, guilds were encourag ed by both royal power and the Church of England. The climate was th erefore propi- tious for maintaining tradition within the guild. A ccording to the law of history, because it remained alive, this traditi on was structurally enriched over the course of centuries. Masonry, whi ch had taken the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 181 name Freemasonry, now received its principal contri bution from Hermeticists and the Rosicrucian Order after it had ceased being purely operative and accepted speculative members in large numbers. We will now take a look at the characteristics and evolutio n of the British ver- sion of operative freemasonry. The Trade Guilds and Mysteries of Great Britain Guilds (ghilds) were born and grew in Great Britain for the same rea- sons that prompted this development on the Continen t. They were pri- marily tied to the conquest and defense of municipa l franchises. The first guilds were those of the merchants, which were made up of people of the bourgeois class, all of whom were expected to be mem- bers. They controlled commerce and the city insofar as they protected its inhabitants commercially. But over time, a prof ound change took place. These guilds gradually became aristocracies whose membership was hereditary. At this same time the number of inh abitants of the city was growing due to a constant influx of artisans. N either villains or serfs, they had been either emancipated or had fled their masters and had dwelled in cities long enough so that their fre edom had become a right. Being unable to obtain admission into the me rchant guilds, they formed their own craft guilds. Despite the resistan ce offered by the mer- chants, these new guilds developed and grew so effe ctively that by 1735 in London, the city's administration had been trans ferred from a munic- ipal assembly to that of professional associations, including, notably, the Company of the Masons. At this point no one cou ld benefit from the freedoms offered by the city without being a me mber of one of these associations that were then known as mysteries. 1 The word mysteries, borrowed from the French in the Norman era, denoted \"craft\" in old English. Hence the archaic e xpression arts and mysteries, meaning arts and crafts. Etymologically speaking, there was initially confusion among the meanings of the word ministerium (a variant of mistere, from the twelfth century), mean ing \"function\" or \"service\" in Latin, largo sensu, meaning \"craft,\" a nd mysterium, mean- ing \"religious mystery.\" It should be remembered that during the Middle Ages the theater"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"182 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING was first religious and that it emerged almost impe rceptibly from the liturgy. Starting in some Benedictine abbeys in the ninth century, vari- ous episodes from the Passion and Christ's Resurrec tion were staged in order to more effectively instruct and edify an ill iterate populace. The art of stone completed the work of the theater—the theater of the mys- tery plays was reflected in and finalized by the ca thedral—and from this the word mystery was born. Etymologically, it summo ned up antiquity and the most widespread and deeply rooted rites of ancient times. The gospel was first transposed into a spectacle by putting to work the magnificent and evocative dramatic resources he ld in this scripture. This made it possible to present on the stage all t he biblical characters who theologians of the time considered to be foreru nners of Christ. Through these extensions, the mystery became more a nd more popular in nature while at the same time recalling the litu rgy closest to it. It is not out of the question that craftsmen, whose brotherhoods and corporations multiplied the mysteries, began to cull from the spec- tacle both an exoteric meaning—the Passion, literal ly speaking—and an esoteric meaning related to the trade's initiation rites and their connec- tion to Christ's Passion through the themes of puri fication, death and resurrection, and the recollection and remnants of the ancient mysteries. In England these developments took place with the s upport and instruction of the priesthood and allow us to presu me a certain Christianization of a tradition. There were \"miracl e theaters\" that were staged every year by crafts corporations in several cities: Coventry, Chester (1327), York (1350), and Newcastle. We can recall, however, that in France the Parliament of Paris and the Chur ch banned the mys- teries during the sixteenth century. While they had been very popular and imbued with faith during earlier centuries, it was determined that they had become incomprehensible and were debasing their original models. When we turn our discussion to esotericism, however , we shall see that this philosophy, rather than involving impious or hidden secrets or meanings, concerns instead a symbolism that was acc epted as pure and perfectly orthodox during the Middle Ages, when it was even even pro- fessed by the Church. The proof of the transmission of these rites in the ir iniatory and"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 183 Christian sense is perhaps discernable in John Penn el's book, The Constitution of the Free-Masons, published in Dubli n in 1730. For the reception of a journeyman, we find in the invocatio n that opens the lodge the following characteristic phrases: \"We bes eech your blessing, O Lord, on our present enterprise . . . Grace [our ne w brother] with your divine wisdom so that he may be capable of comprehe nding, by means of the secrets of Masonry, the mysteries of piety a nd Christianity.\" Organization of the English Guilds Each profession had its guild or mystery in every l arge city of fourteenth century England. These groups were also known as co mpanies and fra- ternities. (The word corporation was not used durin g the Middle Ages.) Each guild established ordinances to regulate worki ng hours and the details governing admission into the organization. Some obliged mem- bers to make periodic contributions to a common fun d and to take part in certain religious ceremonies or feasts and celeb rations, such as the public stagings of mysteries. The Christian spirit of the guilds can be seen in t he clauses con- cerning the reciprocal assistance that members owed each other. All risks and accidents that might occur in life, all c ases where aid might be necessary—even those that might befall a departure on a pilgrimage— were anticipated by the statutes. A solemn oath preceded acceptance into a guild, eac h of which had a rule calling upon its craftsmen to refrain from r evealing the affairs of the organization. Guild members frequently wore spe cial dress and referred to each other as brother and sister. They had the right to estab- lish their statutes with no need of a charter or an y other form of per- mission from the authorities, but they nevertheless had to obtain a license of mainmort when they sought to take posses sion of lands, which was often the case. In 1389 all guilds filed their ordinances, cus- toms, and deeds and as a result, a great many of th ese can be found today in the London Public Archives. The principal officer of the guild was the master, but there were also wardens and sometimes assistants or a committee mad e up of former officers. Guild members were divided into apprentic es, day laborers,"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"184 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING and free men. The term master was also used to desi gnate any free man who took on an apprentice. Here we pause for consideration of the term free ma n. It is proba- bly more effective for our purposes to use the anci ent French term franc homme, with its connotations that we have already e stablished: This is the franc hons who is neither a serf nor villain bu t has become a free bourgeois, independent of any lord. Going further a long these lines, we come upon the free man craftsman called a free burg ess, which comes from franc bourgeois and means a bourgeois who by f eudal law \"nei- ther owes nor pays the lord anything for the right to his bourgeois sta- tus and is thus free and clear of him.\" The sole members of the guild who could become free men were those whose apprenticehip had been satisfactory and who had fulfilled the obligations of their contracts. A penalty was i mposed upon anyone who took on a young man and taught him the craft wi thout making him undergo the apprentice stage. A specific ceremo ny was performed during corporation meetings for the admission of a new apprentice. It was forbidden for any master to take on an apprenti ce of servile status. Those who knew the craft but had not undergone the obligatory stages were called day laborers or servants; free m en could hire them on condition they their names were inscribed in the co mpany's records. Furthermore, these day laborers could find employme nt only from a free man. In the Exeter stonecutter guild, men from this class of worker called themselves free cutters. The free men who so ught to hire such workers had to acquire a special right of admission for them, and this admission became the occasion for a special ceremon y. Day laborers had the right to designate supervisors as their represe ntatives in certain cases. However, these supervisors were not on equal footin g with free men. Finally, there were restrictions concerning the num ber of servants or apprentices a free man could take on. Sometimes he was not allowed to have any if he himself did not hold a certain po sition. The Origin of English Craft Freemasonry Contrary to what took place in associations in Fran ce, in England there was no duplication of duties between the profession al association and"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 185 the brotherhood responsible for religious practices . The guild assumed responsibility for both kinds of duties. Of course, as was the case throughout medieval Christian Europe, the Church ke pt its hand on the trades and by virtue of this had its own place in t he guild. A priest would thus perform the duties of chaplain. This should not lead us to believe, however, that t he guild enjoyed a kind of monopoly and that there were not, outside its walls, autonomous and even rival brotherhoods that were si multaneously pro- fessional, religious, and charitable organizations, and that also served as keepers—and sometimes better ones—of the traditi on. In all of this we should not overlook one important fact: During the Middle Ages Great Britain, like the countries of th e continent, was sub- ject to feudal law, which was tangibly identical ev erywhere. All cities freed themselves from their manorial bonds under th e same conditions and with the same measures. The guilds, which were the essential cogs in this process, benefited only from the rights and franchises that had been granted to them, and these applied only within the limits of their respective cities. As in other countries, things went differently for the professional brotherhoods that remained tied to the domain and s uzerainty of the religious orders that held all the rights to admini ster justice. This was the case in the jurisdictional areas of the Benedic tine abbeys and the Templar commanderies. The generally extensive franc hises that the arti- sans of these brotherhoods enjoyed extended to all the dependent terri- tories of the suzerain orders and all places where the talents of these artisans earned them summons. This fact is of capit al importance in the formation of freemasonry. There are several documents in England that are qui te important to the study of operative masonry but, contrary to wha t has been previ- ously thought, do not have bearing on modern Freema sonry: In 1212, the court of taxes in London alludes to a company o f cementarii (masons) and sculptores lapidum liberorum (sculptor s in free stone) 2 and in the Workers Statute issued in 1351, which wa s composed in French, there is mention of mestre mason de franche pere [master mason of free stone]. Some have deduced from these texts that the term fr eemason may"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"186 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING have originally designated a sculptor of stone (scu lptores in Latin or latomos in Greek) working free stone, which is to s ay stone that can easily be carved by hammer and chisel, as opposed t o rough stone or hard stone. Later, when the decadence of Gothic art had brought about the gradual disappearence of free-stone sculptors, the term freemason would have been commingled with roughmason, but the first name pre- vailed. This etymology, which Robert Freke Gould al so found dubious, cannot be supported. The word free or franc does no t apply to the craftsman working the stone but to the stone of pur e and good quality that is being worked. In fact, the first use of the term freemason appear ed in 1376 in the license for the franchise of the Company of Masons of London, where it was used in definition of its members. Its exist ence should go back to a much earlier time though (the first half of the t hirteenth century) and its meaning, applied to the masons belonging to the guild, would have evolved etymologically from its French origins. In 1377 William Humbervyle, designated by the title magister operis and free master mason, was hired by Merton College, Oxford. A mason free appears in the Pershore records of 1381. In 1391, in a license composed in Latin by the archbishop of Canterbury, there is reference to the use of twenty- four lathomos vocatos ffremaceons, as opposed to la thomos vocatos ligiers, which denotes liges, or vassals. D. Knoop and G. P. Jones 3 also cite fourteenth- and fifteenth- century texts where there is mention together of fr eemasons, masouns hewers, masoun setters [stone cutters], and masoun legers [stone set- ters]. It is these legers with whom they relate the ligiers cited above. It appears their intention is to show the professional distinctions between the first group—freemasons—and the others. In actua lity, though, by opposing these terms in this way, the authors intro duce an element of confusion to the names of these workers relative to their status and their legal position within their specialization an d type of work. It is a bit like referring today to \"unionized masons\" in o ne part of a text and in another \"cement layers\" and \"tilers\" in such a w ay that each term appears opposed to another. Along with this misleading opposition, we should be wary of ety- mologies. For instance, the word layer, from to lay or lay, could mean"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 187 someone who lays stone or someone of secular status . The word setter could refer to a stonecutter or the member of a set or association, such as a guild. The lay mason dependent upon a guild an d subsequently a ligier, lige, or vassal, could then be opposed to t he freemason, who is free because of his connection to the Church. The 1396 text of the archbishop of Canterbury shows that the term ffremaceons was then recognized as technically Engl ish with no Latin equivalent. It is quite likely that it also confirm s that the term franc maconnerie is to be understood as similar to francs metiers, artisans who were not only free but enjoyed certain franchis es and exemptions. Originally, these franchises were not the property of the trade itself but of the craftsman's domicile. Only the Benedictines, and especially the Templars, assured trade franchises to everyone thro ughout the whole of their domains. Recall that the term franc metier an d, consequently, franc-macon were likely born in the era that witnes sed the formation of trade communities, guilds, and brotherhoods. So whe reas some had only those rights—limited for ratione materiae and ratione loci—that their sovereign lords had the power to grant them, others who had emerged from the monastic associations of the Bened ictine abbeys, and especially the Templar commanderies from the time t hey were at the pinnacle of their power, benefited from the largest franchises in the most extensive territories. Eventually, royal power, inspired by the example se t by the reli- gious orders and by the desire to secure the guilds ' political support, granted charters and franchises to certain trades. It is helpful here to recall the intelligence agents the English kings ke pt in the guilds and brotherhoods of Normandy, Flanders, Guyenne, and in Paris itself dur- ing their endless wars against the kings of France. It was to the advan- tage of these kings to support the power and freedo m of these professional associations—and it is now easier to u nderstand the rea- son for the diametrically opposed policy of the Fre nch kings regarding them. The privileges granted by the king to guilds ensure d these organi- zations independence from the framework of cities a nd allowed them at times to include the profession in all its locat ions thoughout the entire kingdom.

This evolution took shape quickly and is quite visi ble in the late- fourteenth-century texts cited above. The term free mason applied in 1376 to the masons of the Company of London is indi cative of the gen- eralization of the term. On the other hand, the lic ense of the archbishop of Canterbury still clearly shows that distinctions existed between the freemason, in the strict sense of the word, and the ordinary vassal mason (lathomos). Three centuries later a manuscript of the old chart ers of the masons, the Melrose Manuscript dating from 1674, pr ovides the defin- itive status of the terminology used. The frequentl y used expression friemason is presented as being synonymous with the expression free- man mason (master mason) and that of frie men with freemasons. 4 This was now the common application of the generic term freeman or free burgess that was used in guilds' statutes to design ate masters. The Statutes of the Masons English authors, notably Robert Freke Gould, have b elieved the found- ing of the Company of the Masons of London could be established around the year 1220. The oldest statutes that have come down to us, however, are the Ordinance of Workers and the Statu te of Workers, which date respectively from 1349 and 1351. These s et a maximum salary rate for all kinds of workers, including mas ons. The statute, writ- ten in French, mentions \"un mestre mason de franche -pere,\" who draws a higher salary than an ordinary mason. The Ordinances of the Masons of York (1352) appeare d during that same time and was composed in Latin: Ordinacio facto pro cemen- tariis et ceteris operatis fabrico. These were revi sed in 1370 (in a text written in Old English) and in 1409 (in Latin). 5 They concern the con- struction of the cathedral of Saint Paul, regulatin g work (referring to an Inspector of the Work) and insisting on respect for customs.

Another document, dated February 2, 1356 and known as the Articles of London, is a complete, professional, ma sonic instructional composed in French. The eight rules it lists stipul ate that the duration of the apprenticeship period is seven years and that i t is the master's respon- sibility to see that apprentices are justly paid. I t also states that infractions are liable to incur penalties involving fines and i mprisonment. 6 One final document of statutes that we will conside r from this time is the Ordinances of the Norwich Carpenters' Guild (1375), which contains a variety of social and religious directiv es that all masons were subject to equally. It opens with a plea for p rotection addressed to the Very Holy Trinity and a substantial invocati on to God and all the saints. One of the directives it contains deser ves particular empha- sis here: that which commands the brothers and sist ers to gather together on the Saturday following Ascension to giv e prayers in honor of the Holy Trinity and in favor of the Holy Church , \"for the peace and union of the country and for the peaceful repos e of the souls of the departed, not only those of brothers and sisters, b ut those of friends and of all Christians.\" 7 The mention of sisters here proves that women were accepted as members into the builders associat ions, an important fact given that modern Anglo-Saxon Freemasonry rega rds the admis- sion of women with hostility. We should also note t hat at the end of the seventeenth century, English Freemasonry, which was speculative at this time, still continued to admit women member s. Proof of this can be found in the 1693 Statutes of the Lodge of York. Here we read: \"Hee or shee who would be made a mason, lays their hands upon the Book, [the Bible] and then Instructions are given.\" * * Hiram (May-July 1908). It has been noted that thi s text contains the original Latin ille vel illi (he, singular and plural), words that were incorrectly translated as Hee or Shee. See A. Mellor, Les Grands Problemes de la Franc-Mac onnerie d'aujourd'hui (Paris: Belfond, 1971), 108.

The Maso nic Poem, also known as the Royal Manuscript (Regius) or the Halli well Manuscript, from the name of its first publisher, dates from ar ound 1390-1400. 8 This poem, 794 verses of rhyming couplets composed in Old English, shows clearly that the mysteries of the brotherhood were practiced in fourteenth-century England. Numerous clues allow us to attribute the work to a priest who had knowledge of various docum ents related to the history of the organization. He may have held t he role of chaplain or assumed the duties of the brotherhood's secretar y or, most likely, both in an era when people who knew how to read and write were rare.

The Cooke Manuscript dates from 1410-1420 but is a transcrip- tion of a compilation that was at least a century o lder. It is divided into two parts. The first, consisting of nineteen articl es, is a history of geom- etry and architecture. The second is a \"book of dut ies,\" including an historical introduction; nine articles governing th e organization of labor, which were allegedly promulgated at a genera l assembly that took place during the time of King Athelstan; nine counsels of a moral and religious nature; and four rules concerning the social life of masons. The word speculative actually appears in this docum ent: \"the son of King Athelstan was a true speculative master.\" The Cooke Manuscript served as the foundation for the work of George Pay ne, the second grand master of the grand lodge of London, who ensu red that this organization adopted a first rule to Saint John in 1721. It also appears to have been the principal source from which Anders on drew his Book of Constitutions. In addition to the Masonic Poem (Cooke Manuscript), we also have the texts of old charters and statutes concerning c orporative Masonry. There are a great many versions of these, which are known as old charges, and none of them dates earlier than the en d of the sixteenth century, 9 yet their language seems to indicate that they are copies of much older documents.

The Legendary History of Freemasonry All the ancient charters, despite their various dis tinguishing features, follow the same general outline. They open with an invocation to the Trinity and more or less continue as follows: \"Good Breathren and Fellows, our purpose is to tell you how and in what manner this wor- thy craft of masonry was first begun.\" A memorandum declaring that geometry is the oldest of the sciences and the grea test of the seven lib- eral arts follows this. These are the essential poi nts it covers: 11 After the Flood, Hermes found one of two pillars + in which the scriptures con- taining all the sciences had been hidden. He absorb ed all the knowledge that he rediscovered, taught it to humanity, and be came the father of all sages. The legend goes on to state that Nimrod (or Nimroth ), king of Babylon, provided his masons with a \"rule\" stating that they should be loyal to each other and love each other. It is said that he also gave them two other rules concerning their science, though it is not known what these were. The next major figure in the narrative was Abraham. He left his native region on the Euphrates River for Egypt, whe re he taught the Egyptians the seven sciences. One of his students w as Euclid. During this time, the nobility were giving birth to so man y children that they were at a loss as to how to find uses for all of th em. It was Euclid who, with the king's permission, taught the noble childr en geometry (and it was during this era that this science was given its name) and then saw to it that they built temples, churches, and castle s. Euclid also granted his masons a charge or license stating a number of directives, among * In a history of Staffordshire published in 1686, Dr. Plott included a history of the freemasons. The legendary story he recounts is clea rly based on a version of the ancient charters that closely corresponds to William Watson 's document, which is written in the style of English that was commonly used at the end of the fifteenth century. + According to the Cooke Manuscript, Pythagoras foun d the second pillar after the Flood."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 193 them that the masons owed the king their loyalty, t hat they should ren- der assistance to each other and call one another \" brother,\" that they should deserve their wages, and that they should de signate the most skilled among them as director of the work and call him \"master.\" Finally, Euclid ordered his masons to hold an annua l assembly. The legend next speaks of David, who loved and cher ished the masons and gave them licenses. His son, Solomon, ga thered together 80,000 masons, including 1,000 masters, and finishe d the construction of the Temple. Hiram, king of Tyre, who greatly lov ed Solomon, pro- vided him with the wood he needed for the construct ion and sent him an artist who was the very spirit of wisdom. This m an's mother was of the Nephtali tribe and his father was a man of Tyre , and his name was also Hiram. (Some versions of the story describe hi m as the son of King Hiram; others give his name as Amon or Aymon.) Ther e had been no one like him in the world before his time. A master mason of great nobility and refined knowledge, Hiram was master of the construction, all the builders of the Temple, and all the carved and sculpted works in the Temple and the surrounding area. The legend then leaps ahead several centuries and r ecounts how Namus Graecus,* who had taken part in the building of Solomon's Temple, introduced masonry into France by teaching it to Charles Martel, who then instructed the men of France in it s mysteries. + The tale then arrives at Saint Alban, the patron saint of masons, who granted them a personal charter. ++ Subsequently, masonry suffered from a series of wars until the era of King Athelst an, who greatly esteemed the masons, and his son Edwin, who himself became a mason. It was Edwin who issued the Charges of the M asons during an Assembly held in York in 926. At this point the story abruptly comes to a halt. This briefly describes the legend that was reproduc ed, with different * It should be noted that this name simply replaces a Greek name that a former copier was unable to decipher.

There is no need to point out its anachronis ms and historical fan- tasies; these in no way detract from its importance from an esoteric point of view. It is important to note the abrupt ending of the le gend with the Congress of York in 926 when all the existing versi ons of the ancient charges are dated to after the end of the fourteent h century. Why was there no effort made by the compilers to update the legend, at least to the year 1400? We have to assume that either the or iginal legend was drawn up shortly after the last event it mentions, which is to say around 926, and was then copied by craftsmen who gave no t hought to any continuation; or that it was the result of a later compilation by some writer who had a special reason for stopping the st ory at the time of Athelstan and Edwin. The first assumption is not supportable. Historical ly, it is impossi- ble to speak of a corporation or crafts guild from the beginning of the tenth century. The mention of Euclid in almost all of these texts, how- ever, gives us a means to set the earliest possible date on which the leg- end was crafted. The works of Euclid were most like ly completely unknown in England before they were introduced ther e by Adelard of Bath in 1130. 12 In favor of the second hypothesis, we have the fact that in 1389 Richard II requested that the corporations file the ir statutes, indicate the origins of their formation, and provide an inve ntory of their prop- erty. It was completely in a corporation's interest to produce a charter because it would strengthen its position within the city and could serve to show its seniority. It was also advantageous to trace seniority back to Athelstan, who was the last Angle king and was b oth the first and the last to hold uncontested domain over his entire kingdom. He was also, as noted earlier, a great legislator, and he granted various charters to certain cities that referred to guilds that, if not professional, were at least religious."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 195 The Masons' Obligations After the conclusion of the legendary history, the ancient charters listed the obligations imposed upon the brothers, indicati ng that they had been agreed upon by several assemblies of masters a nd journeymen. These rules consisted of a varying number of genera l charges followed by a series of special obligations. Concerning these obligations, it helps to examine f irst the require- ments that were of a religious nature. All of these documents stress the profoundly Catholic nature of the fraternity: \"The mason's first duty is to be faithful to God and the Holy Church, and to f lee from heresy and error\"; \"Whosoever exercises the art of masonry sho uld honor God and his Church. Whosoever wishes to learn this art, must first and foremost love God, the Holy Church, and all the sai nts\"; \"Each of its members humbly beseeches All-powerful God and his m other, the gen- tle Virgin, for the grace of being faithful to his duties.\" The statutes also require that the feasts ordained by the Church be s anctified. They also stress that in order for each worker to behave dece ntly, all must observe certain rules, which are described in meticulous de tail. Following the obligations, the ancient charters pro vide a clue con- cerning the oath of the \"new men who have not yet b een received,\" by which are likely meant the masons who have recently completed their apprenticeships and become qualified workers. The H arleian Docu- ment (circa 1650) provides a detailed formulation o f an oath that could be equally appropriate for a speculative Mason. Thi s is also true for the text of the statutes published by the Masonic Assem bly of December 8, 1663. This is the text of article 7 of these statut es: That no p'son shall be accepted a Free Mason, or kn ow the secrets of the said society, until he hath first taken the oath of secrecy here- after following: —I, A. B., doe in the presence of Almighty God and my fellows and brethren here present, promise a nd declare that I will not at any time hereafter, by any act o r circumstance whatsoever, directly or indirectly, publish, discov er, reveale, or make knowne, any of the secrets, priviledges, or co unsells, of the fraternity or fellowship of Free Masons, (559) whic h at this time,"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"196 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING or at any time hereafter, shall be made knowne unto mee. So helpe mee God, and the holy contents of this booke [empha sis mine]. 13 This oath is also significant. The last phrase, whi ch I emphasized, indicates that the oath was made on the Bible, most likely on the gospels. We have observed this earlier in France, i n Etienne Boileau's Le Livre des Metiers, and in England in the 1352 Regul ation of the York masons. Closer to the present, this instruction can be found in the 1683 Statutes of the York Lodge cited earlier. This stat ute specifies that \"One of the Elders takes the Book; he or she who would b e made a mason places his or her hands upon the Book, and then the Instructions are given.\" The text goes on to say, \"It is a matter of great peril for a man to perjure himself upon the Book.\" We shall see, wh en studying masonic ritual, that the Bible, the square, and the compass were con- sidered to be the three symbolic \"pillars\" of the l odge. The revised statutes of 1639 remain perfectly Catho lic, or at least follow Catholicism to the letter. Nevertheless, one doubt may cross our mind. The text commands masons to be \"faithful to G od and the Holy Church,\" but it so happens that this statute was pu blished under the reign of the Protestant William of Orange, who had shown his approval of freemasonry and even joined it in 1640. So what Holy Church did the writers have in mind? Was it the Roman Church o f the Anglican Church? We shall see that the problem was quietly a ddressed by the publication of new masonic statutes in 1694 from wh ich the reference to the Holy Church was simply removed. Whatever the exact form of worship the authors of t he statutes may have had in mind, the statute of 1693 clearly confi rms the overall Christian character of freemasonry. Operative Freemasonry in Scotland In Scotland there is important information on mason ic history provided by the statutes (the Schaw Statutes) that were sign ed and promulgated by William Schaw, master builder of the king and ov erseer of the masons toward the end of the sixteenth century.

They are essential ly practical rules established by the masters of the corporation gathe red in Edinburgh and set as mandatory for all masons to observe. The first date from 1598 and, on the whole, correspond to the rules of other crafts corpo- rations. These concern the election of lodge office rs, restrictions con- cerning admission of apprentices, and other purely operative matters. The first two articles command obedience and honor and anticipate a masonic initiation about which no details are given . Included are sim- ply a mention of the taking of the oath and the tra nsmission of the \"mason's word.\"* Characteristic in this regard is t he manuscript known as the Edinburgh Register House, dated 1695, which explicitly states that the oath is made on the Bible and that the candidate \"swears by God, Saint John, the square, and the compass.\" T his gives the strong impression that the oath in Scotland was made on th e Gospel of Saint John. Another series of statutes dating from 1599 was cer tainly set out by the Old Lodge of Kilwinning. The Lodge of Edinburgh is mentioned in these as the first and primary lodge of Scotland, K ilwinning as the sec- ond, and Stirling as the third. The statutes define the lodge's jurisdiction and establish its mandatory taxes. The warden had t he power to verify the qualities and aptitudes of the fellows, as well as to expel those found wanting. It is also said that he could appoin t a secretary. These statutes employ the terms apprentice, journeyman, a nd master, which proves the existence of these three grades in Scott ish operative freema- sonry, whereas things are much more vague in the En glish craft. The Mason Companies and the Authorities As indicated above, the guilds, notably those of th e masons, as a gen- eral rule benefited from the favor of British civil and religious powers. *Robert Kirk, an Aberfoill minister, writes in 1691 : \"I have found five curiosities in Scotland, not much observed to be [known] elsewhere ... 2. The Mason's Word, which though some make a Mystery of it, I will not concea l a little of what I know; it is like a Rabbinical tradition in [the] way of comment on Iac hin and Boaz, the two pillars erected in Solomon's Temple, with the addition of some secr et sign delivered from hand to hand, by which they [the Masons] know and become familiar with one another.\" Quoted by Gould, A Concise History of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"198 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING Of course, we can certainly cite arrangements that were made against them, but these were particular cases due to very s pecific circumstances. An example of this rare animosity occurred in 1360- 1361, when the Statute of Workers was published again. This te xt included a meas- ure according to which all alliances and associatio ns of masons and carpenters, as well as assemblies, chapters, ordina nces, and oaths that could be established between them, would be annulle d. It might seem, at first glance, that all of this was directed agai nst the obligations and meetings of the masonic order. This seems even more obvious by the existence of an array of many intermediary statutes of the same kind, such as an ordinance from 1389 and the bill crafted by Parliament in 1425 at the urging of the bishop of Winchester, tut or of King Henry VI, who was then still in his minority. This bill state s that the assemblies of masons imperil the law and that consequently they w ould no longer be allowed to convene. Prison and a fine, according to the king's good pleasure, would punish those who violated this ban. In truth, it seems that the actual scope of this bi ll has been exag- gerated. What it suppressed, or proposed to suppres s, was not at all lodge meetings or the yearly assemblies held by the order, but those gatherings, comparable modern strikes, that were or ganized with the intention of forcing the hand of the authorities or the masters. Proof of this can be seen, according to Rebold, in the great assem- bly that was nonetheless held in York on Saint John 's Day in 1427, which protested against the 1425 bill that otherwis e would have remained of no consequence. 14 Similarly, an entry in the Latin register of William Mollart, prior of Canterbury, shows that in 1429, while King Henry was still a minor, a lodge was held in C anterbury under the sponsorship of Archbishop Henry Chichery and attend ed by Thomas Stapylton, master; John Morris, described in Franco -Norman as cultos de la Lodge lathomorum, or \"warden of the masons lo dge\"; fifteen fel- lows; and three apprentices, whose names are also l isted. 15 The importance of the restrictions imposed by the 1 425 bill ought to be viewed in their proper proportion. These inte rdictions were, at most, local matters by virtue of the independence o f the corporations and lodges of each city during a time when the idea of multiple obedi- ences did not exist. They were certainly merely mat ters of place and"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The Corporative Masonry of Great Britain 199 opportunity, which is the reason they can be found periodically repeated in specific and varying circumstances, pro of that they were quickly forgotten. As an example, in 1436-1437, an edict was issued restricting the privileges of the brotherhood of En glish masons; in 1495 King Henry VII banned the use of signs of recogniti on by masons and confirmed the edicts of Henry VI. 16 It is perhaps risky to mention the legend according to which Queen Elizabeth, because she was ineligible to be admitte d into knowledge of the mysteries, harbored suspicions of the masons, w hich their enemies did not fail to encourage. Things reached such a po int that orders were given on December 27, 1561, day of the annual celeb ration of the York Order, presided over by Sir Thomas Sackvill, to sen d soldiers to break up the assembly. Complaints lodged by some of the m ost eminent national figures convinced Elizabeth to end her opp osition to the gath- erings of members of the order. The queen eventuall y became a protec- tor of the masonic brotherhood and confirmed the ch oice of Sir Thomas Sackvill as master. 17 In contrast to the occasional interdiction, facts i ndicate that com- panies of masons enjoyed a good deal of considerati on at this time. The Articles of London (1356) describe the corporation as \"an enterprise quite apt for leading (the work) to a successful co nclusion.\" In 1417, the Company of London received its official arms. 18 In 1427 and 1429, the assemblies of York and Canterbury, respectively , received arms, with the latter group held under the sponsorship of an archbishop.* In 1472, a new coat of arms was granted to The Hole Cr aft and Fellowship of Masons of London, a privilege that it was the first among guilds to obtain. 19 On June 24, 1502, the same Henry VII who had renewe d the 1425 bill presided over the holding of a grand lodge in London on the occa- sion of the laying of the first stone of Westminste r Chapel. 20 This is the second historical event, following the Saint John's day Assembly of 1427, where we find Saint John invoked. A century later in 1586, at the dawn of speculative Freemasonry, * It has even been claimed that King Henry IV was i nitiated into the masonic brother- hood in 1442. His example would have been followed by all the lords of his court.

The situation here wa s thus completely different from the one that prevailed in France, wh ere the ancient brotherhood found itself divided between the strict ly regulated trade, which was controlled and confined to a professional role, and the stricto sensu brotherhood, which was quite often ba nned and often sus- pect in the eyes of the Church. In England, the companies or fraternities of crafts men retained the unity and traditions of the earlier brotherhoods. R estrictions imposed upon them by the king were limited only to specific periods of time and for specific purposes. Furthermore, the corporation s were to a large extent the masters of their rules. Finally, they ne ver collided with the hostility of the clergy. In fact, there is no visib le instance of any con- demnation laid upon them by the Church. When the bi shop of Winchester stepped in in 1425, it was not as a past oral figure but as a holder of temporal power. It was only following the Reformation and the dynastic changes that Freemasons—not only the S cots but the English as well—because they remained faithful to t he Catholic reli- gion, or at least maintained traditional rites and customs, incurred the wrath of the Anglican clergy. Later we will see how they skirted this danger by creating the Grand Lodge of London in 171 7. The Masonic Bond Outside of those connected to religious orders, gui lds and brotherhoods alike retained a local character because of the way they originated. Their organizations and activities were confined to particular cities, which was as true for the companies or brotherhoods of masons as for any. Despite the widespread movement of their statu tes and franchises into general use, thanks to the favor of public off icials, their authority was limited in each instance to the city in which t he craftsmen grouped together. Because of the unique aspects of the buil ders trade, however, it was impossible for their organization to remain strictly local.

Work needs and manual labor conferred an itinerant character to masonry. There was constant intercommunication betw een lodges; not only was each brother expected to be admitted into the lodge of every city where his work took him, but larger constructi on projects necessi- tated the collective travel of lodges and the abili ty to work together. It was therefore necessary for masons to possess or em ploy signs of recog- nition. Equally crucial were the existence of a sin gle technique and com- mon practices. In general, it was necessary to pres erve the procedures and secrets of the craft. The defense of these common interests, the maintain ance of tradi- tions, the need to make certain that lodge statutes conformed to these traditions, the necessity of spreading and teaching the science and tech- niques of the order—all of this led to the creation of a higher organiza- tion, which was regional at the least, but to a cer tain extent national, if not international. This organization displayed itse lf in three ways: • In the holding of periodic assemblies to expedite m atters of gen- eral interest • In the recognition of regulating lodges, known as a ncient lodges or mother lodges • In the nomination of a common protector, called mas ter or grand master This same unifying phenomenon is what we saw earlie r in Germany. An important observation must be made, however. Thi s organization was strictly limited to the defense of common inter ests and to the respect of charters and traditions. It was not at all a pre cursor of a permanent legislative and administrative body or a prefigurat ion of the different obediences, which did not make their appearance unt il 1717, with the formation of the Great Lodge of London.

Its legend states that its constituti on goes back to the charter of Edwin in 926, which is why the Old Lodge of York refused to recognize the authority of the Grand Lodge of En gland, when the lat- ter was instituted in London in 1717. Considerable progress toward organization was achie ved at the beginning of the sixteenth century. In 1509 Cardina l Wolsey, then chan- cellor, united the corporations of masons and other associations of the building trade into a grand guild for which Saint J ohn would be the patron saint. 22 In 1567, after Sir Thomas Sackvill resigned as mast er of the masons of York, the confraternity formed two branches, one for northern England that was dependent on the York Lodge, whose master was the earl of Bedford, the other for the south, which rec ognized the jurisdic- tion of the London Lodge and its master, Thomas Gre sham. 23 It was only after the meeting of the Masonic Assemb ly of York on December 27, 1663, a time in which Freemasonry had already become speculative, that the title of grand master was san ctioned, although it conferred no administrative authority on the figure thus designated. In fact, the person in this role could be only a \"prot ector,\" granting his patronage to the corporation. The powers of the gra nd master were not actually created until 1717, with the Grand Lodge o f London. According to legend, the first grand master or \"pro tector\" was Henri Jermyn, earl of Saint Alban, who at the same time was named to and decorated into the Order of Bath during a sessi on over which King Charles II presided.

The Schaw Statutes make mention of another lodge, t hat of Stirling, which also held authority over a certain number of workshops. A fourth very old Scottish lodge, one which the Schaw Statutes does not mention but which can be found in city documents of 1483, is the Lodge of Aberdeen. The Scottish lodges had as their judges and heredit ary patrons, who would now be called grand masters, the Saint Clairs , the Barons of Roslyn, and the Earls of Orkney and Caithness. 25 This hereditary priv- ilege went back to the Scottish king James II who, in 1438, granted the right of jurisdiction to the masters of the Scottis h lodges. They were authorized by him to establish personal tribunals i n all the large cities, using the proceeds from a four-pound tax levied on each mason gradu- ating to the rank of master, so that the privileges of freemasons would be protected. Furthermore, the lodge masters were a uthorized to impose an admission fee on each new member. In 1439 , James II named William of Saint Clair, lord of a family of French origin who came to England with William the Conqueror, to the dignity of master of the Scottish lodges. A document delivered by the masons of Scotland in 1628 and signed by all the lodge representatives co nfirmed to William Saint Clair's successor the dignity and hereditary rights of this same position. Although the extent of these rights was s ubsequently con- tested, the Saint Clair family invoked them until 1 736. We can still find a trace in Scotland of other offi cers exercising * While discussing the Templars, we learned the leg end of the creation of this rite as well as that of the foundation of the Order of the Thist le of Saint Andrew.

In summary, we have observed that in Great Britain as on the Continent the necessities of the mason's profession created a bond between different lodges.

The master builder monks of the Carolingian and Rom anesque eras traveled widely, some emigrating from motherhouses to found new monasteries in far places while maintaining close r elations with their home abbeys. These relations often included sending monks with artis- tic expertise. The minor abbeys sent their novices to study in those monasteries that were famous for their inhabitants' knowledge of sci- ence. Monks, like laypeople, often went on pilgrima ges to Rome, Compostela, and the Holy Land. While journeying, th ey made numer- ous stops where they would learn much, thus benefit ing from their for- eign experience. Often the title of master builder was enough to earn a place in the retinue of lords who made expeditions to distant lands. Later, lay artists, like monks, traveled great dist ances. French artists could be found in all the countries of central Euro pe.

Until the Renaissance, architecture —in fact, culture as a whole—retained a very internatio nal character. Free- masons were part of this, forming a truly catholic, universal group that traveled ceaselessly from one country to another to employ the secrets of their craft, their art. This international movem ent is why it is often difficult to speak of schools as defined by their g eographic location. It is important to comprehend how this internationa l understand- ing manifested itself on the spiritual and religiou s planes as well as on the operative plane of labor unity, which means we must discover how this unity was guaranteed among builders and betwee n builders as a group and the profane and temporal powers of the ti me. The Christian Character of Freemasonry Their religious foundation was the essential glue o f all the builders groups of the Middle Ages. For the monastic brother hoods, the propa- gation of the faith was the direct impulse for the construction of con- vents and churches. The vast brotherhoods that buil t the Gothic cathedrals responded to this religious inspiration. It was an era when \"man looked up at the heavens with faith, in search of hope and con- solation. He entrusted his misery to she who should no doubt under- stand it best, because she was weak and she was a w oman, and she could best speak to He who could do all, because sh e was the Mother of God. He built for the Lord of Lords; he built fo r Our Lady . . . 1 It was a time when Christians could be seen \"leavin g their native land to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the con struction of a cathedral rising on the banks of a foreign river . . . and then, after twenty or thirty years of laboring in complete obsc urity, the cross would shine from atop the sanctuary built by their hands, and they moved on, without leaving their names, to die in pe ace, in the blessed thought that they had made something for God.\" 2 This enthusiastic faith continued to animate the cr aft communities as they began forming. Over the centuries, religion permeated the lives of men and their work itself could not be separated from its sacred nature. It was the ascetic path of the Christian li fe that led to God. Craft associations could not be solely professional in nature, for if they"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Universal Freemasonry 207 were, as was the case in France, a religious brothe rhood claimed the same members as the trade group. Thus in these asso ciations, priests played a mandatory leader's role. It is beyond doubt that religion and metaphysics we re a part of the lodges' practices, all the more so as they gave she lter to artists and scholars as well as simple craftsmen, and as study gradually turned on a philosophy that was identical to theology. Though it would seem that the religion of the build ers was Roman Catholicism, it is still frequently claimed by Free masons and their adversaries alike that this was and is not so. Cite d as evidence of this are their pagan traditions, their skeptical attitud e that grew from con- stant travel and contact with diverse peoples, and the sculptures they used to adorn the portals of the churches they buil t. The most extreme theory that has been presented in this regard claims that Freemasonry was the supplier of Maniche an and Cathar propaganda. This theory was triggered early on by A bbe Barruel in his Memoires pour servir a l'histoire du Jacobisme (179 8). The Germans Krause and Eckert espoused it again during the nine teenth century.* The theory is based on the notion that the leaders of M anicheism, the quin- tessential Gnostic sect, joined forces to wage all- out war against the Catholic Church. Because Rome was the center of the Church's strength that flowed out in all directions, the Manicheans r esolved to make it the headquarters of their apostles. During this time, t he Church's monaster- ies were bringing up the flower of youth and educat ing citizens in the arts. Hence, the necessity for the Manicheans to fe ign a fervent piety and devote themselves to the monastic profession, where , through teaching, they could win the credit and authority of both nob les and craftsmen and converts to their sect. The Manicheans did not hesitate to set their hearts on the builders associations as being the mo st likely to play into their intentions. Among themselves they soon formed an organized group and founded a grand lodge in Rome. Its adherents to ok on the name of the Johannite Brothers and established themselves a s an association * See also Abbe Lecanu, L'Histoire de Satan (1861), which detects numerous Manichean, Gnostic, and Cathar influences in Romanesque symbol ism.

Their renown spread throughout the Church; France, England, and Germany enviously requested their supp ort. Of course, this hypothesis is merely based on legen d; not one his- torical element nor even any probability exists to accredit it. The same can also be said of similar theories suggesting tha t in connecting the Templars to the freemasons, the alleged heresies of one group are imputed to the other. Yes, the builders association s were subject to Templar influence; this was clearly demonstrated in chapters 6 and 7. But there is no sound supporting evidence that thes e influences could have caused builders, masons, and carpenters to dev iate from the orthodox Catholicism of that time—especially given, as we have seen, that the Eastern, Muslim, and Gnostic influences ab sorbed and trans- mitted by the Templars did not provide grounds enou gh to label them heretics. Although it is reasonable enough to assum e that tendencies that are not considered heretical in one era can be considered so in another, it is easy to see that the associations or brotherhoods of builder craftsmen that were created and nurtured under the aegis of the Templars continued to live, with their rites and sy mbols, traditions and franchises, under the protection of the Templars' s uccessors, the Hospitallers and the Knights of Malta, whose religi ous orthodoxy has never been in doubt. In order to dispel any misunderstanding, it is help ful to emphasize here how the medieval mind conceived of religious o rthodoxy. In the Middle Ages and up until the Reformation, though th eology was the chief topic of debate, freedom of expression was qu ite considerable. While not more expansive, the notion of orthodoxy w as much more flexible than it is today, for the essential dogmas hadn't varied over time. Certain systems that today may appear daring, at least to Catholics, were never suspected by Christians of be ing heretical before the Council of Trent. The reasons they were now con sidered suspect arise from the counter-reformation that shrouded th e division of the Christian world.

This was the era when Raymond Lulle reconciled the Jewish Kabbalah and Christianity; when Abelard, Saint Bern ard, Saint Thomas, Roger Bacon, and Gerson gave new life to th e theories of Aristotle; when Arab works spread throughout the Un iversity of Paris. It was also the time when Marsilio Ficino, perceivi ng the philosophical continuity connecting the systems of Zoroaster, Her mes, Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato, developed them further with the assistance of the Kabbalah and Christian philosophy. Meanwhile hi s colleague, Pico della Mirandola was kabbalistically analyzing Genes is and declaring that no science proved Christ's divinity better tha n Magic. Another Renaissance scholar, Pietro Pomponazzi, was denying , in the name of Aristotle, the immortality of the soul, or the immo rtality of conscious- ness; and was establishing that everything occurs i n the world through generation, in accordance with necessary laws; and was daring to found a morality that was based on its own merits, one th at was disinterested in either hopes or fears of another life. Not one o f these philosophers was accused of heresy. The only one of those mentio ned here who ran afoul of the authorities, Roger Bacon, was imprison ed for sorcery, not heresy.

During the Middle Ages, it was the clerics and eccle- siastics who oversaw the building of the churches a nd who paid the masons. How likely is it that they would allow them selves to be insulted to their faces in this way and immortalized in this fashion on buildings intended for posterity?* These representations corr espond instead to the mores of a time when what constituted the borde rs of license or convention were not at all the same as our own. It is most important to avoid viewing the audacious sculpture of the gargoyles and tympanums as merely a liberal manifes tation of some- what satiric artists who have seen behind the scene s and grasped more than others what was actually going on there. These fantasy depictions show that the freedom of the stone had been in prac tice for many cen- turies before that of the press. What was attacked were the mores of the clergy and not the religion itself. Such art reconc iled with religion in perfect piety. The clerics themselves were not scan dalized by it.

The brotherhoo ds and communities fulfilled an educational mission insofar as each ma ster instructed jour- neymen and apprentices in the craft. Rather than being merely technical, this instructio n assumed a basic minimum knowledge of geometry and art in an era whe n work was not at all specialized and the master builder was simul taneously architect, entrepreneur, mason, carpenter, stonecutter, and sc ulptor. He had to pos- sess all the knowledge that Vitruvius demanded of t he architect during Augustus's century, namely mathematics, arithemetic , geometry, physics, history, astrology, music, and even jurisprudence, rhetoric, and medicine. Perfection in the art of building implied a quintes sence of the sciences and human talents: \"This art, which consists of giving proportion to the dif- ferent parts of a monument, to raise those bold spi res and audacious belltowers, to curve those vaults beneath which sou nd, far from dimin- ishing, will take on a more harmonious fullness, wo uld seem to be a magic art.\" 3 It was the first and noblest of them all; it was t he Royal Art. To builders it was so incomprehensible that science could be excluded from their areas of expertise that in 1401 the Parisian master Jean Mignot unleashed a controversy involving the M ilanese artists who had reproached him for the fact that his argume nts were in the domain of science and not art because, they insiste d, the two were entirely different. Mignot indignantly responded: \" Art without science does not exist (Ars sine scientia nihil est).\" 4 Of course, such vast knowledge could be the privile ge of only the most gifted individuals. But even the least of mast ers had to possess a minimum of equally developed skill and culture. So there is nothing sur- prising in the fact that the time of apprenticeship for masons and car- penters was six to seven years. Its duration eventu ally decreased as technical and social advancements brought about a g reater divison of labor and a greater emphais was given to specializa tion. In an era when teaching in general and mathematics in particular were barely developed, the builders, more than any other craftsmen, possessed true secrets. Teaching in part came in th e form of a profes- sional initiation that included the knowledge of na tural forces, the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"212 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING properties and effects of these forces, the science of numbers and meas- ures, geometry, and arithmetic. Because the science and practice of this speciality had to remain the privilege of craft mas ters, it was necessary to avoid at all costs divulging anything to \"laypeo ple\" or to competitors. It was forbidden to teach the art of building to si mple manual labor- ers. In order to maintain their monopoly, all build ers were enjoined to jealously use secrecy.* The necessity of prudence a lso dictated the impossibility of writing down the principles of the art, which explains why we have no architectural treatises from the Mid dle Ages except for the album of Villard de Honnecourt, which is un intelligible to the noninitiated. + Because of the sacred nature of anything related to work and the secrecy explicit in their oath, any builder's revel ation would have been tantamount to sacrilege. To gaurantee the internati onal unity required by their craft, it was necessary that freemasons ow n privileges and fran- chises that transcended the temporal and were valid in all lands. Fulfilling this need was the role of the Church. It was also necessary that builders share common signs and a universal la nguage by which they could recognize one another. Esoterically, thi s need was fulfilled by the use of symbols; exoterically, it was met by use of the French language. International Privileges The Church was the sole power capable of granting a nd guaranteeing to builders a privilege of internationality that ea rned them \"freedom of passage.\" Generally speaking, the Chruch was a cons tant presence in the performance of work. In this instance, its inte rvention was given even more justification because the work consisted mostly of the con- * According to Etienne Boileau's Livre des Metiers, masons, mortar makers, and plas- terers could have \"as many assistants and valets of their trade as it pleased them, pro- vided they revealed to none of them any information about their craft.\" Article 13 of the statutes of the Ratisbonne stonecutters from 14 58 listed similar prescriptions. + C. Enlart, 68. \"In the Middle Ages artistic or ind ustrial property was understood and protected differently from how we envision it.

Spiritual authori ty and unity were interrelated. This was why builders communities identified with m onastic asso- ciations. Their ecclesiastical quality conferred up on craftsmen the priv- ilege of internationality. The builders, both lay a nd clerical, who belonged to the Benedictine, Cistercian, and Templa r brotherhoods could circulate freely, build, and settle anywhere in the whole of Christendom. Their freedom was guaranteed by the im munity and sov- ereignty of the Church to which they belonged. Later, because of feudal bonds the communities that had turned sec- ular would continue to enjoy the same privileges an d franchises they assumed when they were religious dependents. More i mportant, all craftsmen had the right to asylum and the free exer cise of their trade in the domains of the Templar commanderies and the pop es maintained these privileges for domains held by the Knights Ho spitaller or Knights of Malta until the time of the French Revolution. W hen we recall that the Temple numbered some 900 commanderies, many of which were extensive, and 10,000 castles, we can see how opera tives, especially masons who traveled widely, could be assured of fin ding hospitality, security, and work everywhere they went. The popes also conferred these privileges, valid th roughout the Catholic world, to the lay masons that built church es. 5 Boniface IV granted these craftsmen the first diploma of franch ises in 614. During this time, however, there were not any true lay com munities or associ- ations and such franchises could have concerned onl y Benedictine builders. Mention has been made of the briefs that Popes Nich olas III (in 1277) and Benoit IX (in 1334) crafted with regard t o mason corpora- tions, confirming their status as a monopoly that e ncompassed the entire Christian world, granting them protection an d an exclusive right to construct all religious edifices, and conceding to them \"the right to direct authority from only the popes,\" who freed th em \"from all local laws and statutes, royal edicts, and municipal regu lations concerning conscript labor or any other obligatory imposition for all the land's inhabitants.\" These popes ensured that members of t he corporations had the right to set their own salaries and to regu late exclusively, within"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"214 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING their general chapters, \"all matters pertaining to their internal gover- nance.\" It was forbidden for \"any artist who had no t been accepted into the association to establish any competitive e ndeavor at the expense of the association and for any sovereign to support his subjects in such a rebellion against the Church.\" Finally, a ll were expressly enjoined \"to respect these credentials and to obey these commands, under pain of excommunication.\" The pontiffs signal ed their approval of these absolute methods by citing \"the example of Hiram, King of Tyre, when he sent architects to King Solomon to bu ild the Temple of Jerusalem.\" On reading these privileges, it is difficult to bel ieve, like Clavel (who accepts them), that the members of these corpo rations were opposed to the pope. While we may accept the authen ticity of these briefs, the originals of which are missing, it is n ecessary to measure their scope. They were applicable only within the framewo rk of canon law. They addressed only the construction of religious b uildings. The pope held no temporal power that allowed him to grant an yone private priv- ileges that would constitute a departure from the r ules of feudal or manorial law or to strike a blow against the power and competence of those administering high or low justice. With the e xception of canon law, the Church could act only in the temporal sphe re and within the limits of its own jurisdiction. The pope's authorit y in this regard did not extend beyond the borders of his states. It was bec ause of this and in the roles of lords high justice that the Benedictin es, Cistercians, and Templars could act within the immense extent of the ir thousands of abbeys, houses, and commanderies. Symbolism The use of symbolism on its own constituted a unive rsal language. Symbols were used by builders as much for spiritual teaching as for the transmission of operative craft secrets. \"During th e Middle Ages, Victor Hugo states, \"the human race formed no impor tant thought that it did not set down in stone.\" All form was, as Emi le Male put it, the clothing of a thought. 6 This was the case for the general design as well as the proportions of churches and cathedrals, for the figures sculpted"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Universal Freemasonry 215 on the portals and capitals, the gargoyles, and the composition and color of the stained-glass windows. Until the fourt eenth century, every- thing in Romanesque and Gothic art was invested wit h meaning. Purely decorative whim and chance were merely exceptions t o this basic rule. It was mainly the excess of motifs drawn from flora and fauna dur- ing the Romanesque era that earned Saint Bernard's condemnation. These should be seen as copies of ancient originals from Celtic, Byzantine, and Oriental cultures, which is not to s ay that these are the source of art that is lacking in symbolic meaning, just that it is some- times difficult to pronounce an accurate opinion on this meaning and its Christianization. Strictly decorative flora and fauna can be found in much Gothic art, a charming expression of a deep an d tender love for nature. It's main Christian teaching could be summe d up as this: All God's creatures have their place in the Church, she ltered from the world. Some English authors such as E. W. Shaw and A. F. A . Woodford, who have studied exclusively the simplest forms and professional inten- tion of their symbolism—masons' marks—believe that while these were originally simply alphabetical and numerical, they subsequently took on esoteric and symbolic meaning. They feel that, a t least during the Middle Ages if not during all eras in the history o f building, the marks constituted the external signs of an occult organiz ation. Drawn from geometry, they form a kind of universal alphabet, w hich, outside of some international variations, was a language that all workers could understand. 7 The symbolism in architecture, sculpture, and stain ed glass, which was the work of artists under the direction of the clerics, was the expression of science and philosophy, akin to that of alchemists and Hermeticists. Throughout the Middle Ages and the Re naissance, phi- losophy, metaphysics, alchemy, and Hermeticism were closely commin- gled and these disciplines were inseparable from th eology. The means of expression were the same in all these areas, for, i n the final analysis, they could all be boiled down to the formulation of fundamental meta- physical truths. It is easy to cite famous alchemis ts who were also mas- ter builders, such as Gerbert, who was pope from 99 9 to 1003 under the name of Sylvester II, or Nicholas Flamel, to wh om Sauval attributes"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"216 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING the contruction of the southern side of the ancient Parisian church Saint Jacques de la Boucherie. 8 This same Nicholas Flamel gave two paintings to this church in 1413, one of which is called An I mage of a Misericorde of Our Lord, whereas the other depicts the Passion and the Resurrection. 9 It so happens that the coat of arms of the Parisia n masons and stonecutters depicted the Resurrection a nd Ascension of Jesus Christ. Another famous architect and Hermetic philosopher from a later time is Philibert Delorme, the builder of m any \"dwellings for philosophers,\" who was \"general master of the mason ry of the king- dom as well as the king's chaplain. 10 It is important to underscore that the immense symb olism, the true thought of the Middle Ages, was not only the philos ophical province of great doctors and scholars; it had a universal teac hing power and the Church understood how to impart it to the masses. T his is why there exists such perfect unity between different works—t hough of course the artisans who crafted it, be they ever so humble, we re admirable artists. That masons may have benefited from outside contrib utions to their repetoire of symbolic expression is beyond do ubt. But the terrain was prepared beforehand to receive them. Traditiona l symbolism was a framework that was ready to accept these diverse in fluences. A vital force fully aware of its own universal nature, it d id not hesitate to cre- ate the synthesis and transmutation of everything i t found valid in its inheritance from the past. Hence it is legitimate t o detect the most diverse influences in traditional symbolism, but it would be erroneous to view it as debatable syncretism, or even heresy. Furthermore, during the Middle Ages everything, even that which seems m ost profane to us, remained within the universal Christian vision, mar ked by a connection between the visible and invisible. Our modern mind, habituated as much to a strictly logical method of reasoning as t o crystalized dogmas, often finds it difficult to perceive such a mentali ty. Convincing evidence exists, however, that from the times of earliest an tiquity to the time of Descartes, the modes of expressing thought were ess entially esoteric and symbolic. At the risk of perplexing our Cartesi an, habit-trained minds, it is not rash to state that such a system o f logic equally deserves the label of rationalist, because it simultaneously addresses the two poles of thought (discursive and intuitive). Modern scholars, moreover,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Universal Freemasonry 217 have recovered from many of the preventive measures taken against symbolism, notably that displayed against the alche mists since the time of Lavoisier.

Accordingly it is a priori of the transcendent. In the next chapter we will see that the organized implementation of symbolism occurs through ritual in order to tran smit the profound and traditional teachings of freemasonry. Signs of Recognition We can divide the symbols intended to preserve the craft secrets of masonry into the categories of ritual \"words, signs , and touches.\" We have already come across the masons' word in our di scussion of the statutes of the Scottish lodges. Reverend George Hi ckes wrote on this subject in 1678: \"They [the Freemasons] were oblige d to receive the Masons' word, which is a secret signal that they po ssess to identify each other throughout the whole world.

French: Language of the Crafts Although often given to excessive imagination, Pela dan justly noted that from the twelfth to sixteenth centuries, the l anguage of the crafts was French: 12 Before the idea of internationalism had been expres sed,* the high dignitaries of the corporations had established bet ween themselves and their colleagues a diplomatic undertanding that concerned * It was an expression of Christianity."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"218 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING working methods as well as the economic situations of the artists. The language of esoteric use until the threshold of the sixteenth century was French. Its use was so extensive that i n order to com- prehend the so-called rebus writing, the language o f heraldry, or what Menage called \"the ambiguities of the painting of the word,\" it was into the French language that these esoteric and allegorical hieroglyphics so frequently found on ancient monume nts and edi- fices must be translated.\" This role of French was an important one in the bui lding arts. Isn't Gothic art, with its distinction between Old Gothic or Romanesque and \"modern\" Gothic, primarily a French art? Both the b uilding arts of the Middle Ages and Gothic art were born in France. The one that first saw the light of day in the Benedictine monasteries of the old Goth provinces remained permeated with Roman traditions, while the other arose in the brotherhoods on the Ile de France. We saw how t hey spread into foreign lands, mainly England, which eventually bec ame the birthplace of modern Freemasonry. It so happens that the Frenc h language exerted a very unique influence in England. Imposed by the Norman monarchs following the Battle of Hastings and the conquest o f the land in 1066, it remained the official language for three centuri es. As noted earlier, the Statut des Ouvriers (Statutes of the Laborers) of 1351 and the Articles de Londres (London Articles) of 1356 were written in French. According to Peladan, the builders of the Middle Ag es assumed the name of gaults or coqs [cocks], because of the homo nymy between galli, meaning \"Gauls,\"—that is, Frenchmen—and gall i, meaning \"cocks\" or \"roosters.\" Their symbol was the rooster as well as the pob- joy, popinjay, or parrot.\" it is beyond doubt that the rooster figured in seals or coats of arms of master masons. In 1438, J ehan Lambert, mas- ter mason of Paris, had a rooster with three stars added to his shield. 14 The rooster also had a profoundly esoteric signific ance. Without examining too deeply its symbolism, which would nec essitate moving well outside the concerns of this book, we can say that this animal was always considered a solar bird.

The Decline of Masonic Universalism The universalism of the medieval builders was close ly connected to the Catholic religion and the building of its churches. A breech had already been torn in this universalism by the communal move ment, when purely local brotherhoods formed without any solid bonds to another brotherhood or ties of origin to the monastic assoc iation and, through them, to tradition. The Renaissance and Reformation dealt a fatal blow to this universal character. The sixteenth century was marked first and foremost by a serious decline in the art of religious construction. The e ssentially religious Gothic art disappeared to make way for the essentia lly secular Renaissance art. The Christian symbolic language, v ehicle of the tradi- tion, was erased with the same stroke. Despite the efforts of the Italian academies and the most prestigious artists, such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo, the return to antiquity was accom panied by little in the way of understanding and quickly became widespr ead solely as a visual and decorative art. It contributed no compen sation for the spiri- tual values it replaced. Finally, the encroachment of the Reformation upon Western Europe and the army of iconoclasts tha t emerged from it brought a complete halt to the construction and mai ntenance of the magnificent monuments to piety on which so many mas ter builders had collaborated. Other contrasts contributed as well. The Gothic bui lding technique was quite difficult and exacting, whereas that of t he Renaissance proved to be much simpler and more flexible. We should als o note that with the development and vulgarization of the arts and s ciences, the number of artists multiplied. Each country had its own res erves of personnel from which it could draw to meet construction needs . Cosmopolitan artisans had far fewer opportunities to meet their foreign colleagues.

The master became more egotistical and distant. Secure in his position, he monopolized all the posts of the mastery associatio n; at the top of the corporation and with his peers, he tended to form a band apart. Soon artists and artisans, masters and journeymen, had m ore and more diffi- culty understanding each other; a moat was slowly b eing dug between them. The disappointed, discouraged, and sometimes rebellious jour- neymen grouped together separately. This was the ti me when the mod- ern form of the compagnonnage was born, retaining t he signals of recognition, the rites, and the symbols passed down by tradition. Their secrecy allowed the journeymen to protect the quali ty of their work and the identity of the worker. This was also the era w hen, finally, the brotherhoods, which had lost sight of their pious a nd charitable goals, degenerated into excess, causing alarm for both rel igious and civil authorities, who banned them in both France and Ger many. All of these factors brought about a rupture of the bond that united the freemasons not only from one country to another , but also within each kingdom. This period marked the decline of ope rative masonry. The universalism, prestige, and power of the builde rs died with the frac- turing of the Christian world and with the slackeni ng of faith. They would be reborn, however, with speculative Freemaso nry. In the transi- tion from one form to the other, continuity was com pensated by a sub- rogation: The connection between operative freemaso nry and speculative Freemasonry was the language of symbol and the thought beneath it. Symbol, which had served to maintain pr ofessional and reli- gious unity, changed design and now served to creat e a scientific, philo- sophical, and spiritual unity.

All of these associations purs ued religious, charita- ble, and social goals as well as those pertaining t o the defense of their craft interests.

The Masonic Poem (Regius Manuscript) contains a ver itable trea- tise on civility. It stipulates that an individual should attend to his own education and that of his family to attain courteou sness, distinguished manners, good morals, and self-mastery. The Cooke M anuscript attests to masonry's enduring desire to require its members to display a char- acter of rectitude and uprightness. It was forbidde n to keep a \"night crawling\" apprentice, for he could not effectively perform his duly appointed tasks and would give his fellows cause to complain. No mas- ter should seek to supplant another. If a mason has a quarrel with his journeymen, he should submit to the judgment of the master or warden who rules in his stead and reconcile with his journ eymen on the next feast day of the calendar. A master or journeyman w ho has transgressed any article should be judged before a general assem bly of the lodge. If he does not acknowledge his misdeeds, he will be ex pelled and handed over to the sheriff or lord mayor to be imprisoned. Philibert Delorme, in his Treatise on Architecture, advises the reader that in addition to the science required to perform his craft, the qualities of probity, openness, and scrupulousness \"should di stinguish the mason; he must neither be mad, nor vain, nor proud, nor pr esumptuous.\" Finally, we should recall that brotherhoods and cra ft associations pursued social objectives that were not confined me rely to providing charitable assistance to brothers in need. All craf t communities had a much larger target in mind. They often played a tru ly political role and were unfailingly the basis of the municipal franchi ses. Particularly in the northern countries, Italy, and England the mast ery associations remained the instruments of the municipal administr ation, taking part in basic policing, finance issues, urbanization, an d even the defense of the city, especially with regard to the levying of troops. Consequently, it is superfluous to emphasize how questions of a p olitical and social nature could be the subjects of discussion in these organizations.

They were inseparably joined, at least in their original form s, when it was difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the temporal and the spiritual, between the craft and the sacred. This fact was of vital importance to the mason's craft because of the knowledge and skil ls it required and because its purpose touched on matters of primordia l importance con- cerning life and human destiny. This profound and truly initiatory teaching of maso nry appeared in the ritual for works and ceremonies that was practi ced in the lodge and in the analysis of the rites and symbols it gave as means of instruction. The Ritual For a long time there has been little at our dispos al regarding the ritual in masonry. The reason for this is easy to grasp: R ituals and instruc- tional catechisms were not created to be written; t heir practice and transmission were purely oral. It was strictly forb idden to put them into writing, even as a memory aid. Fortunately, researc h undertaken by English Freemasons at the beginning of the twentiet h century has led to the discovery of revealing documents. Douglas Knoop , G. P. Jones, and Douglas Hamer have gathered together these texts in their book The Early Masonic Catechisms, which first appeared in 1 943. These works, though few in number and sometimes incomplete, prov ide enough information to show us the essential elements of th e ritual followed by operative masons. The word ritual in the singular i s used here on pur- pose, for all these documents, despite their varied origins, display iden- tical elements that reveal a shared symbolism and e sotericism. * To get a sense of the political role played by co rporations in France, it is enough to recall their interventions during the times of Etie nne Marcel [the leader of a failed revolt against royal authority in Paris during the fourtee nth century], the Caboche [members of the butcher and skinner guilds who briefly seize d power in fifteenth-century Paris and undertook radical reforms before being ousted; thei r name comes from the word for skinner], and the League [the Holy League in France , which fought for Catholic inter- ests during the wars of religion that wracked Franc e in the sixteenth century]."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"224 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING The time of their writing stretches from 1696 to 17 30, but it seems obvious that they are simply transcribing a traditi onal ritual whose ori- gin reaches back far into the past, although we are not able to precisely identify this genesis. The fact that this operative ritual is so old can b e supported on the one hand by crosschecking the texts against the con tents of the statutes and old charges, which are greater in number and wh ich date back to the fourteenth century, and on the other hand by co mparing them to the customary rituals of other organizations, which, al though different from those of freemasonry, shared the same common r oot. For instance, the French Compagnonnage and the German Bruderschaf t shared masonry's symbolic themes. Perhaps one of the best proofs of the age of the ma sons' ritual has been overlooked until now: the nature of its symbol ism, which is the key to its iniatory and esoteric meaning and which can be illuminated as an overall value only through its Christian expl anation such as that doctrine was professed in medieval times. Comparison of the symbols of the ritual to those ex pressed by Christian religious thought during the thirteenth a nd fourteenth cen- turies allow us to grasp the high scope of the ritu al and to establish, albeit approximately, the time of its birth. It is significant that, starting at the end of the fourteenth century, all the symbo lism that had been used in previous centuries to formulate the Christi an truths that expe- rienced an apotheosis in the thirteenth century gra dually fell into disuse and became incomprehensible. Without renouncing the m, the Renaissance that occurred from the fourteenth centu ry in Italy to the beginning of the sixteenth in France, the Low Count ries, and Great Britain replaced it with a symbolism restored from antiquity, even though it may have led to the same traditional valu es. After around 1530, this tradition became blurred and the symboli c thought employed in religion, art, and philosophy became fo reign and eventu- ally disappeared altogether from popular thought.

How could the people have any genuine i nterest in those who took the place of the saints—Jupiter, Mars, Apo llo, Ceres, and Proserpine or the ancient heroes of Greece and Rome or the Caesars?

The cathedral no longer took the place of all the books. It was no longer the symbol of the faith, of love, of all. The peak of this evolution would be Versailles. Its strongly emphasized symbolic conception converges toward the unity of the Solar Majesty, image of the king and no other, who personally embodies gran deur and the perennial. This is a completely different world. Based on this shift, it seems incontestable that a ritual continuing to express traditional values in a thirteenth-century Christian form, espe- cially occurring as it did among craftsmen, could b e nothing less than a teaching that had been passed down from an earlier time. The esoteric character of the operative ritual can be boiled down to the general symbolism of the building of Solomon's Temple, which was one of the most popular myths of the Middle Ages. T his popularity reveals an interpretation of the story that reaches far beyond the tale of the magnificent temple, which David began and Solom on completed in order to provide a dignified place to worship the E ternal One and house the Holy of Holies, the Ark of Covenant containing the Tablets of the Law. To the medieval mind, Solomon's temple was the replica of God's true temple and must be visualized on two planes: t hat of the Universe and the Divine Creation and that of Man, the reduce d form of the Universe to which Christ's incarnation had conferre d a level of grandeur or some value sequal to it. The temple was the symbol of both the universal macrocosm and the human microcosm. This is the basic model of the Christian church. No other religious edifice has as simply and eloquently expressed the immemorial symbol- ism of the temple consecrated to the godhead. Its p erfection was reached in the Romanesque church, in the outline of its basic plan in squares and cupolas, sacred architecture's classic vocabulary for sym- bolizing the union of heaven and earth, the the unc reated and the cre- ated. It is easy to see how the instruments used to depict the circle and the square, the compass and the square, were invest ed with an identical symbolic meaning. It is in this very broad sense that the reconstruct ion of Solomon's Temple was understood. Likewise, Jerusalem was not merely the city in Palestine where the Crusaders gathered. T his was simply its"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"226 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING geographical and historical meaning. As for all int erpretation of scrip- ture, it required in accordance with the methodolog y of Church schol- ars the perception of its allegorical, tropological , and anogogical meanings. In the allegorical sense, Jerusalem was t he militant Church; in the tropological sense, it was the Christian sou l; and in the anagogi- cal sense it was the celestial Jerusalem, the land above announced by Saint John in the Apocalypse. With respect to Kings David and Solomon, both of wh om were extremely popular, they were regarded, curious as t his might appear today, as signs or portents of Jesus Christ. The sa me was true of Hiram, the founder of the Pillars of the Temple, and Adoni ran, Solomon's high official and head of the conscripted labor. Hic et Christus, said the Venerable Bede in the eighth century, meaning that it is Christ who guides the workers of the Temple and provides the m easures of the con- struction. This was repeated in Walafrid Strabo's O rdinary Gloss, which, from the ninth to the sixteenth century, acc ompanied all editions of the Bible.* Emile Male describes this book as on e of the most valu- able to come down to us from the Middle Ages. This view of the figures of the Hebrew Scriptures a s those who her- alded the coming of Christ was traditional among th e Fathers of the Church. The same perspective held true for Adam and Noah; for the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph; for M elchizadek, the pontiff king; and for the prophets Moses, Ezra, Agg ee, and Zerubbabel. As disorienting as this may appear to our modern lo gic, the people of the Middle Ages did not understand the Hebrew Scrip tures in solely their literal sense, as the record of a historical and chronological process (which would be too narrow and anti-Christian). Tru th for them was intemporal, not merely a question of historical con tribution. Truth was what was primarily and clearly expressed in the New Law as taught by Jesus, the Verb Incarnate. For the Church Fathers, the literal sense of the He brew Scriptures was clearly sacred in nature. According to the symb olic exegesis, the * W.

But God made these men the heralds of his Son yet to come upon the earth. Therefore, it is necessary to searc h through all they said and did, and in doing so, we will find Christ. \"The Old Testament,\" Saint Augustine said, \"is nothing other than the Ne w Testament cov- ered with a veil and the New Testament is merely th e old one unveiled.\" The Divine Plan transposed into the tangible figure of Christ helps us to move from the macrocosmic symbolism of the te mple to its micro- cosmic symbolism. Even more, in giving resonance to the millenary symbolism of this point, Christianity gave it new l ife. The Romanesque church, inspired by Solomon's Temple and the image of the cosmos, is constructed on human measur es such as they most notably were given in Saint Hildegard von Bing en's Liber divino- rum operum simplicis hominis. Of course, the form o f a cross, man's image, was an ancient symbol used for the blueprint of a temple, the most grandiose example of which is perhaps the Temple of Luxor in Egypt. But never was the harmonic correspondence of Univer se-Temple-Man invested with such high significance as it was in C hristianity, for while the Romanesque church offers the image of man, it a lso presents, first and foremost, through the perfections of its measur ements, the symbol of the Perfect Man, meaning Christ, Incarnation of God. This brings us to the foundation of Christian teach ings. Man is the true temple of God, for which Solomon's Temple is a symbol. \"Know you not,\" Saint Paul asked, \"that you are the templ e of God?\" (Corinthians 1, 3:16.) \"Are you not aware that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you?\" (Corinthians I, 6:1 9) It is the same truth, an affirmation of God's immanence, that Sain t Bernard would proclaim in his second sermon devoted to the dedica tion of the church. He makes an allusion there to the visible temple bu ilt to shelter humankind, but in which God dwells not as he reside s in his image, meaning within man.

What sense did operative masons attach to this symbolism of Solomon's Temple? Once we understand how set and pr ofessed the Christian interpretation was during the Middle Ages , it seems obvious that beyond the similar connections this symbolism forged with their professional concerns and the model it provided for their work, the masons of that time would have been incapable of se eing it from any other perspective or deducing from it an esoterical ly different teaching inside their Church-controlled brotherhoods. Eloquent proof of this is provided by the ritual it self. The best artic- ulation of it is Dumfries Manuscript no. 4, dating from around 1710 and belonging to the Old Dumfries Lodge (now Dumfri es Kilwinning no. 53). 2 It provides a fairly complete record of the entire ritual that was followed at the time of the transition that pre ceded the construc- tion of the Great Lodge of London.

For the masons, who ma de him both their master and model, Hiram was a mythical figure who w as the brilliant builder of the Temple. Haloed by glory and talent, he is a synthesis of two biblical figures: Huram or Hiram Abi, and Adora m, Adonhiram, or Adoniram. According to the Kings III (5:13, 14, 15), King Sol omon fetched Hiram out of Tyre. He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to King Solomon and wrought all his work. F or he cast two brass pillars . . . that of the right was Jachi n, and that on the left, Boaz. According to the Chronicles II (2:14 and 4:11), Hur am Abi was sent by King Hiram of Tyre to Solomon. He was the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blu e, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving . . . And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the bason s. And Huram finished the work he was to make for King Sol omon for * This explanation conforms to the etymology of the se two names.

To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pilla rs. Adoram, Adonhiram, or Adoniram, son of Abda, was on e of Solomon's high officials, the head of the conscript ed workers (Kings III, 4:6). It was he who, in this capacity, directed the works of the temple, but we know that in reality the true architect of t he Temple was God himself. When King David gave his son Solomon the p lans for the building of the Temple and the models of the tabern acle and all the tools, he declared: \"all of this was written by the Lord's hand which gave unto me the understanding.\" (Chronicles I, 28: 19). Solomon and Hiram were merely executing (albeit perfectly) the will of God. In the commingling of Hiram and Adoniram, the mason s followed the customary interpretation of all the medieval co mmentaries and inter- pretations of the Bible. But the masonic legend—a m ajor theme of the initiation of the mason to the grade of master—inve nted the tragic death of Hiram, who was said to have been killed by three evil journeymen to whom he had refused to give the master \"word.\" He w as then transfig- ured and resuscitated in the person of the newly in itiated master. In this story, the masons embroidered upon the Bibl e. What's more, as we shall see, Adoniram was killed in circumstanc es that bear resem- blance to Hiram's death through their sacred and sp iritual significance. Hiram is mentioned in the old charges (see the Tew manuscript, circa 1680, which describes him as the son of King Hiram; see also the Inigo Jones manuscript from the same era). But the legend of his death, with its initiatory and therefore secret character, appears in documented form only with modern Freemasonry, specifically in Prichard's expose Masonry Dissected (1730). The ancient provenance of this legend seems accurate, however, for it seems its full mean ing and the source for its inspiration could be found only in a mediveal r eading of the Bible, a mind-set that was completely lost with the arrival of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. We may invoke additional arguments in support of th is legend's age. The creation of legends based on biblical them es was a widespread practice during the Middle Ages. It was encouraged by popular fervor and a taste for the marvelous. The Church itself, f ar from condemning"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"232 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING these glosses, encouraged their creation to a certa in extent. We may recall how similar legends were transposed into apo cryphal texts and were spread through sculptures and the images in st ained-glass win- dows. Some of these were Christianized forms of anc ient beliefs and stories—depictions of myths that were eternal beare rs of the Transcendent. As described in the image of Isidore de Seville, Holy Scripture was a lyre whose strings had infinite res onance. Thus, all the patron saints and fabled figures who were the protec- tors of the crafts had their own legends. Those of Saint Christopher, Mary Magdelene, and the Three Magi, which remain ex tremely popular today, shared the same sources. Outside of these pa rticularly deep- rooted cases, however, other similar innovations wo ven from the scrip- tures were no longer accepted by Christian churches —either Protestant or Catholic—after the Reformation and the Council o f Trent. In the masonic rite of initiation, Hiram, projectio n and adaptation of the tradition, is the embodiment of Christ in th e form of a minor deity. The Church itself declared as much for eight centuries through Bedes and Strabo's commentaries on the Bible. In th em, Hiram and Adoniram are seen to be combined in a single figure : the image and fig- ure of Christ. As we learned earlier, Hic est Chris tus is written in the text about Adoniram (Ordinary Gloss in Kings III, 5 :28). The comparison gains more strength when we recall t hat Adoniram was executed by stoning at the hands of the norther n tribes of Israelites who rebelled with Jeroboam against Solomon, King of Judea and Jerusalem, and then against his son Roboam. To Robo am the Israelites declared, \"What have we to do with the son of Jesse ?\" (Kings I, 22:16-18). These are words fraught with significanc e, for according to Saint Matthew, who based his position on Isaiah (11 :1-10), Jesse, David, and the kings of Judea were the source of Ch rist's genealogy: And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understandi ng, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and f ear of the Lord. And shall make him of quick understanding in the fe ar of the Lord. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, whi ch shall stand for an ensign of the people."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Speculative Freemasonry 233 No other prophecy exists that influenced the art of the Middle Ages in such enduring fashion. According to Emile Male, the motif of the tree of Jesse seems to have been conceived by Abbot Suge r, for the oldest known image of the Jesse Tree can be found in Saint Denis in a stained- glass window that dates to a time earlier than 1144 . Jesse Trees were numerous in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries an d can be found in stained glass (for example, in Chartres, Saint Deni s, Le Mans, and Sainte Chapelle) and in the archivolts of portals ( in Senlis, Mantes, Laon, Chartres, Amiens . . .). Starting at the end of the thirteenth cen- tury, the Virgin began appearing at the top of the tree, holding the Infant Jesus in her arms. She is the rose, the flow er that blossoms at the tip of the stem. How illuminating and eloquent Hiram's legend become s when placed alongside Christ's Ascension, which was so o ften celebrated by stone sculptors, masons, and carpenters. All the prophets and seers of Israel, all those her alds of Christ, all those figures who gravitated around the scriptures and the Apocrypha and oral tradition or the books of legends such as Jacques de Voragine's Golden Legend, Comestor's Historia Scholastica, and Vincent de Beauvais's Speculum Historiale [Mirror of History)— all of these were common figures to the people of the Middle Ages. Ea ch year at Christmas or on Epiphany or other religious feast d ays and commemo- rative celebrations, these figures and their retinu es paraded in costume. The processions they formed entered the church or c athedral and each of them, at the call of his or her name, stepped fo rth to give witness to the truth, reciting a verse or a monologue. Religio us dramas and mys- teries emerged from these kinds of processions and the same thought behind them provided the same lessons everywhere. I t permeated all of life's circumstances. Using an understanding of the amphibological meanin g of Christ's Passion with respect to the French and English craf ts of the Middle Ages, this is a good time to revisit these mysterie s. The Passion was certainly the subject that aroused the greatest ent husiasm in the medieval imagination. In truth, it was the preferre d study of the Middle Ages, inspiring men such as Saint Francis of Asissi to push love to the extreme until it was impossible for them to make an y distinction"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"234 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING between themselves and Christ. It was expected that these figures, who had served as heralds, would also be illustrations of the Passion in accordance with the indications of their gestures a s related by the scrip- tures and various legends. All of this served as a departure point for the elaboration of the Mysteries, which in this way rej oined and continued the traditions of the ancient mysteries. The masons' legend connected to Hiram belongs withi n this general framework. The circumstantial and fixed death of Hi ram, followed by his resurrection within his own person as well as i n those who emulated him, is a reflection of the Passion in the fullness of its lesson. It is also a continuation and the Christianized spiritual fina lity of the ancient mysteries: the attainment of immortality and unders tanding through by incorporating the divine substance within oneself a nd through this, becoming a god. In simpler terms, the legend, witho ut its pagan over- tones defiling its harmony, is the glorification of Christianity: finding the road to salvation and eternal life by building within the ideal and undying dwelling of the Lord. A final observation may prove helpful in explaining the symbolic meaning of these narratives. The majority of ancien t Bibles provide a lexicon that interprets Hebrew names. In Franciscus de Hailbrun's Bible (Venise, 1480; Bibliotheque nationale, Res. A2331), for instance, we can read: \"Adoniram = dominus exaltatus, vel domina tor sublimes; Hiram = vivit excelsus, aut vivens est excelse.\" Th e word abi means pater, father, which lends even more support to the identical nature and unity of the two figures. Adon (dominus) is the pre cursor to the name Hiram, which is the explanation that Vuillaume give s in his Masonic Tiler. Lord the Father, Lord most high, Lord of Lif e—we find the same amphibology on the initiatory legend. These were co mmonly taught during the Middle Ages, connections that everyone u nderstood in the theophany in which the world lived. To measure the importance of the legend for which H iram's legend is central, it is important to note that despite th e existence of three levels in masonry—apprentice, journeyman, and maste r in Scotland, England, and on the Continent—we cannot assume that three separate rituals existed for initiation at these three level s. The initiation ritual among the operative masons should be viewed as a si ngle entity mark-"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Speculative Freemasonry 235 ing the true entrance of the apprentice into the cr aft—in other words, his graduation to journeyman when he had successful ly completed his apprenticeship. In addition to this initiation cere mony, there would be ritual forms of practice. We can see, then, what mu st have become two traditional rituals practiced during the time of tr ansition from operative to speculative Freemasonry. One took place in the l odge of apprentices (for general trade meetings), the other in the lodg e of journeymen and masters (meetings concerning the intrinsic secrets of the craft). The pri- vate ritual of the masters only appeared later and the speculative or \"accepted\" masons divided the rites of masters, ini tiation, and practice into three differentiated rituals. \"Accepted\" Masons The speculative character of operative masonry was transmitted and maintained but certainly softened since the time of the Reformation with respect to the spiritual and traditional perce ption of its rites and symbols. It was reinvigorated—though with certain a daptations—when freemasonry began admitting \"accepted\" members, mea ning accredited individuals who were foreign to the actual craft of masonry. These new members were attracted to the order for three reaso ns. First, masonry, along with all other corporations a nd brotherhoods, offered the only possible form for associations in the society of the time. In France, illicit assemblies were ranked as capita l crimes until the end of the Ancien Regime. In his Somme Rurale, Boutilli er defined an assembly as illegal when it exceeded the number of three people. Second, the nature of masonry, including its privil eges, the renown of its masters and artisans, the kinds of matters that could be discussed in that company, and the protection offered by powerfu l patrons, must have had a seductive effect on studious and contemp lative minds seek- ing to increase their knowledge and share their ide as without arousing suspicion. Finally, because of the nature of its wo rk, masonry was the sole corporation not tied to one locale. Thus it ma intained connections between cities and even countries that offered prot ection and welcome to brothers away from home. In this regard it playe d a significant and unique role in the exchange and spread of ideas."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"236 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING The admission of \"accepted\" members is a very old p ractice in masonry. Clerics were always to be found in the ass ociation because of the religious foundation of mastery associations an d brotherhoods. This was how a priest initiated into the order was the one to draft the famous Masonic Poem (Regius Manuscript) at the end of the fourteenth century. This priest most likely held the duties of chaplain or secretary or perhaps both. In the seventeenth century, Atches on Haven Lodge shows these duties entrusted to a notary who was in tentionally initiated as a mason so that he could write apprenticeship co ntracts. 3 Over time many other figures were given access to m asonry, whether because they themselves were drawn by the instituti on's prestige or because their support was sought by the organizatio n. This was how King Henry IV and the nobles of his court were init iated into the broth- erhood in 1442. 4 Indeed, the Regius Manuscript mentions apprentices \"with the blood of high lords.\" It is obvious that this does not refer to the sons of high nobility who were actually plying the craft of masonry. The Cooke Manuscript is the first to employ the wor d speculative. The son of King Athelstan, it states, was a true specul ative master. In these older times, the professional or operative element was more prevalent in the order. But an era eventually arrived when the external element, the accepted, prevailed over the operative element, first in quality then in actual quantity. This occu rred when artisans confined to their professional tasks considered all that had constituted the grandeur and prestige of the order to be nothin g more than an old, worn garment. This old clothing, deemed to be more or less anachro- nistic by humble craftsmen, was, however, quite sui table for the needs of others. For various reasons, the task of achieving this tra nsformation—this subrogation, to use a legal term—belonged to the lo dges of Great Britain.* The Scottish lodges preceded the British lodges down this * Although L. Vibert claims the contrary, the Germa n Hiitten included accepted mem- bers. We need only refer to the stonecutter statute s for proof of this. Further proof can be found in the well-known sign of the interlaced s quare and compass with the letter G at its center, which served as the logo of Strasbou rg publisher Jean Grieninger in 1525, a time when the corporation was still enjoying the height of its prosperity in that city (Clavel, Histoire pittoresque de la Franc-Maconneri e, 86; B. E. Jones, Freemason's Guide and Compendium, 299)."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Speculative Freemasonry 237 path. In fact, we have already seen that since 1439 the Scottish lodges had hereditary grand masters in the Lords Saint Cla ir.* Under the reign of James V (1513-1542), husband of Mary of Lorraine and father of Mary Stuart, the wind of a n ew era was blowing through Scottish high society. The king was a fervent humanist as well as an admirer of the ideas and mas terpieces of the Renaissance. Did he inspire this interest? The fact remains that Lord Sinclair resolved to visit Italy. He returned full of enthusiasm and immediately decided to entrust to Italian artis ts the construc- tion of a chapel inside his domain at Roslyn. This chapel is still standing today and is admired by its visitors for t he high quality of its architectural decor, in which shines all the ma sonic symbolism of the time. Not content merely with building a cha pel, Sinclair invited additional Italian masons, put them togethe r with Scottish masons, organized them into a brotherhood, and gran ted them a charter. From that time, under the protection of th e king, this brotherhood's prospects soared. 5 It appears that we can trace the origins of the tra nsformation of operative masonry to this era. During this time, th rough the infusion of new blood, it was given a new impetus that could be seen on both the cultural and artisitic planes. The first historic trace of a nonoperative Mason wh o was neither a powerful patron nor a cleric is provided by the m inutes of a meet- ing of the Mary's Chapel Lodge in Edinburgh on June 8, 1600. This \"accepted\" mason was John Bosnel of Auchinlek, but it is certain he was not the first. On May 20, 1641, the members of this same Edinburgh lodge, who were then in Newcastle with th e Scottish Army, admitted as an accepted mason the honorable Robert Moray, the general quarter master of the army. Interestingly, it had been long- standing practice to form lodges within Irish and S cottish regiments. In chapter 13, we will see the important role this played in the estab- lishment of modern Freemasonry on the Continent, es pecially in France. * [Saint Clair was eventually Anglicized to Sinclai r. —Trans.]"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"238 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING In 1670, more than three quarters of the members of the Aberdeen Lodge were not professional masons and the Laws and Statutes speci- fied that this speculative membership was exempt fr om the collecting box, the mark, the banquet, and the pint of wine. T hey paid no fees.* The cohabiting cultural and social differences and differing objec- tives of the two groups did not fail to cause probl ems at times. The free- dom and independence of the lodges as a whole led t o the formation of certain lodges composed solely of nonoperative memb ers. The first such case cited is the lodge constructed in 1702 by eigh t land owners in the village of Haugfool, near Galashiels. 6 In England, the situation began to change noticeabl y after 1607, the year in which James I named Inigo Jones the General Intendent of the Buildings of the Crown, a title that gave him autho rity over the entire corporation of masons. Just like Lord Sinclair, Ini go Jones had been smitten in Italy by the style of Andrea Palladio an d had taken to heart the desire to transplant it to England. To achieve this, he organized lodges on the model of the Italian academies, where skilled instructors could give lessons in architecture based on the pri nciples of the school he championed. These novel events produced two noteworthy results: First, the number of unschooled masons gradually diminished. S econd, presti- gious figures seeking culture requested admission i nto the corporation. This was how the doors of the lodges began opening wider and wider to people who were not professional masons—but thei r admission rested on the express condition that they use their social influence and knowledge to benefit the masonic community without receiving in return the privileges of working masons. It then be came fashionable for nobles and the rich to be received as masons. In 16 20, a group of accepted masons gathered in London under the auspic es of the Company of Masons. At this time, seven individuals who were not part of the com- pany were confirmed as accepted masons in return fo r a special tax. 7 When the large embellishment projects that had been undertaken to * Nonoperative members, generally gentlemen of high er birth, who were accepted in the seventeenth-century Scottish Lodges were customaril y referred to as Geomatics, while professional masons were known as Domatics.

The same was not true for the accepted masons, who gained st rength through the admission of new brothers. This fact and the social position of these let- tered individuals ensured that the accessory portio n became the princi- pal part and took the corporation's business into t heir hands. The statutes published on the occasion of the large mas onic assembly held in 1663 establish evidence of this. Philosophical and Mystical Influences It is important to understand the spiritual influen ces freemasonry was subject to during this transformation, or at least to comprehend those that facilitated this transformation. An accepted fact of history is that from the end of the fifteenth cen- tury in Italy through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe as a whole, there was a strong inclination among ed ucated individuals to join together in more or less secret societies. The desire to create these kinds of groups, their organizational plan, a nd their goals arose in large part from the reading of certain books pub lished in different forms by the illustrious authors of that time, prin cipally Thomas More, Rabelais, Andrea, Francis Bacon, and Robert Fludd. In his famous work Utopia (1516), Sir Thomas More ( 1477-1535) puts into practice a program of democratic reform o n the imaginary island of Utopia. In this society, the chief concer n of government is to furnish the material needs for individual and publi c consumption. Each individual is given as much time as possible to fre e him- or herself from the servitude of the body, freely cultivate his or her mind, and develop his or her intellectual abilities through the study of the letters and sci- ences. The civil organization of the Utopians is re publican and all reli- gions are tolerated. Here we should note an importa nt point as observed by A. Lantoine. \"It was Sir Thomas More wh o created a word that until that time was unknown: tolerance.\" In his rule of the abbey of Theleme, Rabelais (1494 -1553), who was certainly an accepted mason, has left us with t he constitution of a society of free men. The sole rule of the Thelemite s was this:"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"240 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING Do what you will, because people who are free, well -born, well- bred, and easy in honest company have a natural ins tinct that drives them to virtuous deeds and deflects them fro m vice—and this they call honour. When these same men are depr essed and enslaved by vile constraint and subjection, they us e this noble qual- ity, which once impelled them freely towards virtue , to throw off and break this yoke of slavery. For we always striv e after things forbidden and covet what is denied us. 8 Johan Valentin Andrea (1586-1654), abbot of Adesber g, was the unintentional founder of the Rosicrucians. In 1610, he published Fama fraternitis, or Discovery of the Honorable Order of the Rosy Cross, a work inspired entirely by his imagination. In this fictional work, he recounts the fabulous story of a certain Christian Rosenkreuz who dis- covered a secret, concealed for centuries, that cou ld ensure the happi- ness of humanity. To enable the success of his prop aganda, he founded a secret college (lodge) whose purpose was doing ch aritable works and promoting internationalism and the advancement of t rue morality and religion. The members of this society were required to swear to the strictest discretion. The book enjoyed great succes s and its readers, par- ticularly in England, believed the Order of the Ros y Cross genuinely existed. Andrea followed up his first work with oth ers, notably The Universal Reformation of the Entire World (1614) an d The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz (1616). Robert Fludd (1547-1637), whose works enjoyed consi derable suc- cess, established himself as a defender of the Rosi crucian Order. Rosicrucian societies were formed in London under h is influence and adopted his philosophical doctrines. These ideas we re inspired by those of Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, and Jacob Boheme and consisted of a synthesis of alchemy, the Kabbalah, and Neoplatonic and Hebraic traditions collected from the writings of H ermes Trismegistus mixed with the ambitions and mysticim of the Rosicr ucians. Francis Bacon (1560-1626) chancellor of James I, is the famous author of La Nova Atlantis.

One final avatar whose plans for an ideal society o ffer many analo- gies to the tenets of modern Freemasonry is the fam ous Czech peda- gogue Jan Amos Komensky. The persecutions suffered by reformers in Catholic countries during the Thirty Years' War and the sight of the bloody collisions among races and religions had ins pired in some noble souls the conception of a humanitarian mysticism fo r which Komensky was an eloquent spokesman. He dreamed of the reconc iliation of the principal Christian factions. In his Pansophia Diat yposis (1643) and his De rerum humanarum emendatione catholica, whose fir st parts were published in 1666 under the titles Panergesia and P anaugia, he pro- posed the founding of a society with the purpose of spreading the ideas of tolerance and respect for the individual. The ob jective of this society would be the construction of a Temple of Wisdom, si milar to the Temple of Solomon, built upon Mount Moriah (in othe r words the Temple Mount). Komensky also proposed the creation of a large inter- national organization, the Collegium Lucis, which w ould be a Wisdom school to provide an education for those seeking to enter the Celestial Academy. All steps taken in this regard had to be t aken secretly and Komensky's full treatise was to be shared only with those participating in the undertaking. All the academies and societies throughout Europe were to be encompassed within this vast organizatio n, which would take London as its hub. From the end of the fifteenth century and throughou t both the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries in Europe, we can observe the creation of associations of thought that enjoyed the indispe nsable backing of sovereign authority. The goals of these association s, the oldest of which first saw the light of day in Italy, cradle of the Renaissance, corre- sponded more or less to those of fiction's imaginar y societies. Marsilio Ficino founded a Neoplatonic society in Fl orence as early as 1460. It was certainly no secret association—its patrons were the Medicis—nor an initiatory one. But it was still nov el for its time. The philosophy Ficino taught there would leave a signif icant mark on the next generation, influencing Cornelius Agrippa, Tho mas More, and"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"242 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING Rabelais. It was Ficino's contribution to develop a syncretic philosophy inspired by the systems of Zoroaster, Hermes, Orphe us, Pythagoras, Plato, the Kabbalah, and Christian philosophy. He w rote: God appeared in eternity, creating or rather lumino usly emanating from the center of the circumference, which radiate s outward from being and good to nothingness and evil. As men, who are intelli- gences, finite lights within the abode of time and movement, we aspire toward that motionless light for which we ar e its mobile emanantions. Death, by delivering us from the body, draws us close to it and its other angelic lights, pure spir its whose bliss is found in rest. Death is therefore a pleasure and it is death that the philospher dives into each day when leaving the bod y to soar on the wings of the soul. 9 In 1512, Florence would also witness the creation o f an original organization, the Company of the Trowel. This socie ty appears to have emerged from the operative masonry that preceded it , although it left behind its material purpose to embrace its mystical intent. Consisting of scholars and prominent figures of the civil society of the time, it employed symbols such as the trowel, the hammer, an d the chisel and chose for its patron saint the same one who watched over the Scottish masons: Saint Andrew. 10 We know the great influence the Italian acad- emies had over the English and Scottish Freemason l odges. Undoubtedly the Platonic Academy and the Company of the Trowel, whose members were the same as those of the academi es, exerted a sim- ilar influence. Another important society that likely had an effect on masonry, however indirect, is the Guild of Mages. It was fou nded in 1510 by Henri Cornelius Agrippa when he arrived in London a nd was modeled on the organization he had already created in Franc e. The Guild of Mages was a secret society consisting of masters of alchemy and magic- Its members, who used personal identification signs and passwords, founded corresponding organizations—chapelies—in ot her European countries for the purpose of studying the \"forbidde n\" sciences.

At the beginning of the seventeenth century, there existed in Holland, Germany, and England various groups of learned men who formed secret societies in conformance with the principles proclaimed by the books we have already mentioned, but particularly A ndrea's Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. Not surprisingly, th ese same men were drawn to freemasonry. In fact, Sir Robert Moray, wh o, as we have learned, was admitted as an accepted mason in the L odge of Edinburgh in 1641, was a Rosicrucian. 11 Because of its symbolism, masonry provided an espec ially propi- tious environment for this influence. The first pro of of a relationship between freemasonry and the Rosicrucian Society can be found in a poem published in Edinburg in 1638: Muses Threnodie . Its author was Henry Adamson, master of the arts and citizen of Pe rth. In it we can read this verse: For we breathren of the Rosies Cross We have the mason work and second sight.

There he became a staunch supporter of the Stuarts' cause in 1644 and was named a commissioner of the king. Some have maintained th at Ashmole was an Israelite, but in actuality he was an active member of London's Catholic circle and was buried in the Catholic church of Sou th Lambeth. 13 Ashmole was introduced to the Rosicrucian Society b y William Backhouse and on October 16,1646, according to his own journal, was admitted as an accepted mason into the Warrington L odge. Here he found himself in the company of the Warton brothers , Thomas and George; the mathematician William Oughteed; the doc tors of theology John Herwitt and John Prarson; and the astrologer W illiam Lilly. With these men he founded a society whose purpose w as to build the House of Solomon, the ideal temple of the scien ces, in imitation of the models imagined by Sir Thomas More and Francis Bacon. He per- suaded the masons to allow them to meet on their pr emises. We should note that the society formed by Ashmole, like those of More and Bacon, was meant to remain secret. In 1724, a manuscript of ancient masonic constituti ons was printed under the title The Secret History of the Free-Maso ns. Its preface pre- sented the Rosicrucians and masons as \"brothers of the same fraternity or order.\" Similarly, the Daily Journal of Septembe r 5, 1730, indicates that the modern Freemasonry was an offshoot of the Rosicrucian Society. Political and Religious Influences Just as it was practice in Germany for factions to seek the support of the rich, organized, powerful guilds and corporations d uring divisive times such as the election of emperors or the religious w ars, in England, when the struggle broke out between the Stuart royal fam ily and Parliament and later between the Stuarts and the House of Oran ge or Hanover, political parties sought to enlist the corporations to their side.

It i s also certain that they intensified the establishment of masonic lodges ins ide the regiments in order to create political auxiliaries. In 1689, Sco ttish and Irish regiments landed in France with their military and masonic st affs. According to scholar Gustave Bord, these military staffs were th e executive agents while the masonic personnel were the administrative authority. When James II was dethroned in 1688, the corporatio n of masons was under the authority of Christopher Wren, superi ntendent of the royal buildings and an ardent Jacobite. He nonethel ess held this posi- tion until 1695 and regained it in 1698, exercising this authority until 1702 and the ascension of Queen Anne, who reinforce d the Protestant factions. Freemasonry was still so Jacobite at this time that the masons refused to continue work on the construction of Sai nt Paul's Cathedral, which would not be completed until 1710, despite th e orders of William Benson, inspector of the Queen's buildings. 14 It is likely that the Catholic influence on the fre emasons remained significant under the Protestant monarchy of Willia m of Orange. The text of the 1693 Charter of the York Lodge, which r eproduces much older statutes, states that \"the first article of y our Instructions is that you will be faithful to God and the Holy Church, to the Prince, to his Master, and to the Lady he serves.\" The same struct ure is found in statutes dating from 1704. The term \"Holy Church\" c ould refer here to the official Anglican church, rather than the Catho lic church, but it is likely that in the minds of numerous masons the tra ditional expression continued to mean the Holy Catholic Church. This likelihood seems to be supported historically. It is a fact that the Orangemen tried to make use of masonic lodges a nd sought to change their traditional Catholic orientation. It a ppears fairly well established that William III of Orange was initiate d as an accepted mason in 1694 or, more exactly, that some English m asonic lodges put themselves under his protection at that time and th at in this role of pro- tector, he presided over several assemblies held at Hampton Court. This branch of masonry published new statutes in 1694 in which Article I was redrafted: \"Your first duty is to be faithful t o God and to avoid all the heresies that misinterpret him.\" This masonry, whose allegiance was pledged to the Protestantism of William of Orange, simply omitted the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"246 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING reference to \"the Holy Church\" to which masons had always been expected to swear fidelity. This omission appears t o show that the expression \"Holy Church\" was not assumed to refer t o the Anglican church. The Orangemen deemed it preferable simply t o suppress a dan- gerous connection to a Catholic tradition. In the next chapter we will revisit these incidents of religious inter- ference and the controversies they raised with the formation of the Great Lodge of London and with Scottish Freemasonry . The Decline of Operative Freemasonry At the same time that speculative and \"accepted\" Fr eemasonry was developing under the effect of philosophical, relig ious, and political influences, the corporation of professional masons was undergoing a slow death. In 1666, a terrible fire destroyed 40,000 houses an d 86 churches in London. Given that there were only seven lodges at that time in London, nine tenths of whose members were accepted masons, it proved necessary to summon masons from all the coun ties of England to rebuild the city. These masons and architects pu t themselves under the authority of the Company of the Masons of Londo n and the archi- tect Christopher Wren. Seven years earlier, under t he direction of Wren, construction on Saint Paul's had begun, with King C harles II laying the first stone. At that time, the count of Arlington w as the protector of the corporation, but operative masonry was nonetheless in full and obvious decline. In 1703, the Lodge Saint Paul made a decision that reveals how Freemasonry had gradually transformed: \"The privile ges of masonry will henceforth no longer be reserved for construct ion workers alone, but, as it is already a practice, they will be exte nded to persons of all estates who would wish to take part therein, provid ed they be duly pre- sented, that their admission be authorized, and tha t they be initiated in the usual manner.\" The history of speculative Freemasonry had begun."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"13 The Grand Lodges and Modern Freemasonry The Grand Lodge of London On June 24, 1717, Saint John's Day, four London lod ges with names borrowed from the taverns where they gathere d—The Goose and Gridiron, The drown, The Apple Tree, and The Ru mmer and the Grapes—formed a unified organization under the name of the Grand Lodge. 1 Anthony Sayer, a gentleman, was elected grand mast er and was given authority over all his brothers. On June 24, 1718, he was suc- ceeded by George Payne, who ordered work begun to g ather together all the charters in England having to do with Mason ry.

We do not know the official reasons for the creatio n of the Grand Lodge of London, which was fairly modest at concept ion. Emphasis has been placed on a possible need for a regulatory pow er over the lodges. As long as freemasonry remained operative, rather t han speculative, this power belonged to the guild or company, which supervised the lodges to ensure their members adequately met the d uties of their craft. The situation changed when lodges were formed by \"a ccepted\" masons. The danger became a potential influx of ext ernal contributions and innovations invading the institution and distor ting the spirit of the organization as a whole. Religious and political qu arrels have also been mentioned as a possible impetus. Men in positions o f power could, for the purpose of pacification, impose their views and discpline over the workshops that, under the practice of the old custo ms, were somewhat independent and autonomous. All of these probable r easons for the for- mation of the Grand Lodge more or less mesh with on e another and can be justified, with inflexions and nuances, by the e vents that took place not only in Great Britain but on the Continent as w ell.

At the outset it is important to note that it would be an exag- geration to claim, as some in France have done, tha t the tolerance this document displays is akin to a proclamation of free thought. 2 This would be the equivalent of declaring that modern Fr eemasonry no longer has anything whatsoever in common with opera tive freema- sonry. But this is a highly partisan form of reason ing and completely ignores the climate of the time and environment in which the Book of Constitutions was written. In 1943, Knoop and Jones, in their study Freemasonr y and the Idea of Natural Religion, which was presented befor e the Quatour Coronati Lodge of London, 3 have emphasized the evidence that the 1723 constitutions involved a kind of deism, but th ey did not push their analysis more deeply. In 1965, another member of the Lodge Quatour Coronati, J. E. Clarke, went much further. Under the title The Change from Christianity to Deism in Freemasonry, 4 he maintained the theory that the Book of Constitutions deliberat ely rejected Christianity and replaced it by simple deism as the religious basis and profession of faith in Freemasonry, despite the ord er's apparent monotheism. He did not explain, however, what meani ng could thus remain invested in what remained of the rituals and ancient symbolism of operative masonry. Akin to Clarke's theory, but reaching a different c onclusion, was the hypothesis put forth by Albert Lantoine in 1925 in his book La Franc-Maconnerie chez elle.

The best argument J. R. Clarke provided to support his contention that deism became the rule is that Jews were accept ed into Freemasonry shortly after 1723. First mention of this is in the Daily Post, September 22, 1732, and Fog's Journal, October 7, 1732, which announced the admission of Daniel Delvalle. 5 How could Jews who remained ortho- dox utilize the Christian symbolism of traditional freemasonry? And why would the lodges have admitted them if they had renounced Freemasonry's principles? In his missive Anderson's Freemasonry not Deistic, 6 E. Ward res- ponded by showing, with the support of precise fact s, that English Freemasonry had actually retained Christian objecti ves following 1723. Thus the admission of Jews into Freemasonry could a mount to only iso- lated instances corresponding to particular circums tance, much like the admission of several Turks into the lodges of Smyrn a and Aleppo in 1738. Ward also thought it wise in regard to the disposit ions of Pastor Anderson's mind to quote two sermons, one of which was published in the very year of 1723: \"Refutation of the Errors of the Socinianus, Pythagorians, Papists and Others.\" The other, \" Uni ty in Trinity against Idolaters, Modern Jews, and Anti-Trinitarians,\" was published in 1733. Besides the rejection of the Jews, Freemasonry's ap parent rejection of \"papists\" and \"idolators\" reinforces Lantoine's sen timents. The toler- ance of the Book of Constitutions barely conceals t he struggle against the Catholics as a means for Anglicans to defend Ch ristianity. But we should also look at the contemporary reactio ns of London and Great Britain as a whole to the founding of the Grand Lodge of London. Tolerance, even if it was a ploy, was nonet heless seen as being in tune with rituals and the formulation of oaths, invocations, and prayers using any word or expression that might irk anyone or cause controversy, no matter the form of Christian worshi p. Many saw toler- ance as a renunciation—if not an outright denial—of Christian disbelief.

The majority of"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The Grand Lodges and Modern Freemasonry 251 lodges, especially those in the provinces, were rel uctant to abandon their independence and they continued to respect th e ancient obliga- tions of the craft. In 1722, the same time that And erson was writing his text, the edition of Ancient Constitutions cited ea rlier appeared in London, with this first article: \"I am to admonish you to honour God in his holy Church; that you use no Heresy, Schism and Error in your Understandings, or discredit Men's Teachings.\" 7 Could these words be read as an answer to the views like those of Anders on and Desaguliers? One of the principal centers of resistance to the G rand Lodge of London was the Old Lodge of York. The oppositional workshops, called antients, were not grouped in any kind of de nominational for- mat, although in 1725 the Old Lodge of York adopted the title of Grand Lodge of England, which corresponded more wit h its ancestral role of mother lodge than to any demoninational pow er. This grand lodge existed until 1792 and in the interim, in 177 9, it even gave a char- ter to another grand lodge that lasted a dozen year s, the Grand Lodge of England South of the River Trent. It was only in 1751, with the struggle unrelenting, that the oppo- nents of the Grand Lodge of London, resolved to fig ht against it in force and by using the same weapons, formed a verit able rival organi- zation, the Grand Lodge of the Free and Accepted Ma sons According to the Old Institutions. The Antients reproached the Moderns for having omit ted prayers, dechristianizing the ritual, and no longer honoring the holy days (the feasts of the two Saint Johns). To them at stake wa s the tradition inher- ited from the craft—at least what had survived of t he tradition, for the terrain had been altered for a long while and the t ranscendent percep- tion of this tradition had been watered down or tra nsformed under the pressure of outside influences. The best proof of t his evolution lies in the differences that existed between \"traditional\" seventeenth-century rituals of the Antients, on the one hand, and what we now know about the ritual of the operative masons, on the other.

In 1736, however, they too deci ded to form an inde- pendent overseeing authority—the Grand Lodge of Sco tland—but its spirit was different from that of the Grand Lodge o f London. While the Scottish masons used English Freemasonry as their m odel for a central- ized denominational organization, they remained sol idly attached to the traditional rites, leaning more to the side of the Antients and opposing the Moderns. It is significant that they named as t heir first grand mas- ter William Saint Clair of Roslyn, last in the line of the family of the hereditary protectors of the Scottish lodges. The S cottish distinction was further emphasized by the undying fidelity of m any to the house of Stuart and the Catholic religion, the sole \"Holy Ch urch\" for them in the terms of the old obligations. Despite all this, a number of Scottish lodges did not rally to the new denominational form . Their resistance found a cohesive structure in 1743 when the old Mot her Lodge of Kilwinning established itself as a single grand lod ge, like that of York or England. But staunch Scottish resistance to masonic modernis m did not only occur in Scotland. It was also taking hold, perhaps even more strongly, on the Continent, primarily in France. Scottish Freemasonry in France It is commonly believed that modern French Freemaso nry was an off- shoot of English Freemasonry and that the first Fre nch lodges were cre- ated if not directly by the Grand Lodge of London, then at least on the model of those lodges it established. This opinion conforms to the claims of the Grand Un ited Lodge of England, which, although formed in 1815 by the merg er of the Antients and the Moderns, dates its founding to 1717 and by virtue of this feels it should be recognized as the Grand Mother Lodge o f the World as well as guardian of the masonic tradition. Many Fre nch Freemasons are receptive to this viewpoint with one major distinct ion: They place this modern tradition with Anderson's 1723 Book of Const itutions, where, as they read them, theism and deism gave way to fre e thought. This or course does not result in atheism so much as nondog matic attitudes. We"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The Grand Lodges and Modern Freemasonry 253 know that this interpretation is strongly rejected by the English, who today are clearly in support of a theism that leave s each brother the freedom of his faith. It should be noted that in this debate made obscure by sectarian attitudes, the question is not one of explicitly de fining the tradition and its temporal formulation, but rather of knowing if a tradition—truly, two traditions—might not have been substituted for another one. Everyone might thus be either correct or mistaken a nd find themselves on a path that has been substituted for the Christi an tradition of the operative masons and its initiatory path. Perhaps it is best to stick to the historical data. In actuality, specu- lative Freemasonry was imported into France by Scot tish Catholics and the Stuarts. According to the book Annales Maconniq ues des Pays- Bas, 8 which cites a sixteenth-century document, there we re two Scottish lodges in France in 1535: one in Paris and the othe r in Lyon. While this is debatable, we do know that as early as the sixte enth century, Scottish craft freemasonry was admitting accepted members. T he Scots had already long been in the habit of forming military lodges, so it is not gratuitous to assume that the Scots—who had been pa rt of the French court for some time where they notably formed one o f the king's noble guard units (the Ramsays were part of it in the fif teenth century)—had introduced the customs of their own country into th eir adopted land. The ties between the Scots and French were strength ened further dur- ing the sixteenth century when Mary Stuart I, Queen of the Scots from 1542 to 1567, became Queen of France through her ma rriage to Francois II (1558-1560). The ancestral role played by Scottish Freemasonry i n France is con- firmed by the knight Ramsay in his famous Discourse of 1737: \"By degrees our Lodges and our rites were neglected in most places. This is why of so many historians only those of Great Brita in speak of our Order. Nevertheless it preserved its splendour amon g those Scotsmen to whom the Kings of France confided during many centu ries the safe- guard of their royal persons.\" The presence of Scottish lodges in France was more evident when the Stuarts were forced into exile following their reign in England.

Without delay, they organized anti-Cromwellian acti vity with an eye to promoting the restoration of the heir, Princ e Charles II. To pro- tect themselves from English strangers or those hos tile to their side and to lead Cromwell's police astray, they acted under the cover of the masonic lodges, of which they were honorary members . Under the pro- tection of so-called trade secrecy and without too much risk of com- miting an indiscretion, they could thereby communic ate with their brothers who had remained in Great Britain to plot the overthrow of the \"dictator.\" 9 In 1661, on the eve of ascending the throne of Engl and, Charles II formed a regiment in Saint Germain called the Royal Irish, whose name was soon changed to the Irish Guard. Under the orde rs of Lord Colonel William Dorrington, this regiment, which outlived t he Stuarts, landed in Brest on October 8, 1689, as part of the surrend er terms of Limerick. Until 1698, it maintained a garrison in Saint Germa in but remained independent of any French units, although it was ma intained by Louis XIV On February 27, 1698, it was incorporated into the French Army under the name of its colonel, still Lord Dorringto n. This regiment of the Irish Guard seems to have had the oldest lodge recognized by the Grand Orient of France. In fact, on March 13, 1777, the Grand Orient acknowledged that the original constitution of the Guard dated from March 25, 1688.* It is likely that this Scottish lodge in Saint Germ ain had no distinc- tive title originally and bore only the name of its colonel. After 1752, the name Perfect Equality appears, but it is possib le that it existed under this name earlier.

Unfortunately, as their appearance is coincident wi th that of the English lodges created under the aegis of the Grand Lodge o f London, their dis- tinctive quality has not always been noted, nor has the fact that until 1738, the date when the Duke d'Antin was named gran d master of the masonic order in France, there were two categories of lodges in Great Britain: Scottish lodges and English lodges. The la tter were dependen- cies and creations of the Grand Lodge of London whi le the former con- tinued to live and spread based on the traditional rites of freemasonry. Among these Socttish lodges were the famous Lodge o f Saint Thomas, named in memory of Saint Thomas a Becket, the saint most worshipped in Stuart England. This lodge was created in 1726 b y a famous partisan of the Stuarts, Lord Derwentwater, about whom we wi ll earn more. Another Scottish lodge worth mentioning is the famo us Lodge of Aubigny, established on August 12, 1735, in the cas tle of the same name owned by the Duke of Richmond, Lennox, and Aub igny, who had recently inherited his estate from his grandmot her, Louise de Keroualle, the duchess of Portsmouth. 10 In her youth, Louise Renee de Penancoet de Keroualle had been considered the most beautiful woman in France. To serve King Louis XIV with the sole we apons she pos- sessed, her beauty and taste for intrigue, she left France for the court of London, where she became the mistress of Charles II , who made her Duchess of Portsmouth. In her older years, she had become a deeply bigoted Catholic. Repenting of her past errors, she adorned the churches that sat on her lands with offerings of he r piety and even installed a convent of Hospitaller nuns in her chat eau. But her brilliance at intrigue had not abandoned her.

Just like his father, who had been sponsor in 1695 of a freema- sonry that mixed operative and speculative members, he was grand master of the Grand Lodge of London in 1724, a time when this lodge, in the midst of a full crisis of growth, sought, un der an apperance of tolerance, to take control of the lodges that remai ned independent and orthodox, both English and Scottish. Before it was housed in the duchess's chateau, the Lodge of Aubigny had operated in its Parisian manor on the r ue des Petits Augustins (Rue Bonaparte) or rue des Saints Peres ( on the corner of the rue de Verneuil). It was established on August 12, 1735, by Lord Weymouth, grand master of the Grand Lodge of London . Hence its affiliation with that institution. This reveals how the opposition between the two versions of Freemasonry was not com pletely black and white. In fact, there was quite a bit of grey, evid ence of the great spirit of tolerance solemnly proclaimed by the Orangemen a nd Hanoverians as well as by the Stuarts. This does not mean, howe ver, that a spirit of competitive bidding and self interest was not also evident. From the beginning, which was around 1728, the Scot tish Lodges of France recognized as grand master Philip, duke o f Wharton, former grand master of the Grand Lodge of London, and supp orter of the Stuarts. At his death in 1731, Charles Radclyffe, L ord Derwentwater, assumed the status of grand master, followed Hector MacLean, Baronet of Scotland, from 1733 to 1735, and then Lord Derwe ntwater again in 1736. The Radclyffes belonged to a very old family, which remained faith- ful to the House of Stuart and to Catholicism until the extincton of its line. It seems that Charles Radclyffe was inititiat ed by Sir Charles Ramsay. In attempting to return to England in 1746, he was captured and imprisoned. Condemned to death, he was executed on December 8, 1746. These were his final words: I die a true, obedient, and humble son of the Catho lic Apostolic Church in perfect charity with all mankind and a tr ue well-wisher to my dear country as I desire that it know no happ iness until he treats with justice its king, the best and most sla ndered of sover-"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The Grand Lodges and Modern Freemasonry 257 eigns.

This declaration of faith provides an eloquent illu stration of the state of mind of the Catholic Scots and Stuarts who had introduced Freemasonry into France from their land. This Scott ish Freemasonry has certainly undergone a political divergence, but still remained true to its traditional principles of Catholicism and indep endent lodges. This mind-set is also asserted in the lines of a letter addressed by Ramsay to the Marquis de Caumont and dated April 1, 1737: The unfortunate discord of Religion that set Europe ablaze and rent it apart during the sixteenth century ensured the degeneration of our order from the grandeur and nobility of its origins.

But because this name could never be f ound listed in the Bristish peerage, the grand mastery of this lord ce ased to be mentioned.

Moss offered the opinion that the name Lord Harnouester could be a deformation of Count Charles Arran Wester of the Butler Family of Ormond, a titl e that appears in Scottish nobility and the Irish peerage and was hel d by zealous Stuart partisans. 13 A letter dated August 2, 1737, from Ramsay to the J acobite Carte 14 seems to confirm this opinion. Speaking of his Disc ourse of the previ- ous year, Ramsay writes: \"I sent the discourse I wr ote for the various receptions of eight dukes and peers and two hundred officers of top rank and the highest nobility, to his Grace, the Du ke of Ormond.\" Is it possible that this figure to whom Ramsay submitted his text was the grand master of the Scottish lodges of France? Scottish Innovations It has been claimed that the Scots, who allegedly c reated the grade of master, used it for political ends and instituted t he high grades for the same purpose. It has also been argued that English Freemasonry origi- nally recognized only the grades of apprentice and journeymen. The term master was used by English Freemasons only to designate the patron or elder of the lodge. Things were different in Scotland , how- ever, where the grade of master was pan of the craf t hierarchy. This had been true for a long time as is demonstrated by the Schaw Statutes. During this era of religious and dynastic struggles , it is said that the Scots tried to use this distinctive feature as a me ans of dominating the lodges. At this same time they were developing the symbolism of the master grade.

English Freemasons, it is claimed, adopted the grad e of master in the years 1723-1725, when the thinking that had inspire d its development and application had faded from memory. Similarly, some say the Jacobites combined their kn ightly titles and decorations with Freemasonry and that this served a s the origin of the Scottish higher grades, which were intended to serv e the political pur- pose of dominating Freemasonry and placing it in th e service of the dynastic interests of the Stuarts. We have covered the legend of Hiram at length and i t seems it has an ancient origin that cannot be traced to any sing le location and retains a sense that is strictly traditional and Ch ristian. We have also seen that the English craft did not overlook the gr ade of master, but that it was simply less differenciated in their practice than it was in Scotland. During the era of the transistion between the two f orms of masonry— operative and speculative—lodges of both England an d Scotland fol- lowed two rituals, those of the apprentice grade an d those of the journeyman grade. It is conceivable, though, that m asters in Scotland had, if not their own ritual, then at least signs o f identification—words and customs reserved for their use alone. By virtue of circumstance, Scottish master masons were able to take advantage of these distinctive features for purposes of superiority and management , which were not always purely initiatory. It was only starting in 1723 that the English mason s of the Grand Lodge of London instituted a clearly separate grade of master similar to that in Scotland. In the domain of ritual, a replic a of the journeyman ritual and the gradual impoverishment of its symbol ism accompanied this creation. There is nothing in their adoption t o suggest, however, that they were able to integrate the unique Scottis h features to reverse this impoverishment. Further, remaining within the strict concerns of the order, the grade of Scottish master could conti nue to be considered as a veritable extra grade with its own secrets. Th is would explain the nomination of \"Scots master masons\" that took place at that time, chiefly at the Lodge of Bath (Somerset) on October 28, 1735.

The f irst knighhood grade, the Knight of the Orient, did not appear unt il 1749. In some of my other books, I have dealt at length w ith the forma- tion and development of the high grades that are ca lled \"Scottish\" and have found nothing to suggest that the dynastic con cerns of the Stuarts brought them, or any other aspect of modern Freemas onry, into being. 15 Nonetheless, it has often been said that the Stuart s, despite the decline of their political fortunes, ceaselessly to ok advantage of the high grades of Freemasonry to facilitate their undertaki ngs. The Jesuits are said to have been their most active allies at infil trating these higher grades. At the same time, members of this religious order would have acted in their own interests, especially after 1762 during the Seven Years' War, at which time the Society of Jesus was dissolved in France and the order found its principal haven with the ch ief adversary of the king of France, Frederic II of Prussia. Later, in 1 773, Pope Clement XIV decreed the complete suppression of the order. It w as not restored until 1814 so that all its activity in between those two dates was more or less clandestine. While there is a telling lack of any historical cer titude about the Jesuit-Stuart alliance, there are certainly strong arguments supporting assertions concerning efforts made by the Stuarts a nd the Jesuits through Freemasonry. All of this, however, held onl y an episodic place in the history of the high masonic grades. What is primary and indu- bitable in the propagation of these grades and the constitution of the systems they embodied is their ritual and symbolic contents, which made them the vehicles of choice for mysticism and all the esoteric and Hermetic doctrines that were popular during the eig hteenth century.

Qu ite the contrary; the Church always had a presence within it, which m ade it easy to address a situation if particular circumstance call ed for steps to be taken. The Church took no greater concern regarding the admission of \"accepted\" members into the lodges. When religious and dynastic conflicts broke out in Great Britain, Church leaders quite naturally took an interest in the situation, decid- edly from the side of the Stuarts. They supported t hem through their misfortunes with words of encouragement, always a g ood thing, and with financial assistance, which is even better. Ja mes III visited the Pope on several occasions, especially following the Trea ty of Utrecht, and when Louis XIV was compelled to expel the Pretender from France, it was to Rome that he went in search of consolation a nd support.

Their long silence leads us to believe that they thought well of them. As noted by P.

It notes that the Freemasons shoul d be regarded as \"strongly suspect\" of heresy for reason of masonic secrecy and its corollary, the oath.

In 1735, these lodges drew up plans to form a provincial grand lodge, sending their request for a constitutional c harter to the Grand Lodge of London, which turned them down. To avoid a second refusal, they decided to go outside the organization and tha t following year, in accord with the \"Scottish\" Lodges, they founded on their own author- ity a provincial grand lodge. Two years later, on J une 24, 1738—in other words, six weeks following the issuance of th e papal bull—a peer of France, the Duke d'Antin,* was named the Perpetu al and General Grand Master of the Masons of the Kingdom of France . The creation of this Grand Mastery Association, ent rusted to a peer of France, dissolved the bonds of French Freemasons to the Grand Lodge of London, much to the irritation of their Br itish brethren. \"These ingrates forget that the splendor they enjoy comes to them only from England,\" was the bitter English response reco rded in the 1738 edition of Anderson's Book of Constitutions. French Freemasonry thereby escaped Protestant nationalism, as has been noted by Albert Lantoine. + There was no room for any ambiguity concerning the religious domain of French Freemasonry. On December 27, 1776, the very Catholic Lord Derwentwater, grand master of the Fre emasons of France—in other words, of the \"Scottish\" lodges—app roved and signed the Devoirs enjoints aux macons libres des l oges francaises, 17 which is simply a version of one of Anderson's Cons titutions, in which the phrase \"It is now considered more appropriate t o compel [the masons] only in that religion on which all men are in agreement,\" was replaced by this one: \"It has been deemed more appr opriate to require of them the religion appropriate to all Christians. \" This was the toler- ance, limited to Catholics and Protestants, that wa s then deemed polit- ically expedient to proclaim by both the Stuarts an d the Hanovers. The target was hit more precisely following 1738.

Lodges of both English and Scottish origin remained imbued by Catholicism during the course of the eighteenth cen tury, even within their sometimes heterodox nature. They thus rebuffe d the principal rea- son for the papal condemnation, which, now rendered meaningless, caused little worry among the French lodges to whic h the ecclesiastics aligned themselves in Mass. Interestingly, in 1781 half of the members of the L'Amitie a l'Epreuve Lodge of the Orient of Narbonne were members of the clergy 19 and in 1780 there were twenty-six lodges headed by priests. In Search of the Tradition French masonic unity appears to have been ensured b y the integral respect for tradition that was general practice. Th is put it out of step with the times, however. During the Age of Enlighte nment, when the Reason of Philosophers triumphed, faith was questio ned if not outright shaken and demanded fortification. A vast mystical current arose then in reaction against the skeptics and the libertines . Freemasonry, faithful to religion, helped to nurture this current. It cou ld claim to respond to all doubts and to unify the faith, which it would d o in the name of the religion it embodied. It was thus a matter of some importance that it formulate its principles and establish its forms, t hat it go further than the Church, or at least second that institution's e fforts, which were no longer capable of convincing the growing number of freethinkers.

I am con vinced that if one placed at the head of these assemblies wise men cho sen by Your Eminence, they could prove quite useful to the reli gion, the State, and to letters.\" It seemed Ramsay had not forgotten his conversations with Fenelon in Cambrai. He concluded his letter by reco unting these dis- cussions with words borrowed from his interlocutor: \"One cannot be sensibly a Deist without being a Christian, and one cannot be philo- sophically a Christian without becoming a Catholic. \" 20 This was both a well-intentioned and laudable begin ning. Still, it was necessary for Freemasonry to act as the central izing factor of Deist sentiments and the catalyst of their transcendental unity around aspira- tions for betterment. Eventually, a surprising deve lopment occurred within this presumptuous objective: Excess acted as compensation for doubt. Under the pretext of reforging its bonds wit h the order's origins, this spiritualist Catholic Freemasonry fabricated d uring the eighteenth century and beyond a veritable swarm of degrees and rites. Every his- torical or legendary delusion of mysticism found a home therein. This movement was followed next by Protestant and Cathol ic Germany and ultimately supplied a source of inspiration for Rom anticism. This was in turn relayed to the Americas in the form of the dreams of chivalry held by Caribbean colons. 21 The Light became the selva oscura of Dante. Everyone was to seek a clear view of this in order to discover the origin and goals of the Masonic order—that is, its tradition. The more pragmatic English, who were closer to the sources of Freemasonry, knew full well that this tradition was to be found among the builders of an earlier era. Brother Preston ass erted this fact in 1722 in his book Illustrations of Masonry. But no one to ok it any further. The quarrels between the Moderns and the Antients were based on a heav- ily obscured tradition. The authentic ritual passed down by a necessar- ily oral tradition had become lost over time and th e way it was received, even by self-declared Christians, had ceased to be comprehended and perceived, thus it could no longer be fully preserv ed in its form or in thought. The more serious Masons on the Continent, however, did not fail to demonstrate curiosity about the origins of the o rder and its tradition."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"266 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING The most notable displays of their interest were th e Congress of the Gauls held in Lyon in 1778 and the Wilhelmsbad Cong ress held in 1782. Primarily under the impetus of J. B. Willermo z, who was perhaps the best informed and most active Freemason of that time, the research arrived at the conclusion that Freemasonry was rela ted to the Templar Order, such as it was at the time of its founding. The Rectified Scottish Rite and the Order of the Benevolent Knights of the Holy City emerged from these conclusions. Freemasonry was therefore o riented toward chivalry in the best sense of the word, but the rit uals of the new rite approved in Wilhelmsbad showed proof, unfortunately , of an almost complete misunderstanding of the operative traditio n. The implemen- tation of this system was not negligible on the spi ritual and philosoph- ical planes, however, especially in Germany. But Fr eemasonry nevertheless continued to evolve primarily in a sta te of disorder and at the whim of unbridled imaginations. The famous Philalethan Congress held in Paris from 1785 to 1787 provides the perfect picture of the complete confus ion to which all eventually succumbed. It called upon eminent Freema sons from all lands and all rites to convene \"to discuss and clar ify the most essential points of the doctrine, the origin, and the histori cal affiliation of the true masonic science.\" Each of these seasoned broth ers, who came from all points on the horizon, brought with him his own pertinent opinion. The resulting understanding generally agreed upon w as that Freemasonry was the \"original religion\" handed down from such diverse sources as King Arthur, Richard I, Ramon Lu lle, the Gnostics and the School of Alexandria, the Templars (as inst ructed by Judas of Galilee, disciple of the hermit Banon), Pythagoras, Plato, Jesus Christ and the Apostles, the Persian philosopher Each-Ben- Mohammed- Eleansi, Ormus, the Egyptians, the Benedictines, th e Rosicrucians, Zoroaster, Abbaris, Channondas, Eudoxus, Hermippis, Hermes Trismegistus, Porphyrus, Plotinus, Proclus, Jambliq ue, the priesthood schools of India, the Gauls, the Hebrews, the Essen es, and the Persian magi. 22 The Temple of Solomon had been transformed into th e Tower of Babel.

P reston has no doubt confused the former with the builder masons.\" This citation clearly shows that the initiatory sense of traditio nal masonry had been lost. After two years of such distractions, it was not necessary to be a magician to prophesize with Cagliostro, who had ref used to have any- thing to do with the Congress and whose anthology o f stories moreover would have been enriched if it included his opinion : \"Miserable Philalethans, you sow in vain, you will reap naught but weeds.\" Starting in the nineteenth century and continuing r ight on into the present, these erring ways persist by staking claim s to the respect of imaginary sources. This has caused an amplification of both a trend of pseudospiritualism and occultism and a modernist tr end combining free thought, scientism, agnosticism, and politics. This highly diffused situ- ation has noticeably permeated the majority of ritu als for the higher degrees such as the Ancient and Accepted Scottish R ite, despite the fact that its motto is Ordo ab Chao [Order out of Chaos] . What path should be taken to restore the unity—in o ther words, the truth—of the operative tradition created by the cathedral builders? In 1938, in his book Qui est regulier?, Oswald Wirt h discussed the problem of knowing what remained faithful to pure M asonism under the regime of the grand lodges inaugurated in 1717. In his appraisal of this book Rene Guenon rightly observed that the aut hentic expression of pure Masonism could apply only to the craft masonry of a bygone era. He noted that if speculative Freemasonry would one day acknowledge this, it would be logically led to the integral res toration of the old oper- ative tradition. But, he went on to ask, where were those capable of achieving such a restoration, a task that was most likely impossible? 23 The Survival of Operative Masonry An integral restoration (and the necessary search f or it beforehand) of the ancient operative tradition: This is the primar y concern that has guided the writing of this book. There is an import ant aspect of this subject that we have overlooked up to now: In our e xamination of the"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"268 FROM THE ART OF BUILDING TO THE ART OF THIN KING appearance and development of modern speculative Fr eemasonry, we have assumed that since the time when modern Freema sonry was con- stitutionally formulated in 1717, operative masonry was for all intents and purposes finished. Along with many contemporary authors, we can certai nly deny the validity of the theory of a transition—at least for England but not Scotland. Many believe that modern Freemasonry has nothing in com- mon with the craft of masonry and that the people w ho made up its membership after around 1690 had quite simply decid ed to adopt the rites of masons to make their meetings more interes ting. It is plausible that this may well have been the case for the four lodges that formed the Grand Lodge of London. This line of reasoning, however, cannot escape the fact that in 1717 there were still a large number of lodges whose ori gin was incontestably operative. But wouldn't these lodges also have cons isted exclusively of speculative members? There is one other fact that i s certain. In modern Freemasonry lodges there was not a word mentioned o f operative mem- bers. Did they just leave everywhere of their own a ccord? Why did they become invisible and mute? These craft masons nonet heless continued to practice their profession. Did they all simply a nd unanimously renounce their rites and customs? Raising such ques tions does sow some doubts. It is reasonable to assume that an operative masonr y continued to exist and more or less continued to practice its tr aditional rites. It is the trace of this activity that needs to be rediscovere d. Unfortunately, no definitive elements remain in this regard. It is tr ue that we can cite the revelations made by Brother Clement Stretton and Br other John Yarker between 1908 and 1913, which were published in a va riety of Masonic magazines such as The Freemason and The Co-Mason in London and The American Freemason in Iowa. Their information w as then reprinted in a series of articles by the English ma gazine The Speculative Mason between 1950 and 1957. Rene Guenon mentioned his interest in it a number of times in Etudes Traditionnelles. Clemont Stretton said he had established contact wi th a lodge that was still operating under the principles of the for mer operative masonry that had survived beyond 1717 in Leicester County. He declared that"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The Grand Lodges and Modern Freemasonry 269 similar lodges remained in existence at this time, lodges that had never recognized as authentic or legitimate the modern Fr eemasonry of the Grand Lodge of London.

Stretton provided informa- tion on the organization, seven-degree hierarchy, a nd rituals of this operative masonry but unfortunately failed to suppl y any proof. A number of the revelations made here are so obviousl y interpolations, such as the seven-degree hierarchy, that it casts a shadow on the verac- ity of his entire claim. So it is clear that another approach entirely is re quired to seek out the operative tradition, which is what we have atte mpted here.

A lesson should also be drawn fo r contemporary Freemasonry, which views itself as the heir to the masons of the past and for all men striving to place human destiny wit hin the sacred value of its essence. In fashioning here an objective study based strictl y on facts, we may understand that today's widespread opinions concern ing the historical and spiritual origins of Freemasonry are merely con jectural if not ten- dentious. The facts, however, can speak clearly eno ugh on their own to require no interpretation at all. It is necessary, of course, to connect them to the social structures of the past, but only the way we think has the power to distort how we see them. By its very nature and purpose, the an of masonry w as never a strictly operative or purely local phenomenon. The millennia-old con- cept of craft that blossomed in the Christian world viewed it as insepa- rable from the Divine creative work. The worker cou ld stake no claim to performing his job well without the help of the Lord, and thus, by placing his activity on the path of perfection, he might raise himself to the Kingdom of God.

This grace als o required an"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Conclusion 271 implicit obedience to all moral commandments. The w hole of life was placed in a convergence of the sacred and the neces sity to heed the demands of the Divine. The initiatory ritual of dea th and resurrection is the ascetic reflection of the model of Christ's Passion. More than any other profession, that of construction illustrated this concept perfectly through the different kinds of knowledge it require d and the conjunc- tion of science and beauty in its art, and by its p urpose, whose grand- est and most testimonies are God's dwellings on ear th: churches and cathedrals. The art and learning that finds expression in the s mallest detail of every work is based on intangible foundations as th ey are touching on Perfection. This thereby establishes the tradition as well as the path to which a person must necessarily be initiated in ord er to take part in the Work. On the practical and social plane, Freemasonry inna tely tends to speculative and universal teaching. Although its fu ndamental values were faithfully handed down, the tradition of mason ry was ceaselessly enriched in its formulation by experience and the c onstant desire to do better. As an intinerant art that established conta cts between men from different places and brought different techniques t ogether, the univer- salist attitude within masonry led to the quest for everything that could bring together everything from the four corners of the world and make of them One through all the generations. When this coming together took place outside of the exclusivity of dogmas to establish relations between the different religions, it ran the risk of becoming embroiled in conflict with these d ogmas, which led to the growth of rationalism in the order's philosophy , allowing room and space for these differences. Does this mean that su ch antagonism was inevitable and impossible to resolve? This does not appear to be the case. Reason and faith are not mutually exclusive. They occupy differ- ent but complementary planes. The precedence we sho uld assign either one is fuel for endless debate by philosophers and theologians and is a delicate question indeed. The answer depends in fac t on what should be attributed to discursive thought and intuitive thou ght—two poles of one mind whose parameters are beyond measure and im possible to determine."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"272 CONCLUSION In fact, all authentic traditional paths can inters ect only as they are connected to the Absolute, which is One. Forms are merely different; they do not diverge. It is interesting to note that there was never any conflict in the art of building—that is, in the art of serving and express- ing the Sacred—among the Christian religion and Isl am either in Spain or the Holy Lands at the time of the Crusades. Quit e the contrary, their relationship was one of mutual teaching and recipro cal enrichment. The tragedy of operative masonry was the Reformatio n and Counter-Reformation. Rather than being a case of op position between two different religions, it embodied the opposition of different forms of worship within the same religion. This manifested i n differente liturgi- cal forms, which are simply circumstancial products of human sensibil- ity—but these forms ceased to be seen as anything m ore than what they were, an abstraction of the Transcendent Reality th ey expressed. What resulted was the rule of the iconoclasts. Freemasonry survived despite this critical blow. It survived through those elements within it that were undying: its ini atory path and its mode of expression: symbolism. In one country especially, Great Britain, long divi ded and torn by religious and political conflicts, it succeeded thr ough an adaptation of its mode of thinking and a transposition of its abi lity to act, to unite men of separate conviction, who, without Freemasonry, w ould have remained strangers to each other. This provided Freemasonry with a new point of departure. But this transformation did not occur wi thout upheaval, especially concerning the essential: the spiritual transmission, the tradi- tion, that ceased to be seen without an effort to i ntellectualize it. This is where our historical record concerning the origins of this tradition comes to a close. Above the vested intere sts, beliefs, and opin- ions, and across the centuries and many nations, Fr eemasonry, loyal to its origins, however hazy, maintained its perennial tradition of an ini- tiatory path that has made it the reflection of hum anity's eternal aspi- ration toward the Beautiful, the Good, and the Perf ect. For a contemporary Freemasonry that still declares itself to be an initiatory society despite the inevitable adaptatio ns that have been made, it is most important to grasp the simple and sublime, clear and profound lesson offered to it by history. It is a v aluable lesson for all"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Conclusion 273 those who wonder about the essential questions of b oth their origins and their destiny. The initiatory way from which tr aditional freema- sonry emerged is of a sacred nature. Embodying a qu est for the tran- scendent, a bond with the sacred, it is humanism in its complete and existential acceptance. At the same time this exist entialism is essential- ism. It erases any duality between subject and obje ct, between the path and the finality. In order to grasp these things, which touch on the Absolute, there is no need to employ the abstract vocabulary of phi losophers. Such things do exist because they can be felt and experi enced. No other ini- atory path has managed to better express the inexpr essible. The medieval freemason, the builder of the cathedrals, never viewed himself as anything more than the imagier of an infinitely more elevated work: the Temple of the Eternal One who dwells within Man , the Heavenly Jerusalem, symbol of the universality of all men be longing to all times and races, temples of Immortality and Perfection. This Great Work involves Consciousness, another asp ect of Infinity. Humans can lay claim to this perfection b ecause they possess it as something virtual, a sacred trust of which we must become aware. The great lesson to be drawn from this by al l humanity is found in the words of the good Jeremiah: \"Behold the days come, oracle of the Eternal ... I will set my law within them and w rite it on their hearts . . . Behold the days come that city shall b e built.\" The apostles Paul and James in turn stressed the divine truth of the indestructible unity and reciprocal demands of faith and works in order to aspire to transcendence. The key to the Holy of Holies promised to all is Lo ve, the major factor of the comprehensive illumination: Love for everything in Creation that is an immanent sign of the Light from Above; Love for all beings, who are all brothers by virtue of the subli me grace of this Love, which is the presence within them of the Absolute a nd the ability to per- ceive this presence. This Love, which is Conciousne ss, has nothing to do with science, learning, degrees, individual dist inctions, and fragile and sometimes deceptive assumptions based on circum stance. We can recall some other words of Jeremiah heraldin g the New Jerusalem: \"And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"274 CONCLUSION every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for t hey shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of the m\" (Jeremiah 31:34). The effort required by implementation, the path tha t must be taken, is the application to acquit ourselves well of ever y task to which our human condition makes us heir. This is the Work con ceived by all and on every plane as a sacred gesture, the co-particip ation in the perpetual creation of the Great Work of the Absolute. The con vergence within man of the finite and the infinite, the simultaneou s awareness of humil- ity and grandeur, were regarded by the operative ma sons as the best foundation for morality and social life: humility a nd grandeur made lib- erty, equality, and fraternity primary values. But what heavy demands are made upon us to attain t hese! The intelligence of a Saint Thomas Acquinas and the sen sibility of a Saint Francis of Assisi while possessing the prescience o f Christ's message: These lead to no more exploitation of man by man, n o more domina- tion and humiliation based on social distinctions, no more scorn for the weak, no more vainglory, no more baseless enrichmen t, and no more of anything that degrades the image of the Perfect One from whom the essence of human beings are crafted. This in brief is the spiritual, moral, and cultural patrimony of oper- ative freemasonry in its constitutive tradition. We can of course be fully aware that all of this never existed either as a wh ole or as a consequence of this tradition. But we do know, even if it might appear surprising from a contemporary perspective with eyes only for material progress, that all of this was perceived by those who lived d uring the Middle Ages—and by the masons better than anyone else. In the facts we know, touching upon work and human relations, we find no trace of a failure among them to advance the notions of \"fair salaries \" and \"fair prices\" or to condemn profit or to ignore the rule of frate rnity. Today this has all been forgotten and lost. For tho se very people who claim to best speak on behalf of these values a s the foundation of a civilization they ceaselessly invoke, these princ iples are ignored and the precepts that arise from them are nothing but e mpty words that have no actual effect on behavior.

For them, Freemasonry is a conjunction of t his dead past and this lifeless dream that shapes the nostalgic refug e of a few sensitive but faded souls. It is true that when compared with the ideal aspect of humanism, the realities of our world are quite removed from t his ideal. Who still speaks of the sacred value of man and his creative activity, Work? Isn't work all too often a painful and odious constraint from which we should be liberated? Do today's Freemasons, concern ed with the prob- lems of the hour and the next day, still know how t o decipher the secrets they have in storage? Finally, are these se crets from the small, motionless world of the artisan for whom time and e ternity did not matter have any usefulness for our large industrial societies, so complex and overwhelmed by a rhythm that is ceaselessly acc elerating? Under these conditions, wouldn't it be better for those s till smitten with spiri- tuality to attempt to reinvigorate Freemasonry with a traditional con- tribution from external sources, and for those whos e feet remain firmly planted on the ground to utilize their abilities on a new path that is more rational, useful, and sure? Some might subsequently believe that, confronted by historical assumptions and objective analysis, Freemasonry wil l be reduced to either an illusory record or a dilemma requiring ab negation or innova- tion. In either case, the danger for Freemasonry wi ll be enormous.

Those who have faith in God don't see him with the eyes of chil- dren, enthroned on top of a mountain of sugar betwe en blessed rivers of honey. We refrain from talking of him too much a nd seeking to define him. It is preferable to envision the itiner ary that allows us to approach him and to think that God constructed hims elf in such a way that man's gravitation to the Spirit is, by virtue of reason, the best proof of God's existence. Those of increasing number who do not believe in God or who turn him into an abstraction out of a co ncern for tolerance, base what they deem to be just, good, and desirable on the good use of reason, on their trust in intelligence, and on the infinite perfectability of humanity. The difference between these two attitudes is essen tially dependent on the value given to the origin of reason: God, st ill unknown to the believer; or the unknown, for the nonbeliever anoth er cause for natural laws that govern life. In one case or the other, if we use our ability to reason as best we can, to work with the certitude o f the goal yet to be attained, what are we doing if not working under th e auspices of and for the glory of this Unknown?
