The spirit of unrest is in the air. On the sur- face of things today, CommerciaUsm most often and most loudly claims attention. Great combinations oi capital and the massing of millions seem the order of the day. Within the body politic organi- zation and cooperation is being tried on a scale never before recorded in the history of man, and economic problems are being tested in a way that cannot help adding immensely to the combined ex- perience of mankind. What the final outcome may be, only the wisest could now say, and perhaps only the foolish would venture to predict. But human nature is essentially a stable product, and can be relied on in any event.

Potent as is all this commercial unrest and eco- nomic strife, other problems are equally up for solution. Using the term in its broadest sense, the Psychic problem keeps pace with the economic. Ethics and Economics are inseparable. The con- duct of the individual, and the use of the resources of life and the distribution of wealth, always in- volve both ethics and economics; in short, consti- tute them. Outside the churches and religious literature we hear less about religion nowadays. Indeed, many otherwise good people seem to think religion obso- lete ; a thing of the past ; a survival — where, indeed, it is admitted to have survived at all — of the dark ages. No greater mistake could possibly be made. The surface problems may have changed; organi- zations may have broken up or disappeared, but the vital issues not only remain, but were never more in evidence than today. Nor can it be other- wise so long as the essential nature of man remains unchanged. Only the imbecile or the degenerate can really ignore the religious element in his own nature if he tries. Just as inevitably as water seeks its level."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Foreword to the Third Edition. ix and ultimately finds its way to the sea, does man feel after that Power — called by whatsoever name — whose divine ray makes him Man, and whose in- dwelling presence lifts him, at rare moments, be- yond sordid self, and beckons his soul toward the higher, the larger, the better, as by the touch of wings. This is a universal experience, equally known to the savage and the civilized, and entirely independent of theologies or ecclesiasticism. Theologians in all ages have seized hold of this common human experience and formulated and en- deavored to guide it, and have often exploited it, just as capitalists have dealt with economic prob- lems in the resources of nature and the distribution of wealth. This is, broadly speaking, the psychic problem, consitituting the religious element in the life of man. It was never more manifest than it is today. This it is that now runs pari passu with commer- cialism; and while, as already said, it may make less noise, it is everywhere in evidence. Every problem in the life of man, and every movement that affects society, is, in the last analy- sis, a psychic problem. One and all they concern the body and its environments incidentally, and the soul essentially."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"X Foreword to the Third Edition. The progress made in physical science in the last half century is so remarkable that it is difficult to find an adjective suitable with which to designate it. Hence the economic problems already referred to are necessarily to be revised. While the psychic problems have come into equal prominence, no such organized results can be pointed out as in economic experiments. The race, as a whole, has been gathering facts and making experiments. The working hypothesis in psychol- ogy has seldom been suggested. At any rate, there is no large or general agreement as to any theo- rems. There seem to be no designs on the trestle- board, and the workmen, the legions, are in con- fusion. The great majority of people, even among the educated and intelligent, will make haste to deny that this psychic theorem has ever been known to man. That it could ever have been discovered and then' lost, or concealed, is to them preposterous; yet the whole of the traditions and symbolism of Masonry cluster around this theorem, this working hypothesis in the psychical life of man. It is the one thing needed to bring order out of confusion in the psychic problems that interest so many at the present time."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Foreword to the Third Edition. xi This Great Secret, this Master's Word, was known to and preserved in the Mysteries of An- tiquity, and is embodied and preserved in the tradi- tions and symbols of Masonry today. This fact has been stated repeatedly in the body of this little book, the real purpose of which was to set students, and particularly masonic students, to searching for the real secret. It is the reward of study and de- votion, and has never been obtained on any other terms. It has never been conferred in the ritualis- tic degrees of the Lodge, and' never will or can be. It is the establishment of understanding in the soul of man between that higher self in him, and the More, and the Beyond self from which he draws his life, and from which his intuitions spring. This is real Initiation: Becoming: At-one-ment. The author is both gratified and encouraged al the reception accorded and the interest manifested in this little book, and the commendations received from many quarters. That it could become, in any broad sense, popular, he never for a moment im- agined. It is too serious and void of sensational- ism for that. In entering now on its third thou- sand, it has already exceeded any expectation of the author, who will be profoundly gratified if he may aid. though it be but a little, in increasing the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"xii Foreword to the Third Edition. respect entertained by the community at large for the Order of Freemasonry, and encourage his brother Masons in seeking More Light. I beheve that nowhere amongst men today can there be found so near an approach to an Ideal Brotherhood of Man as in the Masonic Lodges. Perfect it is not, and cannot be till human evolution is completed. Among the hundreds of thousands of Masons today in the United States it would be difficult to find one who does not strive his best to exercise charity and loving-kindness, particularly toward his brothers in the Lodge. There are thou- sands of Masons, moreover, who realize that Masonry contains and implies far more than ap- pears in the ritual and ceremonies of the Lodge. There is a very widespread and growing interest in this direction, and it is this that Mystic Ma- sonry, above all else, is designed to foster, encour- age, and help. Indeed, the growth of this feeling in the past decade is remarkable, and the present writer has not a shadow of a doubt as to the result. It is the ethical precepts inculcated in the Lodge and so largely practiced by the craft, more than all else, that open the higher intuitions of man, and so enable him to grasp and finally comprehend the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Foreword to the Third Edition. xiii higher problems concealed in the profound sym- bolism of Masonry. Modern Masonry is thus fast becoming, like its ancient prototype, a School of the Mysteries; the real Mystery being the origin and nature of the human soul, and the transcendent and immortal destiny of Man. The Masonic organization is so large, so wide- spread, so strong; its spirit so fraternal; its teach- ing so helpful and inspiring, that it seems destined to achieve the most glorious results in the encour- agement and uplifting of the whole human race. The hard and fast lines that have heretofore seg- regated mankind are rapidly disappearing. Creed and dogma have lost their hold since the State no longer protects them, and the anathemas of eccle- siastics are no longer feared. Men and women of all classes are coming into closer touch with the avowed purpose of understanding, in order that they may help each other. It is more and more recognized that the good of one is the welfare of all. The \"sin of separateness\" is thus slowly being undermined. Hence the ethical, the religious, the economic, and the political problems are seen to be practically inseparable, and all definitely related in the one problem of the higher evolution of man.

That a second edition of this little book should be called for within six weeks of the date of issue is, perhaps, the best answer to the inquiry in the mind of its author as to what kind of a reception so serious a view of modern Freemasonry, and so high an estimate of Ancient Mysteries as is herein set forth, might receive. It has not only attracted at- tention and excited inquiry, but met the unqualified approval of certain high Masons. Sir Albert Pike's greatest work, restricted to the members of the craft, obtained but one hundred and fifty sub- scribers. If Mystic Masonry quadrupled this sub- scription list before the date of publication, the reason is to be sought, not in the superior quality of the book, but in the more popular form in which the subject is handled, in the removal of all restric- tions as to subscribers, and still more, from the fact that a widespread interest has of late arisen in re- gard to these subjects; offering, as the author be- lieves, the grandest opportunity presented to real"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"xvi Preface to the Second Edition. Masonry for more than a thousand years, for pre- senting its sublime philosophy to the world for the upHfting of humanity. Mystic Masonry is, to a considerable extent, a compilation. It was not the author's purpose to become an innovator, but rather, in a modest way, an inspirer and renovator, and for this purpose he but repeated statements that had already been made by those high in Masonic authority, statements that had been overlooked or forgotten, and that needed to be remembered. In his preface to Morals and Dogma, Mr. Pike declares that about one-half of that work is original matter, and half taken from various sources, and that as he was writing neither for fame nor money, but for the benefit of the craft, the source of what he had set down was a matter of secondary importance. He often adapted, rather than quoted, in many places, and very seldom gave authorities. He wrote those things which he evi- dently believed his Masonic Brotherhood ought to know, and as he had divested his mind of all selfish motive or hope of gain, so must he be exempt from the charge of plagiarism. He drew very largely, in many places, from the writings of Abbe Constant, better known as Eliphas Levi, whose writings then existed only in the French language, and which un-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Preface to the Second Edition. xvii doubtedly contain the most profound knowledge of the Occult Sciences and the Ancient Mysteries given to the world since the days of the Old Initiates. As the present author has observed, in the body of this book, it matters far less whence these truths have been derived than what they really mean, although no reader is bound to accept the interpretation put upon them by any writer or commentator. Yet every intelligent inquirer may discern their general reasonableness, the logical sequence of the whole as revealing a profound philosophy of Nature and of Life, and the beneficent influence they must exert if universally diffused and generally adopted amongst men. Liberty and Equality based on Fraternity may have degenerated into a slogan of blood in the days of the French Revolution, yet in more peaceful times must such Fraternity be interpreted as the ideal state, and made to promote the Universal and Un- qualified Brotherhood of Man."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION. The object of the author of this book is to show the relation between Freemasonry and the Mysteries of Antiquity. This much, at least, is implied by the title of the book. That there is both a historical and philosophical thread uniting these departments of human thought and action is well known to every intelligent student of Masonry, no less than to all students of Symbolism and Mysticism. One trav- eler, in the wilds of South America, records the fact that he found there an ancient roadbed running over mountain an(J valley for hundreds of miles. By whom this ancient structure was built is a mat- ter of conjecture. It is now broken by time, with great gaps here and there, and forest trees obliter- ating its pathway, but 14; everywhere shows the de- signing hand of man.

Masonry deals largely with the ethics and sym- bolism of the Ancient Mysteries. The writer be- lieves that through the well-timed efforts of Masons today the grandest achievements in knowledge ever gained by man, which were originally concealed in the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, and in time be- came lost to the world, may be again recovered. In the strictest sense this knowledge has never really been lost, as there have always existed those who were possessed of the Great Secret. It was orig- inally veiled in order to conceal it from the pro- fane, and written in a universal language of Sym- bolism that the wise among all nations and through- out all time might read it, as it^were, in their own language. It was also written in parable and alle- gory, so that the unlettered and common people might not be deprived of its wise precepts, and of its force in shaping character, dissipating igno- rance, and inspiring hope. This Ancient Wisdom is the fountain from which Masonry takes its rise.

J'xi were destroyed by priests and potentates, jealous of their influence. For many weary centuries men have been trying to recover the lost key and to re- store the ancient wisdom from the parables and alle- gories in which it had been concealed. But progress in this inverse order is not only necessarily slow and uncertain, but all such attempts have, more or less, given rise to fantastic flights of the imagina- tion, and resulted in confusion, rather than in en- lightenment. The result has been to bring the whole subject under contempt, and to make the name \"mysticism\" mean something vague and uncertain, if not altogether foolish, to those ignorant of its true meaning. \"Remember,\" says Bro. Albert Pike, \"that the lessons and ceremonies of these degrees (those of the Blue-Lodge) have been for ages more and more accommodating themselves, by curtailment and sinking into common-place, to the often limited memory and capacity of the Master and Instructor, and to the intellect and needs of the Pupil and Initiate; that they have come to us from an age when symbols were used, not to reveal but to con- ceal : when the commonest learning was confined to a select few, and the simplest principles of moral- ity seemed newly discovered truths: and that these"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"xxii Introduction. antique and simple degrees now stand like the broken columns of a roofless, Druidic temple in their mutilated greatness : in many parts also cor- rupted by time, and disfigured by modern additions and absurd interpretations.\" — Morals and Dogma, p. 1 06. Here, then, are two causes that have operated to render the old wisdom difficult of recovery, viz., concealment, and ignorant alteration or misinterpre- tation. To these must be added a third source of obliteration, viz., the direct efforts of interested par- ties to utterly destroy all records. \"Let one only think of the thousands, and perhaps millions, of MSS. burnt; of monuments with their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols pulverized to dust ; of the bands of early hermits and ascetics roaming about among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert and mountain, valley and high- lands, seeking for and ready to destroy every obe- lisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay their hands upon, if it only bore the symbol of the tau or any other sign borrowed and appropriated by the new faith: — and he will then see plainly how it is that so little has remained of the records of the Past.\" — Secret Doctrine, p. xl., vol.

The author of this book desires to aid all that he can in this noble and glorious undertaking. In the effort to bring about such a result it is not contemplated that any innovations whatever should be introduced into Masonry as now organized. If the sublime philosophy which is the heritage of Masonry shall become universally diffused and ren- dered capable of apprehension by all intelligent persons, not only among Masons, but everywhere, its beneficent influence may thus become universal among men. In this way may be hastened the rise of that Great \"Republic of which every Nation is a family, and every individual a child.\" It will be very naturally questioned whether any thing can be definitely ascertained regarding the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, inasmuch as they were always concealed, never revealed to the pro- fane, never published to the world, and only re- corded in glyph, parable and allegory. It has al- ready been shown that all attempts to discover the real secret by running backward from parable and allegory have resulted in confusion and discourage-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"xxiv Introduction. ment. The interpretations resulting have been as fantastic and varied as the genius of each investi- gator; had any of these been possessed of a uni- versal key to symbolism, or a complete philosophy of the Secret Doctrine, the result might have been very different. The solution of this question is not only greatly simplified, when investigation is guided by such a philosophy, or a complete key, but the in- vestigator has the positive assurance at every step that he is on firm ground. But a far more important consideration remains to be noted. There is a tradition in the far East, and to be often traced more or less vaguely in the West, that the Great Lodge of the Magi, the Adepts, the Perfect Masters, knov^n and designated also by many other names, has never ceased to exist; that this Lodge has often, though secret and unknown, shaped the course of Empire and controlled the fate of Nations. Knowing always the line of least re- sistance, and when and how to act, and having al- ways in view only one object, viz., the Progress of Humanity and the Brotherhood of Man; despising fame and worldly honors, and working \"without the hope of fee or reward,\" they have concealed their labors, and either influenced those who knew"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxv them not to do their work, or worked through agents pledged to conceal their very existence. To the public generally, this may be a matter of little interest or importance, as the character of the work done must be the sole criterion by which that work is to be measured. But to Masons it should be of interest, as showing what it is to be indeed a Master Builder. It will reveal to them the meaning and goal of human evolution, and give them the unqualified assurance that that evolution is being now aided by those who know, as it has not been for many centuries. Such work has now become possi- ble, because of a cycle of liberality and enlighten- ment, when the workers are not likely to be sacri- ficed to the Moloch of bigotry and superstition. Granting that such Masters exist, and that they are possessed of profound knowledge, that they are ready to help the world, the world must be ready and will- ing to receive such help, if it is to be benefited by it, instead of destroying its agents. Guided, then, by a complete philosophy; armed with a key to symbol- ism, and aided by these Grand Masters, the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity may be restored and made to tell their hoary secrets for the benefit of the coming age. The object of this book is to give an outline of"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"xxvi Introduction. such work; it is introductory, and, to some extent, explanatory, but by no means exhaustive. It is not based upon any authority beyond the author's sin- cere convictions and capacity to apprehend the sub- ject. The Mason who is ready to dig deeper and fill in the outline here furnished is recommended to read carefully, if he has not already done so, Albert Pike's great book. Morals and Dogma. The historical method of research is not followed in the compilation or writing of this book, although historical facts are herein recorded. It is of far less importance to determine whence Masonry has been derived, than what it really teaches. In answering this question, it may be justly charged that the au- thor has put his own interpretation forward, not against facts or history, but in the face of what may be regarded as insufficient historical proof. To such a charge he would reply, first, that no well-authenti- cated history of Masonry is known to exist; there being only isolated facts, or fragments, recording the existence of certain organizations or movements at different times, and their disappearance on account of inward dissension or outward persecution. Then another movement would spring up, at another time and place, and perhaps under a different name, though evidently working on the same general lines."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxvii only to meet with a similar fate. One writer makes the statement that fully eight hundred different de- grees have thus, from time to time, been introduced to the Craft as Masonic. In no case does there exist any reliable consecutive history of these various movements. But even if such history existed, it would but little serve the purpose of the present work, as will be readily seen from what has hereto- fore been said regarding all these attempts to dis- cover the Lost Word, by reading backward from the outer form of Symbolism. Such a history would be curious and interesting, as showing the fertility of the human imagination, and its proneness to regard as valuable that which is curious and fantastic, be- cause it is concealed. Mere vulgar curiosity and secrecy alone have never yet been the pass-words to the Adytum of real Initiation. On the other hand, such a history, did it really exist, would be tinged with a touch of pathos, on account of the many sor- rowful disappointments it would have to record, in the case of earnest souls seeking, with sincerity and in truth, for the \"Lost Word of the Master,\" only to be overwhelmed at last by disappointment, or to be publicly executed as malefactors and enemies of State or Church. Such histories as exist well de- serve, in many cases, the designation of \"organized"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"xxviii . Introduction. fiction,\" and almost invariably record merely the opinions of those who were friendly or unfriendly to such movements, with a corresponding dearth of facts. For these reasons, no specially historical character is attempted to be given to this work. One of the strong points urged by the writer is the logical in- ferences drawn from such facts as are known to exist, and the general spirit everywhere admitted as pervading the Ancient Mysteries in their orig- inal purity. That such organizations should exist through all time and yet be without a history seems at first a strange paradox. The enemies of Ma- sonry will urge this fact as a reason for rejecting all that is herein contained, ignorant of the fact that few histories of any people or any epoch are better founded. Foremost among these detractors or deniers will be found the bigoted sectarian and the modern materialist. With each of these the real genius of Masonry is in perpetual conflict. For the first, the universal and unqualified Brotherhood of Man, is a dead letter, for he believes that only himself and his chosen associates can be saved. For the second, the materialist, the recognition of the Divine Architect of the Universe, in Masonry, as the \"Principle of Principles,\" and belief in the im-"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxix mortality of the Soul, will prove an equal stum- bling block. Fortunately, the number of bigoted sectarians and the out-and-out materialists is few. The historical deficiency referred to is by no means without a parallel. That superstructure known as Christianity has, it is true, many historical phases ; of dogmas the most contradictory; ot doctrines pro- mulgated in one age, and enforced with vice-regal authority, and severe penalties for denial and dis- belief, only to be denied and repudiated as \"damn- able heresy\" in another age. In the meantime, the origin of these doctrines and the personality of the Alan of Sorrows around which these traditions clus- ter receive no adequate support from authentic his- tory. What, then, shall we conclude regarding the real genius of Christianity ? Is it all a fable, put forth and kept alive by designing men, to support their pretensions to authority ? Are historical facts and personal biography alone entitled to credit? While everlasting principles. Divine Beneficence, and the laying down of one's life for another are of no account? Is that which has inspired the hope and brightened the lives of the down-trodden and despairing for ages a mere fancy, a designing lie?

The historical contention might be given up, ignored, and the whole character, genius, and mission of Jesus, the Christ, be none the less leal, beneficent, and eternal, with all of its human and dramatic episodes. Explain it as you will, it can never be explained away ; the character remains ; and whether Historical or Ideal, it is real and eternal. This digression serves to illustrate a principle of interpretation. The Traditions and Symbols of Masonry do not derive their real value from his- torical data, but from the universal and eternal truths which they embody. Were they historical epi- sodes only, the world in its cyclic revolutions would long ago have swept by them and buried them in eternal oblivion. These great truths, obscured and lost in one age by misinterpretation or persecution, rise, Phoenix-like, rejuvenated in the next. They are Immortal Ideals, knowing neither decay nor death. They are like a Divine Image concealed in a block of stone (the rough ashler), which many artists assail with mallet and chisel, square and compass, only, perchance, to release a distorted"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxxi idol. Only the Perfect Master can so chip away the stone as to reveal in all its grandeur and beauty the Divine Ideal, and endow it with the breath of life. Such is the building of character. The fable of Pygmalion and Galatea is, after all, more real than history. The thread of history is not in isolated facts, joined by conjecture, and warped to the ig- norant, bigoted, and time-serving opinions of men. The real thread is to be sought in the theme that runs through the symphony of creation ; in the lofty Ideals that inspire the life of man, and that lead him from the clod and the lowlands, where hover the ghosts of superstition and fear, to the mountains of light, where dwell forever inspiration and peace. Such ideals are the Christ, Hiram, and the Perfect Master. It is doubtful whether any portion of the present organization of Masonry, as such, can be traced further back than the middle of the 17th century. The great Masonic revolution of 1717, and the Constitutions of 1723 and 1738, seem to have brought into existence the present organizations ; which, by no means uniform throughout the world, have, nevertheless, very much in common. There were indeed earlier organizations, often unknown and un- suspected, and operating under different names,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xxxii Introduction. while using the same glyphs and symboHsm; but no direct connection has been clearly shown to exist between these organizations and those of the present time. But as our pursuit is philosophical rather than historical, and our appeal rather to reason than to authority, we need not go into these matters further than may be necessary as land- marks in following our philosophical thread. A distinctively Christian character is now given to some of the Masonic degrees in Europe and America. Without the slightest opposition to the Christian religion, as such, it can readily be shown that a sectarian bias of any kind is an innovation, wholly unwarranted, and entirely contrary to the genius of Masonry. Masonry, on the broad prin- ciple of toleration and brotherhood, can exclude neither Jew nor Gentile, Parsee nor Buddhist from its ample fold. Masonry is chiefly indebted to the French Jesuits for the distinctively Christian char- acter of some of its degrees. The templar degrees are purely sectarian, and can in no sense claim that universal character which recognizes the fraternity of all religions, and finds fellowship with all men, as brothers of one common humanity. No genuine Mason, imbued with the spirit of liberality, will treat any religion with derision or contempt, or ex-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxxiu elude from membership any Brother who beUeves in the existence of God, the Brotherhood of Man, and the ImmortaHty of the Soul. This Catholic spirit is the very foundation of Masonry, and any de- parture from it is un-Masonic, and subversive of the ancient Landmarks and Genius of Masonry. If the Catholic Priests have the right to Christianize Masonry, so have Jews, Buddhists, or Mohamme- dans, an equal right to transform it to fit their own creeds; and such transformation in every case de- prives Masonry of its universal character. While it cannot benefit the creed to which Masonry is made to conform, it will, in the end, destroy Ma- sonry itself. True Masonry has, for ages, held aloft the torch-light of Toleration, Equity and Fra- ternity. The bigoted sectarian, whoever he may be, divides the world into two classes: those who, with zeal and blind faith, accept his dogmas, and those who do not. The first he calls \"brothers,\" the sec- ond class he regards as aliens, if not enemies. Masonry, while adopting no religion and no form of doctrine or creed, as such, or as formulated by any one religion, recognizes certain basic principles embodying the ethics taught in all religions. Every Mason may formulate his creed to suit himself, and may institute such forms of worship as may seem to"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"xxxiv Introduction. him desirable or beneficent. Now, that the old creeds are everywhere losing their hold and falling in pieces, it is more than ever necessary to show that none of these have ever been a legitimate part of Masonry; that while Masonry antagonizes none, it can adopt none as Masonic. This impartial spirit is the basis of that impartial justice illustrated in more than one Masonic degree. \"The distinction between the esoteric and ex- oteric doctrines (a distinction purely Masonic) was always and from the very earliest times preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous time of Orpheus. . . . And after the time of Alex- ander they resorted for instruction, dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools; to those of Egypt and Asia, as well as those of ancient Thrace, Sicily, Etruria, and Attica.\" The real source from whence the Ancient Wis- dom came was Persia and old India, the Mother of Civilizations and Religions, and of the esoteric or concealed wisdom.

To recover the Lost Word is to revive the Ancient Wisdom, and this will facilitate Universal Fraternity and Universal Progress more than all other agencies now in our possession. In its ritualism and monitorial lessons Masonry teaches nothing in morals, in science, in religion, or in any other department of human knowledge or human interest, not taught 'elsewhere in current forms of thought, or by the sages of the past. In these directions it has no secrets of any kind. It is in the ancient symbols of Freemasonry that its real secrets lie concealed, and these are as densely veiled to the Mason as to any other, unless he has studied the science of symbolism in general, and masonic symbols in particular. In place of the term Mystic Masonry, the term Symbolic Masonry might have been used alone, but just here lies the whole secret, a profound mystery, and few Masons up to the present time have had the interest or the patience necessary to such investigation. This is a fact, and not intended as either a criticism or a reproach. If"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"xxxvi Introduction. lacking a knowledge of the profound meaning of masonic symbolism, and its transcendent interest and importance, Masons have allowed the whole or- ganization not only to fail in all real progress, but to degenerate, that is indeed a reproach. The number of individuals admitted to fellowship in the various degrees can not atone for such degeneracy, but on the contrary it rather emphasizes it. The author of this book is perfectly well aware that such a treatise will not be popular with a certain class of Masons. They are almost certain to regard it with contempt and to undertake to frown it down. They will make the statement, which is perfectly true, that no such meaning has before been explained to them, and that no such philosophy is found in the moni- torial instructions of the Lodge. The author can not, therefore, be justly accused of revealing any of the secrets of the Lodge unlawfully. The most profound secrets of Masonry are not revealed in the Lodge at all. They belong only to the few. This again, if admitted as a fact, will seem an injustice. But these secrets must be sought by the individual himself, and the candidate is debarred from possess- ing them solely by his own inattention to the hints everywhere given in the ritual of the Lodge, or by his indifference to the subject. If he prefers to"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxxvii treat the whole subject with contempt, and to deny that any such real knowledge exists, it becomes evi- dent that he not only closes the door against the possibility of himself possessing such knowledge, but he also becomes impervious to any evidence of its existence that might come to him at any time. He has no one but himself to blame if he is left in darkness. On the other hand, there is a large and increasing number of persons among Masons who really desire more light; who are satisfied that there must be other and profounder meanings behind the ritual and ceremonies of the Lodge. Some of these have taken the hint and \"Journeyed Eastward\" in search of Light. The play made upon the word \"light,\" in the Royal Arch, and in almost every other degree; the three greater lights, and the three lesser, ought to teach every intelligent Mason that Light, and the trinity, or triangle of lights, have a profound mean- ing, or else that the whole ritual is a meaningless farce. Aside from all interest that any individual Mason may find in the subject for his own enlight- enment, it is obviously his duty, while preserving unaltered the usages and landmarks of the Order, to advance the interests and fame of Masonry itself"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"xxxviii Introduction. by every just and benevolent means in his power. The names that are honored in the traditions of the Lodge and in the history of the Order, belong to those who have thus achieved enduring fame, and they are held aloft in the ritual of the Lodge as worthy of all emulation. But shall neither the present nor the future add anything to this roll of honor? or, if need be, to the list of martyrs? Are the days of noble deeds past with Masonry forever? and the need of self-sacrifice and devotion altogether a thing of the past? There was never greater need than at the present time ; never so great an opportu- nity as now for Masonry to assume its true place among the institutions of man and to force recogni- tion by the simple power of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth, based upon philosophy such as nowhere else exists outside of its ancient symbols. If the majority of Masons do not realize the true signili- cance and value of their possessions, there is all the more need for those who do to speak out, even in the face of discouragement and detraction, and do their utmost to demonstrate the truth. Does any in- telligent Mason imagine that the guilds of practical Masons of a century and a half ago originated the Order of Freemasons? There were indeed Archi- tects and Master Builders among them, but the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Introduction. xxxix great majority of Masons were far more ignorant, as manual servants, than the majority of such builders are today. Freemasonry is modeled on the plan of the Ancient Mysteries, with their glyphs and allegories, and this is no mere comcidence; the parallels are too closely drawn. Bro. Pike came to the conclusion, after long and patient investigation, that certain Hermetic Philosophers had a hand in the construction of the organization of Free and Ac- cepted Masons, and if they embodied in its symbol- ism more than appears on the surface, and far deeper truths than the superficial student readily discerns, it was evidently designed that future gen- erations should discern and use these profounder secrets. The evidence in this direction is not only conclusive but overwhelming, though only frag- ments of it can be here adduced. In brief, then, the real secrets of Freemasonry lie in its Symbols, and the meaning of the symbols reveals a profound philosophy, and a universal science, that have never been transcended by man. The author of this book is not presumptive enough to claim that he has exhausted, or altogether appre- hended, in its entirety, this old philosophy. He has, however, found such interest in its study, and it has opened to him such a mine of wealth, with"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"xl Introduction. such treasures revealed at every step, that he desires to share these precious jewels with his fellow crafts- men, that they may also go further, and from the secret vaults bring forth for inspection other and greater discoveries. These jewels have not been concealed by accident, but by design, in order that they might, in some future age, be restored. Even the stone that was rejected, and became lost in the rubbish, not only bears an emblem, and contains a mark, but is itself, from first to last, with its sur- roundings, method of restoration, and final use, a symbol. It is the center of a five-pointed star, which is the kabalistic sign of man. In one direc- tion, it symbolizes the five senses, lost in the rubbish of passion and selfish gratification. When this re- jected or lost stone is recovered, and sent to the King of the temple (man's Higher-Self), and is recognized and restored, the arch is complete, and the gateway of the senses gives entrance to the \"Palace of the King.\" The result is light or il- lumination. Such are the Illuminati. The writing of this book has been altogether a la- bor of love. It is designed to be no less a tribute to the Heroes and Martyrs of Masonry in the Past, than an humble offering to the Fraternity of the Present. J. D. B.

Even this much may be discerned from physical evolution alone; from the study of the human brain, in which there is a con- tinually increasing portion of gray substance set free from the functions incident to the preservation of the physical structure, and evidently designed to be appropriated to separate and higher uses. Mere in- tellectual activities alone, connected with the phys- ical plane, with the maintenance and enjoyment of life, will not explain the philosophy of cerebral de- velopment. It is largely for this reason that the ofifices of the encephalon are so little known today. There are latent powers and almost infinite capabili- ties in man, the meaning of which he has hardly yet dreamed of possessing. Nor will leisure and intel- lectual cultivation alone reveal these powers. It is only through a complete philosophy of the entire nature of man and the capacities and destiny of the human soul, supplemented by the use of such knowl- edge, that man will eventually come into the pos- session of his birthright; and from this \"general infancy\"— as Browning puts it— begin the journey from real manhood to perfection. Two conditions at the present time stand squarely"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 43 in the way of such achievements : first, anarchy and confusion, the resuh of selfishness in all social re- lations. This condition can be overcome in but one v^^ay, viz., by the recognition of the unqualified Brotherhood of Man; not as a theory, a religious duty, or a mere matter of sentiment; but as a fact in Nature; a universal and Divine Law; the penalty for the violation of which is precisely the conditions under which humanity now suffers. The second condition, which has given rise to \"Confusion among the Workmen\" in building the social temple and the individual habitation of man, is false ideals ; inefficient methods of education ; and almost total ignorance of the existence and the na- ture of the soul. The result of this ignorance may be seen in the fact, that not one individual in a million who has both leisure and opportunity, makes any real advancement in the evolution of the higher powers ; or is even cognizant of the fact that he is a LIVING SOUL. Old age is filled, not only with in- firmities, but with miseries without number. Not one in a million can say with the poet: \"Tis the sunset of life, gives me mystical lore; As coming events east their shadows before.\" In the great majority of cases with the aged, death"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"44 Mystic Masonry. is looked upon with uncertainty or fear, or as a blessed release from suffering and sorrow. Life is thus endured as a necessary evil, and is more often voted by the individual to be a failure than a suc- cess. What life ought to be is often conceived from our many failures; what it might be is dimly perceived from the intuitions of the soul which the struggles and selfishness of existence have failed to entirely obliterate. These things ought not so to be, nor need they longer be, if earnest men and women would seek diligently, first for the cause of all our ills, and sec- ondly, for a sufficient remedy. This remedy is to be found, first, in Knowledge; second, in Service of the Truth. Let us now examine a little more in de- tail some of the conditions under which we suffer. The present is proudly designated as the Age of Science. The art of printing, the power of Steam and Electricity in applied science; the Conservation and Correlation of Energy, and the Theory of Evo- lution in speculative science, with the resulting details, constitute the greater part of our real dis- coveries. One machine is made to do the work of a score or more of men, while the laborers who have been thus displaced have no adequate share in the profits of mechanical invention. Those who work"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 45 with their hands are no longer artisans, but gener- ally machines, a necessity as to different details for which no machine has yet been invented. The work of the laboring classes is thus reduced to the routine of drudgery without the hope of advancement; and, therefore, with no other incentive than to keep the wolf from the door. A manufactured article which, when completed, serves more often to foster ex- travagance and luxury than to supply a necessity, passes through many hands before it is completed. The laborer is glad even thus to serve, because idle- ness means starvation, and still the Army of the Un- employed is an ever-increasing host. The occupa- tion of the common laborer is even more precarious than that of the mechanic or the artisan. Is it any wonder, then, that in times of financial uncertainty, • when thousands of laborers are out of employment and threatened with starvation, unable to apprehend the real causes of their suffering, naturally envious of those who are supplied with all the luxuries of life, and knowing that something is radically wrong somewhere to produce all of this inequality and in- justice, band together to secure what they conceive to be their rights by force ? But all this concerns mere physical existence, though the effects are seen on every plane of life."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"46 Mystic Masonry. With regard to the Science of Man, and all that concerns his origin, nature and destiny, individually or collectively, neither science nor religion has taught us anything. Science has given us the slogan — \"the survival of the fittest,\" — a mere scien- tific phrasing of the motto of the Robber Barons, that \"he may seize v^^ho hath the power, and he may hold who can.\" In the industries of life the result may be reduced to one word, Competition. In manufacture, in trade, in all professions — even the Clerical profession — in schools, everywhere. Competition^ Strife, and \"the survival of the fittest.\" \"And this to fill us with regard for man; With apprehension of his passing worth. Desire to work his proper nature out. And ascertain his rank and tinal place.\" So far our boasted civilization is, on a gigantic scale, a Car of Jagannatha, and it crushes heads and hearts as relentlessly as the wooden idol of our heathen brothers, only, American-like, we do the killing by wholesale. Are not nearly the whole of the energies and activities of life directed to and expended upon the physical plane alone? And has not the struggle for existence increased with the great majority, in spite"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 47 of all our boasted progress, our boasted science, and our Christian Civilization? We have neither the time, the energy, nor the disposition to discover the real meaning and aim of life, because all our ener- gies are absorbed in the bare maintenance of exist- ence. \"Ah! small is the pleasure existence can give, When the fear we shall die only proves that we live.\" If real knowledge of the nature of the soul and the destiny of man had never existed, our present con- dition would be pitiable in the extreme ; but when it is demonstrated that this knowledge once existed, that it was first degraded by selfishness and then lost by design, and that for centuries designing Priests, many of whom would have disgraced a scaffold, but who have been canonized as saints, have done their utmost to deprive humanity of this knowledge, what shall the humanitarian say? Shall he preach Uni- versal Brotherhood and Toleration, and yet seek revenge on the priesthood ? A thousand times, no ! but rather leave priest and proletariat to settle their own affairs and go their own way, and go to work ourselves to recover the lost knowledge, and when recovered devote it absolutely to Humanity.

In very few instances, however, the results attained are commensurate with the energy or tlie sacrifice employed, for self- sacrifice is a virtue not altogether unknown to Christendom. But in very many instances these humanitarian efforts resemble an attempt to destroy a Upas tree, which being cut down every day grows again before morning. We imprison and execute criminals, and crime nowhere decreases. We se- questrate and \"doctor\" the insane, and insanity continually increases. We build hospitals for or- phans, the sick and the aged, and we do well; but orphanage, sickness and the distress and poverty of age grow in no wise less. It ought sometime to occur to us that society is all wrong, or that some- thing is radically wrong with all our methods. In the aggregate all the profits derived from scientific discoveries and from labor-saving machines has to be returned to the criminal or indigent classes. The only thing that we can boast of as a result is an in- crease in the number of milHonaires ; and these, as a class, instead of being the fruition of a higher evo- lution are almost without exception the very flower of a Civilization of Competition and Selfishness."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Principles of Education ana Ethics. 49 They have created an aristocracy of wealth, very often by gambling or stealing, and determine the criterion of what is called \"good society,\" viz.: ex- travagant display and vulgar pretentiousness. What then is really the matter with our boasted civilization? The answer is, ignorance and sel- fishness; it is the result of the \"Sin of Separate- ness.\" If in our social and political affairs the foregoing are the results in spite of all scientific progress, and in the face of our boasted \"Christian Civilization,\" in the intellectual realm, or in educational matters, are we any better off? Let us see. One of the first lessons the child is taught in school is Competition. It is instilled into every child at an early age that he should aim to be at the head of his class, and his exertions are continually incited to get ahead of his fellows. Many a young man or young woman graduating from literary institutions and carrying off the prizes for profi- ciency or scholarship are mental ivrecks all the rest of their lives. Nor are the subjects taught, or the branches of learning mastered, such, in a great ma- jority of instances, as are of any great practical value to the student in after life. The amount of technical information acquired is often useful in the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"50 Mystic Masonry. so-called learned professions; but in the ordinary walks of life more often fall into disuse, and seldom serve the purpose of opening the higher avenues of knowledge, or putting the individual in possession of a real knowledge of himself. Herbert Spencer mentions five objects to be at- tained in the education of children : That education which prepares for direct self-preservation; that which prepares for indirect self-preservation; that which prepares for parenthood; that which prepares for citizenship; and that which prepares for the miscellaneous refinements of Hfe. These objects set forth by one of the most profound writers of the present time, may be seen to pertain to self-pres- ervation and \"getting on\" in life, the last object may, by implication, have a Social bearing; but any higher knowledge, designed to put man in posses- sion of his real powers and to promote the evolu- tion of the soul, are not even mentioned. In all our religious instruction, from childhood, and through all the ministrations of religion in after life, we are taught to look very sharp after the salvation of our own souls ; and this in the face of the statement that a very large proportion of the human race will eventually be utterly lost, or damned, for all eternity ! Science completes the pic-"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 5^ ture by trying to demonstrate that the struggle for existence is a necessary condition of all improve- ment ; and that only the sharpest tooth and the long- est claw can survive. The ideal thus held aloft by both religion and science is selfishness. Self- preservation is regarded as the \"first law of life.\" The result is materialism in the strictest and broadest sense, and this has paralyzed, where it has not utterly destroyed, all higher ideals. Is it not reasonable to suppose that if we were possessed of real knowledge we might so govern our actions, and so shape our lives as to avoid the pit- falls of ignorance, and set our feet on the line of the higher evolution? Religion offers Faith, with a system of rewards and punishments, and inculcates Charity, which is more often interpreted as the giving of alms ; but religion does not give us Knowl- edge. Science offers a theory, or a working hy- pothesis, but still does not give us Knowledge. So long as It requires all of our energies to barely maintain existence on the physical plane, and to help those who can not do even that, unaided, we have little opportunity to seek for higher things. The complicated system under which we are working is the result of many centuries of ignorance and superstition, and of many generations of evil-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"52 Mystic Masonry. doing, and these results cannot be changed in a day. Many of our modern institutions, covered over, as they are, with abuses and injustice, are, neverthe- less, so deep-rooted that they will have to work themselves out to the bitter end of pain, sorrow, and, probably, through lawlessness and bloodshed. This need not be, yet it would be impossible to con- vince, all at once, a sufficient number of individuals who are involved in these institutions, of the real cause of all our misery, and, at the same 'time, to induce them to co-operate at once to remove the cause. Such a thing is not to be expected, because of universal unbelief as to the existence of the rem- edy proposed; hence, retributive Justice will have to work out its own results. Is it really necessary that mankind should forever remain in ignorance, and forever repeat the same follies, and invite the retribution that we have in- voked ? In the following pages, two sources of knowledge have been pointed out, viz.. Masonry and Philoso- phy, and these have been shown to take their rise, either directly or indirectly, from the Mysteries of Antiquity. The Unqualified Brotherhood of Man is the basis of all Ethics, and the Great Repubhc is the Ideal State. If these concepts were accepted"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 53 and acted upon, there would result time, opportu- nity, and the power to apprehend the deeper prob- lems of the origin, nature, and destiny of man. \"Man is not man as yet.\" What he may be, and what he might do, under favorable conditions, is very seldom even dreamed of. We never build be- yond our ideals. We habitually fall below them. There are a few persons in nearly every com- munity with whom the struggle for existence is re- duced to the minimum; and, undoubtedly, the ma- jority of these are women. Having a competency against want, or being amply provided for, they really have leisure for study and self-improvement; and many of these engage more or less in charitable work. But possessing no high ideal beyond the meritoriousness of charity and the self-approbation which it brings, and having no real knowledge as to the nature of the soul and the laws of its higher evolution, they fritter away their opportunity in luxury and self-indulgence, which they feel is jus- tified by the tribute they have already paid to char- ity. The result is, that they are habitually con- sumed with ennui; and they are as unstable as water in the search for a new sensation or a new excitement. If the majority of these are women who deter-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"54 ' Mystic Masonry. mine the standards and usages in what is called \"society,\" the ideals of their male associates are far lower than theirs, and the men are saved from ennui by the diversity of Club Life or the necessities of business. The common laborer who finds continued employment is really less miserable oftentimes than these sons and daughters of fortune, who generally lose all zest in life, whose old age is filled with mis- ery over their vanished youth, and whose lives are frequently cut short by paresis, where they do not degenerate into imbecility. It is one of the most hopeful signs of the time that among this favored class an increasing number are found devoting themselves, their time, energy, and money, to the betterment of the condition of the masses. Re- incarnation being true, these servants of humanity are laying by a store of good Karma, which is lit- erally \"treasure in heaven,\" and which must inevit- ably secure for them still broader opportunities and greater power for good in another life; and best of all, they are unfolding the higher spiritual percep- tions. Nothing so shrouds the Higher Self in man as selfishness, and this is the reason why so few per- sons are possessed of the direct perception that what is true, is True, and that what is false, is False. There has been for a long time a very widespread"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 55 cma increasing conviction that Education would prove a panacea for all our evils; and that if we could begin with the young, and have the training of children, we could eventually reform society, even though these children might be the offspring of vicious parentage. That \"we must educate or we must perish\" contains, no doubt, a great truth; but it is offset by another saying: \"Education cannot repair the defects of birth.\" What real education is, how and when it should begin, and what, under the most favorable circumstances, it may be ex- pected to accomplish, we do not yet perceive. The saying that it takes at least three generations to make a Gentleman contains a truth, even if the criterion as to what constitutes a real gentleman may be uncertain or defective. And again, the say- ing, that the education of a child should begin at least nine months before it is born, shows that pre- natal conditions and influences are at least recog- nized as existing. But in this last direction, viz., as to the environment of the Mother during gestation, the Ancient Greeks knew far more than we, and enacted laws to prevent physical deformity from being propagated or even seen. The result was physical symmetry such as the world has seldom seen."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"56 Mystic Masonry. Now when all these problems are studied in the Hght of re-incarnation the greater part of all ob- scurity disappears. Such study teaches us what the Ego is, and exactly what is determined by heredity, and what are the individual and inalienable posses- sions of the Ego itself. It teaches how, by a law as blind as that of gravitation, because it is always ab- solutely just, and as inflexible as Fate, the Karma of the child, associates it with the Karma of the pa- rents, whether on the score of virtue or of vice. If both vice and virtue adhere to the Ego as me result of all former living, and are manifest in the ten- dencies of the individual, one way or the other, then the parentage, in any case, can only furnish the necessary conditions of expression ; the opportunity to work out the innate tendencies. Now the thing that education can and ought to change, is these innate tendencies. This is the only genuine reformation ; and a great step toward this is gained by improvement in individual environ- ment. If, however, it be considered that all envi- ronment is the result of Karma under natural law. It will be seen that the most unfortunate and hope- less environment might sometimes afford the very conditions of reformation. It can be imagined that 'd really intelligent and aspiring Ego, brought by"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 57 Karma into these unfavorable conditions as the re- sult of its own acts in a former life, would not only put forth all of its energies to rise, but would be forevermore repelled by such degrading influences as now surround him, and flee from them as from a pestilence. Here we come face to face with the real problem of education. How shall we educate? With the children of the poor, and even with many of those of the middle classes, the ordinary curriculum of School and College often serves to inculcate ideas of luxury and contempt for labor, and results, in many instances, in idleness and dissipation. Many parents are ambitious that their children should be educated, in order that they may escape from, hard work, and have an easier time in life than they have had themselves. In morality, or ethics, the children are taught certain precepts, or are required to recite certain religious formula, such as the Creed or the Catechism; they are very seldom, however, taught unselfishness or self-conquest. The result is that the innate perceptions of the child, which are nat- urally far keener than most people are aware of, and which invariably, unless cultivated, become blunted with age and worldly experience, are utterly disregarded, or they are blunted by the very system"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"58 Mystic Masonry. of competition in education to which reference has already been made. It may thus be seen that it makes all the difference in the world how we edu- cate, and that Ideals here are of more importance than almost anywhere else. It is true that in some of the newer colleges, methods are being introduced which foster individu- ality, and which cultivate the natural perceptions to an extent hitherto almost unknown. This method must necessarily result in putting those students who are so fortunate as to come under its influence in possession of their own faculties, and in making them aware of their own capabilities. This method must necessarily favor a strong Individuality in the student. Now, if this can be supplemented by a further knowledge of the Latent Powers of the Soul and with the true ideals of the higher evolution, the result will be something not yet apprehended by the majority of educators. In discussing the question as to what kind of knowledge is of the most use, Herbert Spencer places Scientific Knowledge in the first category; not alone for its practical results, but on account of the ideals to which it may give rise, and the broader apprehension to which it may lead. \"Only the sin- cere man of science,\" he says, \"and not the mere"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 59 calculator of distances, or analyzer of compounds, or labeler of species; but him who through lower truths seeks higher, and eventually the highest — can truly know how utterly beyond, not only human knowledge, but human conception, is the Universal Power of which Nature, and Life, and Thought are manifestations.\" In like manner Professor Huxley makes the con- summation of Science to be the discernment of the rational order pervading the universe. It is, then, our methods that are most at fault and our ignorance that holds us down. It is this higher knowledge toward which all use- ful and rational acquirement tends; and why should our efforts cease short of the very highest? All education that does not tend in this direction, with the final goal consistently and continually in view, is false, and is necessarily a failure. Now, this higher knowledge is a knowledge of the Soul : of its origin, nature, powers, and the laws that govern its evolu- tion; and this is precisely the knowledge which modern science fails to afford, but which Ancient Science taught in the Mysteries of Antiquity. All preliminary study and training led up to this — \"The real measure of a man.\" Just as all life is an evolu- tion, so is all real knowledge an initiation; and it"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"6o Mystic Masonry. proceeds in a natural order, and advances by specific \"degrees.\" The candidate must always be worthy and well qualified, duly and truly prepared. That is, he must perceive that such knowledge exists; must desire to possess it; and must be willing to make whatever personal sacrifice is necessary for its acquirement. He must have passed beyond the stage of blind belief or superstition, the bondage of fear, the age of fable, and the dominion of appetite and sense. This is the meaning of being \"duly and truly prepared.\" He must have proved his fitness in these directions, no less than the absence in him of that subtler form of intellectual selfishness which comes from the possession of knowledge, and the desire for dominion through it over others less highly endowed, for selfish purposes of his own. His mo- tive, therefore, alone, can determine that he is \"worthy and well qualified.\" It is true on every plane of life, that in the process by which knowledge is acquired — always by experi- ence — man becomes the thing which he knows ; that is, knowing is a progressive becoming. There re- sults, therefore, a continual transformation of the motives, ideals, and perceptions of the individual, whenever in his daily experience in life he is placed on the lines of least resistance or the Natural Order"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Principles of Education and Ethics. 6i of Evolution. This is the really scientific and phil- osophical meaning of all Initiation. By referring to the chapter in which the Principles and Planes of Life are considered, it will be seen that the princi- ple just stated is the logical deduction from the idea of Microcosm and Macrocosm, or the philosophical concept that man is Involved from Divinity, and Evolves with Universal Nature ; and that, therefore, his evolution runs pari passu with that of the earth he inhabits. There is so much of the commonplace that passes with us for knowledge, and that is so utterly void of comprehension, that unless one is familiar with this line of thought he will not readily see the truth and bearing of the statement, that man always becomes that which he really knows. Here lies the reason why the mere inculcation of moral precepts so often fails entirely in transforming character; and why there is so much lip-service. In his travels through China and Thibet, Abbe Hue gives a graphic ac- count of the traveling traders whom he encountered. He depicts their shrewdness in trade and their gen- eral air of friendliness, and declares that the slogan forever on their lips was that \"All men are brothers,\" but this did not prevent them from taking every possible advantage of their customers ; so easy"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"62 Mystic Masonry. is it for a moral precept to degenerate into mere slang. Conscience is the struggle of the under- standing in assimilating experience; it is the effort of the individual to adjust precept with practice, or in other words, Conscience is that living, active process, resulting in the growth of the soul, and in the increase of man's power to apprehend truth. In the Ancient Mysteries, Life presented itself to the candidate as a problem to be solved, and not as certain propositions to be memorized and as easily forgotten. The solution of this problem constituted all genuine initiation, and at every step or degree the problem expanded. As the vision of the can- didate enlarged in relation to the problems and meaning of life, his powers of apprehension and as- similation also increased proportionately. This was also an evolution. It may reasonably be supposed that the lower degrees of such initiation concerned the ordinary affairs of life, viz., a knowledge of the laws and processes of external nature: the candi- date's relation to these through his physical body, and his relations, on the physical plane, through his animal senses, and social instincts, to his fellow-men.

If he was found capable of apprehending these, and kept his \"vow\" in the preceding degree, he presently discovered the evolution within him of senses and faculties per- taining to the \"soul-plane.\" His progress would be instantly arrested, and his teachers would refuse all further instruction, if he was found negligent of the ordinary duties of life ; those to his family, his neighbors, or his country. All these must have been fully discharged before he could stand upon the threshold as a candidate for the Greater Mys. teries ; for in these he became an unselfish Servant of Humanity as a whole; and had no longer the right to bestow the gifts of knowledge or power that he possessed, upon his own kinsmen, or friends, in preference to strangers. In the higher degrees, he might be precluded from using these powers even to preserve his own life. Both the Master and his Powers belong to Humanity.

That which makes such an evolution seem to modern readers impossible, is, that it cannot be conceived as being accomplished in a single life, nor can it be. It is the result of persistent effort guided by high ideals through many lives. Those who deny Pre-existence may logically deny all such evolution. There must, however, come a time when the con- summation is reached in one life; and this is the logical meaning of the saying of Jesus — it is fin- ished."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 65 CHAPTER II. THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY, \"The whole world is but one Republic, of which each Nation is a family, and every individual a child.

The above quotations from two of the most promi- nent modern writers on Freemasonry — the one deal- ing with the philosophical, and the other with the historical aspect of the subject — may fairly repre- sent the genius, or the Ideals and aims of Masonry. How far short of this ideal Masonry may fall today, it is no part of the object of this book to show. No one, however, at all famihar with the subject, will for a moment undertake to maintain that noth- ing is left to be accomplished. It is, indeed, some- thing grand and sublime to have conceived such an ideal, and to have striven in any measure toward its realization ; and this, Masonry has done from its earliest history. There is a thread of tradition connecting modern Masonry with the most ancient Mysteries of An- tiquity. The ancient landmarks may be discovered in every nation and time. \"Notwithstanding the connection that so evidently exists,\" says Dr. Re- bold, \"between the ancient Mysteries and the Free- masonry of our day, the latter should be considered"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 67 an imitation rather than a continuation of those ancient Mysteries; for initiation into them was the entering of a school, wherein were taught art, sci- ence, morals, law, philosophy, philanthropy and the wonders and worship of nature.\" — Rebold's History, p. 62. The universal Science and the sublime philosophy, once taught in the Greater Mysteries of Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, and India, and among many other nations of antiquity, is a dead letter in modern Freemasonry. The intelligent Mason, however, should be the last person in the world to deny that such wisdom once existed, for the simple reason that the whole superstructure of Masonry is built upon the traditions of its existence, and its ritual serves as its living monument. Proficiency in the preceding degree is everywhere made a reason for advance- ment in Masonry. This proficiency is made to con- sist in the ability of the candidate to repeat, word for word, certain rituals and obligations already passed, the meaning or explanations of which con- stitute the lectures in the various degrees. The usage at this point, in the United States at least, serves rather to secure the rights and benefits of the Lodge to those entitled to them, and to withhold them from all others, than to advance the candidate"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"68 Mystic Masonry. in real knowledge. In other Masonic jurisdictions, however, a different custom prevails. Of the Bel- gium Lodges, for example, a Brother writes as fol- lows: \"Our Lodge, called 'La Charite,' at Orient Char- levoi, is under obedience of the great Orient at Brussels, and has the Scottish Rite. No Mason is supposed to know anything of the ritual by heart. Questions and answers are read out, especially at initiation. The work of the Mason is supposed to be interior work in himself, before it can become exte- rior labor. So in order to obtain his degrees he has to do some work of his own, and no one is supposed to learn anything by heart, except words, signs and passwords. Now I have to tell you that every Mason is supposed to do some literary work on gen- eral subjects concerning the welfare of man, hu- man institutions, sociology, history, philosophy, philanthropy, etc., etc., and it is such work that a young Mason is supposed to do. Then, after reading these papers, they are discussed by all the members of the Lodge present, perhaps for three or four meetings, until the subject seems to be exhausted. This develops, in the young Mason, his intelligence and his moral feeling.\" As will be shown in a later section, this method"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 69 conforms to that pursued in the Lesser Mysteries of Antiquity, which were preparatory for the Greater Mysteries. It should be borne in mind that in modern Free- masonry, in the Ancient Mysteries, and in all of the great Religions, there was always an Exoteric por- tion given out to the world, to the uninitiated, and an Esoteric portion reserved for the initiate, and re- vealed by degrees, according as the candidate dem- onstrated his fitness to receive, conceal, and rightly use the knowledge so imparted. Few professed Christians are, perhaps, aware that such was the case with Christianity during the first two or three centuries. The following quotations from Albert Pike's great work may therefore be of interest. On page 541 (et seq.) he says: \"This, in its purity, as taught by Christ himself, was the true primitive religion, as communicated by God to the Patriarchs. It is no new religion, but the reproduction of the oldest of all; and its true and perfect morality is the morality of Masonry, as it is the morality of every creed of antiquity.\" St. Augustine says: \"What is now called the Christian Religion ex- isted among the ancients, and was not absent from the human race until Christ came, from which time"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"70 Mystic Masonry. the true religion, which existed already, began to b^ called Christian.\"* St. Augustine was Bishop of Hippo, born in 347 A. D., and lived near enough the time of Christ to know whereof he wrote. But to continue our quotations from Morals and Dogma : \"In the early days of Christianity, there was an initiation like those of the Pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initiates were consequently divided into three classes : the first, Auditors; the second. Catechumens; and the third, *He Faithful. These doctrines, and the celebration 3 J the Holy Sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, >ere kept with profound secrecy. These Mysteries were divided into three parts : the first styled the Mass of the Catechumens ; the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The celebration of the Mysteries of Mythras was also styled a Mass, and the ceremonies *Quoted by Heckethorne — \"Secret Societies,\" p. 12, Introduction: \"They were first called Christiana at Antioch.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 71 used were the same. There were found all the sacraments of the Catholic Church, even the breath of confirmation.\" . . \"The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after the time of the Apostles, practiced the Mysteries with the old Egyptian legend. They symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and Typhon by Scorpio, and wore crystals bearing these emblems, as amulets or talismans, to protect them from danger, upon which were also a brilliant star and the serpent. They were copied from the talismans of Persia and Ara- bia, and given to every candidate at his initiation. They all claimed\" — (Gnostics, Marcosians, Ophites, etc.) — \"to possess a secret doctrine, coming to then? directly from Jesus Christ, different from that of U Gospels and Epistles, and superior to those com munications, which, in their eyes, were merely exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not com- municate to every one; and among the extensive sects of the Basilideans, hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from Irenseus.

They had at least three degrees— the Material, the Intellectual, and the Spiritual, and the lesser and greater mysteries; and the number of"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"72 Mystic Masonry. those who attained the highest degree was quite small.\" \"In the Hierarchiae, attributed to St. Dionysius, the Areopagite, the first' Bishop of Athens, the tradi- tion of the sacrament is said to have been divided into three degrees of grades — Purification, Initia- tion, and Accomplishment or Perfection — and it mentions also, as part of the ceremony, the bringing to sight. The Apostolic Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bishop of Rome, describe the early church, and say: 'These regulations must on no account be communicated to all sorts of persons, because of the mysteries contained in them.' \" It is interesting to contrast the utterances of early Bishops of the Christian Church with the Bulls and Anathemas of excommunication of later Popes, hurled against the Masons for entertaining the same doctrines and practicing the same rites. But this was after the idea of dominion had seized the mod- ern church, which tolerates no rival, and would de- stroy all opposition. Papal supremacy must be maintained at any cost.

These are not explained to the Gentiles at all; nor are they taught in the hearing of Cate- chumens, but much that is spoken is in disguised terms, that the Faithful, who possess the knowledge, may be still more informed, and those who are not acquainted with it may suffer no disadvantage.\" Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, was born in the year 316 and died in 386. In his Catechesis he says: \"The Lord spake in parables to his hearers in general ; but to his disciples he explained in private the parables and allegories which he spoke in pub- lic.\" . . \"Just so the church discovers its mys- teries to those who have advenced beyond the class of Catechumens: we employ obscure terms with others.\" St. Basil, the great Bishop of Csesarea, born in the year 326, and dying in the year 376, says : \"We receive the dogmas transmitted to us by writing, and those which have descended to us from"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 75 the Apostles, beneath the mystery of oral tradition; for several things have been handed to us without writing, lest the vulgar, too familiar with our dog- mas, should lose a due respect for them.

D. 379, says : \"You have heard as much of the mystery as we are allowed to speak openly in the ears of all; the rest will be communicated to you in private; and that you must retain within yourself.'\" . . . \"Our mysteries are not to be made known to strangers.\" The foregoing quotations are from Pike's Morals and Dogma, pp. 141, 142, i43.

The Mys- tery of Christ received a new interpretation after the first Nicene Council, and as the Church sought do- minion, it lost the Great Secret, and since then has denied that it ever existed, and done all in its power to obliterate all its records and monuments. While we are concerned with Masonry rather than Christianity, it is, nevertheless, necessary to show the connecting links, in order that the \"Ancient Landmarks\" may not only be discerned, but cor- rectly interpreted. Neither Christianity nor Free- masonry is the direct and lineal descendant of the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, but both are im- itators, and both have failed to preserve the Key of interpretation, and are generally unaware that such a Key ever existed. My contention is not against either Masonry or Christianity, but for the rejuve- nation of both, through the restoration of the Se- cret Doctrine to each. Modern Masonry never possessed the Key, while many of the early Chris- tian sects had it in their possession, but in time lost it through worldliness, the greed for earthly domin- ion, and the decay of Spirituality. Something further may be shown as to the origin of the Christian Mysteries.

In the time of Plato, a century later, the Mysteries were in a flourishing condition, and in them he learned his sublime philosophy. At the beginning of our era the mysteries had declined. There remained, however, the Gnostics, the Essenes, and the Therapeutse of Alexandria, and from these the Christian mysteries were undoubtedly derived. The Neoplatonists, headed by Ammonius Saccus, undertook to preserve the primitive revelation, and the utterances of the Christian Bishops to which I have referred, show how the Secret Doctrine was adopted from the earlier mysteries by the primitive Christians during the first three centuries of our era. After the first Council of Nice, a. d. 325, little more was heard of the earlier doctrines, and with the burning of the Great Library of Alexan- dria, Catholic supremacy and the dark ages oblite- rated the primitive wisdom in Western Europe, as it was also overrun by hordes of barbarians from the north. The principal seats of learning were"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"y8 Mystic Masonry. the convents. Coming now to the dawn of the i6th century, and the great Protestant Reformation, we find Johann Trithemius, Abbot of St. Jacob, at Wurtzburg, celebrated as one of the greatest of Alchemists and Adepts; and Cornelius Agrippi and Paracelsus were his pupils. John Reuchlin, a famous Kabalist of that time, and counted as one of the most learned men in his day in Europe, was the friend and perceptor of Luther, and Luther's first public utterances were a course of lectures on the philosophy of Aristotle. A strong effort was made to revive the ancient wisdom, but the age was too gross and superstilious, and the Reformation resulted in centuries of blind belief, and the suppression of the Secret Doctrine. Modern Freemasonry honors as its ancient great teachers Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Plato, and many others, and in some of its degrees gives a brief summary of their doctrines. Masonry, in a certain sense, includes them all, and has adopted their precepts. They were all initiates in the mysteries, and fundamentally their doctrines were the same. All taught the existence of the G. A. O. U., the immortality of the soul, and the unqualified Brother- hood of Man; and with these primitive and funda- mental truths Masonry is in full accord."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry^ 79 The Guilds of Masons, or Builders, with which modern Freemasonry claims connection, doubtless suggested the name of Mason, the symbolism of a Builder, and perhaps the form of organization or advancement by degrees, as Apprentice, Fellow- craft and Master, representing the three degrees of the ancient mysteries. The past two or three centuries at most will include the whole of the history of modern Free- masonry. The organization is recent, but its prin- ciples, when clearly defined, and intelligently inter- preted, are eternal, and are in full accord with the greater mysteries of antiquity. The foregoing running comment on some of the ancient landmarks will enable us to draw compari- sons and derive interpretations of Masonic symbols and glyphs from ancient mysteries, and so to dis- cover the science and philosophy that constitute the genius of Masonry.

CHAPTER III. THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY. The traditions, glyphs and ritual of Freemasonry cluster around the building of the temple; the le- gend of the widow's son, Hiram-abiff, who lost his life in the defense of his integrity, and the search for the Lost Word of the Master. As the candidate progresses, degree after degree, he is furnished with the working-tools suited to his degree of knowledge and proficiency, given instruction as to their use; the lesser and greater lights are revealed and ex- plained; and through all, each outer form, or ma- terial thing, is shown to be a symbol of a deeper mystery, a concealed potency. This is, in brief, the language and the philosophy of symbolism, or the exoteric and the esoteric garb of Truth. The method itself, outside of all details or applications, has a deeper scientific significance than most persons are aware of. This method of instruction is not fanciful or arbitrary, but conforms to the process of Eternal Nature in building an"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 8i atom or a world; a daisy or a man. Cosmos has evolved from Chaos, and yet Chaos remains the Eternal Potency; what Plato called the 'World of Divine Ideas.\" This will be more fully explained in a. subsequent chapter. For the present, it may suffice to say, that from primitive space, primordial ether, or what modern science might call the Matrix or origin of the \"nebulous mass,\" the earth and all that it contains has evolved. The essential form, the idea of all things; the potency or force; and the matter as we now discern it, must have existed in primordial space. Therefore, these two always ex- ist, viz., the inner potency, and the outer act; the concealed Idea, and the outer form ; the inner mean- ing, and the outer event. Each is in its turn a sym- bol of the other. Hence the saying on the Smarag- dine Tablet, as above so below. All outward things are therefore symbols, or embodiments of pre-exist- ing Ideas, and out of this subjective ideal realm all visible things have emanated. This doctrine of emanations is the key to the philosophy of Plato, and that of the Gnostic sects from which the early Christians derived their mysteries. This fact is mentioned here in order to show the deep founda- tions of the glyphs of Masonry. In the Ritual of Masonry, King Solomon's temple"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"82 Mystic Masonry. is taken as a symbol. The building and the restora- tion of the temple at Jerusalem are dramatically represented in the work of the Lodge, and in the ceremony of initiation, by a play upon words and parity of events, and applied to the candidate, with admonition, warning or encouragement, as the drama unfolds. The measurements and proportion of the temple are dwelt upon in order to bring in the science of numbers, form, and proportion, so manifest in architecture, and to connect them with the \"spiritual temple\" with which they all have the same, though less obvious, relations. The symbolism is fitted to ideal relations, rather than to actual ex- istences or historical events. Sol-om-on represents the name of Deity in three languages, and the bibli- cal history is doubtless an allegory or myth of the Sun-god. There is no reliable history of the con- struction of any such temple at Jerusalem, and re- cent explorations and measurements have greatly altered the dimensions as heretofore given. Hiram Abiff is dramatically represented to have lost his life when the temple was near completion, and yet it is recorded that after the completion of the tem- ple he labored for years to construct and ornament a palace for the King. Add to these facts the state- ment that the temple was constructed without the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 83 sound of hammer or any tool of iron, and it is thus likened more nearly to that other \"Spiritual Temple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\" and the literal and historical features disappear, and the symbolism stands out in bold relief. Masonic Lodges are dedicated to the Sts. John ; one of whom, the Evangelist, opens his Gnostic Gospel with the Greek philosophy of the Logos, the principle of emanation already referred to; and the other, the Seer of Patmos, writes a book symbolical of ancient initiations, which many a non-initiate has tried in vain to interpret. It may thus be seen that there is a deep significance in the dedication of Lodges to the Sts. John. Take, for example. Revelations xxi, 16: \"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth ; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length, and the breadth and the height of it are equal\" (a perfect cube). \"And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, an angel.\" The language is evidently a veil, designed to con- ceal the real meaning from the uninitiated. As the measure of man ; that is, a perfect man, or \"angel,\" we have the cube as a symbol of perfect proportion. Hence a Square Man. The temple of Sol-om-on;"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"84 Mystic Masonry. the Cubical City — which unfolded becomes a cross, and hence the \"measure of a man\" — all these refer to the work of regeneration, or initiation.* The re- building of the temple after the plan drawn upon the Trestle-board, by which it shall be like that spiritual temple, not made with hands, plainly refers to ini- tiation from which results perfect proportion and perfect harmony. In a later section of this work this mathematical and geometrical basis of virtue and wisdom, or knowledge and power, will be fur- ther explained. It is unknown to the Craft of Ma- sonry except in its bare outline and cruder symbol- ism: it is nowhere hinted that there is an inherent relation and full equivalent between absolute mathe- matics and spiritual power. \"A very limited knowledge of the history of primitive worship and mysteries is necessary to en- able any person to recognize in the master mason, Hiram, the Osiris of the Egyptians, the Mithras of the Persians, the Bacchus of the Greeks, the Atys of the Phrygians, of which these people celebrated the passion, death and resurrection, as Christians celebrate today that of Jesus Christ.

As to the Fellowcrafts concerned in the con- spiracy, they are shown to have more than one mean- ing; astronomically this relates to the signs of the Zodiac, the \"three wicked ones\" representing the winter solstice or death of the year, and consequent subjugation of the Sun-god ! Other meanings will be shown further on. \"Is it an accidental coinci- dence,\" asks Bro. Pike, in Morals and Dogma, p. 82, \"that in the name of each murderer are the two names of the Good and Evil Deities of the Hebrews ; for Yu-bel is but Yehu-bal or Yeho-bal; and that the three final syllables of the names, a, o, m, make A. -.U. -.M. ',, the sacred word of the Hindoos, meaning the Triune-God, Life-giving, Life-preserv- ing, Life-destroying\" (Brahma, Vishnu, Siva), \"rep- resented by the mystic character Y.\" And, again, on page 620, Bro, Pike says : \"This word could not be pronounced except by the letters; for its pronunciation as one word was said to make Earth tremble and even the angels of Meaven (elementals) to quake with fear.\" The aim of the writer at this time is to show the general connection of Masonic glyphs with those of ancient times. The real meaning will appear fur- ther on. As already declared, modern Masonry being but"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 87 an imitation of ancient genuine Mysteries, the writer has no design of reading into it a meaning which can not be fully verified. For the greater part, modern Masons are dealing with symbols, the Key for the real interpretation of which they never possessed, or even suspected that it existed. It re- mains for the future to determine whether any con- siderable number of our Masonic Brethren really desire to possess in fuller measure the Living Truth which the dead-letter text conceals. That Living Truth exists, and is as accessible to every Mason as is the dead-letter or the dumb-show under which it masquerades in every Lodge. As to the sprig of Acacia, Bro. Pike says: \"The genuine Acacia also is the thorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew up around the body of Osiris. It is a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the Idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur, arf of it the 'crown of thorns' was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of life ; for it has been known, when planted as a door- post, to take root and shoot out budding boughs above the threshold.\" Here, again, we see a symbol ages old, revived"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"88 Mystic Masonry. and adopted in many forms, and further, that Im- mortahty was not \"brought to light\" for the first and only time by the \"Man of Sorrows\" of the Christians ; yet in every case is the symbol none the less true. Whether any of these sun-gods or Re- deemers were historical characters or not, the sym- bolism teaches everywhere the same eternal truths: the Resurrection and the Life; Redemption and Immortality. After being obligated and brougiit to light, the candidate in the third degree is bantered with the statement that undoubtedly he now imagines himself a Master Mason. He is informed not only that such is not the case, but that there is no certainty that he ever will become such. He subsequently starts on his Journey for the discovery of the Lost Word. The method by which he undertakes to obtain it, and the names of the three Fellowcrafts already re- ferred to as brothers, have a very deep significance. After many trials, he receives a substitute, which he is to conceal with great fidelity \"till future genera- tions shall discover the lost word.\" The method by which he receives and is ever to transmit or use even the substitute, is made exact and definite, and guarded by solemn obligations.

The force of the obligation is therefore in the oath and not in the reason. As a matter of fact, the real reason is scientific to the last analysis; scientific to a degree beyond the penetration, up to the present time, of the \"radiant matter\" or the Roentgen Ray of Modern Science. The Word concerns the sci- ence of rhythmic vibrations, and is the key to the equilibrium of all. forces and to the harmony of Eternal Nature. This tradition of the Ineffable Name is brought into Masonry from the Hebrew Kabalah, and how it became lost is partly historical, at least. The an- cient Hebrew Priests evidently undertook to fit to the names of their tribal-deities the symbolism and traditions of the far East.

The Anathemas threatened for him who should alter, by a single letter or \"Yod,\" the outer text, had therefore a deeper meaning. The priests of many nations of antiquity were initiates in the Mysteries, and as such they were Monotheists, while the ignorant masses were idolaters. The monothe- ism of the Jews was of a robust character, and their priests and prophets had a hard time to preserve their people from the seductive polytheism and abominations of surrounding nations. The Ineffable Name was not only concealed, but \"terrible as an army with banners.\" Jehovah was jealous, revenge- ful, vindictive toward the evil-doer, and tolerated no rival in the broad expanse of Cosmos. In no reli- gion of antiquity is the anthropomorphic image of Deity so strongly defined, and the Creator of man and worlds made so exceedingly human. The Kabalah, on the contrary, embodying con- siderable of the true and ancient Secret Doctrine, held a different idea of Divinity. While carrying the tradition, therefore, of the lost v/ord as the In- effable Name of Deity, the symbolism was taken as literal fact, and the people who were commanded to \"make no graven image\" ended by making a gigantic idol, half Moloch and half Man. Amid such contradictions, the symbolism adopted from the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 91 purer and gentler Aryans was ill at ease and far from home. Rev. Dr. Garrison claims in a \"Con- tribution to the History of the Lost Word,\" ap- pended to Foot's Early History and Antiquities of Freemasonry, that the four-syllabled name, Jehovah, was held by the Hebrews as the Ineffable, and that Adonai was used as a substitute. The Highpriest once every year, at the time of the atonement, en- tered alone into the Holy of HoUes and there re- peated the name. The name was thus withdrawn from and finally lost by the common people. This is ingenious and too literal to cover the case. The old query, \"What is in a name?\" is, after all, not so easy of answer ; or the answer might be, \"every thing or nothing,\" according as you understand it or look at it. Before the introduction of the Masoretic points or indices of vowel sounds, the consonants were read by metrically intoning the text. The principle of the Mantram was therefore known to the Highpriest at least, and, therefore, the Word, the Name, that Known in all its plenitude and used with power, \"caused the whole world to shake,\" may have been used or invoked in the Holy of Holies by the Kabalistic Hierophant.

Notwithstanding, it is the letter that killeth, and the Spirit (the breath) that maketh alive. The consonants composing the Hebrew al- phabet are about as sacred as so many wooden blocks. If one knows how to arrange the blocks, and endow them with life, so that they may \"bud and blossom like Aaron's rod,\" that of course is a very different matter. \"There are dangers inseparable from SymboUsm, which afford an impressive lesson in regard to sim- ilar risks attendant on the use of language. The imagination called in to assist the reason usurps its place, or leaves its ally helplessly entangled in its web, Names which stand for things are confounded with them; the means are mistaken for the ends; the instrument of interpretation for the object; and thus symbols come to usurp an independent charac- ter as truths and persons. Though perhaps a neces- sary path, they are a dangerous one, by which to ap- proach the Deity; in which many, says Plutarch, mistaking the sign for the thing signified, fell into a ridiculous superstition, while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunge into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety.\" . . ."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 93 \"It is through the mysteries, Cicero says, that we have learned the first principles of life, wherefore the term 'initiation' is used with good reason.\" . . . \"To employ nature's universal symbolism instead of the technicalities of language, rewards the humblest inquirer and discloses its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparatory training to comprehend them.

In seeking Magic, he finally becomes the Majus. All genuine Initiation is, like evolution and regeneration, from within. Devoid of this inner meaning and power, all rituals are but foolish jargon, and all ceremonies an empty farce. Even such the rituals of Masonry have be- come to many. That the Christ-life and the power that made Jesus to be called Christos, Master, whereby he healed the sick, cast out devils, and foretold future events, is the same Life revealed and attained by initiation in the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, is perfectly plain. The disrepute into which the Divine Science has fallen has arisen from its abuse and degredation. In the middle ages, and in fact, in every age there have been dabblers in magic; sorcerers and necromancers, who, possessing some of the secrets, and imbued with none of its beneficence, have used their knowledge and power for purely personal and selfish ends.

The popular idea is that education consists largely in the cultivation of the intellectual powers. An average standard of morals is always recommended by educators, and its outer form is illustrated by religious ceremonies. But intellectual cultivation alone, no matter to what extent it may be carried — and the further it goes in this one-sided way the worse for all concerned — is in no sense an evolution. Perfect intellectual development, without spiritual discernment and moral obligation, is the sign-manual of Satan. Intelligence, without goodness, lies athwart the Divine Plan in the evolution of Cosmos. Intellect and Altruism by no means necessarily go hand in hand. One may have a very clear intellect, have quick perceptions, and be a good reasoner, and yet be very wicked. On the other hand, one may be very dull intellectually, and yet be kind, brotherly and sympathetic to the last degree. A world made up of the former would be a bad place to live in; if of the latter, a thousand times to be preferred. Magic contemplates that all-around development which, liberating the intellect from the dominion of the senses and illuminating the spiritual perceptions, places the individual on the lines of least resistance"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"96 Mystic Masonry. with the inflexible laws of nature, and he becomes nature's co-worker or hand-maid. To all such, Nature makes obeisance, and delegates her powers, and they become Masters. The real Master con- ceals his power and uses it only for the good of others. He works \"without the hope of fee , or reward.\" Discerning that knowledge is power, designing and evil men desire to possess both knowledge and power for entirely selfish purposes. It may be read- ily discerned that the more knowledge and power a purely selfish man possesses, the more inimical to humanity he becomes. He can do less harm if kept in ignorance. This is especially the case in regard to those deeper sciences which deal with mind, and influence the thoughts and actions of others. Sup- pose one were able to hypnotize large numbers of persons at once, and compel them to do his bidding ; and that his motives were not only selfish, but all results injurious to his agents. Such a person would be a Magician, and, as his motive would be purely selfish, a \"Black Magician.\" Modern Science, purely materialistic in its aims and conclusions, has always, till very recently, ridiculed the idea em- bodied in Magic, and were it not for the fact that it has been compelled to recognize, under the name"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 97 Hypnotism, since the time of Braid, the very force which it denied and condemned in the days of Mes- mer, it might be difficult to find a palpable and un- deniable illustration of what kind of power is in- volved in Magic. But Hypnotism is not even the alphabet of the vocabulary known to the real Master or Magician. It is but an empirical dabbling in a power of gigan- tic proportions, the key to which makes of its pos- sessor either a Savior or a Destroyer of his fellow- men.

The conception of Masonry is true, but it has adopted or imitated the ritual and glyphs of a science, the key to which not one Mason in ten thousand possesses, and hence the tradition of the Lost Word has a literal, no less than a symbolical meaning. The \"Substitute\" is given to the ne- ophite — \"till future generations shall find the True Word.\" The question nov\\r propounded to every \"obligated,\" or so-called Master Mason, is — is the present the generation in which that which was lost shall be found? and each must answer for himself singly; just as he entered his lodge, first saw the light, and took his obligation; just as every real Master, or \"White Adept,\" has done since the begin- ning of time. There exists in Masonic literature many learned essays on the history, orthography and philology of the Lost Word; but I am acquainted with no treatise that apprehends the nature of the real secret like that of Brother Albert Pike in his great work, and yet, if he knew the whole secret, he concealed it at last. The more immediate source from which the le-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 99 gend is imported into Masonry is the Jewish Kaba- lah, derived doubtless from the Chaldean and Zoroasterian form of the Secret Doctrine ; the prin- ciples and methods of which were unfolded by the late lamented Bro. J. Ralston Skinner, A. & A. S, R. 32°. Bro. Skinner's greater works, however, aside from his Source of Measures, and a large number of pamphlets, exist only in Manuscript, and are of so abstruse a character as to be of little use except to profound scholars. Running all through the Talmud are found references to the Secret Wis- dom, while the Sohar, the Kahalah Demidata, and other Kabalistic works are all written with a veil designed to conceal the secret from the uninitiated, and to be meaningless without the key. Bro. Skin- ner's discoveries were the reward of genius, made as the result of stumbling on one of the keys that \"unlock the Golden Gates of the Palace of the King.\" His discoveries lay the foundation for a systematic and scientific study of the Kabalistic form of the Secret Doctrine which lies concealed beneath the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch, and which no commentary has ever revealed or intended to reveal.

Copies of Bro. Skinner's unpub- lished researches have been so placed by his special desire and act, that they may be preserved for such future investigators and not again be lost to the world. But the Hebrew Kabalah is but one of many sources from which the Secret Science may be de- rived, and it is not the one which in its form of Sym- bolism and method of interpretation is best fitted to the present age. When the symbolism of the Ka- balah is read by the key furnished by Bro. Skinner, it requires to be again translated into modern ideas or forms of thought. The basis of it was the Chal- dean Book of Numbers, no genuine copy of which, if in existence, is accessible to modern students. Several spurious copies are known to exist, and it is possible that a genuine copy may be produced at the proper time. For be it remembered that Genuine Masters, \"Prince Adept Masons,\" have always ex- isted, and no book or record worth preserving or necessary for the good of man is ever lost.

Modern ma- terialistic science has had its brief day, and Philos- ophy has already undermined its foundations. The new age will show a genuine revival of Philosophy. The immortal principles enunciated by Plato, clothed in modern garb of thought, less involved and dialectical, will again command the attention of the thinking world. Every one is aware that the source of Plato's knowledge was the Mysteries; he was an Initiate, and on almost every page reveals the obligation he is under not to betray to the com- mon people the secrets taught only to initiates under the pledge of secrecy. The foregoing digression seemed necessary in order to show the real basis for the traditions of the Lost Word, and to put beyond cavil, at least with the more rational, the idea that the Master's Word is a real thing, the genuineness and power of which is not overdrawn in the parables and glyphs of Freemasonry. \"The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealed and profound meaning of the Ineffable Name of Deity communicated by God to Moses\" (rather by the Priests of Egypt.— B.), \"and which meaning was long lost by the very precautions taken to conceal it.

This was the profound truth hidden in the ancient allegory and covered from the general view with a double veil. This was the exoteric meaning of the generation and production of the Indian, Chaldean, and Phoenician Cosmogonies; of the Active and Passive Powers; of the Male and Female Principles; of Heaven and its Luminaries generating, and the Earth producing; all hidden from vulgar view, as above its comprehension; the doctrine that matter is not eternal, but that God was the only original Existence, the Absolute, from Whom everything has proceeded, and to Whom all returns. . . .

The doctrine of Moses and the prophets, identical at bottom with that of the ancient Egyptians, also had its outward meaning and its veils. The Hebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions ; and they were written in Symbols unintelligible to the Profane. The Pentateuch and the prophetic poems were merely elementary books of doctrine, morals or liturgy; and the true secret and traditional philos- ophy was only written afterward, under a veil still less transparent. Thus was a second Bible born, unknown to, or rather uncomprehended by, the Christians' (of later times), \"a collection, they say, of monstrous absurdities ; a monument, the adept says, wherein is everything that the genius of phi- losophy and that of religion have ever formed or imagined of the Sublime; a treasure surrounded by thorns ; a diamond concealed in a rough dark stone.\" \"One is filled with admiration on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical, so simple and at the same time so abso- lute.

These are the elementary principles of the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world.\"* And so we might go on quoting from this real \"Master of the Veils,\" this genuine Prince Adept among Masons, whose great work, even as a com- pilation, is a monument more enduring than brass, and more honorable than the crown of kings. If he did not comprehend to the last veil all that he tran- scribed — and he too used veils — he discerned enough to teach him how to find the whole. It may thus be seen that the Holy Bible as one of the Great Lights in Masonry has a very profound meaning when coupled with the tradition of the Ineffable Name, or Lost Word.

The laws then governing the Mark of a Fellowcraft or a Master Builder were very strict, and the Mark was never bestowed unworthily, and when received was a passport among builders over a wide domain. But in a deeper, or Kabalistic sense, the Master's Word, which entitled its possessor to Master's wages, was a very different thing indeed. The wages of the real Master were the satisfaction and the power that flow from the possession of real knowledge. Knowledge is power only when one comprehends that which he possesses, and is, there- fore, enabled to use it for the purposes that lie near- est his heart. Bro. Pike shows conclusively that the power of the Word lies in the knowledge of the Philosophy which is its perfect synthesis. This is, in part, the meaning of \"knowing how to pronounce the Word.\" As already stated, the Kabalah of the ancient He- brews, which Moses derived by initiation into the mysteries of Egypt and Persia, and which Pike and many others declare was identical among the He- tThe wages of a real Master is Knowledge and Power to travel where he will in space."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Genius of Freemasonry. 109 brews, the Egyptians, Hindus and other nations of antiquity, was known as the Secret Doctrine. The reason for such a name is fully revealed in what has been shown hitherto. What Pike says regarding the relation of the Pentateuch to the Kabalah, is true of the exoteric scriptures of every nation of an- tiquity. How many generations of imbeciles or material- ists, think you, my Brother, would it require to re- cover it? The great majority of mankind in every age not only do not possess the secret and the power of the Master's Word, but are incapable of com- prehending it. We do not know a thing because we are told that it is so. Let the gods shout the truth of all the ages into the ears of a fool forever, and still forever the fool would be joined to his folly. Here lies the conception and the principle of all initia- tions. It is knowledge unfolded by degrees in an orderly, systematic manner, step by step, as the capacity to apprehend opens in the neophite. The result is not a possession, but a growth, an evolu- tion. Knowledge is not a mere sum in addition ; something added to something that already exists ; but rather such a progressive change or transfor- mation of the original structure as to make of it at every step a New Being. Real Knowledge, or the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"no Mystic Masonry. growth of Wisdom in man, is an Eternal Becoming ; a progressive transformation into the hkeness of the Supernal Goodness and the Supreme Power. Initiation and Regeneration are synonymous terms. The ritual of Freemasonry is based on this natural law, and the ceremony of initiation illustrates, at every step, this principle, and if the result attained is a possession rather than a regeneration, in the great majority of cases, the principle remains none the less true. The mere inculcation of moral prin- ciples, or lessons in ethics, and their symbolic illus- tration and dramatic representation, are by no means in vain. These appeal to the conscience and moral sense in every man, and no man has ever been made worse by the Lessons of the Lodge. By these \"rites and benefits\" the Freemason is, above all men, in our so-called Modern Civilization, the near- est to the Ancient Wisdom. He has possession of the territory in which lie concealed the Crown Jew- els of Wisdom. He may content himself, if he will, by merely turning over the sod and gathering only a crop of husks or stubble.

Does this read like a rhap- sody, and are the Landmarks, traditions, and glyphs of Freemasonry nothing more ? The real temple referred to from first to last in Masonry, as in all ancient initiations, is the Taber- nacle of the Human Soul. It is built, indeed, without the sound of hammer or any tool of iron. It is like (made in the likeness of) that other, spiritual temple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens ; for the old philosophy (Kabalah) teaches that the Immortal Spirit of man is the artificer of the body and its source of Ufe; that it does not so much enter in, as overshadow man, while the Soul, the immediate vehicle of the Spirit, inhabits the body, and is dissipated at death. The Spirit is Immortal, pure, and forever undefiled. It is Christos, or Hiram, the Mediator between the Soul, or physical man, and the Universal Spirit— the Father in Heaven. The \"poor, blind candidate,\" that is, the man of sense, immersed in matter, would learn the Ineffable Name, and obtain the Lost Word, and, seeking a short cut, \"climbs up some other way.\" He would have wisdom without self- conquest, power without sacrifice.

Hiram (Christos) is resur- rected. Being immortal, he can not really die. No sin of man is final. Realizing his error and purified by suffering, the spirit in man being again lifted up, even defeat gives promise of victory, and he re- ceives a Substitute for the Lost Word. He hears, however faint or dim, the Divine Harmony. Future generations, that is, further trials and more sincere endeavor, promise greater reward. He learns to \"know, to will, to dare, and to keep silent.\" Brotherly love, Relief and Truth; Prudence, Forti- tude, Justice and Mercy — all the Virtues and all the Beatitudes are inculcated. The candidate is taught, not merely to tolerate an- other's religion, but to respect it as his own ; though still adhering to that into which he was born.

The Ineffable Name is spelled in many ways, yet the Word is one and eternal. Masonry is not only a universal sci- ence, but a world-wide religion, and owes allegiance to no one creed, and can adopt no sectarian dogma, as such, without ceasing thereby to be Masonic. Drawn from the Kabalah, and taking the Jewish or Christian verbiage or symbols, it but discerns in them universal truths, which it recognizes in all other religions. Many degrees have been Chris- tianized only to perish ; as every degree eventually will if circumscribed by narrow creeds, and dwarfed to the bigoted apprehension, so as to exclude good men of any other communion. Is Jesus any the less Christos, because Christna was called \"the Good Shepherd\"? or because the Mexican Christ was crucified between two thieves? or because Hiram was three days in a grave before he was resur- rected?

Masonry is the Universal Religion only because, and only so long as, it embraces all religions. For this reason, and this alone, it is universal and eternal. Neither persecution nor misrepresentation can ever destroy it. It may find no place in a generation of bigots; it may retire for a century; but again comes a Mas- ter Builder with the Key to the \"Shut Palace of the King,\" throws open the blinds, lets in the light, kindles anew the fire on the sacred altar, clears away the rubbish, when behold ! the tesselated pave- ment is as bright as when it first came from the quar- ries of truth, the jewels are of pure gold and brighten at the touch, and the great lights are un- dimmed and undecayed. \"When the candidate is ready the Master appears.\" And yet men are so foolish and so vile as to imagine that they can de- stroy this heirloom of the ages; this heritage from the Immortals !

These, one and all, serve only to keep the people in darkness, and retard the reign of Uni- versal Brotherhood. Therefore for humanity — the Great Orphan — the real Master laments. He smiles at the passions of Popes or Kings and pities the folly of man. He only waits indifferent as to re- sults, knowing these to be under eternal law; but ready and willing, whenever and wherever the in- struction entering the listening ear may find lodg- ment in the faithful breast. For ages Kings, Popes and Synods have done their best to kill this Secret Doctrine by anathematizing or burning its Masters.

Furthermore, the Sacred Books of all religions, including those of the Jews and the Christians, were and are no more than parables and allegories of the real Secret Doctrine, transcribed for the ignorant and superstitious masses. All commentaries written on these Sacred Books, whether on those of Moses, the Psalms and the Prophets of Judaism, the Gos- pels of the Gnostics and Christians, or those written on the Sacred Books of the East — the Vedas, Pura- nas, and Upanishads — all either make confusion more confounded when written by one ignorant of the Secret Doctrine, or, when written by initiates, but ring the changes on, or further elaborate the parables and allegories.

Underlying this Secret Doctrine was a profound philosophy of the creation or evolution of worlds and of man. The present humanity, in many quar- ters of the globe, has evolved on the intellectual plane so far that there now exist a very large num- ber of persons capable of apprehending this old philosophy, and, at the same time, capable of under- standing the responsibility incurred in misusing or misinterpreting it. A large number of persons have reached, on the intellectual plane, the state of man- hood; and are capable of partaking of the \"fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil.\" There is, therefore, no reason why this old philos- ophy should be longer concealed. On the other hand, there are reasons why it should be known. Empirical knowledge has advanced in certain direc- tions into the realm of Psychism, and the arts an- ciently designated by the term Magic, and it is im- perative that the dangers that attend these pursuits should be pointed out and demonstrated, in order that they may be avoided by the beneficent, and that the ignorant or innocent may be afforded protec- tion. How far these modern inroads into Occultism"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 121 or ancient Magic extended very few persons seem to realize. It is therefore high time that the philos- ophy of the East should illumine the science of the West, and thus give the death blow to that intellect- ual diabolism, and spiritual nihilism, known as Materialism, and this only the Secret Doctrine can accomplish. Grave responsibility, however, is in- curred by such a revelation. Those who, like the professional Hypnotists and the Vivisectionists, have sinned, perhaps ignorantly, and thus have been unconsciously \"Black Magicians,\" will eventually find no avenue of escape. Ignorance can no longer cover their inhuman or cruel practices. The Hyp- notist can not reduce the mind of a trusting but ignorant brother to the condition of imbecility, with- out facing the law that counts such a crime as no less than murder. The new Science, resulting from the union to which I have referred, and which, I believe, Mr. J. M. Rusk proposes to call Psycho- Physics, will be well understood before the close of the 20th century, and many an old score in the intellectual arena will be settled.

They have waited for millen- niums, and their time has come. \"To recapitulate ; the Secret Doctrine was the universally diffused religion of the ancient and pre- historic world. Proof of its diffusion, authentic records of its history, a complete chain of docu- ments, showing its character and presence in every land, together with the teaching of all its great Adepts, exist to this day in the secret crypts of libraries belonging to the Occult Fraternity.\" As to the danger of revealing these doctrines to the profane : \"The danger was this : Doctrines such as the planetary chain, or the seven races, at once give a clue to the seven-fold nature of man. For each principle is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race ; and the human principles are, on every plane, correlated to sevenfold occult forces* — those of the highest planes being of tremendous power.\" \"No one styling himself a 'scholar,' in whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to 'Experimenters with the \"Roentgen Ray\" may profitably take notice."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 123 regard these teachings seriously.

D. 325, and dictated terms to their deliberations, applied for initiation into the Mysteries, and was told by the officiating priest that no purgation could free him from the crime of putting his wife to death, or from his many perjuries and murders. Every careful and unbiased student of history knows why the Secret Doctrine has been heard of so little since the days of Constantine. An exoteric religion and belief in a personal God blotted it out for self-pro- tection; and yet, oh, irony of history ! the very Pen- tateuch conceals it, and for many a student of Kabalah of the coming century the seals will be broken.

In the last analysis, both Space and Consciousness elude us. What they are, per se, we shall never know. We may as well take them as facts in our experience, and in analyzing that experience, both Conscious- ness and Knowledge will expand. \"What is that which was, is, and will be, whether there is a Universe or not: whether there be Gods or none? asks the Senzar Catechism. And the an- swer made is — Space.\" Now space is not Nature, nor is it Deity. Space may be said to contain nature or creation, and to conceal Divinity. It is therefore the point of ema- nation and the vanishing point. The Occult Catechism contains the following questions and answers : \"What is it that ever is?\" \"Space, the eternal Anupadaka\" (parentless). \"What is it that ever was?\" \"The germ in the Root.\" \"What is it that is ever coming and going?\" \"The Great Breath.\" \"Then there are three eternals?\" \"No, the three are one.\" \"That which ever is, is one ; that which ever was, is one ; that which is ever being, and becoming, is also one : and this is Space.\" \"For clearer understanding on the part of the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"126 Mystic Masonry. general reader, it must be stated that the Occult Sci- ence recognizes Seven Cosmical Elements — four entirely physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi- material, as it will become visible in the air toward the end of the Fourth Round, to reign supreme over the others during the whole of the Fifth. The re- maining two are as yet absolutely beyond the range of human perception. These latter will, however, appear as presentiments during the 6th and 7th Rounds respectively. These seven elements, with their numberless Sub-Elements (far more numer- ous than those known to Science), are simply con- ditional modifications and aspects of the one and only Element. This latter is not Ether, nor even Akasa, but the Source of these. The Fifth Element, now advocated quite freely by Science, is not the Ether hypothesized by Sir Isaac Newton — although he calls it by that name, having associated it in his mind, probably, with the ^Ether, 'Father-Mother' ol Antiquity. As Newton intuitionally says: 'Nature is a perfect circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids, fixed things out of volatile, and vola- tile out of fixed. Subtle out of gross, and gross out of subtle.' . . . Thus, perhaps, may all things be originated from Ether.'' (Hypoth. I, 675.)* *Secret Doctrine."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 127 It is interesting to notice, in this connection, that Newton was famiUar with the writings of Jacob Boehmen, the \"Teutonic Theosopher,\" and that among Newton's posthumous papers were found copious notes and translations from his works. As to the \"Races,\" referred to in the above quotation, it need only be said in passing, that the Secret Doctrine declares that in the evolution of humanity there are to be seven Races, of which ours is now the fifth, and that each race makes seven rounds on our planetary chain, of which rounds the present race is now in the fourth, with here and there a \"fifth rounder\" appearing. The Secret Doctrine teaches, not only the immortality of the soul, but the perfectibility of humanity by orderly evolution on this Earth. This doctrine concerns the general evolution which the present work touches only inci- dentally; it is complicated, and necessarily so. There are three fundamental propositions that un- derlie the Secret Doctrine, (o) \"An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle on which all speculation is impossible, since it tran- scends the power of human conception, and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or simili- tude. It is beyond the range and reach of human thought — in the words of Mandukya, \"unthinkable"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"128 Mystic Masonry. and unspeakable.\" This Infinite and Eternal Cause — dimly formulated in the \"Unconscious\" and \"Un- knowable\" of current European philosophy — is the rootless root of \"all that was, is, or ever shall be.\" . . . In Sanscrit it is \"Sat.\" This \"Beness\" is symbolized in the Secret Doctrine under two aspects. On the one hand, Absolute abstract Space, repre- senting bare subjectivity, the one thing which no human mind can either exclude from any concep- tion or conceive of by itself. On the other. Absolute abstract Motion repre- senting \"Unconditioned Consciousness.\" \"Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded, not as independent realities, but as the two facets or aspects of the Absolute, which con- stitutes the basis of conditioned Being whether sub- jective or objective.\" \"Considering this metaphys- ical triad\" (the only reality. Spirit and Matter) \"as the Root from which proceeds all manifestation, the 'Great Breath' assumes the character of precosmic Ideation.\" (Plato's World of Divine Ideas.) \"It is the fons et origo of force and of all individ- ual consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelli- gence in the vast scheme of Cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, precosmic root-substance (Mulapra-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 129 kriti) is that aspect of the Absolute v^hich underhes all the objective planes in Nature.\" (b) The second of the three postulates of the Secret Doctrine is: \"The Eternity of the Universe in toto as a boundless plane: periodically 'the play- ground of numberless Universes incessantly mani- festing and disappearing,' called 'the manifesting stars' and the 'sparks of Eternity,' 'The Eternity of the Pilgrim' (the Monad or Self in man) is Hke a wink of the Eye of Self-Existence. 'The appear- ance and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux and reflux.' \" The third postulate is:— (c) \"The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul, the latter being itself an as- pect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pil- grimage for every Soul — a spark of the former — through the Cycle of Incarnation (or Necessity) in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term.\" . . . \"The pivotal doctrine of the Eastern philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort and merit throughout a long series of Metempsychosis and Reincarnations.\"* * Secret Doctrine, Introduction."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"130 Mystic Masonry. Every soul must \"work out its own salvation,\" and \"take the Kingdom of Heaven by force.\" Sal- vation by faith and the vicarious atonement were not taught, as now interpreted, by Jesus, nor are these doctrines taught in the exoteric Scriptures. They are later and ignorant perversions of the orig- inal doctrines. In the Early Church, as in the Secret Doctrine, there was not one Christ for the whole world, but a potential Christ in every man. Theologians first made a fetish of the Impersonal, Omnipresent Divinity ; and then tore the Christos from the hearts of all humanity in order to deify Jesus; that they might have a God-man peculiarly their own ! All the ancient Mysteries had the true doctrine, and the early Christians had it. Masonry, uncon- taminated by the disciples of Loyola, had and has it also. The one Immutable Principle, referred to in the first proposition (a), is called in the Kabalah, Ain Soph: the word Ain meaning \"nothing.\" This is not Jehovah, or Adonia, or the G,A,0,U; for it is not itself creative, but the cause of Creation. (\"Causeless Cause.\") The Jewish \"creators\" (plural) are the Elohim; the \"Principalities and Powers.\" In this conception"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 131 of Divinity lies the secret of the Ineffable Name, i. e., the Nameless. The Lost Word is to the Mas- ter who possesses it and knows how to \"pronounce\" it, what the Logos or creative power is to the Nameless. Hence the real Master creates, and in this sense is a god. This will be further shown in connection with the Seven Principles and the Na- ture of Man. The second proposition — the Eternity of the Uni- verse in toto — reveals the law of cycles and the \"in- cessant\" work of creation. In other words, the creative process never had a beginning, and will never have an end. There is one endless succession of Universes. Worlds and Solar systems continually appear and disappear. Each sun, star, or solar system has a period of activity and a period of repose; emanates from, and is. drawn back into, the All and the One. These periods are called the \"Nights and days of Brahm,\" The idea that a God with human qualities and human passions made the Earth out of nothing in six days of twenty-four hours each, is sufficiently miraculous, and sufficiently childish, for those who are ready to burn all who do not accept their inter- pretation.

The law of periodicity is a necessary corollary of the order of events and the flight of time. Ryth- mical, orderly, harmonious movements in space give us our conception of time, as how fast, how often, how slow, how regular, etc. The ear is a time or- gan, and the basic property of the Ether is Sound. This idea of periodicity, or law of cycles, is sym- bolized in Freemasonry in many ways. In the three, five, or seven years of pilgrimage or penance; in the seven years of plenty, and seven of famine. \"In the low twelve\" and \"the high twelve,\" in calling the Craft from labor to refresh- ment, and many others. In the third postulate we have \"the fundamental identity of all souls with the One,\" which gives the basis of the eternal and uni- versal Brotherhood of Man, and the basis of the en- tire scheme of human Evolution. When these doctrines are clearly understood, they will be seen to go far beyond any modern scheme of evolution, though running on somewhat similar lines. In them the entire scheme of Cosmic and human evolution will be found to have been worked out ages ago. Pythagoras and Plato found these doctrines completely unfolded in the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 133 Brother Pike says repeatedly that they have been far oftener disfigured than apprehended, and never transcended in modern times. Masonry derives its genius, its inspiration, its glyphs, and its traditions from this philosophy as taught in the Mysteries. How short-sighted and time-serving, then, must it be for Masonry to allow its Grand Traditions, its priceless inheritance to be dwarfed and overlaid by illogical interpretations, derived from records that were in the beginning, and before being disfigured by ignorance or cupidity, only an allegory of the true doctrines, prepared by \"those who knew\" for the ignorant masses, who demanded a sign and could never rise above a fetish. This is like barter- ing a magnificent diamond for a lump of common clay. Shall Masons now complete the folly by try- ing to convince themselves and others that the clay is the only diamond? How much one's idea of God colors all his thoughts and deeds is seldom realized. The ordi- nary crude and ignorant conception of a personal God more often results in slavish fear on the one hand, and Atheism on the other. It is what Car- lyle calls \"an absentee God, doing nothing since the six days of creation, but sitting on the outside and seeing it go !\" This idea of God carries with"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"134 Mystic Masonry. it, of course, the idea of creation, as something al- ready completed in time; when the fact is that cre- ation is a process without beginning or end. The world — all worlds — are being \"created\" today as much as at any period in the past. Even the ap- parent destruction of worlds is a creative, or evo- lutionary process. Emanating from the bosom of the All, and running their cyclic course; day alter- nating with night, on the outer physical plane, they are again indrawn to the invisible plane, only to re- emerge after a longer night and start again on a higher cycle of evolution. Theologians have tried in vain to attach the idea of immanence to that of personality, and ended in a jargon of words and utter confusion of ideas. A personal Absolute is not, except in potency. God does not think, but is the cause of Thought. God does not love, he is Love, in the perfect or absolute sense ; and so with all the Divine Attributes. God is thus the concealed Logos, the \"Causeless Cause,\" the \"Rootless Root.\" God never manifests Himself (to be seen of men). Creation is His manifestation: and as creation is not complete, and never will be, and as it never had a beginning, there is a concealed or unrevealed po- tency back of and beyond all creation, which is still God. Now, Space is the most perfect symbol of"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 135 this idea of Divinity; for it enters into all our con- cepts, and is the basis of all our experiences. We can not fathom it, or define it, or exclude it from a single thought or experience. Space is boundless, infinite, unfathomable, unknowable: in all, over all, through all. We know that It Is : and that is all we know about It. But are not these just the attributes that are as- signed to the Absolute and Infinite Deity? and they are all negations. God, says the Kabalah, is No Thing. But the Theologian will hasten to say that this is pure Pantheism. It is no more Pantheism than it is Atheism, for, as already shown, the Ain Soph is before and beyond Creation or Cosmos. It is not God deduced or derived from Nature, but pre- cisely the reverse; nature derived from God, and yet God remains \"the same, yesterday, today, and forever\" — the Changeless. The stability of nature is derived from the unchangeableness of God. God never tires, is not exhausted at His work, needing rest. That were so human as to be child- ish, and the idea, perhaps, originated from the cyclic law found in the Kabalah of the \"Days and Nights of Brahm,'' the \"Manvantaras and Pralayas,\" or periods of \"outbreathing\" and of \"inbreathing\" in the cvcles of evolution."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"136 Mystic Masonry. Hence the parable, given to the ignorant or viie profane, of God's working and then resting. If the reader will but reflect a moment on his own proc- ess of breathing, he will find that the inbreathing (inhalation) and the outbreathing (exhalation) are equal, and equally active processes, although so dif- ferent, each being the opposite of the other: each, in its turn, the cause of the other. Stop one, and the other ceases also. The more one reflects on this symbol of the Great Breath which creation is, the more will he understand of both Eternal Nature and his own being. But it may be asked : is man to be deprived of all idea of Personality except his own? By no means. God is the Author of Being, is the Author of Per- sonality. He personifies Himself, i. e., expresses that potency of Himself which personality is, through Man. The Hand of Providence is always a human hand. Humanity is both the vehicle and the agent of what man has called the Providence of God. Humanity in toto, then, is the only Personal God; and Christos is the realization, or perfection of this Divine Persona, in Individual conscious experience. When this perfection is realized, the state is called Christos, with the Greeks, and Buddha, with the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 137 Hindoos. Hence the Christ is at-one with the Father. \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.\" Humanity in toto ! What is it? Is it the genera- tions of the present age? or of any age in the past? or of the future? and these alone? Justice rules the Universe, and is the foundation of all Law. Jus- tice is the \"Kingdom,\" the \"Permanency\" of Deity. Humanity, therefore, means every human being ever horn, in any age, or to be born in coming ages, on this Planet. All are \"in the Hollow of His hand.\" One God, One Law for all ! else there is no Justice. And if it shall be done unto each according to the deeds done in the body ; if as a man soweth so shall he reap, the only logical deduction is Law governing action and determining results according to Abso- lute Justice. And this the Kabalah, the Secret Doc- trine and Masonry, and all Sacred Books, and all Religions, everywhere teach. By taking the Sym- bols for the thing symbolized, men have made con- tradictions out of details, and then built up a system of final rewards and punishments, attaching to acts in time ; and claimed their unreason and injustice as binding to all eternity. The result is Atheism and Materialism ; for there is an instinct in man, as part of his Divine inheritance, and that instinct is an"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"138 Mystic Masonry. innate sense of Justice. Destroy this, and the result is Atheism, pure and simple. Destruction of the sense of Justice has honey-combed the churches, and been the parent of modern Materialism. It is true that MateriaHsm is not the logical, but the actual result. The issue is not logically between an Uujust God and no God, but between a God tha,t is inconceivable because Unjust; and a God that is conceivable because Just, and therefore the issue of the Supreme Reason. But this philosophical concept of Divinity has another and still wider bearing. It concerns not only man's personal life, but determines his relations to his fellow men. It is the basis of ethics, and furthermore co-ordinates all his experience and all his knowledge, and this leads to true wisdom. \"To know God is the Supreme Wisdom.\" It will be urged by modern Theologians that this view dethrones Christ. To this objection the an- swer is that any other view orphans Humanity. It is far more important that men should strive to become Christs than that they should believe that Jesus was Christ. If the Christ-state can be at- tained by but one human being during the whole evolution of the race, then the evolution of man is a farce and human perfection an impossibility."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 139 Jesus is no less Divine because all men may reach the same Divine perfection. Again, it w^ill be urged, \"There is no other name given under Heaven or amongst men w^hereby ye can be saved.\" But this is the Ineffable Name, v^hich every Master is to possess and become, and salvation and perfection are synonymous. It has also been shown that every act in the drama of the life of Jesus, and every quality assigned to Christ, is to be found in the life of Krishna and in the legend of all the Sun-Gods from the remotest antiquity. That which the orthodox Christian will find to oppose to this view is not that it dethrones or de- grades Christ, but that it disproves the idea of Christ as their exclusive possession, and denies that all other religions are less Divine than their own. We have brought the same selfishness into our religions that we indulge in regard to our other pos- sessions, such as wife and children, and houses and land, and country; and the same partisan spirit as in our politics, and this more than anything else appears to justify selfishness in general, militates against the Brotherhood of Man, and prevents the founding of the \"Great Republic, composed of many Nations and all people.\" This idea of Uni- versal Brotherhood which was a cardinal doctrine"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"140 Mystic Masonry. in the Ancient Mysteries — as it is involved in the first postulate of the Secret Doctrine, and openly declared in the third; and which is equally given the very first rank in Masonry — is the logical de- duction from our idea of Divinity, and of the essen- tial nature and meaning of Christos. Humanity, in toto, as already explained, is the personification of the Divine in Creation, and the idea of exact and universal Justice regards each individual of all the myriads constituting Humanity with equal favor. There are no favorites in the Divine Conception, Justice of God toward all implies Justice toward each other amongst men. This principle of Justice is Law Universal, and this principle of Brotherhood and the perfectibility of man's nature through evo- lution necessitate Reincarnation. The number of souls constituting Humanity, though practically in- numerable, is, nevertheless definite. Hence the doc- trine of pre-existence taught in all the Mysteries applies to \"every child of woman born;\" all con- ditions in each life being determined by previous living. This will be further elaborated in another section of this work. Thus the Fatherhood of God in the Personification of Divinity in Humanity in- cludes the Universal and Unqualified Brotherhood of Man."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 141 The real Masters in all ages, knowing this from the lessons taught in the mysteries of initiation, have ever been the foes of Autocrats, Oligarchies, and Oppression in every form, v^^hether Ecclesiastical or Political.

By enlight- enment and persuasion they may strive to reform a nation or a church.

Masonry does not preach a new religion, it but reiterates the New Commandment announced by Jesus, which was also announced by every great re- former of religion since history began.

I47 CHAPTER V. THE SECRET DOCTRINE (CONTINUED). Science and Religion. The Science and the ReHgion (Theology) of the West are in perpetual conflict. The genius of this religion discerns Faith and Miracle as its founda- tion. Science holds as its ideals Fact and Law. This religion is necessarily illogical, while science is ma.erialistic, and, thanks to both, mankind is as far from any real knowledge of the nature and des- tiny of the soul as it was a thousand years ago. This conflict has long been maintained ; it is a war to the death ; both religion and science are being re- formed, and long before the battle ceases, neither of the original champions will be found to exist, ex- cept in their progeny of doubtful extraction or for- eign parentage. A reconciliation has sometimes been dreamed of, but placed a long way off. The theory or \"working hypothesis\" of Science is mechanical to the last de- gree. Matter, Force, Motion, and Law without an"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"148 Mystic Masonry. underlying Intelligence. Matter is said to be essen- tially dead and inert, and Mind is regarded as the fortuitous result of combination and aggregation, known as \"organization.\" Evolution is regarded as the result of modification and improvement by use and selection, and the increment carried forward by heredity. In other words, of Autonomy. The theory of Religion is that of a Personal God and an arbitrary and equally mechanical, though miraculous, creation; of a Revelation equally mi- raculous; of souls created as by arbitrary caprice of Deity, with the accidental co-operation of man, even in violation of Divine Law. It talks of Laws, but admits their abrogation through the Will (caprice) of God. It is true that neither Science nor Religion has openly formulated the foregoing creeds, but they are fair deductions from the postulates as- sumed, the logical results of a Nature without In- telligence; and a God who creates Laws only to annul them at His own good pleasure ! Reconcilia- tion between Science and Religion thus becomes impossible, because each is a contradiction to itself. But a reconciliation was reached in the Secret Doctrine ages ago. The old universal Wisdom Religion was scientific to the last degree ; for beneath both Science and Re-"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. I49 ligion was the Philosophy which discerned the or- derly processes of Eternal Nature, with no \"missing links\" in Evolution, and no caprice or contradictions anywhere in Cosmos. The First Postulate of the Secret Doctrine, already referred to, lays the sure foundation of this old Philosophy. An Omnipotent, Eternal, Boundless, and Im- mutable Principle, co-evil and co-extensive with Space: in All, through All, and over All: Divinity Immanent in Nature: Alike the Eternal Cause and Result, each without beginning or end, and each alternating forever ! Law in Nature is the Permanency, the Uncbange- ableness of the Divine Being. Intelligence in Na- ture is the Harmony of the Divine Order. Hence, the \"Kingdom,\" the \"Foundation,\" the \"Crown,\" the \"Beauty,\" etc., of the Kabalistic Sephira, or Divine Attributes of Ain Soph, the Boundless. The doc- trine of Emanation, taught by Plato and held by the Gnostics and the early Christians, gave the key to cosmic and human evolution. Plotinus said: \"God is not the principle of Beings, but the Principle of Principles.\" Universal Substance, Universal En- ergy, Universal Law, Universal Life, Universal In-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ISO Mystic Masonry. telligence are all emanations or manifestations of the One Principle. This is not Pantheism, but pure and unadulterated Theism. The All is One, and that One is Divinity, Spinoza came, perhaps, as near the truth as any one since the days of the old Initiates. Every atom of matter as every \"spot\" in space is full of Divinity. There is neither time nor place w^here He (\"It\") is not. The Priest-Initiates among the Hebrev^^s knew this doctrine, as they had it from Old Egypt (\"Moses v^^as skilled in all the vv^isdom of the Egyp- tians\"), and neither Jehovah nor Adonai was the Nameless or the Boundless. Here, in the First Postulate, lies the complete reconciliation of Science and Religion. Through the Divine Immanence in Nature, and within ali, Space concealed, every atom of matter is endowed with Life and Intelligence and bound by Law. Evo- lution is a Formation, Transformation, and Re-for- mation, in endless succession, with the outposts of Creation continually drawn upward toward the center in Divinity. Or, Space Involves Divinity, and Evolves Cosmos.

How any rational mind can fail to see in this philosophy a complete Reconciliation of Religion and Science, it is difficult to understand. In the beginning, when the world emanates, or begins to manifest visibly, space becomes turgid (called \"curds\" in the old Hindoo Cosmology) with substance. The invisible becomes visible. This is the first \"Matter,\" and it is called Akasa. On the force side, coincident with this turgescence (prior to \"nebula\") \"Absolute Abstract Motion, representing Unconditioned Consciousness,\" one of the two aspects of Beness — latent potential energy becomes active. Latent Consciousness becomes Cosmic Ideation. This primal energy is called Fohat, \"the mysterious link between Mind and Matter, the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.\" We have now Matter, Force and Motion, with Law as the Guiding intelligence (active) and Consciousness (latent) as Cosmic Ideation, unfolding the Plan ; and all these in perfect concord evolving the Sym.phony of Creation. Of course this Cosmogenesis can be here but roughly outlined. We have then Akasa, as the Universal Substance,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"152 Mystic Masonry. and Fohat, as the Universal Energy, with Intelli- gence guiding them, Consciousness back of them, and the Roots of all in the Concealed Ain-Soph, the Unknowable. Professor Crooks has taken a long stride in this direction in his metaphysical excur- sion in search of the \"Origin of the Elements,\" and in his postulation of Protyle. He has further touched the septenary key in the order of the ema- nation of the so-called elements known to modern science. It would be impossible in a work such as this, and equally out of place, to undertake to trace the process running through millions of years by which a planet is evolved; how the turgescence gives rise to denser substance, \"set on fire\" by friction (Fohat), and how the \"Fire-Mist\" cools and hardens into Matter on our plane. Though appar- ent Chaos, here is Cosmos, order and formation, as much as now may be discerned in this present state of our Earth. The real Chaos is Space, which is but latent, potential Cosmos, or Creation asleep. Tracing this process of world-building from the \"beginning,\" the One (negative), abstract Space and absolute Abstract Motion (the Ineffable Name, or Deity, lying still back of these, \"Nameless\" and never manifesting), now become active, and here lies the first \"Manifestation,\" a duality: \"Father-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 153 Mother;\" Spirit and Matter; Consciousness and In- telligence. From a latent or potential duality, space and motion, there arises an active manifested dual- ity. Taking latency as the One, the First Logos, we have thus the first Triad, or the \"Second Logos.\" As differentiation goes on the first Triad becomes the Modulus. Fohat \"lights the fires,\" sets the \"vi^heels\" (atoms) in motion, and Cosmic Ideation (latent Consciousness becoming active) now gives form to evolving substance. Symbolize this and we have the first triad reflecting itself in matter a double triangle,* or a perfect square, with the In- effable Name inscribed in the first triangle;^ which with the three reflected, making six, and the Name added making the First Septenary. This is the key- note of all that follows ; the pitch, the rhythm, and the harmony of Creation: The first octave in the song of the Morning Stars. Th© first septenary in the Universal Spectrum of Color : and the first ex- pression of the form into which Matter is molded. *In the Kabalah the \"Ancient of Days;\" the \"Aged of the Aged;\" \"The Face reflected in the Waters.\" Akasa is also called \"the pure waters of apace.\" tSee Plate L"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"154 Mystic Masonry. To synthesize all these movements in one word we have Fohat as the agent ; and Vibration as the man- ifestation. The Master who knows the pitch, qual- ity and amphtude of this first vibration, who can produce this first septenary of sound, color, and form, can by so doing raise his Consciousness to that first or seventh (according as we count from above downward or the reverse) plane. Such a one knows how to pronounce the Ineffable Name. It is not only a matter of pure science, dealing with laws of rhythm; a fact, and not a tradition or a senti- ment, but it implies absolute At-One-Ment in knowl- edge and power between all that goes to make up what we call man and all that we call Nature. It is the consummation of human evolution. Hence said the Christ: \"It is finished.\" In giving himself to the world the perfect at-one-ment was attained. In the ethical sense, that is, on the plane of rela- tions of man to man, the Word is Renunciation, or self-sacrifice. In the Hindoo tradition regarding the Master's Word there are seven ways of pro- nouncing it, each involving a different potency and a different result. The Voice of the Silence says : \"Before thou set'st thy foot upon the ladder's up- per rung, the ladder of the mystic sounds, thou hast"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 155 to hear the voice of thy inner God (the Higher Self) in seven manners. \"The first is like the nightingale's sweet voice chanting a song of parting to its mate. \"The second comes as the sound of a silver cym- bal of the Dhyanis, aw^akening the twinkling stars. \"The next is as the plaint melodious of the ocean sprite imprisoned in a shell. \"And this is followed by the chant of Vina. \"The fifth like the sound of bamboo-flute shrills in thine ear. \"It changes next to a trumpet blast. \"The last vibrates like the dull rumbling of a thunder-cloud. \"The seventh swallows all the other sounds. They die, and then are heard no more. \"When the six are slain and at the Master's feet are laid, then is the pupil merged into the one, be- comes the ONE and lives therein.\" While these descriptions are of symbols of sounds, they nevertheless represent definite vibrations in the Ether or Akasa, and he who can induce them in himself, can raise his consciousness plane after plane to the seventh, and become at-one with the All. If one has ever fainted or taken an anaesthetic, and re- members the rushing sound that precedes the silence,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"156 Mystic Masonry. when consciousness ceases on the outer plane, he has a fact in his own experience givnig him the key to Samadhi. if he can produce the same condition in himself without fainting or chloroform, for ex- ample, but by a knowledge of the laws of vibration, then is he an Adept, and has, and knows how to pronounce the Master's Word. The \"designs on the Trestle-board for the build- ing of the Temple\" are the laws that determine the evolution of the Higher Self in Man: while the exe- cution of the plan, or the construction of the temple, in accordance with the plan, means a transformation of the earthly tabernacle — the lower nature — into a likeness with \"that other, spiritual teniple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\" This is again symbolized by the triangle within the square. The triangle in the square syml)olizes potential Being before evolution : Man in the Garden of Eden. The square in the triangle symlxjlizes regen- eration; the purification of the lower earthly nature so that it may \"ascend to the Father;\" return to Paradise. This is symbolized by the careful posi- tion of the compass and square in relation to the Holy Bible, while the three Greater lights, and three Lesser lights again make a double triangle;"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 157 one greater because above, one lesser because below, which every Mason will understand. A few years ago these explanations would have seemed to the great majority of persons purely fanciful. But since the recent progress in electric- ity and photography ; since thought and emotion, like Hght and shade, have been photographed by light emanating from the human body directed by the human Will, the philosophical synthesis of the forces in man is the next step in the search of science for the mystery of man. It is precisely this synthesis which Masonry pos- sesses in its Symbolism, and we can only read the one by the light of the other, and check both by facts derived by experiments as science advances. Passing now from these broader metaphysical as- pects to the complex nature of man, and we have also the key to his entire nature and evolution. We begin with the fact of consciousness. Man is not merely a bundle of organs or faculties : he is es- sentially ONE. What else can be the meaning of the phrase \"Made in the image of God\" ? Man is the image, God the reality. Divinity posits a center of consciousness and this evolves into man. Just as in Cosmogenesis, latent con- sciousness as abstract absolute motion, became with"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"158 Mystic Masonry. abstract space the Cosmic duality. We speak of this center of consciousness in man as a \"spark of Divinity.\" What Divinity is to Cosmos this spark is to man. Concealed, never manifesting itself, but giving rise to all manifestations in man, it is the apex of the triangle, v^^hile Life and Thought are the other two angles. Starting, then, with this metaphysical concept, we have the Divine Ego, the Higher Self; a metaphys- ical abstraction, it is true, like the zero in mathe- matics, or like Motion and Space, yet the cause lying back of all phenomena, the potency of all actuality. This is the Ego, the Thinker, the \"I am I\" in man. So far, it is not conscious, but consciousness; or the cause of it in man's complex nature. It is the \"All-seeing Eye.\" It is Christos, potentially. It is Conscience; the \"Sun of Righteousness,\" in man's world of being. It attaches to the body and the lower life through mind, of which it is the po- tency, but not the act; the Thinker, but not the Thought. Mind is the immediate vehicle of consciousness, as matter is called the vehicle of Force. Thus, from the three postulates of the Secret"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 159 Doctrine we have, first: Divinity, and Nature at one; second, we have Spirit and Substance as the dual principle from which all Force and all Matter proceed; third. Religion and Science, are consistent, each with itself, and in perfect harmony with each other; fourth, we have a philosophy of the origin, nature, and destiny of Man, agreeing with, and fortified by all previous concepts. The First Postu- late teaches the origin and essential nature of all things. The Second Postulate teaches the Law of Cycles, and the process of world-building. The Third Postulate teaches, in harmony with the First and Second, the \"fundamental identity\" of all souls with the Universal Over-Soul ; Brotherhood and the Laws of Karma and Reincarnation, which are the factors in Human Evolution. Going back, now, to the First Postulate, we find One Principle with whatever \"aspects\" or \"man- ifestations\" the human mind may conceive, and all things, all principles, potencies, powers, derived' from or manifestations of this One: whether it be Matter or Spirit; man or beast; angel or worm; every thing from the One ; and, after all manifesta- tion, as before, the One is concealed; inexhaustible, unknowable. We know and can know only Its gar- ment, Its manifestations."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"i6o Mystic Masonry. Man is called the Microcosm, or little world. The One is in him, as in Nature, the cause of his Being; and as in the Macrocosm, or great world, the One manifests as the many by an orderly descent or dif- ferentiation, so in man, from the one principle we have first a triad, and then a quaternary. The three evolve four, making seven. Then from the first seven, \"seven times seven,\" making the \"49 fires\"* of the older Hindu philosophy. Before the reader declares this conception to be altogether fanciful, let him turn to the investigations of modern physical science regarding Color and Sound. Helmholtz es- timated that between the highest rate of vibrations giving rise to sound waves apprehensible to the hu- man ear, and the lowest vibration of Light, giving rise to the red of the Solar Spectrum, there would intervene about thirty-four octaves of consonant or dissonant vibrations ; and unless there are great gaps in nature, these thirty-four octaves are concerned in producing the phenomena of Nature. It has, fur- thermore, been demonstrated that there is an exact equation between color and sound vibrations; and that colors have their complementary tones, and *See Plates I and II."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. i6i tones their complementary colors. In other words, we may see sounds and hear colors. The modern theory (very old) of the Correlation and Conservation of Force, designates the various forces, as \"Special Modes of Motion:\" that is, defi- nite vibrations. All colors, sounds, and forms in nature, are the result of definite vibrations. Matter exists on different planes, having different densities, different atomic or molecular structure, and hence different vibrations. Change the plane, or rather transfer matter from one plane to another, and you change the inherent or normal vibration. Reverse the process, and change by any means the vibration, and you transfer the matter involved to another plane. We must go further. Observation and ex- periment have shown that as to these various planes we have not a single form of matter, with a single form of vibration, but every plane is complex and compound. All the colors of the spectrum, and all the tones in a musical scale, are resolvable into con- sonant series of octaves (septenaries). Hence on all the planes above referred to, there is an inter- penetration of planes and vibrations. On each plane there is a dominant chord to which all vibrations conform. Just as we may have in an octave or throughout a symphony a dominant chord."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"i62 Mystic Masonry. The order of this interpenetration, however, is from above downvi^ard. The higher penetrate the lower, while the lower are only latent in the higher. Take, for example, seven planes of which the highest (sev- enth) represents spirit, and the lowest matter or physical substance. The first or lowest plane is altogether illusory. It has no permanent or real existence. It is not only in continual motion and continual change (Formation, Dissolution, and Re- formation) but these are its characteristics. Under certain conditions it disappears (dissolves) from the ist plane entirely, and passes to the 2d, and to the 3d, 4th, and so on. The greatest activity is on the higher planes, and is greatest on the highest; till all merge in, or return to, the One, and Change- less, from which they emanated. All known phe- nomena in nature testify to the existence of such a law. Hence the saying in the old philosophy: \"Nature prefers that matter shall be eternal on the higher planes only.\" The grossest physical substance, therefore, is penetrated or saturated with all the higher sub- stances and energies. These are held to sub- ordinate positions by the dominant chord, which is, say, \"F,\" and so are latent or active as the theme unfolds, or as the combination varies. Can any one"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 163 imagine such a complicated condition and such co- ordinate resuks as all the time occur, and yet be- lieve that there is no absolute law governing the whole process? It is not difficult in a general way to formulate the law. Take the first or lowest plane. It is penetrated by matter of plane No. 2, the next higher. Let us say that each plane represents matter and force, the Cosmic duality. The so-called Force, of plane i, is the so-called substance of plane 2. But plane 2 is in its turn saturated by the substance and energy of plane 3. Hence the force or energy of plane 2 is the substance of plane 3, while the Force side of plane 3 is latent on plane 2, but active on plane 3. The law, therefore, may be thus formulated: From highest to lowest, the lower is the vehicle (Upadhi) of the higher; and each plane in the ascending or- der derives its Force or Energ}^ from the Substance of the next higher. In the last analysis, where all are merged in the one. Substance and Energ>^ are seen to be but two aspects of the One Eternal Prin- ciple ; the \"Father-:Mother\" of the old philosophy. Passing now from these general considerations to the organic nature of man, and applying these uni- versal laws to his physical, sensuous, intelkctual, moral, and spiritual nature, we shall find that they"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"164 Mystic Masonry. shed a flood of light on the problem of his nature, origin and destiny. It is well to bear in mind that our idea of God, and our theory of Religion (theology) were the starting points in this philosophy. To deny the ex- istence of God, or to conceive one as illogical, un- just, capricious, personal, and endowed with all hu- man infirmities, equally lead to confusion, ignorance and discouragement, if not to despair. This philosophy, here but crudely outlined, is not only the foundation of all the sacred books of all rehgions, but, while it was in them concealed beneath parable and allegory, in the Mysteries of each religion it was taught openly, and constituted the theoretical part of the genuine Initiations. Be- fore undertaking to show how far this philosophy is embodied in the symbols of Masonry, in the Build- ing of the Temple, and the Legend of Hiram, it will be necessary to further unfold the teaching in regard to the complex nature of man. Man may be viewed from two standpoints : as a concrete whole (an Individual, a conscious unit), and as an aggregate of organs and faculties. An- atomically, man is composed of fluids, tissues, and organs. The fluids are resolvable into inorganic and organic compounds, and resolvable again into"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 165 elements. The tissues and organs originate from cells, these from molecules, and these again are supposed to be composed of atoms or so-called elements. Physiology classifies the functions of man as organic — mere association of tissues en- dowed with life like the plant, hence sometimes called vegetative functions: as Animal— viewe'd from the sensuous plane, and common to all animal life : as Intellectual, in which are generally included the Moral and the Spiritual. Consciousness is usu- ally regarded as incidental, according as it appears or disappears on the physical plane. It has already been shown that in the Secret Doctrine, Conscious- ness is regarded as the permanent or basic factor in Man's Being. It is never destroyed, never sus- pended, but may retire from one plane to another. In this sense it may be withdrawn from the phys- ical plane. This old theory of the Ego, or Thinker, and its planes of consciousness on any of which it may be latent or active during its connection with the body, makes it possible or thinkable that the Ego may, in its states of consciousness, transcend the limits of the physical body altogether, and furnishes a conception of the nature and existence of the hu- man Soul. These elements of truth, be it observed, are derived from the phenomena and experiences of"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"i66 Mystic Masonry. the \"Flgo in the physical body, and the key to the problem lies in the planes of Consciousness. It is because modern materialistic science has overlooked the importance, and failed to understand the philos- ophy of Consciousness, that it denies or is agnostic regarding the existence of the soul. It should also be observed, that we do not put forth a theory of Consciousness as a w^orking hypothesis, but start with Consciousness as an empirical fact in all hu- man experience. Regarding the nature of con- sciousness itself, we are agnostic enough to suit the Spencers and Huxleys of Science, for we have posited it as the highest point in the nature of man ; a \"spark\" from the Unknowable; the \"forever Con- cealed.\" As to changes in states and extension of the bounds of consciousness, this has already been proved empirically in the experiments in hypnotism. Beyond the field of touch, outside the range of sight or sound, as applied to the ordinary functions of the senses. Hypnotic Subjects have been influenced by the silent will, and become conscious of the unex- pressed thought of the Hypnotizer. Thus, even modern materialism with its mechanical working hypothesis has worked up to the problem of cm- sciousness."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 167 Had anything been wanting in this direction, the clues, at least, have been furnished by the experi- ments in Psychic photography of Dr. Baraduc, re- ported in the French Academy of Medicine, and many other experimenters are working on the same lines. If the reports are true, Dr. Baraduc has proved by photography the existence of the Mayavi- Rupa, the thought-body known to many Adepts of antiquity. Long before this, Mr. J. M. Rusk, of . McConnelsville, Ohio, photographed a \"thought form\" by the light resulting from a strong concen- tration of the Will. Instances might be multiplied, but enough evidence has already been adduced to give the death-blow to Mechanico-materialistic hy- potheses of modern science, and to open the door for the Psychic Science of the East. Now, the Anatomy and Physiology to which I have referred, offer a certain method of investigat- ing man, and while this method has given rise to magnificent results, it is not, by any means, the only one, nor the most fruitful for all purposes. The Planes in Nature and in Man, to which I have referred, and the septenary principle in their divis- ions and relations, offer another method of investi- gation."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"i68 Mystic Masonry. CHAPTER VI. THE SECRET DOCTRINE (CONTINUED). The Septenary Nature of Man. We may speak of Life, of Will, of Desire, and of Love as Principles manifesting in Nature and recog- nized by results. In themselves they may have no definite form, yet are they none the less potent. These principles may take the form of the body of man, as water takes the form of the vessel that con- tains it, which, if congealed, retains the form of the vessel. Still it is true that water as a body has no definite form of its own. So it is with the prin- ciples we are considering. They are metaphysical concepts, not tangible things, but they are causes that lead to tangible results. It has already been stated that each principle is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race; and that the human principles are, on every plane, correlated to sevenfold occult forces. It has already been shown how the substances of different planes inter-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 169 penetrate with the \"dominant chord\" determining the vibration on any plane. As to the general method of evolution in man, or the relation of An- thropogenesis to Cosmogenesis, it may here be noted that in the various processes of \"cooling and harden- ing,\" by which the Earth has reached its present state from the \"Fire-mist,\" or \"nebulous mass\" recognized by modern science, long ages are con- sumed and various definite stages are reached. The Secret Doctrine teaches that man, like the earth, ex- isted potentially in the fire-mist, and that he has evolved downward into matter, pari passu, with the earth he inhabits, and of which he is an integral part. Each human being is, therefore, a miniature earth (Microcosm) evolving within the greater earth (Macrocosm). This is one of the meanings of Ezekiel's \"wheels within wheels.\" In a metaphys- ical sense, every so-called atom of matter is com- posed in the same way, and is going through a sim- ilar process. It may thus be seen that the key to the whole process of evolution is Analogy. It must naturally result from such a process, and from man's intimate relation to every principle, process, and plane that he epitomizes the whole ; and that through expansion of consciousness, and differentiation"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"170 Mystic Masonry. throughout his long experience, when the consum- mation of evolution is reached, man will be at one with the All. Knowing and being will be One in him. Hence, he will be a god in the Platonic sense. This is precisely the view set forth by Herbert Spencer as the consummation of human evolution where absolute power and supreme knowledge re- sult. Place over against this view of the infinite possibilities and transcendent destiny of man those of any of the exoteric religions or of materialistic science, and the old Wisdom Religion stands alone as the Divinest Revelation ever made to Humanity. During the life of man in the animal body on the physical plane, he is composed of the seven prin- ciples. These are Atma, Buddhi, Manas, Kama, Astral Body, Life Principle, and Physical Body. (The order in which they are here named is from highest to lowest, or from spirit to matter.) The first three, namely, Atma, Buddhi, Manas, are sym- bolized by a triangle. This is the oldest \"Trinity\" known to man, and is the origin of all the \"Trin- ities\" in all the exoteric Religions of the World. As already shown, the Ineffable Name written in the Triangle refers to the One Universal Principle, antedating creation, and lying back of all evolution. Chrisfos is called the Word, but is not Ain Soph."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 171 Atma in man represents Ain Soph in Cosmos. Hence it is called a \"Spark of Divinity;\" they are one in essence. Atma, Manas, and Buddhi repre- sent Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When Christ \"ascended to the Father,\" he raised his conscious- ness to the seventh or Atmic Plane, and became in fact (no longer in essence only) One With God. These three principles in man compose the Spirit- ual Soul; the Immortal part of man; v^^hile Atma- Buddhi constitute the Higher-Self, the latent or po- tential God in man. The lower quaternary Body, Life-Principle, Form-Body and Kama (or Desire), are symbolized by a square. To make it plain, let us say that the triangle incarnates in the square: that is, the Soul (spiritual) \"descends into matter.\" It has already been show^n in a previous chapter what is the orderly relation of the seven principles. The Body is the vehicle of Life ; Life is the vehicle of the Astral Body; the Astral Body is the vehicle of Kama ; Kama is the vehicle of Manas ; Manas is the vehicle of Buddhi ; and Buddhi is the vehicle of Atma. This is the orderly relation or sequence of the principles. But as already shown, man is not a mere aggregation of principles, any more than he is a conglomerate aggregation of atoms, molecules, or cells. Just as atoms form molecules; molecules."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"172 Mystic Masonry. cells; cells, tissues; tissues, organs; and organs, the whole body; so the Principles, while preserving a similar orderly sequence, in relation to each other, are, at the same time, organized in relation to the whole. That is, the Ego, the Thinker, unites with its vehicle, the Body. Physiology has determined that certain functions are performed by certain organs, and that certain tracts are sensory, and others motor: that there are co-ordinating centers of motion, or of sensation, like the cerebellum, the medulla, or the sensory ganglia; and has assigned thought, memory, reason and volition, to the cerebrum. But neither phys- iology nor modern science has been able to arrive at the slightest conception as to what Mind, or Soul, really are, beyond functions of organs, or results of organization. Empirical facts in Hypnotism show processes actually taking place that can not be classified under any known physiological law. The point at which the Triangle touches the square; that is, where the Spiritual-Soul forms its connecting link with the Physical-Body, is through Mind. Kama (the fourth principle, appetite, desire, passion, etc.) is not found in the upper triangle, but is the first in the square, or lower quaternary; and Kama has been called the vehicle of Manas. We"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 173 have thus resulting from this association Kama- Manas; and the central organ of this conjoined or dual principle is the human brain. Here is the union of Thought and Sensation; or Knowing and Feeling; the union of the desire to know with the desire to feel. Here is, furthermore, the origin, seat, and nature of self-consciousness in man. On the upper side of the point of union we have the Will; on the lower side, Desire. This union of Manas with Kama, or Mind with Desire, is called the lower mind (Lower Manas), because it always involves the personal equation. Let the union exist, but the desire be entirely subordinate and imper- sonal, and the Higher-Mind becomes free. The terms of the personal equation are united with, or merged in the n^ext higher. This is At-One-Ment of the lower man with the Divine: or Christ at-one with the Father. So long as the lower mind is held in bondage by desire, man can not seek or discern the Good or the True. He inquires, \"What is good for me?\" Freed from Desire, or the personal bias, he inquires after and seeks for that which is good or true in itself. When this condition is reached and habitually maintained, the square is said to be in- closed in the triangle. The whole lower nature is said to be at one with the Divine, or Spiritual Soul."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"174 Mystic Masonry. Man's knowledge and power are no longer confined to, or circumscribed by, the lower plane, or the physical body ; but, transcending these by Regenera- tion (self-conquest), and becoming perfect in Hu- manity, man attains Divinity. In other words, he becomes Christos. This is the meaning, aim, and consummation of Human Evolution; and this Phi- losophy defines the one-only process by which it may be attained. The Perfect Man is Christ: and Christ is God. This is the birthright and destiny of every human soul. It was taught in all the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, but the Exoteric creeds of Christendom, derived from the parables and allegories in which this doctrine was concealed from the ignorant and the profane, have accorded this Supreme Consummation to Jesus alone, and made it obscure or impossible for all the rest of hu- manity. In place of this, the grandest doctrine ever revealed to man, theologians have set up Salvation by Faith in a man-made Creed, and the Authority of the Church to \"bind or lose on Earth or in Heaven.\" Law is annulled ; Justice, dethroned ; Merit, ignored; Efifort, discouraged; and Sectarian- ism, Atheism, and Materialism are the results.

The cere- mony instructs, but it cannot transform. To trans- form means to regenerate; and this comes by trial, by effort, by self-conquest, by sorrow, disappoint- ment, failure; and a daily renewal of the conflict. It is thus that man must \"work out his own salva- tion.\" The consummation of initiation is the Perfect Master, the Christos, for these are the same. They are the goal, the perfect consummation of human evolution. Now, with this idea of human evolution, and in the Hght of modern science, what is it to be a Master? Not a mythical Master, not one so holy, so Divine, so incomprehensible as to be the object of blind worship alone, and impossible to be imi- tated, an Idol, a Fetish, but one indeed to reverence, to love, and, above all, to approach and imitate ; an Elder Brother, a Compassionate Teacher, a Helper of the Human Race. By constant struggle and daily conflict the Master has conquered self. Life after life he has gathered experience. Truly hath he been a \"man of sor- rows and acquainted with grief.\" He has assailed all problems; studied all sciences; exhausted all litanies; apprehended all philosophies; practiced all"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"IJ76 Mystic Masonry. arts. At every step he has loved and helped hu- manity more and more, and sought his own desires less and less. Grovi^n famihar thus with all the llower planes of life by sore trial, by bitter conflict, by frequent defeat, by hope deferred, almost despair- ing, he has at last renounced self utterly, and so become \"dead to the world.\" This is the \"Great Renunciation.\" An Infinite Compassion for all that lives takes possession of his soul, and an infinite peace settles within his spirit. \"Believe thou not that sitting in dark forests, in proud seclusion and apart from man; believe thou not that life on roots and plants, that thirst assuaged with snow from the great Range; believe thou not, O Devotee, that this will lead thee to the goal of final liberation.\" \"Step out from sunlight into shade, to make more room for others.\" . . . \" 'Tis from the bud of Renunciation of the Self that springs the sweet fruit of final liberation.\" \"The selfish devotee lives to no purpose. The man who does not go through his appointed work in life has lived in vain.\" \"So shalt thou be in full accord with all that lives; bear love to men as though they were thy"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. i?? brother-pupils, disciples of one Teacher, the sons of one sweet mother.\" \"Compassion speaks and saith : Can there be bliss when all that lives must suffer ? Shalt thou be saved and hear the whole world cry?\"* But, says some modern Agnostic, this is all beau- tiful, very fine indeed, but mere sentiment; with no foundation in fact, and no possible realization in the life of man. It will do for sentimental women, for tramps, or lunatics. What, then, is the meaning, and what the goal of human evolution ? Is Tantalus the one Divinity of the universe? Turning now from the ethical side of the prob- lem to the scientific, let us see what happens as the consciousness of man remounts from the lower animal-self toward the spiritual soul; from the physical toward the higher planes. We have shown Mind (Manas) to be the connect- ing link between the \"Upper Triad\" and the \"Lower Quaternary.\" When man has once passed the plane of Savagery in his evolution. Mind becomes more and more apparent as the battle-ground of his evo- lution. He gradually relaxes tooth and claw, and, first, by instinct, then by cunning, and finally by 'Voice of the Silence."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"178 Mystic Masonry. reason and design, pursues the struggle for exist- ence. He changes continually his code of ethics, for he is continually compelled to compromise, and he finds that he can retain more by relinquishing a part. His very selfishness leads him to combine and co-operate with his fellows. At last his sympathies expand. By and by he learns that a \"fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.\" He reciprocates, and at last becomes generous. During all this long and weary struggle his mind is enlarging, and his con- sciousness expanding. He creates for himself a world of Thought. It is unreal and unsatisfying, because so impermanent; and yet he struggles on. He reflects over his varied experience ; seeks causes, and discerns principles. He realizes the saying, \"My mind to me a kingdom is;\" \"On Earth there is nothing great but Man : In Man there is nothing great but Mind.\" Or, the older saying, \"All that I am is the result of what I have Thought.\" Mind is like an alembic in which are precipitated all ex- periences. By evolution man is continually climb- ing upward to higher planes. His five senses are adjusted to observations and experiences of the physical plane ; but he has other experiences. The senses are narrow and circumscribed ; yet even these become refined. His tastes alter, his tendencies as-"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 179 cend. He is reaching outward as his sympathies expand, and upward, as his ideals become higher. There is revealed to him a whole world of experi- ence in which the lower senses play no part: A world of aspiration in which Self is not the goal. The very physical bounds of self are loosening, ex- panding, disappearing. Hitherto he has been con- scious of flashes of intuition ; of knowing things he has seemingly never learned. He sees inner mean- ings, and senses subtler powers. Not only in visions and intuitions of the day, but in dreams of the night he has experiences beyond the bounds of sense. He learns the power of Thought. By conquering Self, his Will becomes strong. By subduing passion, his mind becomes clear. He has premonitions of com- ing events; for all events and thoughts and things exist first on higher planes, and are precipitated thence into matter. He becomes clairaudient and clairvoyant. He has broken the bonds of Self and now functions on higher planes. As his senses and organs on the physical plane made him Master there of brutes, and of physical nature, even so on the higher plane, the senses and organs evolved by the same Evolutionary Law of experience and choice, make him, on the higher plane, Master of men and of higher Nature. All the time he is evolving organs"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"i8o Mystic Masonry. and functions, and dealing with matter and force. Just as experience and reflection taught him the laws and processes of the physical plane, so his ex- panded and refined experience and intuitions (spir- itual perceptions) teach him the laws of the higher plane. But, says the physiologist, on the physical plane man has evolved physical organs which bring him in contact with Nature on that plane. Even so it is on all planes, for analogy is the key of interpreta- tion, \"As below, so above.\" Deep within the recesses of the skull, lying at the base of the brain, is a curious little structure known as the Pineal Gland — with the Restiform bodies. Modern physiology assigns to it no function. Des Cartes called it \"the seat of the soul.\" In the aver- age individual it is small and apparently useless, though its focalized position and symmetrical rela- tions to surrounding structures would seem to assign to it some very important office. It presents a dif- ferent appearance in the very young, the very old, and in the idiotic, from that found in the prime of life, health, and vigor. It has been called \"The Third Eye.\" The Ancient Hindoos called it the Eye of Siva, and it should be borne in mind that Siva is the third person in the Hindoo Trinity, and"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. i8l is the Renewer, or Regenerator (not simply the De- stroyer). The action of this little \"gland\" may be likened to the bridge of a violin. It renders the nerve chords more tense, and thus raises the vibra- tions of the brain tissues. It is atrophied, and therefore dormant in the average individual, be- cause the relaxed chords (using a symbol) cor- respond to the vibrations on the physical plane; and it is one of the well-known laws of physiology that every organ will become atrophied from disuse. Going back to our problem of Consciousness, we find Mind to be the changes in our states of con- sciousness : orderly, when governed by the Will, and guided by Reason; disorderly, when swayed by the passions, or led by caprice. All the so-called Senses are differentiations of the One-Sense-Consciousness (Apperception). Reference has elsewhere been made to empirical proof that in the case of Sight and Hearing; or, Light, Color, and Sound, the vibrations are conso- nant and interchangeable. Now it can easily be seen that if the one sense (consciousness) has dif- ferentiated into several Senses, so-called, in man's \"descent\" from higher to lower planes, on his \"as- cent\" from lower to higher planes, the differentia- tions must gradually disappear, and one center may"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"i82 Mystic Masonry. combine and synthesize two or more Senses. This is precisely what happens in the case of hearing and seeing, or in the vibrations producing sound and color. Since empirical science has demonstrated the fact, the theory may now, perhaps, no longer excite only a sneer; for it must be borne in mind that the foregoing is one of the theories taught in the Ancient Mysteries. Here then is the physiological, no less than the philosophical basis of Clairvoyance and Clairaudi- ence. The Eye of Siva is, in fact, an All-Seeing- Eye ; for it practically annuls Space and Time as con- cepts on the physical plane. Whether or not modern Masonry has any such tradition, or any such metaphysical or scientific con- cept regarding the All-Seeing-Eye so conspicuous in its symbolism, such, at least, is its meaning in the Secret Doctrine of Antiquity. A real Master, then, has the Eye of Siva; the pineal gland, dormant in others, is active in him; and the vibrations of his brain correspond to the synthesis of sound and Hght. Henceforth, for him. Space and Time are no longer illusions, as he lives in the one and is Master of all lower planes. Says the Voice of the Silence —"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 183 \"Alas, alas, that men should possess Alaya, be one with the great Soul, and that possessing it, Alaya should so little avail.\" \"Unless thou hearest thou canst not see.\" \"Unless thou seest thou canst not hear.\" \"To hear and see, this is thg second stage.\" So much as to the meaning of the word Master, and the methods by which Adeptship is attained. Now, as to the nature of the Power he possesses, or, the Master's Word. A man's words' express his ideas, and reveal his character. In this sense the creative power of Deity is called the Word of God, or the Logos; and the whole process of crea- tion, being an outward expression of Divinity, is called the Logos. \"There is in Nature one most potent force, by means whereof a single man, who could possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could revolutionize and change the face of the world. \"This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal agent, whose Supreme Law is equilibrium, and whereby, if science can but learn how to con- trol it, it will be possible to change the order of"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"184 Mystic Masonry. the Seasons ; to produce in night the phenomena of day; to send a thought in an instant around the world; to heal or slay at a distance; to give our words universal success, and make them reverberate everywhere.\" \"This agent, partially revealed by the blind guesses of the disciples of Mesmer, is precisely what the Adepts of the middle ages called the 'elementary matter of the Great Work.' The Gnostics held that it composed the igneous body of the Holy Spirit; and it was adored in the secret rites of the Sabbat or the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Baphomet, or the hermaphroditic goat of Mendes.*\" Modern Science is slowly re-discovering some of the secrets of Antiquity. The \"Radiant matter\" of Professor Crooks, the Cathode ray of Roentgen, and other advancements in psychic photography, the Mayava Rupa of Baraduc, and, greatest of all, the discoveries of J. W. Keely, trench so closely on the \"elementary matter\" of the old Alchemists and the Akas of the more ancient Adepts of old India, that a student of occultism need no longer be afraid to reveal himself. There is an old legend which declares that the *Moral8 and Dogma, p. 734."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 185 ancient Atlanteans, not those of Plato's island which was a fragment of the great continent, but of the Continent which sank, it is said, 50,000 years ago, possessed the secret of this \"most potent force,\" re- ferred to by Bro. Pike, that they were great Magi- cians, and that they did thus \"change the face of the earth,\" as Bro. Pike declares possible, and that the sinking of the continent was the result. Per- haps, if our \"rain-makers\" succeed in solving a little further the problem of vibrations in their rela- tions to atmospheric changes, this and many other ancient \"Fables\" may seem less fabulous to modern \"scientific materialism.\" When it is stated that these terrible forces exist, and may be known and utilized, people are not scandalized in this age of dynamite. But when it is also stated that the knowledge of these forces is concealed from all but trained Adepts who have demonstrated their unqualified beneficence to man, and that in the hands of vicious, unquali- fied, or ignorant persons, they are capable of work- ing untold misery to man, the statement usually ex- cites derision. If this embargo were removed, doubtless mankind would not long remain in any uncertainty as to the existence of the terrible vrill of Bulwer Lytton. If it were revealed to the Spanish Generals or the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"i86 Mystic Masonry. Cuban Rebels at the present time, the contest would soon be ended on that unhappy island. This force is the universal Life agent, as Bro. Pike says, \"wherein are two natures and a double cur- rent of love and wrath.\" This ambient fluid pene- trates everything. Hence it is the \"First Matter\" of the Alchemists. It is concentrated in man as the magnetic living force directed by the Will. He who knows its \"chord of mass\" or the \"key-note\" of its vibrations can, by his Will, waken it from Space and send it in mighty waves to do his bidding. The real Word of the Master, therefore, in a scientific sense, is this tone-key by which the \"Principalities and Powers of the Air\" can be made to do his bidding. That any one should possess such power and withhold its use, is not easily conceived by the average man of today; and that such a Master should also conceal his own existence, seems alto- gether incredible to an age of Syndicates and Trades Unionists. Such a power would, indeed, be a knockdown argument in all competition, and fur- nish a very ready way of settling all disputes. The ethical training to which reference has been made, and which began at the first step of initiation, preceded all scientific training in the ancient mys- teries; and the Masters are spoken of by Plato,"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 187 lamblichus, and many other writers, as the \"Im- mortal Gods.\" But it must not be concluded that because the real Master does not enter into competi- tion on the physical plane, or parade his gifts for the applause of men, that he makes no use of his sub- Hme Wisdom and transcendent Powers. It would be childish to use siach powers for display, to awe the ignorant, or to amuse the curious; and such Men have long since put away childish things. From their secure retreat on the inner or higher planes of being, they influence, but do not dominate the affairs of men; and many a beneficent move- ment is due to their timely aid. According to our conception of energy as correla- tive throughout Nature's boundless domain, Fohat is the synthesis of all the so-called forces of nature. It is \"Cosmic Electricity Endowed with Intelli- gence.\" In the manifested Universe, Fohat is \"that Occult electric vital power, which, under the Will of the Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms, giving them the first impulse which becomes in time law.\" It is \"the Constructive Force of Cos- mic Electricity.\" Fohat has \"seven sons, who are also his brothers.\"* These are Electricity, Mag- *Se€ Plate I."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"i88 Mystic Masonry. netism, Sound, Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc. What modern science calls the \"modes of motion,\" can fairly be called definite vibrations. The forces just named all manifest on the lower physical plane. That is, we see there their effects. If back of all forces there is One Force, and if this one force dif- ferentiates first into seven, and these seven are in their turn divisible into other Sevens, we get the idea that the Solar spectrum and the musical scale reveal the universal modulus; and that what is known to exist in the realm of Light and Sound, must also exist in the realm of Electricity, Chem- ism; and, in short, with every force and on every plane in Nature.* If, therefore, one can discover the rate of vibration, the quality and amplitude of the \"wave-length\" in any given case, he will hold the Key to that plane. Fohat is not only the synthesis of all known forces, and endowed with intelligence, but poten- tially, before differentiation begins, is the Author of the Law of all subsequent correlations, differentia- tions, or action whatsoever. If this view is considered carelessly it might seem to involve materialism or pantheism. But such is 'See Plate I."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 189 not the case. When one realizes that Fohat is one of the highest of the Elohim, or Builders, the Cre- ators spoken of in Genesis, the direct agents of Di- vinity through which the Ancient of Days or Ain Soph creates, this view will be seen to be spiritual to the last degree. The first impulse of Fohat becomes, in time, the law of all subsequent vibration. Fohat is, more- over, in the Secret Doctrine, likened to an \"Intelli- gent Force moved by Will.\" As the various forces and planes in the constitu- tion of man are derived from and correspond to similar forces and planes in Nature, it can readily be seen what potencies are latent in man ; and that the possession of the knowledge of these planes and forces, and a Trained Will to use and direct them, would naturally constitute one an Adept, or Master. The mere power of thought or of the imagination, with a strong concentration of will power, would, at all times, enable a real Master to say, \"take notice thereof, and let it be done.\" The ignorant would naturally say: \"What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the waves obey him?\" It is said of the Word A. -.U. -.M. •. that it has seven meanings applicable to seven planes, requir- ing, therefore, seven keys; and similar traditions"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"190 _ Mystic Masonry. exist with regard to the Tetragramaton of the Ka- balah — ^\"He who maketh the earth to quake and an- gels and men to tremble\" — even Jehovah, For the ignorant and superstitious, this has one meaning. For the intelHgent student of Kabalah, it has many and very diiTerent meanings. The physical plane, that of the body of man, is such by virtue of the co-ordinate vibrations of all the principles that enter into its construction. The physical exists by virtue of the maintenance of the Key or dominant chord of that plane. As long as this key can be maintained in perfect concord, health exists. Whenever the harmony is disturbed, disease results ; and when the key can no longer exist, dissolution of the organism occurs, and death is the result. The problem of genuine initiation, or training in occultism, consists in placing all the operations of the body under the dominion of the v/ill ; in freeing the Ego from the dominion of the appetites, pas- sions, and the whole lower nature. The idea is not to despise the body, but to purify it; not to destroy the appetites, but to elevate and control them abso- lutely. This mastery of the lower nature does not change the Key of the physical nature as such ; but subordinates it to that of a higher plane. Without"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 191 this subordination, the clamorous lower animal na- ture drowns out all higher vibrations ; as if in an orchestra the bass-viols and the drums only could be heard; and noise, rather than harmony, would result. Hence the old saying — \"He that conquers himself is greater than he who taketh a city.\" From such mastery of the lower nature by intelli- gent effort and Will power, there results not only peace, the silencing of the clamorous lower nature, but clearness of vision and power of discernment. There results also a sense of freedom and of power, and a certainty of Knowledge. In the Bhagavad Gita this training is called Yoga, and is defined as equal-mindedness and skill in the performance of actions. It is distinguished from Hatha Yoga, which is mere straining after special powers (medium- ship), and is called Raja Yoga; that of the Kingly or Divine sort ; and is everywhere portrayed as a permanent subjugation of the whole lower nature. It is, in fact, in science and in a philosophical sense, the higher evolution of man. Whatever is gained in one life in this direction is carried over to the next incarnation ; while all apparent gain of \"powers\" in Hatha Yoga (mediumship) is lost in future births, or else is a detriment to evolution. The potency of the planes in man increases from"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"192 Mystic Masonry. the lower to the higher, and the whole process we have been considering consists symbolically, in \"placing the square within the triangle :\" that is, of so purifying the whole lower nature as to make it at-one with the higher. The mind that functions through the physical brain, governed by the senses and appetites, and that first gives man self-con- sciousness, now moves one plane higher. Passion no longer rules the man and blinds him to universal laws and higher principles. The Higher Self in man, called his \"God,\" or Christos, was formerly \"crucified between two thieves ;\" namely, the Higher and Lower Manas. Hence the saying, \"when I would do good, evil is present with me.\" As the body is crucified (a symbol of death and suf- fering), the Christos says to one of the thieves — \"This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\" This refers to the Higher Manas, now freed from the lower nature. The other \"thief,\" or the brain mind, is left to perish with the physical body of Christos on the Cross of Time. It may thus be seen how the battle-ground of man's lower nature with the higher is the mind, and that self-conquest and the higher evolution are synonymous. The process of this evolution can be expressed in mathematics and terms of exact science. Hence the old saying"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 193 in the Bible — \"I praise thee with my lips, / know not the numbers.\" Silence the dominant chord of the lower animal nature, and change the vibration to that of, the Higher Mind, and \"Thou shalt be- come as gods knowing good and evil.\" This change of vibration, with a knowledge of the dominant chord and the combination of the key- board directed by the Will, is the discovery of J. W. Keely. The Roentgen ray is one of the \"seven forces\" into which light, sound and electricity are divisible. The secret of the Crooks tubes has been clearly shown to consist in getting rid of a surplus of molecules or atoms, and thereby increasing the vibration (bombardment) of the remainder; and thus liberating, not creating, a \"new light.\" The trained will of the Adept can do this, and more. He has been seen to make his whole body luminous. Since the experiments of Von Reichenbach have been verified, and the \"illusion-body\" photographed, such a result can no longer be declared to be a sci- entific impossibihty. It should be borne in mind that our entire phi- losophy as related to man proceeds from the em- pirical fact of Consciousness, with appeal taken at every step to the facts of experience. Our theory does not consist in any speculation or assertion re-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"194 Mystic Masonry. garding the nature of consciousness itself, but rather in using both facts and experiences in the natural order of their relations. In the case of the Master or Adept, the same potencies and processes are in- volved as in ordinary evolution; and none others. The different results arise from the fact that in the case of the Adept, these ordinary processes are no longer trammeled or delayed. \"The Wise Ones tarry not in pleasure-grounds of the senses,\" \"The Wise Ones heed not the sweet-tongued voices of illusions.\" \"Thou shalt not let thy senses make a play-ground of thy mind.\"* It may thus be seen that neither causes nor results are involved in an untried \"working hypothesis.\" This philosophy not only explains the nature and origin of all the Christs of history, as the result of evolution under natural law, but these all stand as \"Landmarks,\" pointing out \"the Way, the Life and the Truth,\" in the journey of the soul, and the im- mortal destiny of man. Furthermore, every point herein made is but a crude fragment derived from the Ancient Mysteries, held by the Gnostics and ^Voice of the Silence."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 195 early Christians, and embodied in or implied by the parables, allegories, and glyphs of Freemasonry. Initiation therefore must be seen to be both evo- lutionary and regenerative; and not a mere empty farce or a dead ceremony. Taking now this evolutionary process as a fact, we may profitably consider further the change that occurs in the structure of man's complex organism as evolution proceeds. We have shown Mind to be the active theater in which the real battle is fought for the supremacy of the Higher or Spiritual-Soul, as distinguished from the lower Animal-Soul. \"Thou shalt not let thy senses make a play-ground of the mind.\" No doubt many who have read this sentence have regarded it as a moral precept only ignorant, perhaps, of the fact that there is not only a philosophical concept but scientific facts and Laws back of all moral truths. The mind is the realm of thought, and the sum of all experience on both the physical (senses and feel- ings) and metaphysical (reason, imagination, Will, intuition, etc.) sides of Consciousness. Experience may be called the moving panorama of events in the conscious life of man. Thought is, therefore, the changes in our states of consciousness. Thought is"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"196 Mystic Masonry. the active movement, and consciousness the passive theater of the varied experiences of Ufe. Con- sciousness is, therefore, to the Hfe of man what Space is to the existence and movements of Cosmos — the ALL-CONTAINER. The Ego is a self-centered \"ray;\" a focus; the \"mathematical point\" in con- sciousness. That which the nucleus is to the living cell, the point from which all forces and movements emanate, and to which all counter-movements and forces tend, such is the Ego — the Thinker of man. The first point to be made in real initiation is for the Thinker to control the thought. Instead of passively and helplessly receiving all suggestions that come from the physical senses, or appetites ; or all that come from ambition, selfishness and pride ; he selects, and chooses, and Wills what thoughts shall come. In this manner he acquires mastery over his own mind, and frees his will from the dominion of Desire; or rather elevates and purifies Desire. He is no longer hag-ridden by vagrant thoughts; or a victim to the ghosts of a remorseful memory, or a depraved imagination.

Yet what is revery, or day-dream, or absent-minded- ness? We have only to analyze and reflect on our ordinary experiences in order to see how natural and really commonplace are the operations of these oc- cult laws. When this process is intelligently conceived and persisted in, the mind grows clear and the Will strong, and for this change there is a physical basis and a scientific law; and there must be correspond- ing changes in the physical structure. This change occurs on the Kamic plane, which is now subordi- nated to Reason and Will ; and also in the Astral or Form-body, which is the vehicle of Kama (passion and desire). This Astral body is the mold or pat- tern around which the physical structure is built, which it precedes and survives for a short time after death. In relation to the molecules and cells which constitute the tissues of the body the Astral structure is Atomic. The Astral body of each sepa- rate incarnation is the immediate result of the thoughts and experiences of the preceding life; modified, however, by all previous lives.

It has also much to do with the \"ghosts\" and \"materiaHzations\" of the Seance rooms. This Astral principle, like all the other seven (really six, exclusive of the highest) is seven- fold in its constitution in man ; and it is the lowest of which we have been speaking. This Astral is one of the principles of the \"square,\" or lower quaternary, and is not, therefore, the real spiritual soul, or immortal part in man. With this crude outline of the Form-Body we may now return to the process of regeneration. The change resulting from self-mastery and the subjuga- tion of the lower animal nature, strengthens the Form-Body and liberates it from the physical shell. Instead of this Astral or Form-Body saturated with the gross animal spirits (kama) being held to the vibrations of the mere animal and physical nature, and thus holding consciousness to the key-note of the physical plane, involved in the lower animal life, the vibrations are now raised one plane higher. The action of the Pineal Gland and Restiform Bodies heretofore described, now come into play with the purified and liberated Form-Body.

Now, in case of the grow- ing Adept these experiences become continually more frequent and lucid. He retains distinct recol- lection, and understands more and more of what occurs. By and by he observes the process of \"going out\" and \"coming back;\" and at length learns to repeat the process at will ; a perfectly nat- ural evolution, be it observed. The story of Peter Ibbetson gives an exceedingly graphic and phil- osophical description of this \"double conscious- ness,\" which is more than justified by the phenom- ena of Hypnotism and Somnambulism, The Adept from the time he is able to change at will his habi- tat, leads a double life, and lives at once in two worlds. He has, moreover, \"put the last enemy under foot.\" He has, by self-conquest and Will, conquered Death. These are they whom Plato and the old Initiates call the Immortals.

It is true that he can not function or manifest on the physical plane as be- fore, for he has now no longer the physical body. But he has learned to live so little on that plane, and found thereon so little of real enjoyment, that unless he has a special work to do for humanity, or an obligation to discharge to others, he finds nothing to regret in dying. He has fulfilled the Law of Necessity (Karma) by obeying it! 'This is peace, To conquer love of self and lust of life. To tear deep-rooted passion from the breast, To still the inward strife.\" \"For love, to clasp Eternal Beauty close; For glory, to be Lord of self, for pleasure To live beyond tbe gods; for countless wealth To lay up lasting treasure.\" \"Then sorrow ends, for Life and Death have ceased: How should lamps flicker when their oil is spent?

The knowledge possessed by such a Master, and the power which he finds subject to his Will, are derived, as in all ordinary cases, from the whole range of his experience. One has only to use good judgment and thoughtful observation in experiment- ing along the lines indicated, and to go but a little way to become convinced of the truth involved in the philosophy of self-conquest.

In comparison with the ordi- nary process of drifting with any tide, it is, indeed, a forcing process ; but the force is derived from the higher nature, and the result is plainly within the law of man's moral and intellectual life. The term Astral-Body has been used because it is somewhat familiar to Western students. The term is a very loose one at best, and the plane and struc- ture to which it refers are so metaphysical and com- plex that it is difficult to find terms in which to de- scribe it. The conception of what we ordinarily call \"matter and force\" is, moreover, entirely in- adequate in dealing with such problems. Electric- ity, for example, is not simply a \"mode of motion,\" or a \"fluid,\" but a correlate involving life and intel- ligence, with latent consciousness, and moved by Will: a duality in itself, according as it manifests as the substance of one plane or the energy of another. Furthermore, the problem of consciousness as re- lated to Space and Time already pointed out, makes it difficult to put in exact terms the experience of the Ego on the supra-physical planes. In \"going out of the body,\" for example, there is a freeing of the centers of action always resident in the Astral, or the Atomic Body, from the physical organs and tissues; and a consequent change of the planes of"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 203 consciousness. Synchronous vibrations now occur between the centers of consciousness in the Astral- Body and the whole Astral Plane; just as before, this synchronism existed between the physical body and the physical plane in relation to physical con- sciousness. The Astral-Body, therefore, need not leave the vicinity of the physical, or \"travel through space,\" to take cognizance of events elsewhere transpiring. This, furthermore, remains true, even in cases where the apparition of the individual is seen at great distances from where the physical body is, at the time, reposing.* Thought is, in every case, a vibration molding substance into definite forms. Whenever we think of a person near or far, we create a thought image of that person. This form necessarily varies according to the clearness of memory or imagination, and the strength of Will. Furthermore, our thought is characteristic of our- selves, and in thinking intently of a distant object or person, a thought-form of ourselves may appear at that place. .This may occur or be visible to others, and exist unconsciously to ourselves. With a per- son of trained habits of thought, who thinks clearly *Dr. Baradue has demonstrated this, by the 'Thought- Body.\""},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"204 Mystic Masonry. and connectedly, and who is possessed of a strong will; who knows, also, how to fix and hold the thought on an object or a person, the projection of the Thought-Body, as above described, becomes a comparatively easy matter. Such an Illusion might or might not be perceived by another ; nor, except in the case of an Adept, could the individual causing the Illusion be certain himself whether his experi- ment had been successful or not. While these facts have been familiar to students of occultism for ages, they have seldom been dis- cussed in print for the reason that such discussion could do no good and would only excite ridicule. But now that modern scientific experiment trenches so closely on the subject, the discussion may not seem so unprofitable. In a communication from Paris dated June 27, 1896, a description of psychic photography is given as presented to the Paris Academic de Medicine by Dr. Baraduc: \"Dr. Baraduc explains in part his methods of psychic photography, which seem simple enough. The experimenter locks himself in a dark room where he has previously placed a sensitive plate.

If no other image has intruded, a perfect likeness will have been obtained. In conclusion. Dr. Baraduc says that not everybody has this power to control his volition, and in order to succeed, a strong imagi- nation is absolutely necessary, and an energetic Will indispensable.\" Mr. James M. Rusk, of Ohio, reports the same result from a similar experiment made by himself and confirmed by Colonel De Rochas. The only new feature in these experiments is the introduction of photography and the consequent fixation of the images, and this result is, of course, of paramount importance to materialistic science. Ten thousand persons will be convinced by a fact or an ocular demonstration, where one will perceive the truth from reason, philosophy, or intuition. Let us have the ocular demonstration, then, by all means. Experiment might be facilitated immensely by as- sistance derived from the old philosophy, but as this is usually ignored or derided.

THE SECRET DOCTRINE (CONTINUED). The Sign of the Master. It must not be supposed that in the Ancient Mys- teries every Initiate became a Master in the sense outlined in the preceding chapters.

Some remained for a lifetime in the lower degrees, unable to progress further on account of constitutional defect or mental and spir- itual incapacity. The Mysteries unfolded the Build- ing of Worlds, the Religion of Nature, the Brother- hood of Man, the Immortality of the Soul, and the Evolution of Humanity.

The Priests of Egypt knew better than we do the laws of move- ment and of life. . .\"* Philosophy, however, may give us a Key t-o sym- bolism, a Universal Modulus. True philosophy dis- cerns the Plans drawn by Divinity on the Tracing Board of Time for the building of Cosmos. The Primary Concepts of such a Philosophy are few and simple. So, indeed, are the root-forms in Symbolism. The changes rung on concept and Symbol, as the plan unfolds, become more and more complex, even where they are wrought by those who know. When from these the symbolism descends to parable and allegory in order to clothe the primary concept in ethical language, and make it apprehen- sible and binding to the ignorant masses, its garment and Fiat read, \"Thus saith the Lord.\" When, however. Ignorance in high places, or cupidity and lust for power interpret, or willfully suppress, disfigure and distort the ancient symbols, as has been done for lo, these many centuries, the masses are not prepared to beheve that the real truth, uncontaminated by man, has ever been dis- covered.

The real sym- bols are the Modulus of Nature, and man can never destroy these. \"Thales and Pythagoras learned in the Sanctua- ries of Egypt that the Earth revolved around the Sun, but they did not attempt to make this generally known, because to do so it would have been neces- sary to reveal one of the great Secrets of the Tem- ple, the double law or attraction and radiation, or of sympathy and antipathy, of fixedness and move- ment, which is the principle of creation and the perpetual cause of life. This truth was ridiculed by Lactanius, as it was long after sought to be proven a falsehood by persecution by Papal Rome.\" \"So the Philosophers reasoned, while the Priests, without replying to them or even smiling at their errors, wrote in those Hieroglyphics that created all dogmas and all poetry, the Secrets of Truth.\"* To preserve its authority and its perquisites, Ec- clesiasticism will, today, as in all the past, answer such statements with neither facts, reason, nor ar- guments, but zvith a curse!! and so long as men *Morals and Dogma, p. 842."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"210 Mystic Masonry. grovel with fear at the curse will the truth be con- cealed. When men are wise enough and brave enough to defy both the anathema and the anathe- matizer, the whole opposition to light and progress will fall to pieces. Till then, the ignorant masses, imitating their superiors, will scout, ridicule and slander all who speak the truth. Freedom and En- lightenment are the only real Saviors of Mankind; while Ignorance is the father of Superstition, and Selfishness the parent of Vice. The Ideal in Church and State, the motive for the Ecclesiastical and Political Hierarchies, has been in all ages to govern men professedly for their own good. The Secret Doctrine teaches man to govern himself. So long as Hierarchies subordinate all things to the real benefit of man, and give Light and Knowledge to all in such measure as they are capa- ble of receiving, they are' a blessing and not a curse. When, however, the Potentate suppresses Knowl- edge, claims power by Divine Right, or by inherit- ance, rather than by proof of knowledge and by service done to man ; when ignorance or disbelief is punished as a crime and men torture the body, or agonize the mind under that devil's plea — \"to save the Soul\" — then does the Hierarchy become an enemy of both God and Man."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 2il Neither Political nor Religious Hierarchy has ever existed for any great length of time in the outer world without becoming corrupt. The continuance of power in such cases must always depend on the ignorance of the people; therefore, the Hierarchy will resist to the utmost the spread of true enlighten- ment. It is for this reason that for many centuries the Secret Doctrine and all of its students or ex- pounders have been under ban of the Church, and of the State, whenever Ecclesiasticism has been able to form an alliance therewith. Persecution in every form, for opinions' sake, is ever the sign-manual of worldliness and irreligion. It is the rule of Might against Right, and the trampling under foot of the weak and helpless by the strong and powerful ; and to complete the blasphemy, and monument the cruelty, such persecution is generally enacted \"in the name of the Lord.\" The Altars of Masonry have ever been the Beacon-Lights of Liberty; and the Lodge a City of Refuge; a Sanctuary of Knowledge and Protection to the way-faring Brother of all Nations and tongues.

The traditions of Masonry in later times exclude v»^man from participating in the work of the Lodge, but not from all the rights and benefits of the Craft. The reasons that have led to the exclusion of women need not here be discussed. A sufficient answer to all advocates of Androgynous Masonry may be found in the history of all attempts to establish or to revive it. Each and all have failed, and have gen- erally proved fruitful of discord and scandal. Nor is woman either the loser or the most to blame for this result.

Every true Mason for centuries has thus been a Soldier of the Truth, fighting for its Altars and its Fires. In this work of the Lodge woman could have been of no service. While every true Mason is the most loyal of men to every office of woman, as Mother, Sister, Daughter and Wife; as Companion, Friend, and Inspirer of man, he would have been trammeled by her presence in the Lodge, and she would have re- ceived no benefit by being admitted.

Masonry resumes its prerogative as Teacher and Enlightener of mankind, and the Philosophy of Nature and of Life are unfolded in its Schools and Colleges as with the Maji of old, and when with no fear of persecution from time- serving Potentate or Creed-ridden Priest, the Light may shine for all, then will the doors of real initia- tion be as open to woman as to man, as was the case in the schools of Pythagoras as shown by lamlichus. The Ancient Wisdom concerned itself largely with the Souls of men, and undertook to elevate the earthly life by purifying the Soul and exalting its"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"214 Mystic Masonry. Ideals. It teaches that souls are sexless; and that the sex of the body is an incident of gestation. No civilization known to man has ever risen to any great heights, or long maintained its supremacy, that debased woman. Indeed, the Secret Doctrine demonstrates with unmistakable clearness that sex- ual debasement in any form is the highway to de- generacy and destruction of both man and woman; and of Nations quite as certainly as of individuals. The most debased and horrible chapters in human history are recorded in scientific works by medical experts. Atavism is here exemplified as nowhere else. Here, more than anywhere else within the possible experience of man, lies the \"Sin against the Holy Ghost;\" for through this open door, through which rush the most unholy passions and the hellish fires of lust, it is possible for man to lose his human soul and descend to the animals. If any one doubts this, let him read — if he can — some of the scientific medical works on Sex-perverts, and then consult the attendant physicians of the insane and the symptoms and records of Lunacy. \"The first lesson we are taught in Masonry is to be good men and true.\" And the frst declaration made by the neophite in Masonry is that he comes to the Lodge to \"learn to subdue his passions, and"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 215 improve himself in Masonry,\" i. e., to engage in the building of a fit temple for an indwelling soul. It may thus be seen that all the traditions and usages of Masonry agree fully with the philosophy of the Secret Doctrine as to true Initiation, and that both are justified by all experience, by all his- tory, and by all scientific discovery and advancement up to date. These ancient institutions, derided, anathematized, misrepresented, persecuted, and sup- pressed, as they have been for the last fifteen hun- dred years, will, in the age that is now dawning, demonstrate their beneficence and their power; and the marvel will be, that the ignorance and brutality of man could have so long succeeded in suppressing them. It is true, even yet, that among otherwise intelligent persons the majority do not believe that any such Fountain of Knowledge has ever existed. They are looking alone to the future, and waiting, and they hail with delight every new discovery in science for the betterment of man. It will be for all such the greatest of all discoveries that \"to go back to Plato is to make progress,\" and that the Egyp- tian, Chaldean, and Hindoo Mysteries had, ages ago, exhausted all philosophies, apprehended all sciences, and recorded their priceless treasures of wisdom in glyph and allegory for the benefit of the latest gen-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"2i6 Mystic Masonry. erations of the human race. By and by, even our scientists will, like weary and disappointed children, become tired in trying to do it all over again by themselves, and then they will no longer turn a deaf ear to the Immortal, though silent, Voices of the Past. But how, some one may ask, were the Ancients, even before the dawn of what we call his- tory, enabled to make such transcendent discoveries ? If, in the preceding chapter, the present author has succeeded in presenting even a faint outline of the meaning of the word Master, and what Initiation really accomplishes, the inquirer will not have far to seek for an answer to his question. The Secret Doctrine declares that it is the result, not of the vain guesses, or the tortuous investigations of igno- rant men, but of the recorded and carefully tested experiences of generation after generation of trained Adepts and Perfect Masters, the Advance-guards of Humanity in every age. Things are not true be- cause they are old, but old because they are true. Immortality belongs to Truth and not to error. A thing is not true because God hath said it, or is sup- posed to have said it; God said it because it is true; and the whole manifestation of Nature is thus the UTTERED WORD OF DIVINITY. The Master who is at-one with both Nature and Divinity discerns the"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The Secret Doctrine. 217 truth, and teaches and records it for all future gen- erations of men. But it is only in an age of free- dom and enlightenment that the voice of the Master can be heard ; but it should be ever remembered that the sole authority of the Master is in the Truth ; and not the authority of Truth in the Master. Just here lies the distinction between Religion and Super- stition. The masses will ever seek a sign, but the one only sign of the Master is his service to human- ity. \"He who can best work and best agree\" is called a Master. Service and Harmony : these are the sign-manuals of the real Initiate. The Ignorant may worship as a god him who can produce signs and wonders, and when weary of worship return to wallow in the mire, forgetful of the miracle. Hence the real Masters in all ages have avoided publicity — \"gone into a mountain apart\" — and shunned the applause of men, preferring to be despised and slandered rather than have the truth ignored, and be themselves glorified of men."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"2i8 Mystic Masonry. CHAPTER VIII. THE GREAT LODGE. The profound secrecy surrounding the Ancient Mysteries, and the obligation of secrecy imposed upon every initiate into the Masonic Fraternity arise from many causes, and varying conditions, some of which have already been pointed out. In times of political oppression and ecclesiastical persecution it became necessary to conceal the identity of all mem- bers of secret fraternities; and, as far as possible, the principles of the order were also concealed for mutual protection. When to be known as a Mason or an Occultist was to be hunted down like a crim- inal, to be imprisoned for life, or perhaps to be tor- tured and burned, men naturally concealed their connection with the Lx)dge, or their interest in the Secret Doctrine. There is probably no degree in Masonry today that has not been invaded by mem- bers of religious orders like the Jesuits. Those who are familiar with the principles of these Sodalities are well aware that under the plea that \"the end"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 219 justifies the means,\" no member of these bodies would hesitate to take any obligation imposed, in order to possess himself of a coveted secret that might support the power and maintain the preroga- tive of his Sodality, knowing in advance that abso- lution for the crime of perjury in violating his sacred obligation would not only be assured him, but that he would be applauded and perhaps canonized for his zeal and his devotion to religion, as many a Saint in the calendar has been canonized in the past upon far less \"Saintly\" grounds. In the face of all so-called exposures, and all be- trayal, Masonry pursues the even tenor of its way, and tyles its lodges as carefully, and inculcates its obligation of secrecy just as though apostacy were impossible, and perjury a crime unknown to the code of civilized communities. Notwithstanding all so-called exposures, it would be exceeding hazard- ous for any one, except a regularly initiated Brother, to attempt to gain admission to the Lodge; and no possible motive can be assigned why any honest man should desire to receive the rites and benefits of the Lodge except in the order and under the con- ditions prescribed. But after all other reasons as- signed for the secrecy of the Lodge, probably the tradition that such was always the rule in the mys-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"220 Mystic Masonry. teries, has had more to do with concealment than anything else; and the real reason for concealment in the mysteries has been herein previously shown to be on account of the power that attaches to the real knowledge possessed by the Master. The pen- alties imposed for violating the solemn obhgations voluntarily taken, may, at times, have been literally executed by the agents of the Lodge in medieval or pre-Christian times ; but in modern times these awful penalties have undoubtedly been substituted by \"the excration of all honest men and Masons.\" In gen- uine initiations into the really occult mysteries, the penalties for unworthiness in any and all directions consisted in the apostate becoming the victim of the powers he had himself invoked. He had created a Frankenstein which he was no longer able to con- trol, and it destroyed him. Hence, the warning was true and necessary, but the real method of its exe- cution was disguised, except that it was portrayed as terrible. Too little is known as yet in the West of genuine occultism, to make further explanation in- telligible. All space, and every plane of nature is full of Life and Intelligence, and Bulwer's \"Demon of the Threshold\" may be neither a joke nor a ro- mance, as many cases of obscession recorded in the annals of Medicine and Spiritualism abundantly"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 221 prove. The \"Principalities and Powers of the Air,\" of which the Apostle speaks, and of which the Kabalah treats very fully, are the Elementals de- scribed) though but blindly, in ancient occult litera- ture. When the real nature of obscession is under- stood, and the character of these depraved entities becomes known, it will be discerned how little is to be gained, and how much is to be risked by invok- ing them. Here lies the reason why mediumship should be discouraged and regarded as a disease, or, at besit, a misfortune. Real Seership is a very dif- ferent thing indeed from obscession in any form. If Seership be compared to the Ecstacy of an inno- cent and happy child, obscession may be likened to the delirium of drunkenness or madness. Some idea may be gained, perhaps, from the foregoing of the source arid character of the penalty for the violation of obligations assumed by .the Neophite in the mysteries. In the \"Mystery of Cloomber,\" Conan Doyle portrays the \"idea,\" but makes the execution of the penalty at once fantastic, horrible, and impossible. No real Master, even such as he portrays, could ever play the bungling part of executioner, such as he depicts, but would leave the criminal to the snares and devices of his"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"222 Mystic Masonry. own creation. The imagination of the noveHst can hardly supply the philosophy of true occultism. The stories that have come down to us of the magnificent pageantry, and the almost superhuman trials attending initiation into the Mysteries, from those of ancient Egypt down to Tom Moore's Epi- curean, all pertained to the various degrees of the Lesser Mysteries. The secrets of the Greater Mys- teries were never written or told. What they were can only be surmised from a complete philosophical knowledge of what initiation really means, and some idea as to what the last supreme revelation may be. This has probably never been betrayed in any indi- vidual case, nor is it likely that it will ever be re- vealed, because, as shown in the preceding chapters, it is the meeting face to face with one's own god; the Higher Self, latent in every man, but now wholly revealed. It concerns the things \"impossible to utter,\" of St. Paul, an Initiate. The philosophy of the whole process may, however, be fairly appre- hended as the consummation of the Higher Evolu- tion of Man. Thus philosophy, for him who can understand it, takes the place of the whole of the instruction of the Lesser Mysteries, except such practical experience and final training of the neo- phite as enable him to enter the Greater Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 223 So far as mere teaching is concerned, or the appre- hension of what is to be done, and how, philosophy is the teacher, and is better fitted to the present in- tellectual age than any other form of instruction. When a genuine School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity is established, worthy and well-qualified neophites will doubtless receive not only instruction, but practical training. Hitherto in this work hints, outlines, suggestions, and running comments or relations only have been given; and every intelligent reader must have ob- served the difficulty of describing that which was never intended to be revealed. We may now undertake to give a diagram or a picture of an idea running through all history like a theme in a musical composition. The idea crops out here and there in history, but it is not history for reasons already made clear. The full-page diagram (see Frontispiece) is a Symbol of the Se- cret Doctrine, and some of its principal ramifica- tions and seats. Like all symbols, it is not the thing symbolized ; and, as already declared, it is not a his- tory of the Great Lodge and the Secret Doctrine. If it should by and by be shown that the Great Lodge, historically, had its first seat in Egypt, or in Ethiopia, which is possible, instead of in Old India,"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"224 Mystic Masonry. or in Ireland, which is not impossible, or on the Con- tinent of Atlantis, which is more likely still, it would not make any difference with our diagram, which, as already repeatedly declared, is not designed to represent history, but the influence of an Idea upon the Civilizations and Religions of the world. When the true and complete history of what are called the British Druids is written, the legends of the now \"Unhappy Emerald Island\" will be deciphered, and the beautiful legend of Venus rising from the Foam of the Sea will not be the most grand or beautiful of Ireland's stories. On the scientific presumption that eveiy effect must have had an adequate cause, we have the right to assume that the Landmarks of Masonry, and the traditions of the Secret Doctrine, are not without foundation in fact. Furthermore: the further back we go in history, and beyond history, the grander become the monuments of the Secret Science. Pythagoras and Plato found all their knowledge ready-made in the Egyptian and Baby- lonian Mysteries. The deeper we delve into the past the grander become these Ancient Monuments.

Precious ore crops out here and there, and is again concealed; it grows richer as we proceed, till the conviction becomes irresistible that deep in the bowels of the earth, or beneath some mountain range, there must be a great \"pocket,\" the real source of all this buried treasure. The analogy is complete, and the reason- ing scientific. But if the ancient monuments on the physical plane are unimpeachable, and those in the heavens unapproachable, they are still more tran- scendent in the Intellectual and Spiritual realms. There is not a religion, a science, or a philosophy, known to man, that cannot be traced back to Old India; with this difference, however, that we have only the fragments, the broken columns, or the disjointed images of a complete and perfect struc- ture as it once existed. The oldest books or written records known to us today, such as The Egyptian Ritual of the Dead, and the hymns of the Vedas, have scarcely yet been spelled out by their letters. Such translations as have been given us are both superficial and literal, and the inner meaning, always expressed in symbols, seldom appears at all."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"226 Mystic Masonry. The interpretation that has heretofore been put upon them by Philologists, few of whom can rank as Symbologists, and not one of whom in Europe is a real Occultist, is that they are the crude imagin- ings of a primitive people who knew nothing of sci- ence, and who were devoted to superstition. Ihese translators have achieved fame as \"Great Oriental- ists,\" and they have undoubtedly done a great work in introducing ancient languages to modern times, and in doing their best to interpret ancient beUef, but in nearly all instances these orientalists have been biased by the traditions and false lights of modern Christendom. In another chapter of this work it has been shown what infinite pains has been taken by ignorant Monks, and by zealous Eccle- siastics, to obliterate these ancient records, and to deface them by interpolations and forgeries in order that the Christian records and traditions might stand unchallenged. The beat of our Orientalists are, even unconsciously, influenced by the results tliat have been thus achieved. When Western students are capable of apprehending, and ready to receive the true interpretation of the ancient symboHsm, it is possible that native scholars who not only know Sanskrit, but who are thoroughly familiar with the Secret Doctrine, may be found to enlighten them."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 227 Take a single instance. The Atomic Theory, known to have been more or less familiar to certain ancient Greek writers, has made great progress in Modern science. But in no form conceived by Modern science — and the forms have been many and contradictory, has this theory proved competent to account for all of the phenomena observed. It has remained for us, therefore, still an Hypothesis and not a Law. The Atoms of Modern Science, whether conceived as solid, fluidic, gaseous, or etheric, — for they have been imagined to be all of these — are, nevertheless, regarded as dead atoms. Even when conceived as mere neutral centers, or \"mathematical points,\" they are still far removed from Life or Intelligence. Leibnitz conceived them as Monads, each a living mirror of the Universe, every Monad reflecting every other. \"Compare these views,\" says a modern writer, \"with that in certain Sanskrit Slokas translated by Sir William Jones, in which it is said that the creative source of the Divine Mind.\" . . . \"Hidden in a veil of thick darkness, formed mirrors of the atoms of the world, and cast reflection from its own face on every atom.\" When we have learned more of Radiant Matter, and the Roentgen Ray, we shall have come"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"228 Mystic Masonry. far nearer this old Atomic Theory, and Matter will no longer be regarded as \"dead and inert.\" The Hymns of the Vedas were doubtless the original allegorical form of the Secret Doctrine, and the Rishis — called \"gods,\" but really Sublime and Perfect Masters — were their creators. Antedating the Vedas, then, was the Great Lodge of Adepts, who created the Religion, inspired the Civilization, and taught the profound Science that made old India great. If only traditions and broken monuments remain, these still outrank all modern achievements of man. The ancient government was Patriarchal; the Ruler was also a Master Initiate, and the people were regarded as his children. In those ancient days a Reigning Prince considered it not beneath his dignity to go into the desert alone, and sit at the feet of some inspired recluse, in order that he might receive more light, which he would again dispense to his people. Instead of teaching superstition and idolatry, when the real meaning of the Vedic symbolism is revealed, it will, perhaps, be found to be the thinnest veil ever imposed between the Sublime Wisdom and the apprehension of men. The old gods were the symbolical or personified at- tributes of Nature, through which man was taught to apprehend the existence of the Supreme Spirit."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 229 This was not Polytheism, nor Idolatry, but a system of teaching that which could not be altogether de- fined, and of pointing to that which must forever remain unknown, and Unknowable, by the aid of symbol, parable, and allegory. No word-painting known to man seems half so beautiful as some of these ancient parables and allegories. Not only was every oblation of love and duty portrayed, and every joy of home and affection illustrated, and the most common duties of life, feats of valor, devotion, and self-sacrifice depicted, but in a language so musical, and in rhythm and meter so perfect, as to make the whole recital more like a symphony than a poem. The whole composition was a mantram. On nearly every page of the Anugita it is said — ^in relation to this or that — \"they relate this ancient story, in the form of a dialogue, which occurred\" — so and so. If India today is like an old woman in her dotage, and her Priests have turned Harpies to devour her remaining spiritual life, the record of primeval greatness can never be dimmed or destroyed.

Power came not from the people, but from the possession of supreme knowledge, and this knowledge, continually exercised and exemplified, was the badge of office and the sign of authority. To such a Priesthood the people rendered most will- ing obedience. The doors of Initiation were open to all who had evolved the capacity to \"Know, to Dare, to Do, and to Keep Silent,\" in regard to that which should not be prematurely revealed. With the light of the Great Lodge standing in the midst, the Religion of the people was a perfect rep- resentative of Science and Philosophy, in which superstition and idolatry found no place, hence the symmetry in our diagram of the old Wisdom-Reli- gion. The religion of India being thus inspired by the Great Lodge was expressed in the Hymns of the Vedas. This was the old Brahmanism, the Religion of Brahm; the Father-Mother of All. But in time the Priesthood became corrupt ; the people forsook the ancient worship. Then came Chrisna, and later Buddha, to restore that which was lost. The Brahmins, now no longer \"twice- born,\" but a priestly caste, jealous of power, since they were no longer real Masters, arose in rebellion,"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 231 and the mission of Buddha largely failed in India, and found its principal converts in Ceylon, in dis- tant lands, and the isles of the sea. The religions of Egypt and Chaldea had back of them the same Secret Doctrine, or Mysteries; and they were also both Scientific and Philosophical. But Egypt and Chaldea repeated the folly of India, and perished with the degradation of their religions. Traditions of the Secret Doctrine still existed, and Masters like Hermes, Zoroaster, Confucius, and Laotse appeared in different lands from time to time to revive the old religion under new names, and often under a different form of symbolism. Pythag- oras and the Schools of the Persian Maji for many centuries kept the true light burning. The conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, as already referred to, com- pleted the ruin of the land of the Pharaohs, and Pythagoras and Plato became the links between the old philosophy and the Christian Era, together with the Jewish Kabalah, derived jointly from the Mys- teries of Egypt and Chaldea, though more largely, perJiaps, from the latter. From the Essenes, the Schools of Alexandria, then in all their glory, from the Kabalaih and the philoso- phy of Plato, the Christian mysteries were derived.

The Religion of Jesus was in every respect that of the Mysteries; it was the same old Wisdom- Re- ligion, though the ethical features were more pro- nounced, as being most needed among what was called \"a generation of vipers,\" and a \"stiff-necked and rebellious people.\" The ethical teachings of Jesus in time give place to Priestcraft and Sacerdo- talism; to worldly power, and conquest; and the re- ligion of Constantine was finally replaced by the \"Holy Inquisition,\" a religion of torture and blood- shed. The Sufis, among the conquering Mohammedans, knew the Secret Science, but their power paled in the presence of the \"Sword of the Prophet.\" Freemasonry, though not a lineal descendant of the ancient mysteries, may justly be regarded as a connecting link between the ancient wisdom and modern times. While imitating many of the ancient rites and ceremonies, and preserving many of the ancient landmarks, and transmitting to modern times a Grand Ideal, Masonry stands as one of the great- est benefactors of the present age. If it has pre- served only the broken fragments of ancient gran-"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 233 deur, it has, nevertheless, cherished and honored these as a priceless inheritance. Will Masons really undertake the noble and glorious work of rebuilding the City and Temple of the Lord? Will they unite to restore the primeval wisdom and glory? Will they search diligently among the rubbish for the \"Stone that the Builders rejected,\" * and for the \"Lost Word of the Master\" ? Alas ! who can say ? There is another link to our chain of evidence and line of transmission. The grips, signs, and passwords, by which a Mason recognizes a Brother, pertain to the Lesser Mysteries. The real Master knows his fellows by other signs. It has been else- where shown that the true Adept is both clairvoyant and clairaudient. There is a magnetic atmosphere, or radiation, around every human being, and, in- deed, something of the kind around every animal and every inanimate object. Every one feels this magnetic aura when coming in contact with others, even though they may see nothing, and may often be unconscious of its effects. This atmosphere of the individual is the source of what is called \"Sym- pathy,\" and \"Antipathy;\" or attraction, and repul- sion. It is not imaginary, but real. It is the focal- \"See Plate IX."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"234 Mystic Masonry, ized result of individual character, and contains all the potencies and qualities of the individual's life. It is composed of matter, is magnetic, has a definite mode of motion, and definite color. It may be ab- sorbed by or transmitted to another. The vibrations incident to it are the co-ordinate result of the com- bined and varying activities of the Priaiciples in man. The Key-note in every individual is thus de- termined as a scientific fact in matter. In the sen- sualist, and in all who are degraded by passion and selfishness, the color of this aura is red, like the oomb of a cock; and the sensation which it pro- duces upon the sensitive and pure is often described as hot and stifling. In an individual who is unselfish and pure-minded, the color may alternate between a golden yellow and blue, and the effect described by the sensitive is that it is cool, restful, and inspiring. If the foregoing is true, and it is easily verified, and if a real Master is able to see all of these con- ditions which are usually invisible to others, he would hardly need to depend upon \"grips, signs, or passwords\" to recognize a Fellow. Man betrays his character, his heredity, his ideals, and all his past life in every lineament of his face, in the con- tour and pose of his body, in his gait, in his hand- writing, in the lines in his hand, in the tones of his"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The Great Lodge. 235 voice, in the expression of the eye ; in short, no man possesses character. Character is that which he al- together is, and not something apart from himself. One need not be a Master to discover all this; he needs only to observe, to think, and to reason on what he sees. In even the ordinary walks of life the Artist, the Musician, the Mechanic, all recog- nize their fellows by signs that are familiar and un- failing. It can hardly be imagined that in the higher science, and in the case of the deeper student or Adept, the signs of character should be less pro- nounced or less plain, or that the Adept, possessed of far finer senses and a wider range of knowledge, should fail in interpreting them. The individual who is really sincere and devout will not fail to recognize sincerity and true devotion in an acquaint- ance or in any character in history that possessed these virtues. Hence it is that the Student of the Sacred Science or Occultism, though not himself an Adept, learns to recognize by unfailing signs those in the present or in the past who really know the true wisdom. Its signs and symbols are not the stolen Shibboleths by which the real student can be betrayed.

Even the crim- inal classes have their dialects or patois. History is full of pretenders in Occultism. Pre- tension alone is a sign of ignorance, and the proposi- tion to \"sell the truth\" is always a sign of fraud. There are, however, many names in history that have been covered with obloquy, and their possessors charged with fraud and imposition, who were, never- theless, genuine Adepts, if not Perfect Masters. We must distinguish between self-conviction that comes from the pretender's own mouth and those accusations that come from others and are unsup- ported by evidence. The pretender is often loaded with honors and found rolling in wealth, as the re- ward of deceit and lying, of fraud and corruption, which he is shrewd enough to conceal. On the other hand, the real Master is often gibbeted by the popu- lace and anathematized by the church, because he is neither time-serving nor willing to barter the truth for gold. All along the line of history may be found those \"Nvho possessed the true light.

The ignorance of the rabble, the zeal of the superstitious, and the \"Vicegerent of God\" have often made sad inroads among the servants of the Great Lodge; yet they have never been altogether exterminated; they have alvv^ays existed to bear wit- ness; and they exist today! If the reader is ready to deny all this, of course it can make no difference to the real Adept, and it is certainly a matter of in- difference to the present v^riter. One can do no more than to state, candidly what he believes, and to set forth that which he knows to be true. These Adepts, or Masters, have, in every age, constituted the Great Lodge. Whether they con- gregate beneath vaulted domes, or meet at stated times, no one would be likely to know unless he be- longed to the same degree; but one thing is very certain, and that is, that they bring help and knowl- edge to the world when most needed, and they are working thus today in the West as they have not done before for many weary centuries. They are enabled to work now, because the ground has been prepared for them by \"one who knew,\" and who served them to the death, in the face of scorn and slander.

Aside from unusual astronomical con- junctions, many perturbations in spact;, earthquakes, cyclones, and tidal waves, there are also predicted great social upheavals, political changes, and both mental and physical epidemics. In other words, as is already apparent to all who read the signs of the times, the present is a transition period, and what- ever influences are to mold the coming century must begin their operations at the present time. This is therefore the seed-time, and the harvest will be by and by. Note — Many references in literature might be ad- duced giving accounts of the existence of the Great Lodge. Two of these may here be mentioned, viz., that given in the Life of Apollonius Tyanseus of his visit to the Adepts of India, and the account of Fla- mel and the Adepts in an old book called Hermippus Redivivus, by Campbell. The present object is, how- ever, rather to unfold a philosophy than to gather facts; to explain what a Master may be, rather than to point out their abodes."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 239 CHAPTER IX. AN OUTLINE OF SYMBOLISM. A man standing by a horizontally revolving w^heel might be taken as a symbol of every vessel made of clay, whether for honor or dishonor. Every detail of ornament or of shape might hold a legend, an allegory, or a parable ; or indicate a use ; but the Potter at his wheel vv^ould be a universal and all- including symbol; a pictorial expression of creative thought in man. The Chinese written-language is nothing more than symbolical writing, each of its several thousand letters being a symbol. This pic- torial expression of an idea or a thought, this Art- speech, is Symbolism. When the symbols are of familiar things, and as various as human experience, the knowledge conveyed is common. When the symbols are few and simple, whether commonplace or grotesque, like a point, a circle or a square, or a dragon, or a man with horns, the knowledge con- veyed is not for the masses, but for him alone who holds the key. Take the following simple series : a"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"240 Mystic Masonry. point • , a circle O, a point within a circle O; the circle horizontally divided 0; the lower half again divided Q ; the upper half divided ©; a cross within the circle ©; the cross alone -i — I — -; and we have the series emanating from the point and the circle. If, now, any process in Nature can be found to un- fold in the same orderly manner, then any one of the series of symbols would be found to symbol- ize a definite stage in the process of nature. Hence, the meaning of the symbol would expand, just in proportion as one's knowledge of the natural process increased. If nature's planes are seven, and each plane sevenfold, there would come to be groups of symbols pertaining to each plane, and a key to each group. Take, for example, the symbol ©. Aside from the philosophical meaning as the third in the series (OO ©) of Mother-Nature within Infinitude, it represents a universal law of proportion, and the exact mathematical ratio of the circumference to its diameter throughout nature; applicable ahke to the circle of a pinhead or a sun. Here then would be a symbol in Mathematics or Geometry, correlating Space and Time with Form and Proportion, Such a symbol would, however, have little meaning ex- cept to the philosopher or the Mathematician. To the latter the Greek tt, or the proportion i :3i4i59,"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 241 or to the Kabalistic 113:355, would at once recall the original symbol and the whole series. If, in ad- dition, our Mathematician knew the different ratios of vibration incident to the three planes of evolu- tion represented by OO©, he would have 'the key to occult physics, and could forecast results, mea- sure effects, and induce changes beyond the ordi- nary plane of crude matter. The simple series to which I have referred will illustrate the whole science of symbolism. Added to this science of Symbolism there is an Archaic Art-Speech, by the use of which a double meaning is given to language, so that the most ordi- nary form of speech may be used to convey a deep scientific or philosophical meaning. This gives rise to the allegory and parable, the outer form of which may convey to the ignorant a lesson in ethics, and to the learned a principle in science. The most complicated form of this symbolism and Art-Speech known to modern times is, perhaps, the Jewish Kabalah, from which most of the glyphs of Free- masonry are derived. The object of the present work is not to explain all these symbols, for that would require a volume of symbolism, and have but little value when written except to the curious. Perhaps the most familiar symbol of a Mason is"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"242 Mystic Masonry. the Square and Compass, found in every Lodge, and worn as a badge of fraternal recognition. We are told in tihe Lodge that the Square is an instrument with which the practical Mason measures and lays out his work, but we as free and accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of squaring our conduct with the golden rule, with principles of right and justice, etc. So also with the Compass ; the practical use is made symbolical of the higher moral obligation, to cir- cumscribe our desires and keep our passions within due bounds. But Masonry is \"a system of Morals illustrated by Symbols,\" and something more; and there is hence a science and a philosophy concealed in the symbolism of the square and compass. This may be outHned as follows: The Square with its one right angle and its scale of measurements ap- plies to surfaces and solids, and deals with the ap- parently fixed states of matter. It represents soli- darity, symmetry and proportion; and this involves the sciences of arithmetic and geometry. The Com- pass with movable angle set in the Lodge at an angle of 60°, applies to the circle and the sphere; to movements and revolutions. In a general sense, the square is a symbol of matter, and the earth ; the Compass, of Spirit and the heavens. In the Lodge"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 243 the square and compass cross each other, and this fact is made a symbol of progression, from the de- gree of Entered Appreiaticeship to that of Master. The compass is set at an angle of 60'', and is repre- sentative of the movements of Spirit, and, if crossed nt a certain distance from the angle, will produce an equilateral triangle ; the three angles and the three sides equal, it now represents perfect equili- brium, or proportion.* \"For the Apprentice, the points of the compass are beneath the Square. For the Fellowcraft, one is above and one beneath. For the Master, both are dominant, and have rule, control and empire over the symbol of the earthly and material. t If the reader now refers to what was said in a pre- vious chapter concerning the descent of Spirit into matter, and the First Trinity represented by a tri- angle ; Matter, Force and Spirit (Law); and in Man — Manas, Buddhi and Atma; he will readily see that the compass may fairly represent this primary trinity, concealed under the square of matter, till by progression it emerges, and finally, in the Master's hands, gains dominion over matter. In the man of *Radius of circle and chord of arc equal. t Morals and Dogma, p. 854."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"244 Mystic Masonry. ignorance (sin), the spirit is concealed, and the body and its passions hold dominion. This is the state of the Neophite, or Entered-Apprentice. In the Fellowcraft's degree, the symbols are interlaced; and in the Master's, Matter is subordinated to Spirit. The lectures on the several degrees explain the method by which the Compass (Spirit) may gain dominion over the Square (body and passion) through the greater activity of Spirit, \"in circum- scribing our desires, and keeping our passions within due bounds.\" The perfect equilibrium of spirit and matter is symbolized by the six-pointed star,* which is again only another form of the Square and Compass, each now having a base-line from which to form a triangle. Inclose the star in a circle, which symbolizes Infinity, and you symbol- ize the harmoay, or at-one-ment of the Spirit that descended, and the body, now purified, with Divin- ity, or the Over-Soul. Place within the Star thus inclosed the Egyptian emblem of Life, ^ , and we symbolize Immortality, as the result of regeneration. Transform the circle into a serpent and it now sym- boHzes Wisdom, as the crown or result of equilib- rium; and is also a double glyph of the return of 'See plate VII."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 245 matter to its source in spirit. Separate the tongue and tail of the serpent by a Thor's Hammer, or Svastica, inclosed within a circle, and it symbolizes regeneration through conquest of animal sense, pre- cisely as taught in the Lodge, under the spiritual meaning of the symbol of the Compass. \"Freemasonry is the subjugation of the Human that is in man, by the Divine; the conquest of the Appetites and Passions, by the Moral Sense and Reason; a continual effort, struggle, and warfare of the Spiritual against the Material and Sensual. That victory, when it has been achieved and se- cured, and the conqueror may rest upon his shield and wear the well-earned laurels, is the True Holy Empire.\" The Masonic Apron made of lambskin symbol- izes innocence or purity, the condition required of candidates in all real initiation.* The shape of the apron is that of a perfect square surmounted by a triangle. We have here the three and the four, making seven; the triangle representing spirit, the square representing matter ; the triangle represent- ing the threefold aittributes of the One ; the square representing the four elements. As spirit, the trian- »See Plate XII."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"246 Mystic Masonry. gle represents, or is symbolized by, heat, light and flame. The Entered Apprentice starts on his career with the triangle surmounting the square (spirit has not yet descended into matter). As he progresses the descent takes place, and we have the triangle in the square, as heretofore illustrated; and finally as a Master the ascent of the square into the triangle begins, which every Master Mason will understand. Masonry being a \"progressive science,\" the progress of the neophite is thus made to conform to the process of evolution and the descent of spirit into matter, and this is illustrated by the manner in which he is taught to wear his apron in each degree in the Blue Lodge. The Entered Apprentice is not only a \"hewer of wood and a drawer of water,\" but he is a novice, taking his first instruction, and this is symbolized by his apron. The tradition of the Master's Word, of the power which its possession gives to the Master; the story of its loss and the search for its recovery; the tra- dition of the Ineffable Name in connection with the Lost Word, showing that it could not or should not be pronounced, except with bated breath ; or, as the Hindoo tradition declares, \"with the hand covering the mouth.\" The symbolism of the three greater"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 247 and three lesser lights, and the play made in many places on the word Light itself, in conjunction with the Lost Word, all these references and uses con- stitute a complicated Symbolism working in and toward a common center or glyph, which, taken in conjunction with the building and restoration of the Temple, constitute the secret Symbolism of Ma- sonry, and illustrate the whole process of Initiation. What real initiation is has been outlined in a pre- vious chapter. These symbols, when correctly in- terpreted, serve two purposes. First: they reveal a complete philosophy of the Creation of the Uni- verse and of Man, unfolding all essences, powers, and potencies, and their mutual relations and cor- relations. Second: they unfold the process of Ini- tiation as synonymous with the uninterrupted evo- lution of man guided by knowledge and design along the lines of least resistance. In the third degree the candidate impersonates Hiram, who has been shown to be identical with the Christos of the Greeks, and with the Sun-Gods of all other nations. The supe- riority of Masonry at this point over all exoteric ReHgions consists in this: All these religions take the symbol for the thing symbolized. Christ was originally like the Father. Now He is made iden-"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"248 Mystic Masonry. tical with the Father.* In deifying Jesus the whole of humanity is bereft of Christos as an eternal potency within every human soul, a latent Christ in every man. In thus deifying one man, they have orphaned the whole of humanity ! On the other hand. Masonry, in making every candidate personify Hiram, has preserved the original teaching, which is a universal glyph. Few candidates may be aware that Hiram whom they have represented and per- sonified is ideally and precisely the same as Christ. Yet such is undoubtedly the case. This old philos- ophy shows what Christ as a glyph means, and how the Christ-state results from real Initiation, or from the evolution of the human into the Divine. Regeneration is thus given a meaning that is both apprehensible and attainable; both philosophical and scientific; and at once ideal and practical. In the Tetragrammaton, or four-lettered name of Deity, the Greek followers of Pythagoras found a glyph by which they both expressed and concealed their philosophy, and it is the Hebrew tetrad ihvh, or \"Yod, he, vau, he,\" that is introduced into Masonry *Here lies the true meaning of Abiff, \"of, or from my Father.\" Ii.iram.=Christos, and ABiFF=:\"at one with the Father,\" i. e., \"of,\" or \"from.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 249 with the Pythagorean art speech. The devout Hebrew, in reading the sacred Text, when he came to the tetrad ihvh, substituted the word Adonai (Lord), and if the word was written with the points of Alhim, he called it Elohom. This custom is pre- served in Masonry by giving the candidate a substi- tute for the Master's Word. The Hebrew tetrad \"Yod, he, vau, he,\" is produced by repeating the \"he.\" The root word is a triad, and the quater- nary is undoubtedly a blind. The Sacred word is found in the mysteries as a binary, a trinary, and a quaternary ; as with the Hindoos we have the om, and the aum^ indicating different methods of pro- nouncing the Sacred name. The Pythagorean Tet- raktys is represented by numbers, i, 2, 3, 4=10, and by points or \"Yods\" in the form of a trian- gle;* this is called the \"lesser tetraktys,\" while a triangle composed of eight rows in the same form and containing thirty-six \"Yods,\" or points, is called the \"greater Tetraktys.\" This corresponds to the three lesser lights, and three greater lights of the Blue Lodge, though the monitorial explanations in the lodge are, to say the least, incomplete. In the Pythagorean philosophy both the lesser and greater *See Plates V and VIII."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"250 Mystic Masonry. tetraktys are represented by equilateral triangles, and the points, in either case, form the angles of a series of lesser triangles. In the lesser tetraktys these triangles are altogether nine, or three times three. In the greater they count fo/rty-nine, or seven times seven ; and in each case the series runs, from apex to base, i, 3, 5, for the lesser, and i, 3, 5» 7> 9, iij I3» ^or the greater tetraktys, or by a series of odd numbers; v^^hile the points, before the triangles are formed, run consecutively, i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \"7, 8. These symbols v^^ere thus used as \"odd\" and \"even,\" to carry a philosophical meaning, and to illustrate the doctrine of Emanation. In the Pythagorean system Spirit is everywhere represented as the Universal. \"All multitude must necessarily issue from One,\" and that one is Spirit. AH emanations and subdivisons must therefore be related to the One by absolute geometry (perfect forms) and absolute mathematics (perfect numbers and movements).

In the Pythagorean Triangle, or tetrad (see Plate V), this same philosophy is symbolized.

The triangle series is of odd numbers; the square even. The ten \"Yods\" occupy all the upright triangle divisions.\" (Quoted, with plate, from print by Fred. G. Plummer.) This Pythagorean method of \"philosophizing ac- cording to numbers\" has not only fallen into disuse in modern times, but has often been deemed alto- gether fanciful and been subject to ridicule, simply because the philosophy upon which it is based is lost. It originally constituted the Art-Speech, or glyphs, in which that philosophy was expressed, and to understand the one is to recover the other.

The Adept knew the relations between the movements (vibrations) that produce thought, those that produce form, those that produce color, and those that produce light and sound, and the number of these in each case. The source of all these is a Trinity ; the form of emanation a septenary. Hence the play upon the formula \"three times three\" and \"seven times seven.\" The first postulate of this philosophy has been shown in a previous chapter to be Abstract Space, and Abstract, absolute Motion; and this absolute motion is that of the Primordial Atoms, thus constituting \"the center which is every- where and the circumference which is nowhere;\" i. e., fills all space. It is necessary, however, to re- mind the reader that these \"Atoms\" are not those of modern Science, or those that compose what we call Matter, for the reason that they are, one and all, endowed (potentially) with Consciousness, Life, and Intelligence, and are equally world- builders and man-builders. They are the vehicles and the basis of all Law in Nature. They form alike the moving panorama of thought and the tides of the restless sea: The beating of the human heart, and the revolutions of Suns and Solar Systems ; the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"An Outline of Symbolism. 253 breath of an infant, and the \"Breath of Brahm.\" There is universal and eternal Unity and Equilib- rium in the midst of universal diversity; Perpetual Involution of Spirit or essence, and endless evolu- tion of form and variety; and back of all, the One Eternal Principle, unknown and forever unknown- able, without beginning, without end, without change. Space is the mantle that forever conceals Him. Abstract, absolute Motion is his Fiat. Crea- tion is His Logos, Word, Speech, Expression, Will, Thought — call it what you will. Man is a \"Spark\" from this \"Flame,\" and, in the last analysis, as in- comprehensible to himself as God. This Spark of Divinity in man is his consciousness, and this in a previous chapter we have postulated as a fact, nothing more. This brings us to the origin of the Tetraktys, the origin of the Ineffable Name, the Lost Word. The Hebrews seem to have derived their Tetraktys from the Chaldo-Egyptian Mysteries, and these may be traced to the Zoroastrian Fire Philosophy, till finally the Word is A . •. U . •. M . •.

Consider the expressions, \"The Lord is a consuming fire;\" \"Since God is Ught, and never but in unapproached Light dweh from eternity,\" etc. The symbol is found in all Scriptures, but only in the Mysteries was the meaning thus symbolized made known. Here, then, is the origin of all the trinities found in Masonry, the plainest of which are the trinities of Light, and the most superficial ex- planations are found connected with the three lesser Lights of the Lodge. \"The Primitive Holy Symbol, composed of three letters, in which the Vedic Triad is comprehended, ought to be kept secret like another Triple Veda.

The legend of the Lost Word and the Potency o£ the Ineffable Name are inseparable. They are the glyphs of Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained; or of the Fall and the Redemption of man. So also is the legend of re-building the temple, a glyph of Initiation, which is the same as Regeneration and Evolution. This ancient Wisdom belongs in a special sense to Masonry, for it has done most of any organiza- tion of modern times to preserve the ancient land- marks, and has honored and protected the sacred symbols. If Masonry has made only a superficial use of these hoary secrets, and their deeper meaning is still unknown to the craft, it is equally unknown to all others, except as the result of genuine initia- tion. One may know that a thing exists, where it is to be found, and that it is above all price, without knowing, to the last analysis, what it is. Such is the secret to the Lost Word, or the Ineffable Name. Its secret lies in exact vibrations under mathemat- ical and synchronous relations; and its Law is Equilibrium, or Eternal Harmony."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"256 Mystic Masonry, CHAPTER X. CONCLUSION. The foregoing pages can justly be called frag- ments only of the Secret Doctrine and of the Sym- bols of Freemasonry. A systematic treatise on either of these subjects would necessarily include the other. The Secret Doctrine is the complete Philosophy of Masonic Symbolism. So long as this philosophy is unknown to the Mason, his symbols are, to a great extent, dead letters, the work of the lodge a dumb show beyond its moral precepts, and the Genius of Masonry for the members of the Craft is largely the spirit of self-interest, mutual support, and physical enjoyment or revelry, the latest embodiment of which is the \"Mystic Shrine.\" But there are some among the members of the Craft — and how many time alone can determine — who believe that Masonry means far more than this, and who have already discerned in its symbols and traditions something of their real meaning. Many of these have found partial clues which served to keep interest alive while searching for plainer mean-"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Conclusion. 257 ings and deeper revelations. In retracing the steps by which these ancient symbols and their profound philosophy have come down to our own time, more and more obscured with every passing century, stu- dents have gathered a large number of facts, a great mass of traditions and general information, all of which have been variously interpreted by different writers on Masonry. All writers, however, agree in the conclusion that the symbols and traditions of Freemasonry come from the far East, and go back to the remotest antiquity. So that the saying that the Mason journeys from Wesrt: to East in search of light is literally true. This search is not one incited by curious interest only. If Masonry possesses merely a mass of curious myths and meaningless symbols, of what real value is it to any one to trace them down? What real benefit can it be to any one to demonstrate that five or ten thousand years ago the same curious myths' and meaningless symbols existed in the Mysteries of Egypt, or were taught by Pythagoras and the followers of Zoroaster? Such, however, is not the genius of Freemasonry. The real secrets of Masonry lie concealed in its Symbols, and these, constituting as they do a Pic- ture Language, or Art Speech, are made to carry a"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"258 Mystic Masonry. complete philosophy of the existence and relations of Deity, Nature, and Man. . The average Mason, taking the symbols for the things symbolized, and knowing nothing of the profound philosophy upon which they rest, is incredulous that it ever existed, and so he treads the \"burning sands\" in search of a novel sensation or a new joke. As mere pastimes these jovial entertainments are neither better nor worse than many others. They represent one ex- treme into which the Ancient Wisdom has degener- ated. Let every intelligent Mason reflect on the sublimity and sanctity of the ceremonies in some of the degrees, where the name of Deity is invoked, where the highest moral precepts are inculcated, and where the purest and most exalted ethics are taught, and then let him ask himself the question, whether it is consistent and devoid of hypocrisy to round all this with a roaring farce ? Does not such a course tend to make all sacred things also a mere matter of form, a jest and a byword? Every Mason is familiar with this extreme and with the extent to which these recent innovations and associations have been carried, and the present writer is by no means the first to protest against it, however ungraciously his protest may be received or unpopular this work may be. Let every intelligent"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Conclusion. 259 Mason admit, merely for the sake of the argument, that there is another extreme. Suppose it to be true and easily demonstrable, that the Symbols of Ma- sonry embody and were originally designed to con- vey the most profound Wisdom, and that these sym- bols stand unchanged through all the ages, and are the means by which that wisdom may at any time be recovered by him who can find their true mean- ing. Masonry is, in a special sense, the custodian of these symbols, and it is its most common tradition that these and the Ancient Landmarks are to be preserved unaltered. This is the plainest and most logical deduction from the whole spirit of Masonry. These custodians are, in the highest degrees, called Princes of the Royal Secret — Nay, Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret ! What a farce, what pretense, if there is no Royal Secret. Reflect a moment, good reader, ancf especially good Brother Mason. What is the most sacred treasure, the most lasting pos- session of man? Is it not knowledge?

But suppose our people were all swept away, like many an ancient Civilization or Lost Em- pire; or suppose that all else remained, and we -lost our store of knowledge, all Arts, all Sciences, and that our whole people were reduced to the condition of our North American Indians; half a century, then, would destroy all we have so laboriously wrought out, and we might pitch our wigwams in weed-grown streets, or amid crumbling ruins. What we have imagined of our own is but the history of other civilizations. The howling wastes of Gobi conceal, we are told, the remains of a civihzation for outranking our own, and beneath the ocean's bed lie entombed the records and the monuments of man. Our most lasting possession is knowledge; and when this is swept away, desolation only re- mains. Bro. Pike says that the real secrets of Ma- sonry, the philosophy concealed in its Symbols, are far older than the Vedas, and are at least ten thou- sand years old, and that the Art-Speech, which Symbolism is, was designed by real Princes of the Royal Secret, by Prince Adepts, or Perfect Mas- ters, to conceal, preserve, and convey this Ancient Wisdom to the latest generations of men: That when Civilizations decayed, when Empires ceased"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Conclusion. 261 to be, and when desolation brooded in silence over a whole continent, a \"Rock beside the Water,\" or a symbol trans-planted to another land might serve to convey the lost secret to another people and time. Knowing the course of Empire and the inevitable destiny of Races of man, these Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret, by wise forethought, determined that nothing should be lost. Such is the heritage of Masonry, and Bro. Pike proves this beyond all controversy by excerpts from the sacred books of all Religions, and by the most learned and painstaking investigation. The value of such investigations does not consist in proving the great antiquity of the Symbols of Freemasonry, for this is an easy task, and no one with the shghtest knowledge of the sub- ject dare dispute it, for the symbols are found on the oldest monuments, and described in the oldest records known to man. A far more difficult under- taking, the results of which are beyond all else valu- able, is the effort to determine exactly what these symbols mean. If they were the precipitated re- sults of profound knowledge, the very fruitage of all past civilizations, some of which transcended all we have yet achieved in the West, then to correctly interpret them, means the recovery of all past knowledge, in substance, if not in detail. This is"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"262 Mystic Masonry. precisely the interpretation and the value that should be put upon such results. This result is the recovery of the Lost Word of the Master, and the Symbol of that Word is the A. U. M. of the Persian Magi and the most Ancient Brahman, because, back of that tri-literal glyph lies the Philosophy of the Secret Doctrine, the Synthesis of all Knowledge. Let any Prince of the Royal Secret examine the evidence and judge for himself. If, instead of doing this, he prefers to sneer at these statements, and to ridicule the whole subject, while he still boasts the title of Prince Adept, he stands as three men once stood near the coast of Joppa, self-convicted by the imprecations of his own mouth. The present re- vival of Philosophy in the West ought to bring about the restoration of this old wisdom. While it cannot interfere with the Masonic organization in the least, or seek to reveal any of its ceremonies, grips, or passwords, by which -the secrets of Masonry may be obtained unlawfully, it must give the largest credit to the fidelity with which the Symbols and Ancient Landmarks have been preserved by the or- ganization of Freemasons, and seek the co-operation of all earnest and true Masons in the recovery of the Lost Word, and in promulgating this sublime philosophy for the benefit of the whole human race."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Conclusion. 263 There is an old occult maxim which declares that \"Nothing is concealed from him who knows.\" No Mason is bound to conceal that w,hich he has never learned in the Lodge. All else he receives as he learns anything, places his own estimate upon its value, and becomes individually responsible for its use. It must be a matter of conscience, and be weighed in the balance of duty, and everyone must abide by the result. If Masonry has lost the Royal Secret, or if it never possessed it, or if it was wrenched away in the very name of Religion little more than a century ago, all the same, it belongs to the Craft as the Heir-apparent of the Old Wisdom. But the time has come when no cable-tow can bind it. It now belongs to Humanity equally with the Mason. To this end has it been preserved through- out the centuries. What a future lies before Masonry should it de- termine to enter into its birthright to possess it. Thoroughly organized as it is, and counting its membership by tens of thousands, rehabilitated in its ancient wisdom, it may become an irresistible force in shaping the present civilization, and in influencing the future destiny of Man.

Of all the achievements of Classic Greece nothing is so well remembered today as the school of Pythagoras, and the Philosophy of Plato, and these but embody and were founded upon the Royal Secret of every Prince Adept Mason. To restore the Royal Secret would be a work, which, when completed, would be to our present humanity what the supporting Columns are to the Lodge : Wisdom, Strength and Beauty. (Knowledge, Power and Harmony.) It would introduce new methods, and motives, and new ideals into modern education, and give us in a few generations other Platos. If we create the conditions the results are sure to follow. Here hes the reward for all the trials and persecutions to which Masons have been subjected in the past. Here we may build the monument of all its Heroes and Martyrs. We may so build that seeing it they would rejoice that they suffered to the end. Bacon dreamed of a great \"Instauration,\" a recovery of knowledge, and possession of wisdom from Inductive Philosophy alone; but on such lines it must be forever a dream.

Of course it is in the province of Masonry to elect, if it chooses, that its symbols shall have only a superficial meaning in the Lodge. It may admit that it has adopted from the ancient mysteries the glyphs and parables that once served to embody and convey the most complete and profound philos- ophy, and, while adopting these symbols and the ancient art-speech, confine their use and interpreta- tion to such lessons of equity, morality, and frater- nity, as are to be found in all exoteric religions. The author of this book would be the last to ignore or to belittle the value of ethical or moral precepts. But these are the basis of conduct, not the crown of existence; the beginning, not the end if wisdom, Man'-s \"general infancy,\" as Browning puts it, only begins when his code of ethics is complete, and when he is perfected as man.

They have generally failed because of sectarian bias, which dwarfed their vision and narrowed the ancient Wisdom Religion to the bounds of a modern creed, while the genius of the ancient wisdom is universal and all-inclusive. To deny or to ignore any but the most superficial view is to adopt such conclusions as those arrived at by the Astronomer Royal of Scot- land, who makes of the Coffer in the King's chamber of the great pyramid of Ghezeh, only \"a corn-bin !\" It is to profane the holy vessels, and at last to ma- terialize all spiritual things. It may justly be doubted whether any man for the past century and a half has done so much toward restoring Masonry to its birthright as Grand Master Albert Pike. His writings are a mine of wealth too little known to the great majority of Masons. The recent Jesuit- ical attack on his memory is not only a palpable and sensational lie, but it should serve to arouse every Prince of the Royal Secret to a deeper knowledge of the value of Bro. Pike's work.

If Masons will but pass from refreshment to labor and unite in rebuilding the City and Temple of the Lord of Truth, recover the Lost Word, and rehabilitate the ancient Wisdom, she may paraphrase the saying of Macaulay in his essay on Barere, and apply it to all her enemies : \"We therefore like his invectives againsit us much better than anything else he has vi^ritten. ...

To demonstrate through this philosophy and its use, illustrations, dramatic representations and symbolism, that the \"Work of the Lodge\" constitutes a Great School oj Instruction for its candidates and Praters, in the real meaning of life, and the basic principles of human con- duct, so as to secure the highest and most noble results ever revealed to man: To render absurd and illogical any other inference from the references to, and all that we know of, the real Masters of the past, and the Schools, and the \"Greater Mysteries\" of antiquity. Masonry seems to have embodied, crystallized, pre- served and adapted to the present age, these Jewels of all the past, divested of all extraneous or irrelevant matters."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"270 Mystic Masonry. This is the meaning of the Perfect Ashlar. The author was well aware that but few Masons realized what a treasure-house of Jewels they possessed, and that some, perhaps, would regard such a claim as absurd, and al- together fanciful. He was also aware that there are thousands of Brother Masons who believe that there must be far deeper truths, and more valuable treasures, concealed, than are revealed, or generally apprehended, if they only knew where to search, and how to discover them; for he has heard this statement oft repeated by Brothers, young and old. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how any intelligent and thoughtful man can go through the dramatic and monitorial Initiation of the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, and come to any other conclusion. To justify this logical inference, encourage the in- telligent search for the Royal Secret, and assist in the Recovery of the Lost Word was the original and only motive of \"Mystic Masonry\". The author has been a Mason nearly half a century and aside from the study of Masonry, its sources, symbol- ism and essential meaning, has been able to check and verify these great truths from another source, viz., the study of man, and especially from the study of Psychology.

From the \"first breath\", often so anxiously looked for and evoked, of the little one, that \"Out from the shore of the Great Unknown, Comes weeping and wailing, and all alone\" — to the last breath of the aged just crossing the Great Divide, the physician is present, often nearer than any other, and vigilant, observing, solicitous, and full of deep reflection. It Is his office to try to understand, in order that he may apply and utilize then, and there- after. It may seem to some a startling and unwarranted statement, that the most profound truths of Psychology, [the building of Character, and self-control which more than all else safeguards against disease, paresis, premature senility and insanity,] are all embodied in the very foun- dations of Freemasonry. But this is the simple truth. To illustrate and verify here would be out of place, but it is a thesis easily demonstrated. Masonry embodies a Science of Ethics, of human conduct and character, found scarcely anywhere else; and more than half of all our diseases come from lack of self-control and from selfish indulgence. Every Mason knows, and I am writing principally for Brother Masons, that this government, of which, in spite of all its faults, we are so justly proud, was in- spired and founded mostly by men who were Masons."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"272 \\Mystic Masonry. The \"truths\" that were \"self-evident\", and the \"rights\" that were \"inalienable\", were perceived in and by those founders as derived from Masonry. They were trans- planted directly from Masonry to the \"Declaration\", and the \"Constitution\", though we have not yet alto- gether realized them. This is why Albert Pike and others have called Masonry the \"Great Republic\". They tried to define the Eminent Domain, the \"Re- served Right\" of every Individual, every Citizen, to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. These In- alienable Rights were founded on \"Self-evident Truths\". Before a candidate takes the slightest obligation in Masonry, and as the premise of every obligation taken, he is given the unqualified assurance that no obligation required of him shall interfere with any duty he owes to God, to his Country, to his neighbor, or himself; and he alone is to be the Judge of these duties. These are his \"Inalienable Rights\"; his \"recognized Duties; his Eminent Domain. Enlarged and elaborated, defined and codified, here is our \"Declaration of Independence\", our \"Constitution of a Free People\", and It is the Genius of Freemasonry pure and simple. It is impossible to enslave either the body, mind or soul of man while these principles and declarations are strictly and logically ad- hered to. Nor were the founders of this Government \"Of the People, by the People, for the People\" either in ignorance or in doubt as to the danger point, for they proceeded to forever separate Church and State, as far as"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Postscript to the Fifth Edition. 273 possible. The Government was to be a State affair, with which the Church had, officially, nothing to do what- soever. Rome declares in America today, that Church and State shall be united as one; and that one shall be the Church. I hereby challenge every Freemason in America today to Take Notice of this Sign and Summons. To the profound Philosophy of Life, and the stores of Ancient Wisdom to which it was the original design of this little book to call attention, there is now added an imminent duty of Citizenship, for which the Freemason ought to be better prepared and more strongly obligated than any other, for the simple reason that these duties and obligations are taught, ingrained, and illustrated in the School of Masonry, specifically and concisely as no where else in the world today. This is why Rome hates, vilifies and anathematizes Masonry continually, relentlessly and eternally. There can be no compromise. Shall it be Church, or State, to rule in this \"Free Country\"? It cannot possibly be both. Rome today is the most powerful and ambi- tious Political Autocracy on earth, and she already holds the Balance of Power in America! I have said nothing here of the Religious department of the Roman Hierarchy. That is \"another story\". The Mason who is untrue to the basic principles of Masonry, can be nothing less than a Traitor to his Country. There can be no middle ground, no compromise."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"274 Mystic Masonry. If the more than two million Masons in the United States today, would do their duty, as did that handful of men and Masons who signed our Declaration of In- dependence, we should have a bloodless revolution, and the Italian Cardinals who run the Politics of the Roman Church would \"get out of politics\", so far as America is concerned; while the Catholic religion would have the same rights and benefits here as any other; no more, no less. Of what value or use is the Wisdom of the Ages if we fail to put its principles in practice, or to utilize its pro- found lessons running through the whole history of man? Every just and Upright Mason ought to know and to realize what he stands for, why he is a Mason, and that while his freedom is reserved, his \"inalienable rights\" were secured by sacrifice, and can only be preserved by conscientious regard and discharge of duty. \"Eternal vigilance is the price of Liberty\". The greatest enemy of the Republic today is the man who stupidly or indifferently says, \"There is no danger\". This is the strongest asset of the enemy of all our Liber- ties.

They are all \"censored\". \"Mother Church\" and \"The Party\" are political slogans, pure and simple; built for \"graft\", and founded on greed, equally unscrupulous and menacing.

The facts are scarcely outlined. The fear and the danger are that Masons will continue to ignore, belittle or evade them. The present point of attack is our Free Public Schools, the very foundation of all our Free Institutions; and the Parochial Schools are fast gaining ground. The most hopeful sign is the Resolution recently passed by the National Teachers Association, unanimously pro- testing against any division of the School fund, for any Sectarian body whatsoever. Nothing is easier than to demonstrate that the Prin- ciples which Masonry so clearly defines and upon which the Lodge Is built, constitute the Magna Charta of this Government, and were thence derived. These prin- ciples are the pure gold of ethics and the conduct of life, both individual and associate, from the melting pot of all human history, and the wisdom of all ages. This is why \"Mother Church\", that is, the sixty-odd Italian Cardinals, arrogant, ambitious, relentless, vin- dictive, hate Masonry, misrepresent it, and continually anathematize it, and would destroy it if they could, as they have murdered its votaries in the past. Masonr>' stands squarely across their path; stands for the exact opposite of all their political ambition covets and would gain at any cost to mankind; for with them, \"the end justifies the means\".

In Canada today the citizens are trying to undo the work of Popery and Jesuitism in the Public Schools, shake off the blight of Priestcraft and regain their Liber- ties. Read the Canadian papers and see, for they are not all censored. Of what value is a knowledge of history if we are never to profit by its bitter lessons and admonitions? Of what value is a knowledge of the basic principles that underlie all individual and social life, if we are not ready to utilize them, live by them, and, if need be, fight for them and die for them, as did the Fathers of this Republic? I can only speak and act as one man, already entered on his \"fourth score\" of years, and a Mason for nearly fifty years. In many countries today, I would pay the forfeit of life, for these utterances; and in this country six deliberate attempts within the year have been made to assassinate one of my Masonic Comrades engaged in the same cause. So far as publicity and our open \"Declaration\" are concerned in this country, we have not yet made a beginning. But so far as the enemy of all our Free Institutions is concerned, scarcely a department of our Government, or one of our Safeguards of Freedom exists that is not by them already undermined.

In \"Mystic Masonry\" I have tried to give a glimpse of the Jewels of Wisdom, the Crown Jewels of every high civilization that has ever existed, inspired by their sages and wisest Masters. Year by year my convictions have deepened, the glory and beauty become more and more transcendent, and the outlook more uplifting on the Journey of Life. Scarcely a proposition herein contained, drawn from Philosophy and Symbolism, and justified by analogy and rational sequence, that has not since been confirmed by Natural Science, and reaffirmed by the author of \"The Great Work\".

A score of times I said to the Beloved Comrade, \"I am waiting for the Man\", and one day I found him.

Good men and women seem so often discouraged and bewildered over the experiences of life. To the ever- lasting question, \"What does it all mean?\" often comes the discouraged, and discouraging answer, \"Nobody knows\". How to adjust the vicissitudes of life, and to utilize its varying experiences, so as to become Master of the results upon ourselves, that is the Royal Secret, the Great Work. Facing, as we must. Principalities and Powers, things present, and things to come, and Life and Death, and yet to remain serene, steadfast, and full of good cheer, is the Great Secret. Does this not imply a mental atti- tude — a way of looking at things — a method of living — an assurance that we are on the right path — and a con- viction that all is well, and the goal secure? Masonry is a Great School, designed and qualified to educate every initiate in just this Science of Life. What else is the meaning of the \"Instructive Tongue, the Listening Ear and the Faithful Breast\"? What else can it be to be \"made a Mason in the heart''? Is not that an expression of reality and sincerity? What else can the expression — \"By being a Man'\\ mean? Certainly not"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Postscript to the Fifth Edition. 279 a coward, a slave, a fanatic, or an imbecile. Test the noblest characters of all time by these principles and these standards and see if they are not revealed. This is the Great School of Masonry coming down through the ages, whether one student in a thousand Graduates, and \"makes good\", or not. The \"Infallible\" Pope says we are \"Atheists\", and do not believe in God. He knows better. No man can pass to the Altar of Masonry who does not believe in God, as two million American Masons will testify. Freemasonry is aligned with Eternal Truth, Liberty, Charity and Fraternity, and it lies squarely across the pathv/ay of all who would enslave the human soul, and there it will stand so long as God is in the Heavens, and till Time shall be no more. Murder, as Rome has often tried to do, every Free- mason on earth today, and not one of its principles, its Priceless Jewels would be changed or lost. You might as well try to destroy the principles of Light, Electricity or Gravitation. One of the relics preserved for pious Catholics in the East, we are told, is a bottle containing \"the darkness that fell upon Egypt\". If his \"Infallible Holiness\" should look upon this bottle he would undoubtedly be- hold his own image reflected there, with his swarm of Italian Cardinals hovering like locusts in the background and his \"bottle of darkness\" would indeed prove a boom- erang."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"280 Mystic Masonry. What Egypt was in its glory, when the Great Masters instituted its Paternal Government, and built the \"Rock beside the Waters\", America may yet become if every Mason is true to his Landmarks and his traditions, and to the Fathers who instituted them here. What Egypt is today, America will become, a waste of sand and howling jackals, if the same Priestcraft and Paganism that triumphed there, are allowed here to destroy our Free Schools, and reunite Church and State. The issues are exceedingly plain, and as old as the human race on this earth. Since the \"Lost Word\" may be \"discovered\" in the \"Great Work\", the designs upon the trestleboard are restored for the first time in many a weary century. Only the Listening Ear, and the Faithful Breast are required. I, for one, have listened, examined the Jewel, and found the Mark. Fraternally, J. D. Buck.
