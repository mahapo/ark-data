There, almost nightly at the dinner table, my fa ther apprised us by example and conversation of what historians do. Sometimes, they electrified the past into life, so as to instill an educated passion for history among imaginative students or readers. Other times, when historians failed to kindle even a weak spark, they had to laugh off their student's foibles as a small detail of the larger human comedy of miscommunication. Most experienced classroo m teachers of history, after awhile, keep a mental file of student bloopers and whoppers as a counterweight to the pleasanter triumph of enthusiasm over ignorance. It has b een impossible, thus far in my career, for me to exceed my father's favorite short-answer reply once given by a 12 o'clock scholar on a final exam in modern Eur opean history. In this case, the class was asked to identify in a sentence or two the frequently referenced item from weekly lectures, \"Rosetta Stone.\" At th e critical moment to decide, the muses failed to show up for one forsaken and ill-prepared college examinee who, staring blankly at the page , desperately and creatively jotted down next to that monolithically puzzling pair of words in question, \"Napoleon's girl friend\"! Now housed in the British Museum in Lon don, the Rosetta Stone was unearthed in 1799 by a group of Napoleon's troops stat ioned along the west bank of the western mouth of the Nile. Students of history not only need to know how to define a major event, idea or term , but why it is important, how it is significant, and what are its consequences. Simply, the Rosetta Stone, a basalt stele (from the Greek term for a commemorative pi llar or inscribed cylinder) permitted the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics by Jean Franüois Champillion, the younger (1790-1832). He is regarded t oday as the founder of Egyptology. The Rosetta Stone sets down a decree com posed by priests assembled at Memphis who had a signal measure of political influence, for they were endorsing publicly the potentially doomed Ptolemy V Epiphanes (204-181 BCE). The message is chiseled in hieroglyphic and vern acular Egyptian as well as Greek."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Translating the Greek first, then working backwards, a small team of scholars discovered by the 1830s the solution to one of the oldest written languages in human history. The dramatic moment also gave birth in the modern west to a deep popular fascination with all things Egyptian, particularly as decorative motifs in public buildings. Nineteenth-century Jews in western Europe and the United States, for instance, showed a remarkable affinity for Egyptian symbolism, while more typical building structures of the pe riod derived clearly from Greco-Roman patterns. The American architect and Freemason William Strickland, a worthy successor to his teacher Benjamin Latrobe, also a Mason, designed Philadelphia's first large synagogue (M ikveh, Israel) which, surprisingly, had a front end sanctuary marked by a free adaptation of Egyptian ideas. Strickland's temple was dedicated in 1825. Another of Strickland's many significan t American buildings is the First Presbyterian Church (now called Do wntown Presbyterian Church) of Nashville, Tennessee, erected between 1849 and 1851. Fr om the outside it appears to be another routine Neo-classi cal building of right an gles and red brick, set between twin belfries. But the facade's details, such as the recessed columns and door frames, gently suggest an Egyptian influence. Once inside, however, there is no mistaking the architect's and subsequent remodelers ' readiness to depart from traditional Georgian styling. The interior walls and columns are vividly colored and decorated in Egyptianesque earthen hues and figures: serpent heads, zig-zags, stripes, lotus leaves , and papyrus capitals. (1) Although it was considered exotic to see such Egyptian revival ar chitecture on the American cityscape prior to the Civil War, by the 1880s Vi ctorian America acquired a taste not only for gingerbread lines and garish tracery fashioned in milled moldings or red sandstone but also a growing fondne ss for Egyptian architecture. One of the tallest steel-frame buildings in the nation's capital, which changed forever the District of Columbia's building code with regard to height restrictions, was put up in 1894 as a landmark, twelve-story hotel, named \"The Cairo,\" j ust a few blocks from the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. A more descriptive name for the building would have been \"The Casablanca\" as its design is an aberration of Moorish a nd Gothic artistry, but the association"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"with Egypt, if only in name, is noteworthy for its apparent cachet. As recently as 1995, a riverboat casino cal led the Empress in Joliet, Illinois, caught national attention as a commercial success, having suffered no loss of gamblers for its completely Egyptian theme and artifice. (2) Similarly, Memphis, Tennessee, is home to a convention arena named the Memphis Pyramid whose main portal is guarded by a massive statue of Pharaoh Ramses II. Further, it is hardly unplanned that the George Washington Masonic National Memorial in Alexandria, Virginia, replicates the architectural tour de force of early antiquity in Al exandria, Egypt, called the Pharos Lighthouse. Cultural historians believe that the occas ional popular attraction of a modified Egyptian building style found in a variety of public buildings is meant to be more than an entertaining novelt y. Rather, the unusual, non-Western architecture is, indeed, sometimes a seri ous statement that can be attributed broadly in an industrial age to a long desire for eternity. Certainly, the evocation of massive solemnity and ceremonial permanence appeals subliminally to the modern eye and offers a needed contrast to austere, merely functional buildings su ch as factories, warehouses, towering apartments, and government offices. Adding Egyptian features in 19th and 20th century American public architecture also expressed a refine d sense of mystery and intelligence, combined qualities of antiquity pack aged in fresh outlines. The Egyptian religious ideas which centered on human mortality and death, in particular, inspired similar modern impulses manifested expansively in American funerary preoccupations. Cemeteries all across America a century ago exploited vague Egyptian preferences in the construction of mausolea, sarcophagi, elaborate memorial marker s, and obelisk monuments.3 Then, of course, there is in our nation's capita l the Washington Monument, a towering obelisk immortalizing America's firs t President and foremost Freemason. While the late Renaissance hermetic traditions of Europe had already placed great stock in Egyptian wis dom and religion as an \"i mperfect harbinger\" of Christianity (controversial beliefs fo r which the Italian Dominican priest, Giordano Bruno, 1548-1600, was executed by th e Inquisition), the seeds for a modern Egyptian revival sprouted more generically in the Enlightenment's scientific curiosity about ancient esot eric religion and al legorical legends. Freemasonry was, consequently, one am ong several intellectual midwives to help deliver the rebirth of ancient Egypt into modernity. But only up to a point, which some Masonic Egyptophile s need to concede more strongly. According to architectural historian Ja mes Stevens Curl, reflecting on the rise"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"of Freemasonry in this Enlightenment context of turning toward the Nile's delta, \"a ceremonial setting using motif s from Ancient Egypt would seem to be logical, given Masonic belief in E gypt as the source of skill and wisdom, yet an Egyptianizing theme in Freemasonr y does not appear to have surfaced much before 1750.\"4 Egyptian features in the design of continental Masonic Lodges, notably in France and central Europe, evidenced themselves much more frequently than in British Masonr y. It was not uncommon that a French Master Mason's apron of 1801 includ ed, besides a token likeness of Napoleon, delineations of an Egyptian temple, obelisk and pyramid.5 A century later in Edinburgh, Scotland, a major exception to the predominantly continental expropriation of Egyptian imagery appeared with the opening of the Chap ter Room of the Supreme Grand Royal Arch Chapter in 1901. Therein, overt Egyptian decor was used for stunning effect. The Egyptian influence on French Freemasonry of the Napoleonic era, obviously connected with the Emperor's Egyptian campaign, coincides with the development of the Scottish Rite in America, conceived in dual terms as a hybrid of British and continental Masonic innovations. Extreme caution, however, needs to be exercised in assuming too much about the Egyptian role in Freemasonry as carried through the French connection and transmitted to American Blue Lodge and Scottish Rite Masonry. It is true that continental Freemasons, who included almost every major thinker of the Enlightenment, frequently saw their Lodges as Egyptian temples and sometimes themselves as an Egyptian priesthood. It is no ac cident that Mozart's The Magic Flute (1791), for example, the first major opera in German (to which Goethe wrote a sequel in 1795), is chock full of concurrent Masonic and Egyptian references. (6) Cornell University professor Martin Bernal omments that \"indeed, the Masonic admiration for Egypt has survived the country's [Egypt's] fall from grace among academics [preferring the primacy of ancient Greece and Rome].\" (7) The Hall of Justice scene in the Scottish Rite's 31st Degree (in the Pike Ritual) represents more than a tepid tribute to Egyptian civilization. But it is also true that widespread hos tility to the concept of Egypt developed during the period of Romantic domina nce from 1790 to 1890. Egypt was, at best, relegated to the footnotes. He nry W. Coil speaks with sympathy in behalf of the deceiver Alessandro Cagliostro whose pseudo-Masonic Egyptian ritual was soundly repudia ted equally (and ironically) by both Roman Catholic officials and Freemasons : \"Masonic writers still kick the dead Lion by denouncing Cagliostro fo r representing the Egyptian Rite as Masonic, but they do not ma ke it clear what he did that had not been done by scores, perhaps hundreds, of degree fabricators on the Continent of Europe, some of w hose works still circulate as Masonic!\" (8) The wider tensions between competing western cultural sources, creating an imaginary blood rivalry between anci ent Greece and dynastic Egypt, made pyramids less fashionable with the rise of Romanticism. Keats's famous ode"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"is about a Grecian urn, not an Egyptian mummy. (9) Also, economic forces may have fueled the growing sense of cultural competition, because by the 1830s Egypt was probably ahead of all other nations in industrial capacity (i.e., textiles) except for England. (10) Against this sweeping ba ckground, from the shaping of broad cultural tastes by the Ro setta Stone's discovery to the metaphorical continuities linking ancient master bu ilders with modern Masonic Lodges, The Supreme Council's House of the Temple enters the picture. John Russell Pope, the Temple's 36-year-old archit ect, a devotee of classical and Beaux Arts arrangements, blended many Egyptian lines and details into his discerning plan. These are not the oddities that many Temple visitors at first presume as revealed by their most frequently asked question about the ornamentation and fixtures which project distinctively Egyptian se nsibilities. In other words, to paraphrase the early Christian writer Te rtullian, they ask, what do Athens and Jerusalem have to do with Memphis? Pope's praiseworthy attempt to recapitu late the Hellenistic temple-tomb of King Mausolos at Halicarnassos (on the coastline of modern Turkey) could hardly ignore the greatest funerary works known_the immutable, triumphal pyramids. The matched sphinxes flanki ng the entry, symbolizing power and wisdom, are obviously Egyptian, but the building's roof, obscured by the shallowness of the building site itself, is a stepped pyramidal structure. The 33 fluted Ionic columns that call to mind Greece are capped by a tiered pyramid that echoes Egypt, whereas the architect's other well-known classical monuments, such as the Jefferson Memo rial and the National Art Gallery in Washington, DC, are always finished with a spherical dome on top. In the House of the Temple, Pope's genius is not only for classical symmetr y, but also the balanced proportions o f mixed masses and incongruous details of Plato and Pharaoh. The Atrium is the boldest Egyptian com ponent of the building. The charcoal polish of the eight Doric columns made from Windsor granite signify the ponderous ambience of the hall, common to all Egyptian sacred structures. The lighting is deliberately subdued, also typical of Egyptia n interiors. The deep earth tones used to color the walls and adorn the friezes at the ceiling's edge are not Grecian, which would re quire a polychromatic scheme, but Egyptian. More than halfway to the vanishing point on the curved back wall of the Atrium, as bright natural light falls upon the cen tral stairway leading to the Temple Room, two Egyptian block statues in black stone guard the passage. (See inside front cover.) Such statuary depicting either seated gods or human s is thought by scholars to have been \"produced for afterlife use and the presentation of the deceased as a revered person.\" (11) It is also noteworthy that the importa nt hieroglyph for the Egyptian idea of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"cosmic order (maat) is always represented as a figure seated exactly as the two block statues appear in the Atrium . An arguable interpretation, therefore, is to view these two guards of the stairway as a th ree dimensional embodiment of maat. Furthermore, in locating the block stat ues at the foot of a staircase, the staircase itself takes on embellished si gnificance. It may represent to the viewer the raised platform upon wh ich Osiris (Egyptian ruler of the underworld, with whom the dead person is symbolically linked) sits or, alternatively, the staircas e may actually suggest a primordial return to the ascending place of creation. On the stair landing above, two bronze and alabaster lamps are crowned by three serene faces of Egyptian beauty. From that point, the upper portion of the Temple takes on the architectura l confidence of Imperial Rome. The dichotomy between two civi lizations of very early antiquity has often kept them apart even in the heterogeneous modern world as the romantic tragedy of Antony (the Occidental) and Cleo patra (the Oriental) suggestively prefigured. That he trans cended the genetic, artistic, and religious differences between eras and societies in successful , brilliant design in the House of the Temple is to John Russell Pope's lasting credit. But the Scottish Rite Masons for whom the House of the Temple was built originally are also responsible for me lding cultural diversities in so huge a symbol that today it stands as a major structure in America's capital city. The impetus to identify with Egypt and Greece simultaneously was not always popular. Together they mark a contrast of associations. Old Egypt represented life's harsh realities and dark uncertainty, while venerable Greece lived in the light of joyful possibility through its ga mes and dramas. The fact that Scottish Rite Masonry could hold in mind two often contradictory worlds is a remarkable achievement. Martin Bernal offers a congratulatory word because \"with some degree of sel f deprecation, Masons have maintained [an admiration for Egypt] until today, [which must be regarded] as an anomal y in a world where 'true' history is seen to have begun with the Greeks.\" (12) One cannot enter or depart the House of the Temple, Pope's classical restu dy of one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, without also passing by the shadows and traces of other ancient wonders from Egypt. The m ood of the pyramids of Giza or the inscrutable fascination of the sphinx ar e inescapable in such masterworks as the Scottish Rite's Washington, DC, hea dquarters. Nor can one fail to gain added appreciation for Napoleon's girl friend. * * * "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Notes: 1.

The furniture is made of Russian Walnut, with brown pigskin upholstery—enriched by a tooled laurel leaf pattern in black and gold. The floor is polished marble mosaic—tens of thousands of tiny cubes, each laid by hand. The floor is accented with a white marble border and with inlaid lines of bronze. In the wall openings on each side of the room are pairs of green granite columns, with bronze bases a nd capitals. The glass in the windows shades up from a deep orange at the bottom (where the light comes through the coils of bronze serpentine grilles) to a pale yellow at the top, allowing the light to stream in at full force. The windows serve as another symbol of the progressive search for more light. The hangings in each opening are of purple Italian velvet, edged with gold. Crowning the center of the window is the Double Eagle, the symbol of the Rite. The seats opposite the entrance designate the East. Here is the Sovereign Grand Commander's chair, under a canopy of Italian velvet. The canopy is lined with cream silk, and em broidered with the emblem of the Grand Commander.

In addition, gifts in this range to the House of the Temple Historic Preservation Foundati on, S.J., USA, are also recognized in the Alcove, which sits down the hall from the Executive Chamber. The Alcove, after more than three years of planning and construction, was completed in time to be dedicated during the 1993 Biennial Session. The challenge was to create an area so harmonious with style, quality, and significance to the House of the Temple th at it would appear to have always been there. This was accomplished by remaining faithful to the timeless and masterful design of John Russell Pope, the original architect of the House of the Temple. Pope also designed many other architectural masterpieces, including the Jefferson Memorial, National Archiv es, and National Gallery of Art in our nation's capital. In developing his original concept for the House of the Temple in 1911, Pope created a \"light well,\" located at mi ddle landing of the marble staircase leading from the Atrium to the Banquet Hall, in the heart of the building. A window covered by a bronze grid admitted pa rtial light through this opening. In 1944 and 1953, by special permission of the United States Congress, the remains of Sovereign Grand Commanders Albert Pike and, later, John Henry Cowles were placed in vaults to either side of the light well. Memorial busts of Pike and Cowles, each on a marble pe destal, were added at that time. In 1990, The Supreme Council, 33, decide d to enhance and utilize this area by"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"creating an exquisite memorial alcove as a place of special recognition for those whose gifts have advanced the work of th e Scottish Rite. At that time Brother John D. Melius, 33, artist of the \"Geo rge Washington Laying the Cornerstone of the United States Capitol,\" \"Georg e Washington's Inauguration as the 1st President of the United States,\" and \"Victory-World War II\" paintings, was selected to work closely with Br other Donald Hogan Misner, 32, KCCH, coordinating architect for the proposed Museum-Library addition to the House of the Temple, to ensure the architect ural harmony, struct ural integrity, and cost effectiveness of the Pillars of Charity Al cove. In order to utilize fully Pope's light well, Brother Melius suggest ed a stained-glass window as the centerpiece of the Alcove. The result of refining several proposed versions, the present window depicts the Scottish Rite Eagle with 33 beams of light radiating to an exterior view of the House of the Temple itself. The window was constructed by one of America's pr emier stained-glass companies, the Willet Stained Glass Studios of Philadelphia. Also, the magnificently detailed stone and woodwork of the entrance to the Pillars of Charity Alcove, as well as the Alcove's highly decorated walls and ceiling, are the meticulous work of Harold C. Vogel, one of the master carvers of the Washington National Cathedral. Th e left and right walls of the Alcove, for instance are inset with exquisite scale reproductions of the Alcove's signature Ionic column motif.

Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime, to the man of every creed. It has taught no doctrines. This Degree is chiefly devoted to TOLERATION; and it inculcates in the strongest manner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art, that a belief in the one True God, and a moral and virtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason.

If we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadows of St. Peter's at Rome, we should have been devout Catholics; born in the Jewish quarter of Aleppo.

And they certainly cannot be called ba d people. Misled, yes, and most really are the good natu red philanthropists helping th eir community, that we see outwardly. You see it is not required of initia tes to ascend any higher than that of the third degree Master Mason. They know there are another 30 degrees if one wished to continue, but the initiation process is a tediou s and drawn out affair (it might take a year to reach the third degree), which the participants, for the most part, are happy it's over with. For them it is good that they not conti nue. And that's just the way higher initiates, or adepts, like it. \"The Blue Degrees are but the court of portico( porch ) of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally mislead by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them....their true explication is reserved for the Adept, the Princes of Masonry.\" (32 nd & 33 rd degrees) General Albert Pike wrote those words in a work called: Morals and Dogma in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, 1871. At th e time his title was the Grand commander of the Supreme Council, of the Scottish Rite in Washington D.C. This book is revered by occult groups across the globe, and most masons have never read it, let alone understood it. If they did understand it, there's a good possi bility they would leav e the craft. It deals with the occult origins of the symbols, initiations, a nd rituals of Freemasonry. It is also a handbook for degree initiation, as it details them all up to the 33 rd degree, which was invented by Pike himself, some say in order to have a higher degree than the president, who ceremoniously receives the 32 nd degree if elected."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" From the first degree, and initiation, the Mason is urged mightily to \"seek the light!\". The average Mason is continually saying that he is \"seeking the light\" and will spend his entire life \"moving toward the light.\" Concerning this light that every mason is told to eagerly seek, Pike gives his answer; \" Lucifer , the Light-bearer! St range and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darkne ss! Lucifer the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the light, and with its splendors into lerable blinds feeble sensual, or selfish souls? Doubt it not!\" This is the task of the initi ate in all Occult groups. The in itiator shows the candidate his latent faculties, his dormant powers, and ini tiates him into their use. He explains or demonstrates to him how the candidate ma y awaken the static energy into dynamic power. To hide these damning truths at the very heart of the mystery Pike said ...the initiate is intentionally misled by false interpretations. Another esteemed Mas on put it this way: Freemasonry is a fraternity with in a fraternity....an outer or ganization concealing an inner Brotherhood of the elect...it is necessary to establish the existence of these two separate and yet interdependent orders, the one visible the other invisible. The visible society is a splendid camaraderie of 'free a nd accepted' men enjoined to devote themselves to ethical, educational, fraternal, patrioti c, and humanitarian concerns. The invisible society is a secret and most August fraternity whose me mbers are dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcannum arcandrum.

The seething energies of Lucife r are in his hands and before he may step upward, he must prove his ability to properly apply energy.\" [The Lost Key of Freemasonry, Manly P.

To them the true definition of occultism is the science of energy flow and energy relationships . Occult meditation is a means of consciously and purposefully directing energy from a rec ognized source to th e creation of some specific effect.

The average reader, ev en if he knew Latin, wouldn't grasp the significance of this statement. However, one look at this phrase would alert any Satanist that the contents within are Satanic. A Satanist would also understand immediately that all of Freemasonry is satanic. Former Illuminist-Satanist Doc Marqui s says this statement is a very typical one within Satani sm. Marquis says that this phrase is very dangerous within Satanism. The second a Satanist sees this phrase in Latin on Pike's book, he knows the material within is Satanic, without reading a word! \"Masonry makes no profession of Christianity.. but looks forward to the time when the labor of our ancient brethren shall be symbolized by the erection of a spiritual temple.. in which there shall be but one altar and one worship; one common altar of Ma sonry on which the Veda, Shatra, Sade, Zeda-Avesta, Koran and the Holy Bible shall at who's shrine the Hindu, the Persian, the Assyrian, the Chaldean, the Egyptian , the Chinese, the Mohammedan, the Jew and the Christian may kneel.\" [ \"The Kentucky Monitor\" Fellowcraft Degree p. 95 ] \".... the literal meaning (of the Bi ble) is for the vulgar only.\" [Albert Pike \"Digest of Mo rals and Dogma,\" p. 166 ] \"What is True to the philosopher, would not be truth, nor have the effect of truth, to the peasant.

Membership in the order was open only to Freemasons who had reached the 32nd degree of the Ancient and Ac cepted Scottish Rite or those who've attained the last degree of the York Rite , the thirteenth degr ee (Knight Templar). The Order of Nobles and Mystics have origin s which date back to the seventh century – apparently founded by a descendent of M ohammed. Author Michael Howard describes the Order's symbols. The symbol of the Order is a crescent moon, made from the claws of a Bengal tiger, engraved with a pyramid, an urn and a pent agram. The crescent is suspended from a scimitar and in the Order is a representation of the Universal Mother worshipped in ancient times as Isis. The horns of the cres cent point downwards because it represents the setting moon of the old faith at the risi ng of the Sun of the new religion of the brotherhood of humanity.

LaVey describes the Templars' ritual thus: The original Templars' rite of the Fifth de gree symbolically guided the candidate through the Devil's Pass in the mountains separating th e East from the West (the Yezidi domain). At the fork of the trail the ca ndidate would make an important decision: either to retain his present identity, or strike out on the Le ft-Hand Path to Shambhala, where he might dwell in Satan's household, having rejected th e foibles and hypocrisi es of the everyday world. A striking parallel to this rite is enacted within the mosques of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine , an order reserved for thirty-second degree Masons. The Nobles have gracefully removed themselves from any implication of heresy by referring to the place beyond the Devil's Pass as the domain where they might \"worship at the shrine of Islam.\" Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he embarks upon the Left Hand Path and chooses Hell in place of Heaven. ( The Satanic Rituals—Companion to the Satanic Bible , p. 21) Pretty powerful stuff for sure, and not what you would expect of the \"merry old men\" wearing \"fez-hats\" and tending to burn victims! One part of LaVey's interpretation I find interesting is the choice the candidate makes in following the \"Left-Hand Path of Shambhala\". In esoteric doctrin e the principle city of the underground world is Shambhala. In this subterranean kingdom presides an all-powerful and All-Seeing ruler – The King of the World. Some have called him Sanat Kumara , others, King Satan. (This may not be as far fetched as it seems. The Bible clearly states that Satan is the \"p rince\" and \"lord\" of this world – John 12: 31 & 14: 30, Eph. 6: 12, Luke 4: 6-7, and 2 Cor. 4: 4 – and in fact has dominion over this fallen world) This King of the World, according to Eastern tradition, has a rule and influence which st retches to the surface world by means of trusted emissaries who carry out specific tasks and duties – including a secret 8 million who carry out his tasks unbeknownst to us all. As we shall see, one such \"emissary\" had a considerable influence with Roosev elt's Secretary of Agriculture. Wallace's Occult Connections"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Many of Henry Wallace's ideas originated with his guru, the Russian mystic and artist Nicholas Roerich. He was an adventurer/occu ltist in the tradition of his peers Madame Blavatsky, and Aleister Crowley. Roerich sp ent many years travelling through Nepal and Tibet studying with the lamas in the Buddhist monasteries of those countries. Roerich was searching for the lost city of Shambhala. In esoteric circ les Shambhala is the home of the Ascended Masters, Secret Chiefs, or th e Great White Brotherhood – the hidden hand behind the formation and guidance of Freemas ons, the Sufis, the Knights Templars, the Rosicrucians, the Hermetic Order of the Go lden Dawn and the Theosophical Society – both Wallace and Roerich were members of the Theosophical Society, this is how Wallace met his Master. Roerich seems to have been an emmisary of sorts for the Great White Brotherhood – even bringing a mysterious stone to guide th e League of Nations on behalf of the Masters (according to legend, the 'Chintamani Stone' was believed to be a part of a magical meteorite from a solar system [probably Sirius] in the Orion constellation. This Chintamani Stone is sent wherever a spiritual mission vital to humanity is set up, and is returned when that mission is completed). A mysterious stone was indeed mentioned by Wallace in one of his typical \"Dear Guru\" letters to Roerich: \"And I have thought of the admonition `Await the Stone.' We await the Stone and we welcome you again to this gl orius land of destiny.\" Not surprisingly, occultists regard Roerich as the guiding hand behind the placement of America's Great Seal and the All-Seeing Eye, a nd matter-of-factly state that it was at Roerich's insistence that Wallace approach Roosevelt about fina lly printing the All-Seeing Eye on the dollar bill. Henry Wallace was well versed in occult knowle dge himself. In a letter to Roerich he stated, \"the search – whether it be for the lost wo rd of Masonry, or the Holy Chalice, or the potentialities of the age to come – is the one supremely worthwhile objective. All else is karmic duty. But surely everyone is a potential Galahad? So may we strive for the Chalice and the flame above it.\" The chalice he refers to, according to Michael Howard, is the Holy Grail, regarded by the Rosicrucia ns as a feminine sym bol for perfection, and 'the age to come' is the dawning of the Aquari an Age. This I agree wi th, and further, \"the age to come\" is synonymous with Aleister Crowley's \"New Age of Horus\" – a Roerich occult contemporary. It seems that Novus Ordo Seclorum and Annuit Coeptis (He has blessed our beginning) has even deeper occult meanings than were led to believe. Illuminist Conspiracy? Well, yes! These three \"wise men\" – by placing the reverse of the Great Seal on the dollar bill – succeeded in announcing to the world that America is on \"the path\", and is the world's best hope for the spiritual (occult) e volution of the planet. Considering how deep into the occult both Roosevelt and Wallace we re already – and Wallace's connections to Theosophy – they had to of known that the most esteemed Theosophist of her time, Alice Bailey, had already declared that the Aquarian Age had begun in 1932.

As for Roerich, he was only doing the Hierarc hy's bidding for he was also a channeler of the Ascended Master El Morya – a major av atar in the pantheon of Theosophy. Roerich, after his death, apparently succeded in join ing the Heirarchy, and has now become the occult equivalent of a cathol ic saint himself – an \"Asce nded Master.\" His messages are now channeled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and one such message was \"received\", ironically enough, on October 28, 1990 at The Roosevelt Hotel . ** * ** \"Symbolism is the language of the Myster ies...By symbols men have ever sought to communicate to each other those though ts which transcend the limitations of language...In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable.\" — Manly P.

( Freemasonry the Witchcraft Connection ) Theosophy Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, 1831-1891 heralded the dawn of the New Age Movement. Her occu lt works are the foundation for many occult fraternities. After writing monumental works such as Isis Unveiled , and The Secret Doctrine , the Theosophical Society(1875) was formed to spread her teachings worldwide. She claimed to receive her revelations from Secret Cheifs, or disembodied Ascended Masters, who claimed to be aiding humanity ev olve into a race of supermen. Freemasonry took notice and many soon claimed her to be an occult genious: \"The Secret Doctrine and Isis Unveiled are Mada me Blavatsky's gifts to humanity, and to thos e whose vision can pierce the menacing clouds of imminent disa ster it is no exaggeration to affirm that these writings are the most vital literary contribution to the modern wo rld.

The Theosophical Society had freemasons Henry Steel Olcott, George H. Felt appointed president and vice-pre sident respectfully. Among the early members were high rankin g masons Charles Sothern and Albert Pike (the most famous \"G rand Pontiff\" of them all). In 1907 Annie Besant became pr esident of the Theosophical Society. Besant earned the 33rd degree in Co-Masonry, an order that admits woman. Bl avatsky before her was also bestowed an 'honorary degree' in Co-Masonry. The beginnings of the modern New Age Movement began with search for their \"own\" messiah, as it were. Along with 33rd degree mason C.W.

Alice Bailey and husband Fo ster (32nd degree mason) continued to interlock the workin gs of Theosophy with the aims of Freemasonry.

Th e Hierarchy had blessed both their beginnings, her master said. O.T.O. The O.T.O. founded at the beginning of the 20 th century represents a reunification attemp t to incorporate the traditions of the Freemasonic, Rosicrucian and Illuminist movements of the 18 th and 19 th centuries, the crusadin g Knights Templars of the middle ages and early Christ ian Gnosticism and the Pagan Mystery Schools. The spiritual father of the OTO was Karl Kellner a wealthy Austrian paper chemist. Kellner was a student of Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and Eastern mysticism. He developed adhesive to form an Academia Masoni ca which would enable all Freemasons to become familiar with all existing Masonic degrees and systems. In 1895, Kellner decided that th e Academia Masonica should be called the 'Oriental Templar Order' . The occult inner circle of this Order (OTO) would be organized parallel to the highest degrees of the Memphis and Mi zraim Rites of Masonry, and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"would teach the esoteric Rosicruc ian doctrines of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, and Kellner 's 'Key' to Masonic symbolism. Possession of the various degr ees of Craft and High-Grade Freemasonry would be a prereq uisite for admission to the Inner Circle of OTO. Theodor Reuss, Kellner's partne r, was granted the charter to perform three systems of high -grade Freemasonry known as the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis of 97°, the Ancient Oriental Rite of Mizraim of 90° , and the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of 33°. With the incorporatio n of these rites, the Order was enabled to operate as a completely independent Masonic system. John Symonds, the official biogra pher of Aleister Crowley, tells us that \"the letters of O.T.O. stand for Ordo Templi Orientis or Order of the Templars, an occult society which was founded in Germany at the beginning of this century. Its leaders were well-known Grand Masters of Masonry, such as Franz Hartmann, Heinrich Klein, and Karl Kellner. They had decided to found the O.T.O after the Vienne se Karl Kellner had returned from an extensive tour in the Ea st (where he had been initiated by the Arab fakir, Soliman be n Aifa, and the Indian yogis, Bhima Sen Pratap and Sri Mahatma Agamya Guru Paramahamsa) and had expounded the mysteries of yoga and the left-hand path which he ca lled 'sexual magic'. Thus, in 1902, the Ordo Templi Orientis was constituted for an inner circle of adepts who, in the light of this new and exciting knowledge, found the Ancient an d Accepted Scottish Rite of masonry rather tame, and the ninety-seven degrees of the tiresome Rite of Memphi s quite unnecessary.\" The O.T.O has also claimed, \"Our Order possesses the KEY which opens up all Masonic and Hermetic secrets, namely, the teaching of sexual magic, and this teaching explains, without exception, all the secrets of nature, all the symbolism of FREEMASONRY and all systems of religion\".

The essence of the New World Order (NWO) or world management system is that it is management by social engineers, rather than government based on a written constitution. How you are affected by this management sy stem depends on what the social engineers decide the system should do for you and require of you. The social engineers and system managers think of themselves as scientists a pplying the scientific method to the control of group behavior. Your behavior and your relationships are regarded as the subject of investigation and control by t hose who call themselves social scientists. You are among their test animals, and you have no say in, and often no knowledge of, experiments that involve you. If the NWO is totally imple mented, your independence, individuality, and freedom will be gone. There is nothing new about the idea of managi ng others, or even of controlling the whole world. That has been the goal of social philo sophers for thousands of years. However, we need not go back over ancient history. We are concerned primarily with what has been going on in our own generations. This we can understand quite well if we confine ourselves to the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. Goals of the New World Order To begin to understand the New World Order (NWO) you need to forget what you have been told about philosophical differences between Republicans and Democrats; left and right; Socialists and Libertar ians; business and labor; libera l and conservative; black and white, etc.. The planners of the New World Order know they must use, influence, and cater to all of these groups to accomplis h the goals they are seeking, which are: (1) Consolidate everything. (2) Commercialize everything. (3) Classify everything. (4) Claim everything. (5) Control everything. We might call these goals the fi ve Cs of the New World Order. If it is fully empowered, free speech, personality, personal goals and deci sions, individual responsibility, private property, private business, morality, Constitutio nal government, national sovereignty; and"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"religious freedom can no longer be tolerated. Everyone in every country will be subject to the NWO management system. To quot e the French mathematician/philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798-1857), one of the most significant early planners of the world management system: The most important object of this regene rated polity will be the substitution of Duties for Rights; thus subordinating pers onal to social considerations. The word Right should be excluded from polit ical language, as the word Cause from the language of philosophy. { 1 } The only real life is the collective life of the race; individual life has no existence except as an abstraction. { 2 } He also wrote: When the system is fully regulated, the eff ect of this will be to secure greater unity, by diminishing the infl uence of personal character. { 3 } This means that to the NWO world manageme nt system planners you, as an individual, are considered to be without character or personality. Your pe rsonal life and personal goals are unimportant to them, unless those goa ls are consistent w ith the sociological, economic and religious goals of the New World Order. Public Schools and The New World Order To demonstrate how NWO sociological, econom ic and religious goals are being brought about we can look first at the public schools. Most students and parents think the purpose of public schools is to teach essential and interesting information, vocational and recreational skills, considerat e and responsible behavior and an appreciation of our country’s history and Constitution. After your formal education is over, your parents expect that you should be able to take responsibility for your own moral, material, and social well-being, and also the moral, materi al, and social well-be ing of any children you might have until they, too, are ready to claim such freedom for themselves. At one time the goal of those who planned the school curriculum in the local communities seemed to follow the wishes of parents and the needs of students. Now, however, those sociologists who have the power to affect policy in the public schools do not concern themselves with what you nee d, what your parents want for you, or with respect and support for the United States C onstitution. Their primary goals are to CONSOLIDATE policies, COMMERCIALIZE in struction, CLASSIFY individuals, CLAIM jurisdiction, establish CONTROL, and tr ain you to fit obediently into their world management system without hesitation or protest. In 1928, sociologist Ross L. Finney wrote: A new world is emerging in which the so cial structures will be of a different shape, the social resources of a differ ent scope and caliber, than anything that history records. It is a new deal—in fact a different game with different cards; and we who are now alive are privileged to witness its beginning, however blind"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"most of us may be to its implications for ourselves and our posterity. And for a new age, a new school! { 4 } National Council for the Social Studies An organization called the Nati onal Council for the Social St udies (NCSS), which is an offshoot of the National Education Associati on and a promoter of the New World Order, has CLAIMED power to determine what you should learn and what you should not learn in geography, history, government, economics, psychology, religion, wo rld politics, etc.. These subjects were CONSOLIDATED decad es ago by sociologists so they could present them together under one agenda called Social Studies. The leaders of NCSS now decide what you should be taught, how you s hould be taught, and how your achievement will be evaluated. In addition to the National Council for the Soci al Studies, the various states have state councils for the social studies. Through the e fforts of state councils—oftentimes with the aid of the Education Commission of the States—b ills are presented to state legislatures to make NCSS’s curriculum standa rds legal requirements. Afte r these standards are passed in your state, your local school board, your ow n teachers and your parents have little to say about what you should be expected to lear n in these subjects. If you, your school, or community have different standards; if you do not try to live up to NCSS’s standards for the New World Order, your schools can be closed or your community punished by depriving it of federal, foundation and state money. Grouping People to Control Them It is interesting to investigate how this takeover was accomplished. Like everything connected to the New World Order and the five Cs, CONTROL is accomplished by influencing groups, and most particularly group leaders. This is because people who are emotionally involved with groups respond to l eadership. They also tend to feel CLASS loyalty. For example, when your elected o fficials CONSOLIDATE into groups and meet with elected officials from ot her areas, they frequently get carried away by the oratory and comradeship. Although they may not unders tand the full implications of the ideas the carefully-selected speakers a nd facilitators promote, the officials are maneuvered into feeling obligated to support what the group supports. By giving their loyalty to these secondary groups, the officials frequently betr ay the primary loyalty they owe to you and the citizens of the states, citi es and counties they are suppos ed to serve. CONTROL of government officials, educators, congressme n, legislators, businessmen, city councils, school boards, etc. through organizations is pa rt of the NWO plan for substitution of its system for the U.S. Constitution. Through CONSOLIDATION into national or in ternational ‘blanket’ organizations, one person or a small group of people can make decisions and set goals for hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people. They can set goals for you if you do not object. Always remember, whoever sets your goals or presents you with what they call a vision or a mission, CONTROLS your behavior. Y ou had better unders tand fully any such commitment you are asked to make."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Goal-Setting, Political Management Setting goals, and designing visions and mi ssions for groups of people is one of the favorite preoccupations of the New World Order philosophers and managers. In education, goal setting and visioning se rve to CONSOLIDATE policies so the NWO/NCSS curriculum can be established in schools throughout the country. When you hear someone who uses the phrase, ‘We must. . .’ or variations of it such as, ‘We need to. . .’, ‘It is essential that we. . .’, etc, without adding, ‘if we wish to . . ,’ there is a pretty fair chance that person is trying to convince you to give up the idea of independent research and thinking so you will support whatev er program or goals he or she might be promoting. It is unfortunate that few of our congressmen, state, count y, and city legislators have been alert enough to detect the be havior management and CONTRO L that have been directed toward them. Many of them have been deceived, flattered, coerced, bribed or blackmailed into surrendering their legitimat e authority to New World Order decision makers. This, too, was planned. In 1906, so ciologist Lester Ward explained how NWO legislation could be achieved: It must not be supposed that such legislation can be conducted to any considerable extent in the open sessions of legislative bodies. These will doubtless need to be maintained, and every new law should be finally adopted by a vote of such bodies, but more and more th is will become a merely formal way of putting the final sanction of society on d ecisions that have been carefully worked out in what may be called the sociological laboratory. { 5 } Goals 2000 - Control is the Object Most of the governors of the United States are members of the National Governors' Association. They have national meetings to CONSOLIDATE their policy decisions. In 1990, a policy was declared to promote the a doption of national educ ational goals. The Republican Bush Administ ration had endorced the id ea in 1989. Multinational corporations and the U. S. Chamber of Commerce supported it. Then, in 1994, Congress (Democrats and Republicans) passed and f unded the Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Originally, social studies was not included, but the NCSS saw to it that social studies was annexed to the national agenda. Its lead ers appointed a task force to develop CONSOLIDATED curriculum standards. These we re later adopted in most states as part of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Eight goals were chosen and publicized. The eight educational goals of Goals 2000 were not the important part of this operation. Any goals that sounded good, along with the money promised, could have enticed governors and state legislators to pass en abling legislation in their stat es. The real goals of Goals 2000 are to CONSOLIDATE leadership over all the states; CLAIM jurisdiction over curriculum to CONTROL what you and othe r students learn; and eventually to COMMERCIALIZE and CONTROL a ll educational resources th rough the use of charter schools and culture vouchers."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"It is no surprise to find now that the eight publicized goals have not been reached—and will not be reached by the Year 2000. Do es this mean that CONSOLIDATED goal- setting and visioning will be discontinued? On the contrary! To the goal-setters it means merely that the Goals 2000: Educate Ameri ca should be renamed, America’s Education Goals, and should be extended beyond 2000 wit hout a specific deadline. Even when failure is obvious and promises are not fulfilled, CONTROL, once gained, is never willingly relinquished by the NWO and United Nations regional government promoters. Failures of Public Schools In recent decades, public education has been subjected to a great deal of criticism. Because schools and curriculum have been interfered with by those who promote the NWO world management system, students were not learning what their parents, potential employers, and the students themselves, kne w they ought to learn. Skill in reading, natural science, English, mathematics, forei gn languages were dismally lacking in many high schools, and even college graduates. All kinds of excuses have been brought forward such as: • The problem is with your parents because they do not take an interest in your schooling. . . • The problem is with you and other st udents because you do not work hard enough or take an interest in learning. . . • The schools are not using the right system of teaching. We need to experiment with new systems. . . • The problem is not enough money for educa tion. If schools had more money they would produce better results. . . • The problem is segregation. We need to bus for integration. . . • Classrooms are overcrowded. We need more teachers. . . • Public schools should have tax-supporte d competition. We need charter schools and school vouchers. . . And so it has gone for decades. Enemies of Learning Few of the explainers have revealed the possi bility that you are not being properly taught because the NWO world management system does not want you to know too much. In his book, A Sociological Philosophy of Education, published in 1928 by the MacMillan Company, Ross L. Finney, Assistan t Professor of Educational Sociology at the University of Minnesota, wrote the following about what should and should not be offered to students: ...a larger place in the curriculum ought to be given to the new humanities and the fine arts, especially the former; and that correspondi ngly less time and energy ought to be allotted to mathematics, formal English, and the foreign languages.... { 6 }"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"What we obviously need is a science of society. Since the time of [Auguste] Comte this has been the aspiration of m odern scholarship. Instead of blundering and bungling along from one crisis to the ne xt, science might render society really telic, and reduce social phenomena to CO NTROL as it has done in the natural world.... (Emphasis mine) { 7 } If leadership by the intellige nt is ever to be achieved, followership by the dull and ignorant must somehow be assured. Follo wership, quite as much as leadership, is, therefore, the crucial problem of the present crisis.... { 8 } The safety of democracy is not to be sought, therefore, in the intellectual independence of the duller masses, but in their Intellectual de pendence. Not in what they think, but in w hat they think they think.... { 9 } The problem of democracy is which sp ecialized sub-group is to function as cerebral cortex. That will depend upon who succeeds in drilling epigrams into the memories of the duller masses. If sc ientists and educators fail to do it, then selfish deceivers and exploiters will. Bu t think for themselves the duller masses never can. { 10 } Those of us who do not agree with sociologis ts like Ross L. Finne y are CLASSIFIED as selfish deceivers, exploiters, or members of the duller masses. NWO usurpers have nothing but contempt for us and our need to learn. Many parents, teachers, administrators, legislators and state gover nors, etc. have been taken in by the NWO agenda. There is little chance that your state and school are independent of NWO management system. Therefore, it is impor tant that you begin to recognize enemies of learning even when they have college e ducations, advanced degrees, university, government and foundation support, and all the pr eplanned publicity th ey need to try to impress those of us whom they consider to be selfish deceivers, exploiters or the duller masses. Goals Statement for Schools You should understand that those who seek to CONTROL your educ ation in order to limit your access to knowledge are not doing it because they love or respect you, but because they want to CLAIM and CONTRO L you. The more you know about their goals and techniques, the easier it becomes to recognize efforts to CONTROL your thoughts. The more you know about hi story, geography, mathematics, English, science, etc. the more power you have to defend yourself against falsehood, deceit and domination. By establishing goals, missions, and vi sions, the NCSS has found a way to limit knowledge in all subjects. I remind you, he who chooses your goals controls your behavior. The social studies goal statement that has been chosen by the National Council for the Social Studies and adopted in similar, and sometimes identical form by the states is:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"...to help young people develop the abili ty to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a culturally diverse, democratic society in an interdependent world. Problem-Solving and Decision-Making To most people this sounds good, but please no tice that it is all a bout politics and world CONSOLIDATION. Nothing is mentioned a bout what is good for you, about giving you the knowledge to make intelligent fact-bas e personal decisions, about helping you to prepare for a career of your own choice. Nothing is mentioned about what is good for your city, your county, your stat e, or the United States of America. No—you are treated as a dependent member of the New Wo rld Order’s interdependent world. Interdependence means CONTROL by sociology’s New World Order and loss of control over your own destiny. Curriculum goals, guidelines, and standards for states and local communities are patterned after those of the NCSS and United Na tions NWO. In all cases, the curriculum is based on the idea of rational problem-s olving and decision-making, and on what the NWO crowd calls interdependence . You are asked to make decisions related to pre- selected social problems based on the limite d information available through classroom assignments. In this regard, it is important to know another behavior cont rol fact. He who states the problem for you controls your thinking. Your thoughts and efforts are directed toward problems which have been selected for you. When you express an opinion about suggested social or personal problems, you accept the NWO agenda and acknowledge an obligation to share your thoughts on the problem s with classmates. You can then be CLASSIFIED or grouped accordi ng to your public statements. Limiting Knowledge—Demanding Opinions Time spent learning facts and skills can be limited when it is taken up listening to and arguing about one another’s uninformed opinions . Also, a special danger is involved in this problem-solving, decision-making type of education. You and your fellow students are encouraged to join groups and act imme diately based on the opinions you express in the cIassroom—never taking in to consideration that your opinions and decisions may change as you mature and have access to information from other sources. If you express the opinion that you would like to try drugs or engage in sexual activities; if you say you might steal or become violen t; teachers are instruct ed not to warn you against such behavior or tell you that your decision is wrong or dangerous. That, say the curriculum planners, would be judgmental. No Right—No Wrong—Rational Conscience"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"It is assumed that none of the problems or personal dilemmas presented can be prevented or solved by self control a nd moral behavior. How do curri culum planners justify this omission? Your teachers are told that any st atement regarding morality is considered to be an unexamined belief based on authority. The National Council for the Social Studies says decision-making should be what they call rational, rather than being based on authority or conscience. For example, in Wisconsin teachers were advised: A child generally comes to school w ith what R. J. Havighurst calls an authoritarian conscience acquired from his parents through a progression of punishments and rewards. He soon learns that he is not equipped to deal with all the new situations which confront him. Peers and teachers join and sometimes supplant parents in helping him to find so lutions which are often in conflict with those offered by his parents. His task , then, is to change from this early authoritarian conscience to a rational one. This requires that he learn a process for resolving to his own satisfaction th e conflicts that will inevitably arise whenever change or confrontation with an opposing view makes him question his existing values. { 11 } Decisions Based on Conscience Not Allowed When you are taught to doubt your own conscien ce in favor of rational decision-making, many types of destructive, obnoxious, and immoral behavior will no longer be objectionable to you. You learn to find reasons to justify whatever behavior might have emotional appeal. Unbelievable as it may seem, teachers in Wisconsin actually were warned against holding students to traditional high standards: Traditionally there was litt le question that the sc hools should promote such values as the following: 1. Respect Property. 2. Be respectful of adults. 3. Say please and thank yo u at appropriate times. 4. Do not use profane language or bad grammar. 5. Be neat and clean. 6. Do not lie or cheat. Now, however, in some situations these are quite controversial. Many lawsuits and community controversies have focuse d on the meaning of ‘neat and clean,’ for example. Several recent surveys indi cate that cheating in school, rather than being unacceptable, has become the norm, and most students feel no guilt about cheating. Standards of profanity are constantly changing and words that one rarely heard used in public a few years ago are now heard a great deal. While many may not like these developments, it is very necessary for teachers to recognize that they are taking place. { 12 } Teachers Are Intimidated By The NWO"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Knowing what you now know about the goa ls of the New World Order, you can understand that the above instruction to teache rs could be taken as a veiled threat, better not telling them they had bette r not criticize the behaviors mentioned. Doing so might make them vulnerable to law suits, or perhaps, discipline by their superiors. Thus, the Wisconsin Department of Public instructi on, following the guidelines of the NCSS, actually promoted the idea that it is acceptable for you and your fellow students to be thieving, disrespectful, ungrateful, profan ity-using, sloppy, and dirty lying cheaters who have no conscience, and therefore no feelings of guilt for such behavior. The United Nations New World Order does not need people of character. It needs only those who are pliable and manageable. Creating Problems Problem creation is another unbelievable asp ect of NWO education. According to the NCSS, one of the main duties of teachers is to create emotional problems for you: Any attempt by a teacher to create a problem without arousing students emotionally can only result in a pseudo-pr oblem. When students are disturbed, upset, perhaps even angry, they are closer to having a problem than is ever the case when teachers make the preservati on of objectivity th eir only concern. A teacher can sometimes create in students a feeling that their beliefs, concepts or values are inadequate in some respect. Wh en students are puzzled over what to believe, they are more likely to have an authentic problem in their possession... { 13 } If the student is to become engaged in problem-solving he must be doubtful, uncertain or puzzled concerning someth ing within his experience and have the desire through inquiry to remove the doubt. As long as he is certain of the truth or goodness of a particular idea or acti on, or as long as he is unconcerned, indifferent about the matter, he is not involved in problem-solving. Hence, the initial task confronting the teacher is that of creating the stat e of uncertainty or doubt in the mind of the stude nt. . .the teacher must implant the element of doubt. { 14 } Strategies Used to Create Problems Since the presence of the element of doubt or puzzlement is a necessary condition for the initiation of problem -solving activity, let us cons ider teaching strategies which are likely to evoke such reactions... ...The teacher can present the students with a problem within the context of the content. ...The teacher can encourage the students to discover a problem within the context of the content. ...The teacher can convert the unexa mined beliefs of students into problems."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"...The teacher can point up conflicts with in the students’ pa ttern of beliefs, thus creating problems. ...The teacher can point up conflicts within the course content, thus creating problems. { 15 } Teaching problem-solving, decision-making, and interdependence may have sounded good to many teachers, school board members, local curriculum coordinators, legislators, parents, and students. However, if they ha d the opportunity to read the above, and what the NCSS curriculum planners mean when they promote this type of education, all of those affected might be more hesi tant before giving their sanction. Changing Beliefs Remember, the NWO planners and managers want CONTROL, but they know for certain that they cannot make you go along with their plans if you are aware of their intentions and if you are firmly convinced that to do so would be wrong. That is why so many methods have been devised to help you que stion or change your mind about what you believe. If the New World Order is to succeed in re aching its goals, Judaism and Christianity are among the religions which have to be elimin ated. People who are guided by the Bible, the Ten Commandments and what the Bible teaches about God, cannot be depended upon to be totally dedicated to th e sociological goals of a world management system. They cannot be intimidated into exchanging morals and conscience for sociological goals. This is why the system does not tolerate competition. Its own Positive religion or religion of Humanity must prevail. So ciology’s founder, Auguste Comte, wrote: By speaking of Positivism as organic, we imply that it has a social purpose; that purpose being to supersede Theology in the spiritual direct ion of the human race. { 16 } and, Sociology is once for all substituted for Theology as the basis for the religious government of mankind. { 17 } and, The last step in this long c ourse of training is now est ablishing the true form of subjectivity by substitution of Sociology for Theology. { 18 } In 1929, Ross L. Finney was among those working on a new morality for the managed society. He wrote: Nor can the new regime be operated with the beliefs of the old regime. . .As for the ideals by which we li ve, they too must be thought out de novo, and built into an adequate and effective new system of moral education. { 19 } The End of Freedom The NWO management system’s moral educa tion has nothing to do with freedom or the principles and ideals on which our nation was founded. The late B. F. Skinner, a Harvard University psychologist, put it this way:"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The hypothesis that man is NOT FREE is e ssential to the application of scientific method to the study of human behavior. { 20 } If you do not want to be a sociologically-c ontrolled and semi-ignorant member of the United Nations New World Order, you need to recognize the importance of knowledge and reject attempts at emotional manipul ation and knowledge limitation. The problem- solving and decision-making system of edu cation uses you, plays on your emotions, and tries to alienate you from those who should be closest to you. It creates animosity between you and your classmates; wastes valu able learning time by forcing you to form opinions and listen to the uninformed opini ons of your classmates; and discourages intelligent and moral behavior. It turns you against your own country and its Constitution in favor of the United Nations' New World Order management system. What Can You Do? Learn to recognize when you are being used, rather than informed. Learn to recognize when you are being led astray. Be like a cons cientious researcher and reporter. Do not be afraid to ask probing questions when ever you have doubts about the philosophy behind educational projects, exercises and game s, especially if they seem to you to be totally useless or destructive. If you are to have any hope of keeping the gift of freedom with which you've been blessed, you must know and share the truth. If you have concerns about your education, share them with your parents. Few parents have any idea what goes on in school. It is their responsibility to find out, and your responsibility to help them. You are not a test animal created to serve the ambition of social scientists and world managers. Do not allow your education to be limited and corrupted as if all you needed was to be trained in obedience to the syst em of the unConstitutional New World Order. And remember, if you truly desire it, all knowledge is yours: Ask, and it shalt be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shalt be opened unto you: For every one that asket h receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 THE AQUARIAN CONSPIRACY The Aquarian Conspiracy Executive Intelligence Review www.LaRouchePub.com In the spring of 1980, a book appeared called The Aquarian Conspiracy that put itself forward as a manifesto of the countercultu re. Defining the counterculture as the conscious embracing of irrationality -- from rock and drugs to biofeedback, meditation, \"consciousness-raising,\" yoga, mountain climbing, group therapy, and psychodrama. The Aquarian Conspiracy declares that it is now time for the 15 million Americans involved in the counterculture to join in bringing a bout a \"radical change in the United States.\" Writes author Marilyn Ferguson: \"While outlining a not-yet-titled book about the emerging social alternatives, I thought again about the peculi ar form of this movement; its atypical leadership, the patient intensity of its adherents, their unlikely successes. It suddenly struck me that in their sharing of strategies, their linkage , and their recognition of each other by subtle signals, the participan ts were not merely cooperating with one another. They were in collusion. It -- this movement -- is a conspiracy!\"1 Ferguson used a half-truth to tell a lie. The counterculture is a conspiracy -- but not in the half-conscious way Ferguson claim -- as sh e well knows. Ferguson wrote her manifesto under the direction of Willis Harman, social policy director of the Stanford Research Institute, as a popular version of a May 1974 policy study on how to transform the United States into Aldous Huxley's Br ave New World. The countercultu re is a conspiracy at the top, created as a method of social control, used to drain the United States of its commitment to scientific and technological progress. That conspiracy goes back to the 1930s, wh en the British sent Aldous Huxley to the United States as the case officer for an opera tion to prepare the United States for the mass dissemination of drugs. We will take this conspiracy apart step-by-step from its small beginnings with Huxley in California to th e victimization of 15 million Americans today. With 'The Aquarian Conspiracy', the Britis h Opium War against the United States has come out into the open. The Model The British had a precedent for the counterculture they imposed upon the United States: the pagan cult ceremonies of the decadent Egyptian and Roman Empires. The following description of cult ceremonies dating back to the Egyptian Isis priesthood of the third millennium B.C. could just as well be a journa listic account of a \"hippy be-in\" circa A.D. 1969: \"The acts or gestures that accompany the incantations consti tute the rite [of Isis). In these dances, the beating of drums and the rhythm of music and repetitive movements were helped by hallucinatory substances like hashish or mescal; these were consumed as"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"adjuvants to create the trance and the hallucinati ons that were taken to he the visitation of the god. The drugs were sacred, and their know ledge was limited to the initiated . . . Possibly because they have the illusion of sa tisfied desires, and allowed the innermost feelings to escape, these rites acquired during their execution a frenzied character that is conspicuous in certain spells : \"Retreat! Re is piercing thy head, slashing thy face, dividing thy head, crushing it in his hands; thy bones are sha ttered, thy limbs are cut to pieces!\"2 The counterculture that was foisted on the 1960s adolescent youth of America is not merely analogous to the ancient cult of Isis. It is a literal resurrec tion of the cult down to the popularization of the Isis cross (the \"p eace symbol\") as the counterculture's most frequently used symbol. The High Priesthood The high priest for Britain's Opium War was Aldous Huxley, the grandson of Thomas H. Huxley, a founder of the Rhodes Roundtable group and a lifelong collaborator of Arnold Toynbee. Toynbee himself sat on the RIIA council for nearly fifty years, headed the Research Division of British intelligence throughout World War II, and served as wartime briefing officer of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Toynbee's \"theory\" of history, expounded in his twen ty-volume History of Wester n civilization, was that its determining culture has always been the rise and decline of grand im perial dynasties. At the very point that these dynast ies -- the \"thousand year Reich\" of the Egyptian pharaohs, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire -- succeed in imposing their rule over the entire face of the earth, they tend to declin e. Toynbee argued that this decline could be abated if the ruling oligarchy (like that of the British Roundt able) would devote itself to the recruitment and training of an ever-expanding priesthood dedicated to the principles of imperial rule.3 Trained at Toynbee's Oxford, Aldous Huxley was one of the initiates in the \"Children of the Sun,\" a Dionysian cult comprised of the children of Britain's Roundtable elite.4 Among the other initiates were T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, Sir Oswald Mosley, and D.H. Lawrence, Huxley's homosexual lover. It wa s Huxley, furthermore, who would launch the legal battle in the 1950s to have La wrence's pornographic novel Lady Chatterley's Lover allowed into the United States on the ground that it was a misunderstood \"work of art.\"5 Aldous Huxley, along with his brother Julian, was tutored at Oxford by H.G. Wells, the head of British foreign intelligence during World War I and the spiritual grandfather of the Aquarian Conspiracy. Fer guson accurately sees the counte rculture as the realization of what Wells called The Open Conspiracy: Blue Pr ints for a World Revolution. The \"Open Conspiracy,\" Wells wrote, \"will appear first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent and quite possibly in some cases, wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and political aims, confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people in a certain direction who will presently discover"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"with a sort of surprise the common object to ward which they are all moving . . . In all sorts of ways they will be influencing and c ontrolling the apparatus of the ostensible government.\" 6 What Ferguson left out is that Wells called his conspiracy a \"one-world brain\" which would function as \"a police of the mind.\" Such books as the Open Conspiracy were for the priesthood itself. But Wells's popular writings (Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and so forth), and those of his proteges Aldous Huxley (Brave New World) and George Orwell (1984 and Animal Farm), were written as \"mass appeal\" organizing documents on behalf of one-world order. On ly in the United States are these \"science fiction classics\" taught in grade school as attacks against fascism. Under Wells's tutelage, Huxley was first in troduced to Aleister Crowley. Crowley was a product of the cultist circle that developed in Britain fr om the 1860s under the guiding influence of Edward Bulwer-Lytton -- who, it wi ll be recalled, was the colonial minister under Lord Palmerston during the Second Op ium War. In 1886, Crowley, William Butler Yeats, and several other Bulw er-Lytton proteges formed the Isis-Urania Temple of Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. Th is Isis Cult was organized around the 1877 manuscript Isis Unveiled by Madame Helena Blavatsky, in which the Russian occultist called for the British aristocracy to or ganize itself into an Isis priesthood.7 The subversive Isis Urania Order of the Gold en Dawn is today an international drug ring said to be controlled by the Canadian multi- millionaire, Maurice Strong, who is also a top operative for British Intelligence. In 1937, Huxley was sent to the United Stat es, where he remained throughout the period of World War II. Through a Lo s Angeles contact, Jacob Ze itlin, Huxley and pederast Christopher Isherwood were employed as script writers for MGM, Warner Brothers, and Walt Disney Studios. Hollywood was already dominated by organized crime elements bankrolled and controlled through London. Joseph Kennedy was the frontman for a British consortium that created RKO studios, a nd \"Bugsy\" Siegel, the West Coast boss of the Lansky syndicate, was heavily involved in Warner Brothers and MGM. Huxley founded a nest of Isis cults in sout hern California and in San Francisco, that consisted exclusively of seve ral hundred deranged worshipers of Isis and other cult gods. Isherwood, during the California period, translated and propagated a number of ancient Zen Buddhist documents, inspiring Ze n-mystical cults along the way.8 In effect, Huxley and Isherwood (joined soon afterwards by Thomas Mann and his daughter Elisabeth Mann Borghese) laid th e foundations during the late 1930s and the 1940s for the later LSD culture, by recruiting a core of \"initiates\" into the Isis cults that Huxley's mentors, Bulwer-Lytton, Blavat sky, and Crowley, had constituted while stationed in India. LSD: 'Visitation from the Gods'"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"Ironically,\" writes Ferguson, \"t he introduction of major psyche delics like LSD, in the 1960s, was largely attributable to the Central Intelligence Agency's investigation into the substances for possible military use. Experi ments on more than eighty college campuses, under various CIA code names, unintentionally popularized LSD. Thousands of graduate students served as guinea pigs. Soon they were synthesizing their own 'acid.' \"9 The CIA operation was code named MK-Ultra, its result was not unintentional, and it began in 1952, the year Aldous Huxley returned to the United States. Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, wa s developed in 1943 by Albert Hoffman, a chemist at Sandoz A.B. -- a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg. While precise documentation is unavailable as to the auspices under which the LSD research was commissioned, it can be safely assumed that British intelligence and its subsidiary U.S. Office of Strategic Services were direct ly involved. Allen Dulles, the director of the CIA when that agency began MK-Ultra, was the OSS station chief in Berne, Switzerland throughout the early Sandoz rese arch. One of his OSS assistants was James Warburg, of the same Warburg family, who was instrument al in the 1963 founding of the Institute for Policy Studies, and worked with bot h Huxley and Robert Hutchins.\"10 Aldous Huxley returned to the United States from Britain, accompanied by Dr. Humphrey Osmond, the Huxleys' private physician. Osmond had been part of a discussion group Huxley had organized at th e National Hospital, Queens Square, London. Along with another seminar particip ant, J.R. Smythies, Osmond wrote Schizophrenia: A New Approach, in which he asserted that mescalin e -- a derivative of the mescal cactus used in ancient Egyptian and Indian pagan rite s -- produced a psychotic state identical in all clinical respects to schi zophrenia. On this basis, Osmond and Smythies advocated experimentation with halluci nogenic drugs as a means of de veloping a \"cure\" for mental disorders. Osmond was brought in by Allen Dulles to play a prominent role in MK-Ultra. At the same time, Osmond, Huxley, and the University of Chicago's Robert Hutchins held a series of secret planning sessions in 1952 and 1953 for a second, private LSD mescaline project under Ford Foundation funding.11 Hutchi ns, it will be recalled, was the program director of the Ford Foundation during this pe riod. His LSD proposal incited such rage in Henry Ford II that Hutchins was fire d from the foundation the following year. It was also in 1953 that Osmund gave Huxley a supply of mescalin e for his personal consumption. The next year, Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception, the first manifesto of the psychedelic drug cult, which cl aimed that hallucinogenic drugs \"expand consciousness.\" Although the Ford Foundation re jected the Hutchins-Huxley proposal for private foundation sponsorship of LSD, the proposal was not dropped. Beginning in 1962, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, Cali fornia began a four-year experiment in LSD, peyote, and marijuana. The Rand Corporation was established simultaneously with the reorganization of the Ford Foundation during 1949. Rand was an outgrowth of the wartime Strategic Bombing Survey, a \"cost analysis\" study of the psychological effects of the bombings of German population centers."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"According to a 1962 Rand Abstract, W.H. Mc Glothlin conducted a preparatory study on \"The Long-Lasting Effects of LSD on Certai n Attitudes in Normals: An Experimental Proposal.\" The following year, McGlothlin conduc ted a year-long experiment on thirty human guinea pigs, called \"Short-Term Effects of LSD on Anxiety, Attitudes and Performance.\" The study concluded that LSD improve d emotional attitudes and resolved anxiety problems.12 Huxley At Work Huxley expanded his ow n LSD-mescaline project in California by recruiting several individuals w ho had been initially drawn into the cult circles he helped establish during his earlier st ay. The two most prominent i ndividuals were Alan Watts and the late Dr. Gregory Bate son (the former husband of Dame Margaret Mead). Watts became a self-styled \"guru\" of a nationwide Zen Buddhist cult built around his well- publicized books. Bateson, an anthropologist with the OSS, became the director of a hallucinogenic drug experimental clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital. Under Bateson's auspices, the initiating \"cadre\" of the LSD cult -- the hippies -- were programmed.13 Watts at the same time founded the Paci fica Foundation, which sponsored two radio station WKBW in San Francisco and WBM-FM in New York City. The Pacifica stations were among the first to push the \"Liverpool Sound\" -- the British-imported hard rock twanging of the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the Animals. They would later pioneer \"acid rock\" and eventually the se lf-avowed psychotic \"punk rock.\" During the fall of 1960, Huxley was appointed visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. Around his stay in that city, Huxley created a circle at Harvard parallel to his West Coast LSD team. The Harvard group included Huxley, Osmund, and Watts (brought in from Califor nia), Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert. The ostensible topic of the Harvard seminar was \"Religion and its Si gnificance in the Modern Age.\" The seminar was actually a planning session for the \"acid rock\" counterculture. Huxley establis hed contact during this Harvard period with the president of Sandoz, which at the time was working on a CIA contract to produce large quantities of LSD and psilocybin (another synthetic ha llucinogenic drug) for MK-Ultra, the CIA's official chemical warfare experiment. Acco rding to recently released CIA documents, Allen Dulles purchased over 100 million doses of LSD -- almost all of which flooded the streets of the United States during the la te 1960s. During the same period, Leary began privately purchasing large quantitie s of LSD from Sandoz as well.14 From the discussions of the Harvard seminar, Leary put together the book The Psychedelic Experience, based on the ancient cultist Tibetan Book of the Dead. It was this book that popularized Osmund's previously co ined term, \"psychedelic mind-expanding.\" The Roots of the Flower People Back in California, Gregory Bateson had main tained the Huxley operation out of the Palo Alto VA hospital.

By 1962, Kesey had completed a novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which popularized the notion that so ciety is a prison and the only truly \"free\" people are the insane.15 Kesey subsequently organized a circle of \"SD initiates called \"The Merry Pranksters.\" They toured the country disseminating SD\" (often without forewarning the receiving parties), building up local dist ribution connections, and establishing the pretext for a high volume of publicity on behalf of th e still minuscule \"counterculture.\" By 1967, the Kesey cult had handed out such quantities of \"SD that a sizable drug population had emerged, centered in the Haight -Ashbury district of San Francisco. Here Huxley collaborator Bateson set up a \"free c linic,\" staffed by **Dr. David Smith -- later a \"medical adviser\" for the National Organi zation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML); **Dr. Ernest Dernberg an active-duty military officer, probably on assignment through MK-UItra; **Roger Smith-a street gang organizer trained by Saul Alinsky. During the Free Clinic period, Roger Smith was the pa role officer of the cultist mass murderer Charles Manson; **Dr. Peter Bourne -- formerly President Carter's special assistant on drug abuse. Bourne did his psychiatric resi dency at the Clinic. He had previously conducted a profiling study of GI heroin addicts in Vietnam. The Free Clinic paralleled a project at the Tavistock Institute, the psychological warfare agency for the British Secret Intelligence Service. Tavistock, founded as a clinic in London in the 1920s, had become the Psychiat ric Division of the British Army during World War II under its director , Dr. John Rawlings Rees.16 During the 1960s, the Tavistock Cl inic fostered the notion that no criteria for sanity exist and that psychedelic \"mind-expanding\" drugs are valuable tools of psychoanalysis. In 1967, Tavistock sponsored a Conference on the \"Dialectics of Liberation,\" chaired by Tavistock psychoanalyst Dr. R.D. Laing, himself a populariz ed author and advocate of drug use. That conference drew a number of people who would soon play a prominent role in fostering terrorism; Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael were two prominent American delegates. Thus, by 1963, Huxley had recruited his core of \"initiates.\" A ll of them -- Leary, Osmund, Watts, Kesey, Alpert -- became the highly publicized promoters of the early LSD counterculture. By 1967, with the cult of \"Flower People\" in Haight-Ashbury and the emergence of the antiwar movement, the United States was ready for the inundation of LSD, hashish and marijuana that hit Am erican college campuses in the late 1960s.

For their achievement, the four rocksters were awarded the Order of the Br itish Empire by Her Majesty the Queen. The Beatles and the Animals, Rolling Stones, a nd homicidal punk rock maniacs who followed were, of course, no more a spontaneous outpour ing of alienated youth than was the acid culture they accompanied. The social theory of rock was elaborated by musicologist Theodor Adorno, who came to the United States in 1939 to head the Prin ceton University Radio Research Project.17 Adorno writes: \"In an imaginary but psychologically emotion-laden domain, the listener who remembers a hit song will turn into the song's ideal subject, into the person for whom the song ideally speaks. At the same time, as one of m any who identify with that fictitious subject, that musical I, he will f eel his isolation ease as he himself feels integrated into the community of \"fans.\" In whistling such a song he bows to a ritual of socialization, although beyond this unarticulat ed subjective stirring of the moment his isolation continues unchanged . . . The co mparison with addiction is inescapable. Addicted conduct generally has a social com ponent: it is one possible reaction to the atomization which, as sociolog ists have noticed, parallels th e compression of the social network. Addiction to music on the part of a number of entertainmen t listeners would be a similar phenomenon.\" 18 The hit parade is organized precisely on th e same principles used by Egypt's Isis priesthood and for the same purpose: the recruitment of yout h to the dionysiac counterculture. In a report prepared for the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, Paul Hirsch described the product of Adorno' s Radio Research Project.19 According to Hirsch, the establishment of postwar radio's Hit Parade \"transformed the mass medium into an agency of sub-cultural programming. R adio networks were c onverted into round- the-clock recycling machines that repeated the top forty hits.\" Hirsch documents how all popular culture -- movies, music, books, and fashion -- is now run on the same program of preselection. Today's mass culture operates lik e the opium trade: The supply determines the demand. The Vietnam War and the Anti-Vietnam War Trap But without the Vietnam War and the \"anti-wa r\" movement, the Isis cult would have been contained to a fringe phenomenon -- no bigger than the beatnik cult of the 1950s that was an outgrowth of the early Huxley ventures in California. The Vietnam War created the climate of mo ral despair that opened Am erica's youth to drugs. Under Kennedy, American military involvement in Vietnam -- which had been vetoed by the Eisenhower administration -- was initia ted on a limited scale. Under Lyndon Johnson, American military presence in Vietnam was ma ssively escalated, at the same time that U.S. efforts were restricted -- the framework of \"limited war.\" Playing on the President's profile, the anglophile Eastern Establishmen t, typified by top White House national"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"security aide McGeorge Bundy and Defens e Secretary Robert McNamara, convinced President Johnson that under the nuclear \"balance of terror,\" or the re gime of Mutual and Assured Destruction, the United States could afford neither a political solution to the conflict, nor the commitment to a military victory. The outcome of this debacle was a major st rategic withdrawal from Asia by the United States, spelled out in Henry Kissinger's \"Guam Doctrine,\" adoption of the spectacular failure known as the \"China Card\" strategy for containing Soviet influence, and demoralization of the American people over the war to the point that the sense of national pride and confidence in the future progr ess of the republic was badly damaged. Just as Aldous Huxley began the countercu lture subversion of the United States thirty years before its consequences became eviden t to the public, Lord Bertrand Russell began laying the foundations for the an ti-war movement of the 1960s before the 1930s expired. Russell's \"pacifism\" was always relative -- the means to his most cherished end, one- world government on the imperial model, th at would curb the nation-state and its persistent tendency toward republic anism and technological progress. Lord Russell and Aldous Huxley cofounded the Peace Pledge Union in 1937 campaigning for peace with Hitler-just before both went to the United States for the duration of World War.20 During World Wa r II, Lord Russell opposed British and American warfare against the Nazis. 1111947, when the United States was in possession of the atomic bomb and Russia was not, Russell loudly advocated that the United States order the Soviets to surrender to a one-world government that would enjoy a restrictive monopoly on nuclear weapons, under the threat of a preemptive World War III against the Soviet Union. His 1950s \"Ban the Bomb\" movement was directed to the same end-it functioned as an anti-technology movement against the peac e-through-economic development potentials represented by President Eisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace\"' initiative. From the mid-1950s onward, Russell's principal assignment was to build an international anti-war and anti-American movement. Co incident with the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam under British ma nipulation, Russell upgraded the old Peace Pledge Union (which had been used in We st Germany throughout the postwar period to promote an anti-capitalist \"New left\" wing of the Social Democratic Party, recruiting several future members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in th e process) into the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation. In the United States, the New York banks provided several hundred thousand dollars to establish the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS), effectively the U.S. branch of the Russell Peace Foundation. Among the founding trustees of the IPS was James Warburg, directly representing the family's interests. IPS drew its most active operatives from a variety of British-dominated institutions.

This is not to say that the majority of anti-war protesters were paid, certified British agents. On the contrary, the overwhelming major ity of anti-war protesters went into SDS on the basis of outrage at the developmen ts in Vietnam. But once caught in the environment defined by Russell and the Tavi stock Institute's psychological warfare experts, and inundated with the message that hedonistic pleasure-see king was a legitimate alternative to \"immoral war,\" their sense of values and their creativ e potential went up in a cloud of hashish smoke. 'Changing Images' Now, fifteen years later, with nearly an en tire generation of American youth submerged in the drugs that flooded the nation's campuses, the Aquarian Conspiracy's Marilyn Ferguson is able to write: \"There are legions of [Aquaria n] conspirators. They are in corporations, universities, and hospitals, on the faculties of public schools, in factories and doctors' offices, in state and federal agenc ies, on city councils, and the White House staff, in state legislatures, in volunteer or ganizations, in virtually all arenas of policy making in the country.\" 22 Like the British inundation of China with dr ugs in the nineteenth century, the British counterculture has succeeded in. subverting th e fabric of the nati on, even up to the top- most levels of government. In 1962, Huxley helped found the Esalen Institut e in Big Sur, California, which became a mecca for hundreds of Americans to engage in weekends of T-Groups and Training Groups modeled on behavior group therapy, fo r Zen, Hindu, and Buddhist transcendental meditation, and \"out of body\" experiences through simulated and actual hallucinogenic drugs.23 As described in the Esalen Institute Newsletter: \"Esalen started in the fall of 1962 as a forum to bring together a wide variety of approaches to enhancement of the human potential . . . including experiential se ssions involving encounter groups, sensory awakening, gestalt awareness training, related di sciplines. Our latest step is to fan out into the community at large, running programs in cooperation with many different institutions, churches, schools, hospitals, and government.\" 24"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Esalen's nominal founders were two transce ndental meditation st udents, Michael Murphy and Richard Price, both graduates of Stanford University.

Several tens of thousands of Americans ha ve passed through Esalen; millions have passed through the programs it ha s sired throughout the country. The next leap in Britain's Aquarian Conspi racy against the United States was the May 1974 report that provided the basis for Fe rguson's work. The report is entitled \"Changing Images of Man,\" Contract Number URH (489~21 5O, Policy Research Report No. 414.74, prepared by the Stanford Re search Institute Center for the Study of Social Policy, Willis Harman, director. The 319-page mimeogr aphed report was prepared by a team of fourteen researchers and supervised by a pa nel of twenty-three c ontrollers, including anthropologist Margaret Mea d, psychologist B.F. Skinner, Ervin Laszlo of the United Nations, Sir Geoffrey Vickers of British intelligence. The aim of the study, the authors state, is to change the image of mankind from that of industrial progress to one of \"spiritualism.\" The study asserts that in our present society, the \"image of industrial and technological man\" is obsolete and must be \"discarded\": \"Many of our present images appear to have become dangerously obsolete, however . . . Science, technology, and economics have made possible really significant strides toward achieving such basic human goal s as physical safety and secu rity, material comfort and better health. But many of th ese successes have brought with them problems of being too successful -- problems that themselves seem in soluble within the set of societal value- premises that led to their emergence . . .

Ind eed the range and inte rconnected impact of societal problems that are now emerging pose a serious threat to our civilization . . . If our predictions of the future prove correct, we can expect th e association problems of the trend to become more serious, more universal and to occur more rapidly.\" Therefore, SRI concludes, we must change the industrial-technol ogical image of man fast: \"Analysis of the nature of contemporary so cietal problems leads to the conclusion that . . . the images of man that dominated the last two centuries will be inadequate for the post-industrial era.\" Since the writing of the Harman report, one Pr esident of the United States, Jimmy Carter, reported sighting UFOs his National Securi ty Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski made speeches proclaiming the advent of the New Age, the Joint Chiefs of Staff every morning read so-called intelligence reports on the biorhythms and horoscopes of the members of the Soviet Politburo.

The LSD Connection Who provided the drugs that swamped the an ti-war movement and the college campuses of the United States in the late 1960s? The organized crime infrastructure which had set up the Peking Connection for the opium trade in 1928 -- provided the same services in the 1960s and 1970s it had provided during Prohi bition. This was also the same network Huxley had established contact with in Hollywood during the 1930s. The LSD connection begins with one William \"Billy\" Mellon Hitchcock. Hitchcock was a graduate of the University of Vienna and a scion of the millionaire Mellon banking family of Pittsburgh. (Andrew Mellon of the same fam ily had been the U.S. Treasury Secretary throughout Prohibition.) In 1963, when Timot hy Leary was thrown out of Harvard, Hitchcock rented a fifty-five-room mansi on in Millbrook, New York, where the entire Leary-Huxley circle of initiat es was housed until its later move back to California.26 Hitchcock was also a broker for the Lansky syndicate and for the Fiduciary Trust Co., Nassau, Grand Bahamas --- a wholly owned subsidiary of Investors Overseas Services. He was formally employed by Delafield and De lafield Investments, where he worked on buying and selling vast quantities of stock in the Mary Carter Pain t Co., soon to become Resorts International. In 1967, Dr. Richard Alpert put Hitchcock in contact with Augustus Owsley Stanley III. As Owsley's agent, Hitchcock retained the law firm of Babinowitz, Boudin and Standard 27 -- to conduct a feasibility study of several Caribbean countries to determine the best location for the production and di stribution of LSD and hashish. During this period, Hitchcock joined Leary and his circle in Ca lifornia. Leary had established an LSD cult called the Brothe rhood of Eternal Love and several front companies, including Mystics Art World, In c. of Laguna Beach, California. These California-based entities ran lucrative tra fficking in Mexican marijuana and LSD brought in from Switzerland and Britain. The British c onnection had been established directly by Hitchcock, who contracted the Charles Bruce ch emical firm to import large quantities of the chemical components of LSD with financ ing from both Hitchcock and George Grant Hoag, the heir to the J.C. Penney dry goods fortune, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love set up LSD and hashish production-marketi ng operations in Costa Rica in 1968. 28 Toward the end of 1968, Hitchcock expanded the LSD-hashish production operations in the Caribbean with funds provided by the Fiduc iary Trust Co. (IOS). In conjunction with J. Vontobel and Co. of Zurich, Hitchcock f ounded a corporation called 4-Star Anstalt in Liechtenstein. This company, employing \"invest ment funds\" (that is, drug receipts) from Fiduciary Trust, bought up large tracts of la nd in the Grand Bahamas as well as large quantities of ergotamine tartrate, the basic ch emical used in the production of LSD.29"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Hitchcock's personal hand in the LSD connection abruptly ended several years later. Hitchcock had been working closely with Joha nn F. Parravacini of the Parravacini Bank Ltd in Berne, Switzerland. From 1968, they ha d together funded ev en further expansion of the Caribbean-California LSD-hashish ventur es. In the early 1970s, as the result of a Securities and Exchange Commission investig ation, both Hitchcock a nd Parravacini were indicted and convicted of a $40 million stoc k fraud. Parravacini had registered a $40 million sale to Hitchcock for which Hitchcock had not put down a penny of cash or collateral. This was one of the rare instances in which federal inve stigators succeeded in getting inside the $200 billion drug fund as it was making its way around the \"offshore\" banking system. Another channel for laundering dirty drug m oney -- a channel yet to be compromised by federal investigative agencies is important to note here. This is the use of tax-exempt foundations to finance terrorism and environm entalism. One immediately relevant case makes the point. In 1957, the University of Chicago's Robert M. Hutchins established the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI) in Santa Barbara, California. Knight Commander Hutchins drew in Aldous Huxl ey, Elisabeth Mann Borghese, and some Rhodes Scholars who had originally been brough t into the University of Chicago during the 1930s and 1940s. The CSDI was originally funded 1957 to 1961 through a several-mill ion-dollar fund that Hutchins managed to set up before his un timely departure from the Ford Foundation. From 1961 onward, the Center wa s principally financed by organized crime. The two funding conduits were the Fund of Funds, a tax exempt front for Bernie Cornfeld's lOS, and the Parvin Foundation, a pa rallel front for Parvin-Dohnna n Co. of Nevada. IOS and Marvin-Doorman held controlling interests in the Desert Inn, the Aladdin, and the Dune - - all Las Vegas casinos associated with the Lansky syndicate . IOS, as already documented, was a conducting vehicle for LS D, hashish, and marijuana distribution throughout the 1960s.30 In 1967 alone, IOS cha nneled between $3 and $4 million to the center.

To teach the reality and power of Thought as a healer of World and National disharmony, and also of individual physical and spiritual di sease hand in hand with medical science. 2. To help people to fight the evils of selfishness which are born of fears caused by the routine struggle for daily existence, and to encourage Spiritual Service between all men as being one of the great ideals of life. 3. To promote lectures on world affairs showing how the decline of spirituality and spiritual values generally has been the paramount cause of present world chaos. 4. To demonstrate how to use Thought, the God Force within us, both for individual and world healing. To further demonstrate how this can be applied to the governments of the Nations, thus affecting the course of world events. 5.

The disaster was brought about on account of the SATANAKUIC domination exercised by Eranus & his followers (Called SATANAKU after the firs t fall of Lemuria & known to later generations as THE DEVIL). “Black Magic was rife and the chances of those who still remained steadfast to the cause of divine evolution were almost hopeless.

Albert Pike wrote: \"Not hing excites men's curiosity so much as Mystery, concealing things which they desi re to know; and nothing so much increases curiosity as obstacles that interpose to prevent them from indulging in the gratificati on of their desires.

Arthur Waite, another M asonic writer, tells us that Masonry \"is on the surface a 'system of morality, veile d in allegory and illustrated by symbols'\" (Arthur Edward Waite, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and of Cognate Instituted Mysteries: The ir Rites, Literature and History, New York, Weathervane Books, 1970, Vol. II, p. 421). Ralph Anderson, a 32 degree Mason, further expounds on the hidden symbolism of Masonry: \"Masonry may be defined as a system of symbols, a collection of allegories, and a pictor ial form which veils and hides a truth so general and universal that man cannot live without it. An allegory is a story which is susceptible of TW O meanings; an Outer One which captivates the fancy and engrosses the a ttention, and an Inner One which conveys to the initiate some basic, cosmic and human truth by which a man hides or veils an inner spiritua l reality. The Masonic Temple work abounds with such symbols, and through them is Revealed to the intelligent Mason the story of his own progress and also the history of the race of men.\" (Arcana Workshops, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and of Cognate Instituted Mysteries: Their Rites, Literature and History, pp. 3-4; The Spirit of Masonry, Kent, England: Lucis (originally Lucifer -- renamed by public pressure) Press Limi ted, 1957, pp. 28-29). Waite further states: \" . . . the newly received brother has come into a world of emblems or symbolism and whatsoever takes pl ace therein has a meaning behind it, being one which is not always indicat ed on the surface\" (Arthur Edward Waite, A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and of Cognate Instituted Mysteries: Their Rites, Literature and History, p. 395). In fact, Masonry intentionally misl eads those who have recently joined. Pike claims: \"So Masonry jealously co nceals its secrets and intentionally leads conceited interpreters astray . . . If you have been disappointed in the first three degrees, as you have received them . . . remember that . . . symbols were used, not to reveal but to conceal . . . The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry have more than one meaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, pp. 105-106; 148). Pike also stated: \"The Blue Degrees (th e first three degrees of Masonry) are but the outer court or portico of th e Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he unde rstands them. Their True explication is reserved for the Adepts (those who have advanced to the highest degrees in Masonry) . . . It is we ll enough for the mass of those called Masons to imagine that all is cont ained in the Blue Degrees; and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain (and any past Mason who has"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"learned the truth, knows the almost comp lete futility in trying to enlighten his fellow Mason as to truth. For they have been so completely indoctrinated they will not listen, nor examine the evidence presented to them) . . . \" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 819). Finally, Pike adds: \"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals it s secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses fal se explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from th em, and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unwort hy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it. . . . So Masonry jealously conceals its secrets, and intentionally leads conceited interpreters astray\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, pp. 104-105). \"The final consummation will be wh en all this luminous substance has been separated from matter; the evil fire will then be freed from the caverns; the angel upholding the earth will let it fall in flames, and the whole mass will be relegated to Oute r Darkness. Those who have failed to free themselves in time will be made guardians of the devils, keeping them from again bringing matter into the kingdom of Light. Such is the marvelous fable under which lies th e nature-worship of ancient and modern Magnetism, known today as Illu minism, often called Christianity! as, for example, Anthroposophy or Steinerism, with its two opposing forces Lucifer and Ahriman, light and matter, and its solar and illuminising Christ. And the redemption consists wi th them of a physical and gnostic process of freeing, by means of unused sex-force, the element of light from matter or the body, and uniting it with the universal magnetic agent without, more often linking one mind with another in a magnetic chain, the weaker dominated by the more powe rful, producing a world-inundation of communications from so-called 'Sag es and Prophets,' destructive both to Christianity and Western civilization\" (The Trail of the Serpent, Miss Stoddard, p. 33). Discovering its God!: Masons emphasize that to participate in the Masonic rituals one must believe in a \"Supreme Being. Freemasonry is available to any man of good character who believes in a Supreme Being and is closed only to avowed atheists and agnostics,\" claims Ralph Anderson. (Arcana Workshops, p. 2) Since the Bible cau tions us that \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt t hou serve\" (Matthew 4:10) and the Masons worship a Supreme Being, is this Supreme Being the same God as the Christians worship, or is he a di fferent god? As you read this you will find out who this \"Supreme Being\" is, but this is not the only god Masons worship! Although many Masons may be unaware of the polytheism in Masonry, many gods and goddesses are worshiped through the symbolism"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"and rituals of Masonry. One poem, writ ten by a Mason, J.S.M. Ward, sums up some of the mythology prevalent in Masonry: Bacchus died and rose again, On the Golden Syrian Plain; Osiris rose from his grave; And thereby mankind did save; Adonis likewise shed his blood, By the yellow Syrian flood, Zoroaster brought to birth, Mithra from his cave of earth, And we today in Christian land, We with them can join hands. (C. Penny Hunt, Masons and Christ: The Menace of Freemasonry, Finleyville, Pennsylvania: The Voice of the Nazarene Press, 1967, p. 9) Bacchus, The Legislator of the Jews fixed the commencement of their year in the month Nisan, at the vernal E quinox, at which season the Israelites marched out of Egypt and were re lieved of their long bondage; in commemoration of which Exodus, they ate the Paschal Lamb at that Equinox. And when Bacchus and his army had long marched in burning deserts, they were led by a Lamb or Ram into beautiful meadows, and to the Springs that watered the Temple of Jupiter Ammon. For, to the Arabs and Ethiopians, whose great Divinity Bacchus was, nothing was so perfect a type of Elysium as a Country abounding in springs and rivulets (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 466). Osiris, Adonis, and Mithra are all gods that are wors hiped by occultists and Masons! Of course, these are just a few of the gods that are actually worshiped through different Masonic cer emonies. It doesn't matter to the Mason that God proclaims: \"Thou shal t worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve\" (Matthew 4:10). \"Osiris is the Egyptian god of the dead as well as a sun god, but he is also known by many other names. In Thrace and Greece he is known as Dionysus, the god of pleasures and of partying and wine. Festivals held in"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"his honor often resulted in human sacrifices and orgiastic (sexual) rites\" (Paul Hamlyn, Greek Mythology, London England: Paul Hamlyn Limited, 1967, pp. 109, 114). In Rome he is called Liber or B acchus. The Lydians label him Bassareus and in Persia he is identified as Mith ras, where astrology is practiced by his followers. He is Zagreus to the Cretan s and \"became an underworld divinity who welcomed the souls of the dead to Hades and helped with their purification.\" Paul Hamlyn also informs that since Zagreus was killed and resurrected (in mythology) he \"became the symbol of everlasting life\" (Paul Hamlyn, Greek Mythology, London England: Paul Hamlyn Limited, 1967, p. 113). The Phrygians know Osiris as Sabazius wh ere he is honored as a solar deity (a sun god) who was represented by horns , and his emblem was a serpent (Paul Hamlyn, Greek Mythology, London England: Paul Hamlyn Limited, 1967, p. 112)! In other places he went by other names, such as Deouis, The Boy Jupiter, The Centaur, Orion, The Boy Plutus, Iswara, The Winged One, Nimrod, Adoni, Hermes, Prometheus, Po seidon, Butes, Dardanus, Himeros, Imbros, Iasius, Zeus, Iacchus, Hu, Thor, Bel, Serapis, Ormuzd, Apollo, Thammus, Altus, Hercules, and believe it or not, Ba'al! Most of these gods were considered to be solar deities or sun-gods. The Worship of the Sun, disguised through the use of gods and symbols, plays a very important role in Masonry, which is simply Illuminism in disguise! Is it not strange that, thou sands of years ago, men worshipped the Sun, and that today that worship continues am ong the Parsee Jews? Originally they looked beyond the orb to the invisi ble God, of whom the Sun's light, seemingly identical with generation a nd life, was the manifestation and outflowing. Long before the Chaldean sh epherds watched it on their plains, it came up regularly, as it now does, in the morning, like a god, and again sank, like a king retiring, in the west, to return ag ain in due time in the same array of majesty. We worship Immutability. It was that steadfast, i mmutable character of the Sun that the men of Ba'albec worshippe d. His light-giving and life-giving powers were secondary attributes. The one grand idea that compelled worship was the characteris tic of God which they sa w reflected in his light and fancied they saw in its originalit y the changelessness of Deity. He had seen thrones crumble, earthquakes shake the world and hurl down mountains. Beyond Olympus, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, he had gone daily to his abode, and had come daily again in the morning to behold the temples they built to hi s worship. They personifi ed him as Brahma, Amun, Osiris, Bel, Adonis, Malkarth, Mithras, and Apollo; and the nations that did so grew old and died. Moss grew on the capitals of the great columns of his temples, and he shone on the moss. Grain by grain the dust of his"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"temples crumbled and fell, and was borne off on the wind, and still he shone on crumbling column and archit rave. The roof fell crashing on the pavement, and he shone in on the Holy of Holies with unchanging rays. \"It was not strange that men worshippe d the Sun . . . Har-oeri was the god of Time, as well as of Life. The Egypti an legend was that the King of Byblos cut down the tamarisk-tree containing th e body of Osiris, and made of it a column for his palace . . . The Supr eme Being of the Egyptians was Amun, a secret and concealed God, the Unknow n Father of the Gnostics (Jews), the Source of Divine Life, and of all force, the Plenitude of all, comprehending all things in Himself, th e original Light. He creates nothing; but everything emanates from Him: and all other Gods are but his manifestations. From Him, by the uttera nce of a Word, (the Secret Word of the Masons), emanated Neith, the Divine Mother of all things, the Primitive Thought, the Force that puts everythi ng in movement, the Spirit everywhere extended, the Deity of Light and Mother of the Sun. Of this Supreme Being, Osiris was the image, S ource of all Good in the moral and physical world, and constant foe of Typhon, the Genius of Evil, the Satan of Gnosticism (Judaism), brut e matter, deemed to be always at feud with the spirit that flowed from the Deity; and over whom Har-Oeri, the Redeemer, Son of Isis and Osiris , is finally to prevail . . . From Egypt, the Mysteries went to P hoenicia, and were celebrated at Tyre. Osiris changed his name, and become Adoni or Dionusos, still the representative of the Sun; and afterw ard these Mysteries were introduced successively into Assyria, Babylon, Pe rsia, Greece, Sicily, and Italy. In Greece and Sicily, Osiris took the name of Bacchus, and Isis that of Ceres, Cybele, Rhea and Venus . . . The Pri esthood possessed one third of Egypt. They gained much of their influence by means of the Mysteries, and spared no means to impress the people with a full sense of their importance . . . Egypt received the legend from Chaldea , and the Hebrews received the Mysteries from the Egyptians; and of course were familiar with their legend, known as it was to those Egyp tian Initiates, Joseph and Moses. It was the fable (or rather the truth clot hed in allegory and figures) of Osiris, the Sun, Source of Light and Principl e of Good, and Typhon, the Principle of Darkness and Evil. . . Osiris, said to have been an ancient King of Egypt, was the Sun; and Isis, his wife, the Moon: and his history recounts, in poetical and figurative style, the annua l journey of the Great Luminary of Heaven through the different Signs of the Zodiac. In the absence of Osiris, Typhon, his brother, filled with en vy and malice, sought to usurp his throne; but his plans were frustrated by Isis. Then he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did, by persuading him to en ter a coffin or sarcophagus, which he then flung into the Nile. After a long search, Isis found the body, and concealed it in the depths of a forest; but Typhon, finding it there, cut it into"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"fourteen pieces, and scattered them hi ther and thither. After tedious search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes having eaten the other (the privates), which she replaced of w ood, and buried the body at Philae; where a temple of surpassing magnificence was erected in honor of Osiris. Isis, aided by her son Orus, Horus or Har-oeri, warred against Typhon, slew him, reigned gloriously, and at her d eath was reunited to her husband, in the same tomb . . . When Isis first found the body, where it had floated ashore near Byblos, a shrub of erica or tamarisk near it had, by the virtue of the body, shot up into a tree around it, and protected it; and hence our (Illuminati Masons) sprig of acacia. Isis was also aided in her search by Anubis, in the shape of a dog. He was Sirius or the Dog-Star, the friend and counsellor of Osiris, and the inventor of language, grammar, astronomy, su rveying, arithmetic, music, and medical science; the first maker of laws; and who ta ught the worship of the Gods, and the building of Temples. In the Mysteries, the nailing up of the body of Osiris in the chest or ark was termed the aphanism, or disappearance (of the Sun at the Winter Solstice {the so-called Christian Christmas}, below the Tropic of Ca pricorn), and the recovery of the different parts of his body by Isis, the Euresis, or finding . . . The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus, seem to have been the model of all other ceremonies of (Illuminati and Masonr y) subsequently established among the different peoples of the world . . . for the ancients held that the Ceres of the Greeks was the same as the Isis of the Egyptians; and Dionusos or Bacchus as Osiris. The legend of Osiris and Isis, as given by Plutarch, contains many more details and circumstances than those we have briefly mentioned; and all of which we need not repeat here. Osiris married his sister Isis; and labored publicly with her to amelio rate the lot of men. He taught them agriculture, while Isis invented laws. He built temples to the Gods, and established their worship. Both were the patrons of ar tists and their usef ul inventions; and introduced the use of iron for defe nsive weapons and implements of agriculture, and of gold to adorn th e temples of the Gods. He went forth with an army to conquer men to estab lish civilization, teaching the people whom he overcame to plant the vine and sow grain fo r food. Typhon, his borther, slew him when the sun was in the sign of the Scorpion, that is to say, at the Autumnal Equinox. They had been rival claimants, says Synesius, for the throne of Egypt, as Light and Darkness contend ever for the empire of the world. Plutarch adds, that at th e time when Osiris was slain, the moon was at it s full; and therefore it was the sign opposite the Scorpion, that is, the Bull, the sign of the Vernal Equinox . . . Then followed a chest or ark, magnificiently orname nted, containing an image of the organs of generation of Osiris, or perhaps of bot h sexes; emblems of the original generating and producing Powers."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"According to the Egyptian fable, wh en Typhon cut the body of Osiris into pieces, he flung his genitals into the N ile, where a fish devoured them . . .

Os iris, Husband of Isis, was the God of Cultivation and Benefactor of Men, pouring on them and on the earth the choicest blessings within the gift of the Divinity. Opposed to him was Typhon, his antagonist in the Egyptian mythology, as Ahriman was the foe of Ormuzd, the Good Principle, in theology of the Persians . . . It was held that we owed to Osiris and Isis: civilization, the discovery of agriculture, laws, arts of all kinds, religious worship, temples, the invention of letters, astronomy, the gymnastic ar ts, and music; and thus they were the universal benefactors. Osiris trave lled to civilize the countries which he passed through, and communicate to th em his valuable discoveries. He built cities, and taught me n to cultivate the earth. Wheat and wine were his first presents to men. Europe, Asia and Africa partook of the blessings which he communicated, and the most remote regions of India remembered him, and claimed him as one of their great gods . . . Osiris was the same god known as B acchus, Dionusos, and Serapis . . . Bacchus, jointly with Ceres (identifie d by Herodotus with Isis) presides over the distribution of all our blessings; and from the two emanates everything beautiful and good in Nature . . .\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, pp. 77, 80, 281, 313, 375, 377, 477). We could have gone on for pages but I believe that this should suffi ce to show that one of the great gods of the Illuminati is Osiris or Lucifer or Sa tan or the Devil under the name Hiram Abiff), that the Masons pay honor in the third degree. The Drama for this degree (Master Mason) involves a death and resurrection ceremony. The Master-Mason-to-be is said to be working on Solomon's Temple. He is in possession of the name of God (the \"Lost Word\" of Masonry) and he has promised to reveal this to the other workers when the Temple is finished. Since the wages are higher for tho se who possess this name, the other workers become jealous and insist that he reveal the name to them before the Temple is finished. When he refu ses to do so, three angry ruffians kill and hastily bury him. Eventually his gr ave is discovered and, after the third attempt, he is raised to life again. The first word he spoke is the substitute for the \"Lost Word\" and it is this word that is sai d to be passed down to Master Masons today (Shaw and M ckenney, pp. 150-151). In the third degree, the climax of the ceremony is the mock murder and resurrection of Hiram Abiff, the \"Christ\" of Masonry. This is made as solemn as the factual nature of the thing will pe rmit. But it is a religious ceremony, a resurrection service, by which the candidate beco mes entitled to eternal life."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"In a sense it is to Masonry what the resurrection of Christ is in Christianity.\"Few Candidates may be aw are that Hiram, whom they have represented and personified, is ideal ly and precisely the same as Christ. Yet such is undoubtedly the case. This old philosophy shows what Christ as a glyph menas, and how the Christ st ate results from r eal initiation, or from the evolution of th e human into the divine\" (Mystic Masonry, p. 248). Any one who is familiar with Egyptian mythology should be able to see the correlation between the myth of Hi ram Abiff and of the Egyptian god, Osiris. Pierson contends: \"We readily recognize in Himram Abiff the Osiris of the Egyptians . . .\"(Shaw and McKe nney, p. 153). \"In Egypt the dead man was identified with Osiris, and a ddressed as Osiris\" (Geoffrey Parrinder, ed., World Religions from Ancien t History to the Present, New York; Facts on File Publications, 1971, p. 176. See also \"Osiris,\" The World Book Encyclopedia, 1961 ed. Vol. 13, p. 654). Waite acknowledges that: \"There is no question that the Myth of Osiris covers the Whole Story of mystical li fe and is presented in the Funerary Ritual (the death and resurrection ceremony of the third degree) as the soul's own story. There is no more eloquent valediction to the departing soul than that which says: Thou hast gone living to Osiris. The promise is life in Osiris. The great doctrine, th e great revelation of all the true Mysteries is that Osiris lives . . . We also as Mason look forward to union of the departed with Osiris . . .\" (Waite, op. ci t., Vol. II, p. 169) The Late Rev. Alexander Hislop relate d: \"It is admitted that the secret system of Freemasonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris. But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architectur e, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for hi s success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building? Now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have alread y seen, Egypt stood to Babylon, who would naturally be looked up to ther e as the great patr on of the Masonic art\" (The Two Babylons, p. 43)? These Masonic authors realize that the ceremonies are only based on Myths or Fables. Collier's Encyclopedia states: \"Masonry fosters an elaborate Mythology . . .\" (Collier's Encyclopedia, op. cit., p. 338) But since they have turned from the trut h, there is only the False left. W.L. Wilmshurst, a Mason, points out: \"It matters nothing whether the prototype be one whose historical actuality a nd identity can be demonstrated, or whether he can be regarded Only as Lege ndary or Mythical . . . In Egypt the prototype was Osiris, who was slain by his malignant brother Typhon, but whose mangled limbs were collected in a coffer from which he emerged"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"reintegrated and Divinized. In Gr eece the prototype was Bacchus, who was torn to pieces by the Titans. Baldur in Scandinavia and Mithra in Graeco- Roman Europe were similar prototypes. In Masonry the prototype is Hiram Abiff . . .\" (Wilmshurst , op. cit., p. 142) Many Masons believe that they are acting out the death and resurrection ritual of Christ. Even if this were the case, which it is not, this ritual would be blasphemous for a Christian, but these Masons are actually acting out the Myth of Osiris and Isis, two Pagan deities of Egypt. Isis was considered to be \"supreme in Magical power . . .\" (Isis, Encyclopedia Britannica, 1964 ed., Vol. 12, p. 703) and \"she was the goddess of . . . Magic.\" Osiris committed incest by marrying his sister , Isis, so those portraying him are not very righteous characters, are they? Also, several symbols in the Lodge that Masons should readily recogni ze are the sun, the point within a circle, the Tau Cross, and the All- Seeing Eye, all symbols representing Osiris! (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, pp. 15, 377, 401, 405, 504, etc). Not only do Masons rely on fables, but th ey also take the place of Christ. In the 19th degree of the Scottish Rite, called \"Grand Pontiff,\" Masons attend a pageant in which part of the book of Revelation is enacted. Waite recounts this drama: \"Amidst darkness and isolation thereafter the officers of the chapter proclaim the dominion of the beast, the opening of the seven vials of Revelation and the fall of Babylon . . . The Candidate is brought into light and is shown the four-square ci ty coming down out of Heaven . . . while He who sits upon the throne, through He is called the Lord God Almighty and Redeemer, is not the Christ of St. John . . . The Candidate is anointed with oil, is made and procla imed a priest forever according to the Order of Melchizedek. . . . The New Jerusalem is interpreted as Ancient Masonry.\" (Waite, op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 342-343) Although Delmar Darrah, a 33rd degree Mason, assures us that \"there never has been any conflict between the church and Freemasonry\" (Darrah, op. cit., p. 298), we ca n see several points of Conflict between the pageantry of the degree of Gr and Pontiff and the Bible. First, we notice that the person who sits on the throne is Called \"The Lord God Almighty and Redeemer,\" but he \"i s NOT the Christ of St. John.\" If he is NOT the Christ of the Bible, th en who is he? Read on and you will discover who the god of Masonry Really Is! Second, we see that the Mason is anointed with oil and proclaimed \"a priest forever according to the Order of Melchizedek.\" Hebrews 5:5 and 9 clearly states that \"Christ glorified NOT Himself to be made an high priest\" but was \"called of God an high priest after the order of Melchizedek.\" But Masons gl orify Themselves and take on themselves"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"the honor of the priest hood that was gi ven to Christ Alone. Third, notice that Masons interpret the \"New Jerusalem\" as \"Ancient Masonry!\" The 25th degree of the Scottish Rite is called \"Knight of the Brazen Serpent.\" Again Waite describes this degree and reveals to us that the twelve signs of the Zodiac are illust rated and a Tau Cross, encompassed by a Serpent is in the East. The Master retires to call upon God and then . . . \"returns bearing a Symbol of Salvati on, being a Brazen Serpent entwined about the Tau Cross . . . It is given thereafter to th e Candidate, as a symbol of faith, repentance and mercy\" (Waite, op. cit., p. 440). Again we can see conflict between the degrees of Masonry and the Bible. The Bible warns against astrology, yet the Lodge is set up in such a way as to correspond with the twelve signs of the Zodiac, which is astrology. We also notice that the symbol of sal vation is the \"Brazen Serpent!\" Once again Christ is set aside for A nother symbol of salvation. The Bible specifies that the Serpent represents Sa tan, but Masonry uses the Serpent as a Symbol of Salvation! In conjunction with the Serp ent, let's look at the Masonic apron. Wilmshurst writes: \"Brethren, I charge you to regard your Apron as one of the Most Precious a nd speaking symbols our Order has to give you\" (Wilmshurst, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 38). This statement is quite intriguing. When Adam and Eve sinned, they sewed together an apron of fig leaves. We find however, God Was No t Pleased with the aprons, and He made the Coats of skin to clothe them (Genesis 3:7, 21); but Waite indicates \"in Craft Masonry and its c onnection, the Apron is the Only Proper and Possible Clot hing\" (Waite, op. cit. , Vol. II, p. 38). In the first degree of Masonry the ca ndidate is given an unadorned white apron which indicates purity of soul (Wilmshurst, op. cit., p. 136). In the second degree blue Rosettes are added to the apron to indicate that progress has been made in regenerati on. In the third degree Wilmshurst explains that: \". . . still further pr ogress is emblematized by the increased blue adornments of the Apron, as also by its silver tassels and the Silver Serpent is the Emblem of Divine Wi sdom knitting the soul's new-made vesture together\" (Wilmshurst. See also Pike, op. cit., p. 496). The newly initiated Mason is instructed that his white apron is the \"Most Precious\" symbol of Masonry and that it re presents purity. We must remember, however, that this ap ron is a Symbol. What then, is the Real Meaning be hind this object? To find out we must return to Mythology. Pike notes that the god Jupiter Ammon's picture was painted with the sign of th e Ram or Lamb (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 407). He mentions that Jupiter Ammon is \"the same as Osiris, Adoni, Adonis, Atys, and the other Sun Gods . . .\" Hutchinson also notes that"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Jupiter Ammon is \"painted with horns \" (Hutchinson, op. cit., p. 82). And that he is the \"same as Ba'al or Mo loch . . . (and) Adonis, whom some ancient authors call Osiris\" (ibid. pp. 82-83). His ceremonies \"consisted in clothing the Initiate with the skin of a white lamb. And in this we see the Origin of the Apron of wh ite sheep-skin used in Masonry\" (Pike, op. cit). So, the Apron was used in connection with the ceremonies of Osiris and this apron is the \"only proper\" clothing, according to Waite. Also notice that in the third degree a Serpent is added to the Apron and that it is an Emblem of Divine Wisdom! The En tered Apprentice's Handbook points out that: \". . . the Serpent is regarded as 'The Shining One' -- the Holy wisdom itself. Thus we see that the Serpent on our apron denotes that we are encircled by the Holy Wisdom . . . The snake is peculiarly associated with (the Hindu god) Shiva, the D estroyer, whose close symbolic association with the third (Masonic) de gree is obvious. . . He is depicted making the (sign) of a Master Mason\" (Dave Hunt and Ed Decker, The God Makers: A Shocking Expose of What the Mormon Church Really Believes; Eugene, Oregon: Harvest House Publishers, 1984, p. 197). Another god, Shiva, is no w introduced into the Pantheon of Masonry. Shiva (or Siva) has numerous wives and, . . . \"wanders naked about the countryside on his white bull Na ndi, overindulging in drugs, and encouraging starvation and self-mutila tion. The innermost sanctuaries of Shiva temples always feature a lingam, the stylized erect phallus which symbolizes his rampant sexuality\" (Bob Larson, Larson's Book of Cults, Wheaton, Illinois: Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. 1982, p. 75). The Serpent is quite prevalent and impor tant in Masonry. When Jim Shaw, a former Mason who has left Masonry, we nt to the Temple to receive his 33rd degree, he reported: \". . . the thi ng that is most noticeable is the way the walls are decorated with Serpents . There are all kinds, some very long and large. Many of the Scottish Rite degrees include the representation of Serpents and I recognized them among those decorating the walls.\" (Shaw and McKenney, op. cit., p. 102) Albert Pike devotes page after page of his book to the prevalence and worship of Serpents. He discloses that, \"The Phoenicians called the serpent agathodemon (the good spirit) . . .\" (Pike, op. cit., p. 495); \"In reality, the hawk-headed Serpent, geni us of Light, or G ood genius, was the symbol of the Sun. The horned Serp ent was the hieroglyphic for a God.\" Two other names for Osiris are Bel and Hu. Pike relates to us that, \"The Gr eeks call Bel 'Beliar ,' and Hesychius interprets that word to mean a Dra gon or great Serpent\" (ibid. pp. 499-500) and \"The British God Hu was called 'The Dragon was cast out, that old"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Serpent, called the Devil, and Sata n, who deceives the whole world... \" (Revelation 12:9) Other connections to Satan can be found. Pike, writing about the pagan god Thor, reveals that \"Thor was the Sun, the Egyptian Osiris and Kneph, the Phoenician Bel or Ba'al\" (ibid. p. 368). Bel (or Ba'al) was believed to be the \"lord of the air\" (\"Bel,\" Encyclopedia Britannica, 1964 ed. Vol. 3, p. 410) as well as sun-god (Texe Marrs, Mystery Mark of the New Age: Satan's Design for World Domination, Westchester, Illinois: Crossway Books, 1988, p. 91). Remember also that the god Ba'al is a synonym for the Devil (Stephen Knight, The Brotherhood: The Secret World of the Freemasons, Briacliff Manor, New York: Stein and Da y, 1984, p. 236). Ba'al; \"had the body of a spider and three heads, tho se of a man, a toad and a cat.\" This god, under the name of Thor, is called; \"the Prince of the Power of the Air\" (Pike, op. cit). Ba'al worship is condemned by the Bi ble, (1 Kings 16:30- 33; 22:53; 2 Kings 17:16) and in Ephesians we find that Satan is called the \"prince of the power of the air.\" Not onl y does Satan have the same title as is given to the god Thor, but we should notice that the word \"Thor\" means \"thunder\" (Einar Haugen, \"Thor,\" The World Book Encyclopedia, 1961 ed., Vol. 17, p. 204). Thor \"was the god of lightning a nd thunder in Norse mythology.\" This is a significant statement, for satanist s use the lighting bolt as a symbol of Satan. Satanic rock groups also use the symbol, called a \"Satanic S,\" which resembles a lightning bolt and is probably taken from the reference in Luke 10:18 where Jesus says: \"I be held Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" (Max Wood, Rock and Roll: An Analysis of the Music, n. p., n. d., p. 28). One of these Satanic rock groups called KISS (the name stands for Knights in Satan's Service) (ibid. p. 30) has a song on one of their albums entitled \"God of Thunder.\" This song claims:- I was raised by the demons, A modern day man of steel, Trained to reign as the one, I gather darkness to please me, God of Thunder and Rock and Roll, I command you to kneel, The sound you're under, Before the god of thunder, Will slowly rob you of your virgin soul. The god of rock and roll, (ibid."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"p. 31) I'm the Lord of the Wasteland. This god is obviously Satan. Is it any wonder that the Bible further Informs us that this \"prince of th e power of the air\" is \"the spirit that now worketh in the Children of Disobedien ce . . ?\" (Ephesians 2:2) Since the gods of Masonry (Thor, Ba'al, Shiva, Pan, Osiris, etc.) actually represent Satan in different camouf lages, and since the Serpent is widespread in Masonry, and the Bible clearly states that the Serpent is Satan, we see that the Masons are in actuality worshipping Satan (Lucifer). Of course, Masonic writers themsel ves plainly confess to us who they worship! Who is it? None other than Satan (Lucifer)! Hutchinson gives the following comment about the fall of man: \"But alas, he (Adam) fell! By disobedience he forfeited all his glor y and felicity; and, wonderful to recount in the midst of this exalted stat e, Satan prevailed\" (Hutchinson, op. cit., pp. 47-48). The footnote on this sentence gives this explanation: \"Thus originated the introduction of a serpent among the symbols of Freemasonry . . . Serpent-worship derives its origin from the same source\" (ibid. p. 48). Another footnote elsewhere in this book is a quote from Key to the New Testament, which states in part: \" The corruptions flowing from the Egyptian philosophy, when adapted to Christianity, were these: they held that the god of the Jews was the De miurgus . . . the serpent who deceived Eve ought to be honored for endeavoring to rescue men from their slavery to the Demiugus\" (ibid. p. 85). The Mason's God Is Lucifer: Pike brags: \"Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the sp irit of darkness! Lucifer, The Son of The Morning! [Here Pike is denying Ch rist as the Light of the world and giving that designation to Lucifer, the Dev il] Is it he who bears the light . .? Doubt it Not!\" (Pike, op. cit., p. 321. See also A Ralph Epperson, The Unseen Hand: An Introduction to the Conspiratorial Vi ew of History, Tucson, Arizona, Publius Press, 1985, p. 224). Masonic testimony is clear that the serpent or Satan (Lucifer) should be worshipped. In fact, the \"Lost Word\" of Masonry has to do with Satan. Masons have been in search of a so- called \"Lost Word\" which is supposed to be the Real name of God, but h as been lost. In the third degree the Mason is given a substitute word and told to look \"to that bright and Morning Star . . .\" (Waite , op. cit., Vol. I, p. 424)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Waite suggests that the Word revealed in the third degree \"was of similar value to our old friend Abracadabra\" (ibid. Vol. II, p. 468). He mentions elsewhere that: \". . . since the sphere of Ritual is also a sphere of sorcery, on proceeding to initiation he is given the symbol Abracadabra...and is told it is the True Word\" (ibid. p. 415). Most people know that the word \"abr acadabra\" has to do with Magic, but did you know that this word comes fr om Abraxas (Hutchinson, op. cit., p. 80)? Abraxas, by the way, is a demon! Masons are actually taught that this demon is the True Word. However, this word is only a substitute. Then, in the 13th degree (Royal Arch) he is gi ven the name of the \"Lost Word\" of Masonry. Let's see, first of all, who is the \"Bri ght and Morning Star\" and then let's look at the \"Lost Word\" and who is represented thereby. Revelation 22:16 explains: \"I, Jesus . . . am the root and offspring of David, and The Bright and Morning Star.\" Now, do the Masons worship Jesus as the \"bright and Morning Star?\" There are several reasons why this answer is \"NO!\" One reason is that everything in the lodge is symbolical of something else, so if the \"B right and Morning Star\" is Ch rist in reality, it is only a symbol to the Mason. In additi on, Wilmshurst admits that \"Hebrew Biblical names represent not persons, but personifications of spiritual principles . . .\" (Wilms hurst, op. cit., p. 127). There is a greater reason, however, th at we know that the \"bright and morning star\" is not Christ, and that is from Masonic testimony. Waite, describing one picture in his book, anal yzes it as: \"There is a globe in her right hand on which is balanced a Ge nius, holding a torch, and said to typify the Morning Star or Lucifer . . . From a Masonic point of view, the symbol in its plenary sense is th e coming forth of conquering Light\" (Waite, Vol. I, p. ix). Masonic testimony points out that the morning star is \"Lucifer\" and that this symbol represents the \"coming forth of conquering light.\" So, when Masons speak of the light of Masonry, th ey are actually referring to Lucifer bringing forth the light. Lucifer, as yo u may already know, means \"Light Bearer\" or \"Light Bringer.\" The Bible also informs us Sa tan (Lucifer) comes as \"an angel of light\" (II Corinthians 11:14). As mentioned earlier, another name for Osiris is Mithras. According to The World Book Encyclopedia, Mithras \"was an angel of light who fought on the side of the god Ahura-Mazda. . . The Zoroastrian scriptures called Mithras 'the Heavenly Light'\" (Mithras, The World Book Encyclopedia, 1961 ed., Vol. 12, p. 566). The Romans created a super-cult, usi ng the forms of the secret cult of Mithra, under which they tried to co llect all existing religions. It was"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"supposed to be the perfect instrume ntum regni that would have stopped the spread of Christianity and assured creation of a global empire. Diocletian, the last of the persecuti ng emperors, issued four edicts of persecution which called for the destru ction of Christia n places of worship and books, the humiliation of Christia n clergy and execution of clerics and Christians who did not sacrifice to Roman gods, officially recognized Mithras as the protector of the Ro man Empire . . . an awful massacre followed (C. Osborne Ward II, The Ancient Lowly (1910), p. 668). The hammer and sickle on the Communist flag is a Mithraic symbol. The Roman oligarchy took over the symbol and u sed many of the cults, as the Masters of Communism have done in this pr esent day, but the whole structure collapsed. Mithras was also identified with the Sun. The mention of Ahura- Mazda is interesting for it is this god that the lecture of the 32nd degree of Masonry deals with. In this lecture Ahura-Mazd a is called the \"spirit of light\" (Shaw and McKenney, op. cit., p. 156). The Masons are then instructed to: \"Look to the East, my brothers . . . and behold the seven-pointed star, the great symbol of this degree, with the seven colors of the rainbow. The seven colors and seven points represent the seven potencies of Ahura. Observe no w the great Delta of Pythagoras consisting of 36 light arranged in eight ro ws to form an equilateral triangle. The light of the apex of the Delta re presents Ahura-Mazda, Source of all Light\" (Shaw and McKenney). The lecture continues and the Masons ar e told that the \"trilateral name for god is composed of\" (ibid. p. 157) three Hindu gods: Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva. Siva (or Shiva), by the way, is a synonym for Satan! In fact, Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, lists Shiva, Lucifer and Pan (among others) in his Satanic Bible as Synon yms for Satan! (Constance Cumbey, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow : The New Age Movement and Our Coming of Age of Barbarism, Shreveport, Louisiana: Huntington House, Inc., 1983, p. 136). Lucifer, then, is the god honored and rever ed by masons as The True God! J. Edward Decker, Jr., a former Mason, gives us a quote from Albert Pike, a 33rd degree Mason. On July 14, 1889, Pike gave instructions to the 23 Supreme Councils of the World: \"That which we must say to the crowd is, We worship a God, but it is the god that one adores without superstition. To you Sovereign Grand Inspectors Genera l (the name of the 33rd degree, the highest degree known to the world in Scottish Rite Masonry), we say this, that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd, 31st, and 30th degrees. The Masonic Religion should be, by all of us initia tes of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of th e Luciferian Doctrine . . . Yes, Lucifer is God . . . the pure philos ophical religion is the belief in Lucifer . . . Lucifer,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"God of Light and God of Good . . .\" (Decker, op. cit., p. 6). With this admission, is it any wonder that Pike is called the \"Pontiff of Luciferian Freemasonry\" (Waite, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 253)? In addition, he is adored by Masonic authors such as Waite, who brags: \"I believe . . . his name will be . . . of Precious Memory in all American Masonry\" (ibid. p. 278). In fact, Morals and Dogma, a book written by Pi ke, is the handbook for Masons. When Jim Shaw earned his 32 nd degree, he, as well as the others present, were given, \". . . a copy of Albert Pike's book . . . We were told that it was The source book for Freemasonr y and its meaning. We were also told that it must never leave our possession, and that arrangements must be made so that upon our deaths it woul d be returned to the Scottish Rite.\" (Shaw and McKenney, op. cit., p. 62) Also, C. Fred Kleinknecht, a 33rd de gree Mason related: \". . . told all Masons that last January that one pa rticular book was to be their daily guide for living, their 'Bible.'\" That book, said Kleinknecht, is Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma (Texe Marrs, Masons Are A Secret New Age Cult, Flashpoint March 1990, p. 3). The majority of Masons in the first few degrees are not aware of the god of Masonry, yet Hutchinson boasts that, \"the first state of a Mason is representa tive of the first st age of worship of the True God \" (Hutchinson, op. cit., pp. 101, 209). He highly insinuates that those outsi de of the Masonic ranks are not worshipping The True God! The Masons have been taught that this true god is called the \"Grand Architect of the Universe\" and that anyone who believes in \"a\" Supreme Being may join Masonry. They have been advised that there is no conflict between Christ ianity and Masonry. To hide the fact of who their god is, those entering Mas onry must enact strange rituals, if asked who he believes in and must an swer \"In God\" and only after the candidate has completed the 13th degree is he told the name of the \"Lost Word.\" Why must this word be kept secret for so long? The answer is that if the word and its meaning were revealed to the candidate in the beginning, he most likely would never have joined up! What is the \"Lost Word?\" Waite indicated that the \"Lost Word\" has to do with Wisdom, and that \"Wisdom in this case is a synonym of the Word . . .\" (Waite, op. cit., p. 470). Before I give you the \"Lost Word\" le t me remind you that Wilmshurst claims that \"the Serpent is the embl em of Divine Wisdom\" (Wilmshurst, op. cit., p. 136), and the Lost Word is a sy nonym for Wisdom, so this Word has to do with the Serpent! We ll, the secret Word is \"Jao-Bul-On,\" the secret"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"name of the demonic god of Masonry, the \"Lost Word\" in the rite of the Royal Arch Degree. You may wonder, \"What does that mean?\" \"Jao\" is the Greek name for the god of the Chaldean Gnosti cs, laldebaoth or lao. \"Bul\" is a Syriac word which means \"Ba'al,\" who was a Can aanite fertility god associated with licentious rites and magic (K night, op. cit., p. 236). Ba 'al is actually another name for the Devil! \"On\" is the Babyl onian name of the Egyptian \"Osiris,\" the god of the underworld. So, here agai n, we can see Satan is deified and honored by the Masons. We are told further (in the ritual of the 13th degree) that this \"triune essence of the Deity,\" (C. Penney Hunt , op. cit., p. 18) represents \"His creative preservative, and de-creative powers.\" This sentence gives a very vivid description of the Hindu gods. In the pagan religion of Hinduism, we also see the \"trinity\" of three gods , Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. Wait e explains: \"Siva (or Shiva) is the Babylonian Bel, identical with the s un-god I.A.O.\" -- the trinity of Isis, Apophis and Osiris. (Waite, op. cit., p. 405). The World Book Encyclopedia states that Bel is \"another name for the god Ba'al,\" (Bel, The World Book Encyclopedia, 1961 ed. Vol. 2, p. 173) and Ba'a l is another name for Satan, so Satan is being worshipped through th e Masonic ritual, for Shiva, the god with \"de-creative powers,\" is just anot her name for Satan! One more name for Satan is Pan. \"He// was half man and half goat . . .\" (Pan, The World Book Encyclopedia, 1961 ed., Vol. 14, p. 93) and he is \"usually shown with goat feet, curly hair, short horns, a nd a beard.\" An occult catalog from International Imports mentions: (Interna tional Imports, op. cit., p. 115) \"In Greek mythology Pan was the god of nature . . . He is al so equated with Satan and life's baser aspects.\" On ce again we can see that Masonry"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"honors Satan, for Hutchinson confesses: \"The knowledge of the god of nature forms the first estate of our prof ession . . .\" (Hutchin son, op. cit, p. 62). He also points out that the god of nature was adored under the names of Osiris and Isis (t he wife/sister of Os iris) (ibid. p. 115). Yes, Lucifer (Satan) is the God of Masonry and the so-called \"God of Light.\" Wilmshurst tries to convince us that: \"Christian and Masonic doctrine are identical in intention t hough different in method. The one says 'Via Crucis;' the other 'Via Lucis;' yet the two ways are but one way\" (Willmshurst, pp. 209-210). \"Via Crucis \" means \"by way of the Cross\" and \"Via Lucis\" means \"by way of light.\" These two ways cannot be identical. One way follows the way of the Cr oss of Christ, which leads to reconciliation; the other follows the way of the light of Lucifer, which leads to death. Isn't it plan to see which path the Masons are on? 33rd Degree Mason ties Bush's New World Order to All-Seeing Eye: James G. Martin, a 33rd Degree Mason, who as Governor of North Carolina and a leading Republican Party big-wig, has warmly praised President's Bush's plans for a \"New World Order.\" Writ ing in Raleigh's daily newspaper, The News and Observer (March 24, 1991), Martin st ated: \"President George Bush . . . has revitalized an old but timely idea; the r ealization of a New World Order.\" Martin noted that this was the same visionary idea as depicted on our U.S. one-dollar bill , the all-seeing eye above the pyramid with the Latin inscription below of Novus Ordo Seclorum. This, Martin explained, is interpreted as either \"A New World Order of the Age,\" a \"New Secular (or worldly) Order\" or simply a \"New World Order.\" Unfortunately, in his article Governor Martin failed to tell readers the se significant facts: That the pyramid and its all-seeing eye was first printed on the U.S. dollar bill in the 1930s at the insistence of the Jewish President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Mason, and his vice- president, Henry Wallace. Wallace, a fellow Mason as well as an ardent communist-Illuminist, later ran for president as a Socialist (Texx Marrs, Flashpoint, April/May, 1991). Former President Bush knows what Novus Ordo Seclorum means: President Bush, on July 2, 1989 stat ed: \"That desire for freedom from tyranny inspired the world and still do es. Look on the back of any dollar bill and you'll see it. The Great Seal of the United States bears the motto, 'Novus Ordo Seclorum,' meaning a 'New Order of the Ages'\" (Parade Magazine, July 2, 1989). Former President Bush spoke before the United Nations on October 1, 1990, where he confirmed his support of World Government by the year 2000 A.D. \"We (members of the U.N.) must join together in a New Compact, all of us, to bring the Un ited Nations into the 21st century . . . The calendar offers up a convenient milestone, a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nations. The year 2000 marks a turning point,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"beginning the turn of the millennium . . . The United Nations can help bring about a New Day . . . to press forw ard To Cap an Historic Movement towards 'A New World Order'\" (The New York Times, October 2, 1990, A-6) This left-hand side of the dollar bill also contains a py ramid with the all- seeing eye above it. You will also notice that the capstone (or cornerstone) has been removed and that the all-seei ng (Illuminati) eye has replaced it. Sharon Boyd, proclaims: \"Ancient Freemasonry employed the triangle, usually in connection with the all- seeing eye. Throughout the entire system of Masonry, no symbol is more importa nt in its significance; it is the Masonic symbol of the 'Gr and Architect of the Uni verse.' The entire symbol of the Eye of Providence (the all-seeing eye) in the Radiant Triangle forms a cornerstone of the unfinished pyramid\" (Sharon Boyd, Occult America: The U.S. Founded on Occultism, No t Christianity, What Is, Vol. 1, No. 2, p. 13). The Bible specifies that Jesus is th e Chief Cornerstone, but He was rejected (Matthew 21:42; 1 Peter 2: 6-7; Psalm 118:22; Mark 12:10; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11). This is quite evide nt by looking at the picture; the cornerstone has been removed or rejected and has been replaced by the all-seeing eye; a symbol of Illumi nism and Satan! Not only do these symbols actually represent the Masoni c god, Lucifer, but there is also another meaning behind them. These symbols, as well as others, h ave sexual connotations! For example, let's look at the point wi thin a circle. When a pers on enters Masonry, he is told that the point within a circle repr esents: \". . . the individual Mason (the point), continued and restricted by the boundary line of his duty (the circle). Its Real Meaning, however, is that of phallus, pos itioned within the female generative principle (sex organ) in sexual union, the climactic act of sun-worship\" (Shaw and McKenney, p. 144). Albert Mackey, a Mason (\"The real chie fs of this immen se association of Freemasonry (the few within the innermost circles of initiation), who must not be confounded with the nominal l eaders or figure-heads, are mostly Jews, and live in close and intimate al liance with the militant members of Judaism, those, namely, who are the l eaders of the Cabalistic section. This Rite of the Masonic associ ation, these real chiefs, who are known to so few even of the initiated, and whom even these few know only under assumed names (noms de guerre) carry on thei r activities in secret dependence (which they find very lucrative fo r themselves) upon the Cabalistic Jews\" (Le Juif, la Judaisme, et la Ju daisation des Peuples Christians (Paris, 1869, p. 340) an authority, writes: \"The point within a circle is an interesting and important symbol in Freemaso nry . . . The symbol is really a beautiful . . . allusion to the old sun-wors hip, and introduces us for the first time to that modification of it, known among the anci ents as the worship of the phallus\" (Albert Mackey, Masonic Jurisprudence, p. 145)."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Pike proclaims that Osiris and Isis (w ho was both his sister and his wife): \". . . were commonly symbolized by the generative parts of man and woman . . . the Phallus and Cteis . . . The I ndian Lingam was the union of both, as were the boat and mast, and the point within a circle . . .\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 27) He also reminds us that the \"Sun is st ill symbolized by the point within a circle . . .\" (Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma, p. 486) and that it is one of the \"three Great Lights of the Lodge.\" What are the \"three Great Lights of the Lodge?\" These lights are represented as the \"Bible, square and compass\" (Shaw and Mckenney, p. 27). But we kn ow this to be a lie because in whatever country the Masonic Lodge is, the book used is the one of the religion of the members of the Lodge. In Is rael, it is the Talmud, in Arabia, it is the Book of Mohammed; in China, it is the writings of Buddha, and etc. Former President Bush's unchanging allegiance to the Brotherhood: As President, George Bush surrounded him self with fellow brothers of the Skull and Bones and interlinking, related groups, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commiss ion, Bilderbergers and etc. on the very day he commenced his presidency, he signaled his unchanging allegiance to the Brotherhood. At his inauguration ceremony, his Oa th of Office was sworn as George Bush's hand rested on the Masonic Bibl e furnished him by his brothers at St. John's Masonic Lodge, 71 West 23rd Street, New Yo rk City. It was the same bible, printed in London in 1767, that was used at the inauguration of Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eise nhower, and Jimmy Carter. These three presidents were all Masons. (Ronald Reag an was not a Mason at the time of his inauguration. However, in 1987, onl y a few months before his second term of office was completed, Preside nt Reagan was inducted into the secret world of Freemasonry; as an honorary 33rd Degree Mason, courtesy of the House of the Temple in Wash ington, D.C., the 33rd Degree Mother Council of Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasonry). Why the St. John's Lodge Bible? (The Royal Arch Mason Magazine, Spring, 1991, p. 15) A Visitor from the Past by Thelen Paulk \"I had a dream the other night, I didn't understand.

The word is an also acronym for the title \"Templi Omnium Hominem Pacis Abbas\", or \"Father of the Temple of Universal Peace\", reversed. Thus \"Tem O.H.P. Ab\" becomes bAPHOmeT (Baphomet). Baphomet is actually a symbolic representation of Luciferian divinity -- Satanael the evil brother of Jesus, who alone could enrich mankind (Genesis 3:1-5). The legendary god of the Knights Templar, it combines all of the an imals and elements of nature and has it's roots in symbolic ability to visually portray the teachings of the neo-Platonists and Sabaean mysticism of the Middle East before the rise of Islam. On the Day of Atonement, one goat (Jesus) was sacrificed, while its brother escaped and was banished from the congregation to bear Israel's sins into the wilderness (signifying the rest of the world). The great two-horned hermaphrodite goat bears between its horns the fiery torch and represents Moloch. The pentacle or five-pointed star between the horns of the beast signifies energy and enlightenment or power in the world and separation from God. It is a symbol of ancient secret societies and the sign of the House of Rothschild and"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of International Communism. The right hand of the beast is raised with two fingers pointing upwards to a white moon. The white moon stands for the Children of Shem. On the right forearm is written \"SOLVE\" which means break-up or dissolve (the Church). The left hand is pointing downwards with two fingers towards a black moon. The black moon stands for the Children of Ham. On the left forearm is written, \"COAGULA\", which means to drive together into one mass or lump -- a little serpent's seed can leaven the whole of Adam's race \"as it did in the days of Noah\". (It is the reconstruction of a New World Order under the Invisible Masters of Universal Judaeo-Masonry whose motto is \"Out of Chaos, Order\"). The beast is enthroned on the world. On the stomach can be seen part of a circle which stands for (the Jewish prophet) Zoroaster, the Seed of Fire. In front of the circle is an apple on a pole around which are entwined two serpents, signifying the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The serpent is Aesculap ius, the god of medicine, worshipped in Pergamos in the form of a living serpent. This design reveals the great secret -- the race of Shem and Japheth and his civilization are to be destroyed by miscegenation with Ham's offspring through Canaan. By accomplishing this, the Idumeans will gain control of the world for which they have worked for over two thousand years. Eliaphas Levi, whose name appears on the picture, was the Abbe Alphonse Louis Constant, who became a cabalist, and wrote History of Magic. The Babylonian Talmud (Pes. 113b) says: \"Five things did Canaan charge his sons: love one another, love robbery, love lewdness, hate your masters, and do not speak the truth.\" For almost four thousand years these five points have been the modus operandi of the Caananite heirs who today control the World Order. Yet this is unknown to those whom the Canaanites continue to rob, enslave and massacre. These instructions are a command to commit genocide against the people of Shem and Christians. The self-styled Jews only use Christian symbols either in derision or as a mask for their intrigues. . . . With reference to \"the Te mple of Solomon,\" Des Mousseaux says, \"This Supreme and Invisible Hierarchy of the Masonic Lodges, and which are composed of Cabalistic Jews, signifies the reconstruction of the Jewish power over the ruin of Christianity\" -- the solve and coagula of Illuminized Masonry.

You have known as odd... Freemasonry and Symbolism What is Freemasonry? Answer: A peculiar system of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols. This is the answer a candidate must give in his initiation. Symbols illustrate, but cover the real meaning. Symbols are there for more co mplex and sometimes sinister reasons. The relationship of symbol to mean ing is most often a typical a ssociation of a natural type, hence, someone waving a mug in your direct ion is either asking you if you would like a drink or suggesting you go and make one. Symbols are there to represent the visible side of the invisible, a type of the thing unseen, it may remind us of a thing not to be forgo tten, a thing of consequence, of danger, they are there often for our own good. E.g. warni ng signs. We use symbols all the time and often we don't realise it. Symbols have been ca lled a universal languag e, this is stretching things too far, a Zulu would have no unders tanding of an hourglass as a symbol for example. Some symbols however, are ve ry widely known many peoples understand Winston Churchill's V-sign and the reverse V- sign is also widely known as an insult. Most symbols are a local language, in othe r words it will mean something to the particular group in question, they will recognise the symbolism and understand its meaning, at least supposedly! Masonic symbo lism is local in its understanding, but even for masons it takes research to understand what it is they represent. The symbols used in masonry are in the main recognisable, but not all, and some have different interpretations"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"and higher you go. The one thing we can say with certainty, is th at all symbols in masonry have some meaning, the question is, what? Compass & Square This is the best known of masonic symbol s, it is found on books, buildings, clothes and anywhere that is masonic owned. It is the most widely used symbol to indicate the presence of masons. Bernard E. Jones, a prominent mason, said of the square and compass, 'it is the most significant symbol in masonry.' The symbol is relatively new, according to masonic historian used by Henr y Wilson Coil, though Jones reckons it was the Chinese. Whoever used it first is of no real consequence, since it so certainly belongs to masonry now. They are seen as two thirds of the three great lights, the third being the Volume of the Sacred Law, often a bibl e. Each light has a specific meaning; Bible / sacred writings = Divinity. Compass = Spirit. Square = Psyche. The great lights are presented in different configurations acco rding to the degree, and as such describe the extent to which the psyche is influenced by spirit. This symbol has prompted many interpretations, usually with a common thread of duality. The compass has been seen as male, the square, female, very typical of dualistic symbolism, others have seen the square as standing for honesty, truth and fair dealing, whilst the compass means undevi ating truth and loyalty. Whic h of these is true? The meaning of this symbol is kept from masons of the craft degrees a nd is hardly revealed anywhere else. In his book, Royal Arch - it s hidden meaning, George Steinmetz has a chapter called, Occult Sy mbology, a clear indication of wh ere the symbol came from and on page 122 it says, Royal Arch will explain a rational meaning for the square & compass, but not its deeper meaning. A Christian mason could not with any real in tegrity agree to such compromise of trust and supposed brotherhood, why is the real meaning not revealed? Pillars Freemasonry is meant to revolve around a symbolical building of King Solomon's Temple and therefore it should not surprise us to find architectural symbolism in the lodge. The most obvious of thes e is the pillars. There are th ree pillars, named wisdom, strength and beauty. Wisdom constructs the building. Strength supports the building. Beauty adorns the building. These could be ca lled the outer pillars, those unseen on the"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"outside of a building. They do a job, but it's al l show. Masonry likes to show its outside pillars, but what of the pillars inside? There are two pillars inside the lodge, th ey have names, Boaz & Jachin, which are incidentally the 'words' for the first two de grees, Boaz in the first, Jachin, second. Boaz on the left is the senior and strength, Jachin is the junior and to establish. Candidates will have to pass between them on admission, this some have seen as entering another world, even eternity. J.C. Ball saw them as a sign of deity; others see the left hand pillar as creation and the right pillar as salvation. There seems again to be some confusion as to the real meaning of these symbols and once again dualism rears head. Two pillars ar e seen as light & dark, strength & beauty, sun & moon, classic duality. The astrological si gn, Gemini has been represented as two pillars and astrology does have a prominen t place in freemasonry, one being the twelve signs of zodiac evenly spread across the f our corners of Grand Temple. The Egyptian view is of twin phallic symbols and Egyptian ideas take an important role in masonry as well. So, more confusion for the mason if he searches for meaning to this symbol. Pentagram The symbol we will now look at is perhaps the most controversial, because of its use in the occult. The question is, are they the same? It is a sym bol which is well known within the occult and the Woman's dictionary of sy mbols and sacred objects says, the pentagram is, 'the most widely revered of all esoteric symbols.' It is a weapon of power in magic and is also used in witchcraft. Why would such a symbol be used in masonry? This symbol is an important one in freemasonry and the views of its meaning are shrouded by the interpreters, but we can deci pher some of the meanings th rough their own writings. There is a pentagram on the pavement to the entrance of Grand Lodge, which is an indication of its importance. One of the more astounding views of the pe ntagram comes from the masonic historian, Henry Coil, he says, 'Pentalpha is said to have a great many symbolic and mystical meanings, but it has no application to fr eemasonry, except possibly in some higher degrees.' The reasons for any astonishment is because if any should know its meaning in the higher degrees it is thirty third degree mason like Coil! Why does he not share its meaning? Coil's encyclopaedia is a well-recommended source of information for masons, and there are many things in it that ought to be ques tioned and answered by masons. One of which, is the reference to Eliphas Levi, an occultist of the first order. The reference to him is of affirmation so it could be therefore assumed th at his word is an authority on masonry. He was also an enormous influence on another fa mous mason, Albert Pike. Pike considered the pentagram to have all kinds of esoter ic meaning, including the pentagon of the Kabbalists. Levi however, saw it as much more sinister, to him it was the, '...goat of lust attacking heaven with its horns.'"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"There are those that say that the meaning de pends on whether or not it has two points up or down. Most occult references to this sy mbol have the two points up, representing the goat of mendes, which is the same as Levi's goat of lust. If the same symbol, two points up, were found in masonry, wouldn't that give us cause for concern? We would have to come to the conclusion that masonry was fu ll of occultic meani ng. The well-respected masonic writer Bernard E. Jones says in agre ement that the symbol with two points up represents the devil and black ma gic! Is the symbol used in th is way? I'm afraid it is! On the cover of the freemason's magazine, Masoni c Square for March 1995 is an apron with this symbol upon it; the same magazine fo r June 1993 shows the masonic inspired gravestone of William F. Cody (Buffalo Bi ll) with this symbol. There are others. If Jones is right representing the devil and who could argue w ith him, it must be a real cause for concern for the majority of men in masonry, I'm sure most would not have joined they had known it was that type of organisation. Skull & Crossbones This is one of the easiest of symbols to d ecipher, as Coil says universally known as an emblem for death, poison or danger. Mackey ag rees with this inte rpretation. The question is why would masonry have a symbol for d eath, poison and danger in the lodges? Is it dangerous to be a mason? Could you be poisone d? Or are you expected to be threatened with death if you betray the craft? Most references to Skull & Crossbones in masonic literature do not make much use in the third degree, where is shown on the tracing boards and presumably mentioned in the third degree lecture. One interesting thing of note to do with this symbol is its use by the Templar degrees. Coil and Mackey take particular notice in th eir encyclopaedias. Coil says that it used by the Templar degrees of masonry but He neve r how or Why used. Mackay is a bit more forthcoming though not much. He reckons it is not used in Masonry except in the Templars (third degree?) where it is a sy mbol of mortality. Why would they want a symbol of mortality? The Templars were accu sed of worshipping a head/skull as an idol. This has been argued about for years however Mackay writes in a definite way that templars did use a skull but it wa s symbolic. Symbolic of what? This symbol means the same wherever you go, death. Why have death as a symbol? The bible says that the dead have no place w ith the living and therefore it represents something ungodly. All Seeing Eye This symbol is well known outside of masonry as well as inside, so we must be careful what we attribute to it. It is Jones again who helps us to see where it comes from. He says the alchemists introduced the all Seeing Ey e into masonry. The Egyptians used it to remind them of Osiris, and is therefore a very old symbol. In Egypt it was a reminder that the gods they believed in were all seeing and knowing. This is a remarkable resemblance to the meaning of the symbol in masonry. J ones admits the symbol does not come from"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Christianity and Coil says that the all Seei ng Eye will reward masons according to their merits. In an attempt to make it acceptable to Christians, a bible reference is given, Proverbs 15:3 - 'The eyes of the Lord are in every place, watching the evil and the good.' First of all, the eyes of the Lord are plur al not singular, God is not a Cyclops. Secondly, no one should use just one verse to try and just ify a belief. Whatever masons may say, the god of all Seeing Eye is not the God of the bible. God does not reward according to merit, but to accepting Jesus as saviour , otherwise some would boast. Triangle The triangle is another well-know n symbol and not just in mas onry, but it is a significant emblem in a large number of masonic degrees. The Egyptians appear again at this point; they expressed the origin of all things by the triangle. The Ancient Egyptians hold more than a little interest for masons and there are a good many E gyptian influences on masonry. Jones considered it meant trinity to the Christian and there is no problem with that, but that is no proof of meaning the same to the mason. The triangle in masonry usually has another emblem on the inside, such as an eye or a point with a circle around the triangle. These all have slightly different meanings, but all have deistic meanings. I found no reference to a triune God of the bibl e mentioned by any masonic writer, but that is no surprise as they do not believe in a m onotheistic God. So then, the question is what god does the triangle represent? Salem Cross This symbol is unknown by any of the lower degrees because it is only used by the thirtieth degree upwards. It has various forms depending on the level attained; for example, it has three bars across in the thir ty-third degree, but only two in the degree below. The cross of Salem has been called, 'C ross of Baphomet', and this should make us want to ask the question, 'W ho or what is Baphomet?' The answer will not be very reassuring for the mason. Baphomet is the name given to the 'Goat of Mendes' the satanic god, which the occultist Eliphas Le vi portrayed in a well-known pi cture. This 'goat' is the same idol attributed to the Templars, so it th erefore interesting to note that this symbol only comes into use in the Templars degrees. I, personally asked the libraria n at Grand Lodge, John Hamill what it stood for, he gave the answer, 'oh, nothing much,' this is of course an unacceptable answer. I then phoned Fred Smyth (Grand Lodge supplied the numbe r) who had written the book, Brethren in Chivalry, a book about the Templar degrees, he sa id to me, 'It is only reference to the Templars, nothing else.' Another unacceptable answer when you consider the level to which these two men have attained to. When you consider the f act that all symbols represent something and this symbol is in a high degree, it does make one wonder what it is they are hiding? The Letter G"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The letter G is one of the more obvious symbols inside the lodge. Macoy in his encyclopaedia called it, 'one of the most sacred symbols, a symbol of deity.' The G is placed over the lodge master's head in the east and it is meant to represent God or geometry. This is where the argument rages within masonry, which one does it represent? The letter G did not ever represent God un til the late Eighteenth century, though it was a feature of lodges earlie r. Hutchinson in his book, 'Spirit of Masonry' (pub. 1775) thought G was both God and geometry! Dr. William Wy nn Westcott, a mason of renown and also probably a Kabbalist said that the interpreta tion of G as God was foolish. Harry Carr, perhaps the greatest of masonic writers, sa w G as geometry as the foundation of all knowledge; he also recognised th at G had come to mean God, Grand Geomatrician of the Universe. Perhaps the most significant comment on the letter G is from Mackey, he said, 'It is to be regretted that the letter G, as a symbol, was ever admitted into masonic system.' Why would a staunch mason say such a thing? What could possibly be behind the letter G to make one mason regret its inclusion in to the craft? To candidates coming into the lodge in their first few visits, may well be left with the impression that the master of the lodge is in fact representing God and therefore is to be obeyed at all times. The bible says you cannot serve two masters, which will you choose, Masonry or Jesus? Hexagram The six pointed star, known to most people as either the Star of David or Star of Solomon. There is no bible reference to any such thing. The Zionist organisation adopted it as a symbol for flag of Israel in 1897. This is quite some time after its use in masonry. The masonic authors as usual cannot agree on its meaning, Gould said it was a sign of the Eternal Creator, whilst Mackey thought it was a talisman. It is Bernard Jones we must turn to if we want to find a ny substantial views on this particular symbol. He says it had a host of meanings, but definitely it came fr om Alchemy and is chiefly known in Royal Arch Masonry, but he then goes on to say nothing of its meaning. He does say though, that it is also used in astr ology, occultism and magic, none of which is compatible with Christianity. The other thing worth noting is the dualistic background to this symbol, it has been used to represent male and female, fire and water and in China it is a symbol of Yin Yang. To the Christian mason it must make alarms ring, because these interpretations of this symbol go against God. If the mason says it doesn't mean any of those things, he will have to prove it by showing exactly what the hexagram does stand for. Chequerboard A well-known sight around the world is this symbol; many floors have this arrangement. For the mason however, it must mean somethi ng more significant, since all symbols have meaning. It is used on the temple floor and referred to as mosaic pavement. Again, we find that the meaning is shrouded in myster y as no one person can come up with definitive explanation. The outcome leaves us with the impression that it is again dualistic. For example, Jones says it symbo lises the chequered life of man, Coil says it represents a life made up of good and evil and the Masoni c Record publication, Enquire"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Within suggest it shows the joys and sorro ws of life. W. Kirk McNulty sees it as completely dualistic, to him it is two sides of everything, black/white, active/passive, and easy/difficult, which together create the whol e. To believe that everything is two sided and therefore eventually even is extremely naive. Some people clearly have an easier time of things than others and in our own lives we will see that things don't always balance out as we might like them to. Jesus made it quite clear to his disciples that life wasn't always fa ir, but that God would judge according to what each has been given. Conclusion Symbols have been used by man since the da wn of time and no-one is suggesting that symbols in and of themselves are sinister, nor the people that use th em, but it is different when the symbol in question is not explaine d or a reason for using it given. Freemasonry says it is opening its door to any who want to see what goes on and they will have to answer some questions on the use of symbols in lodge, if they want to satisfy people. Freemasons use symbolism more than most and it is interesting that they do not use any symbols that has not been used before and in fact most of the symbols have been used for occult purposes and this must cause for c oncern. What are we to make of the many occultists that have influenced masonry? It would seem that they have much more influence than the 'Christian' element. What of the dualism? Even masonic writers can see its there, this is considerably difficult for the true Christian, because of its roots in false religion. Freemasons in general probably have no idea th at the symbols they use are rooted in pagan and occult backgrounds. To these I say, 'Don't just believe me, go and look for yourself and ask questions of those in th e know and see if they satisfy you with good, clear, concise answers to some of the que stions I have set out here.' Masons are encouraged to search after th e truth, so encourage them to seek after the truth, which I believe is found in Jesus Christ. May each of you who seek the truth, find it. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 THE SATANIC RITUALS EXCERPTS COMPANION TO THE SATANIC BIBLE BY ANTON LAVEY THE RITES OF LUCIFER On the altar of the Devil up is down, pleasur e is pain, darkness is light, slavery is freedom, and madness is sanity. The Satanic ri tual chamber is the ideal setting for the entertainment of unspoken thoughts or a veritabl e palace of perversity. Now one of the Devil’s most devoted disciples gives a deta iled account of all the traditional Satanic rituals. Here are the actual texts of such forbidden rites as the Black Mass and Satanic Baptisms for both adults and children. THE CEREMONY OF THE STIFLING AIR The Ceremony of the Stifling Air is the rite which was performed when entering the [MASONIC] sixth degree of the Order of The Knights Templar. It celebrates a re-awakening of the flesh and a rejection of past self-denials, and symbolic rebirth is attained through a contrived entombment. The ceremony originated in the thirteenth century. In its original form it was not the historical parody into which it later developed. Accounts of the performance of L’Air Epais ultimately strengthened the charges of King Philip IV of France in his campaign to abolish the rich order, which was banished in 1331. The Templars had been exposed to the dualistic c oncepts of Yezidis in the Near East. They had seen pride glorified and life praised as never before, wh en they entered the Courty ard of the Serpent and the Sanctuary of the Peacock, where i ndulgence became tantamount to great er power. As a result, they developed what was destined to become one of the most significant rites of Satanism. Martyrdom, once believed desirable, was considered with disgust and ridicule, and fierce pride was to become the Templars’ last image to the world. The philosophy of Sheik Adi and the Yezidis, applied to the already acquired wealth and physical resources of the Templars, might have eventually drawn the Western world away from Christianity if not stopped. Even with the banishment of the Templars, their combination of prideful, life adoring principles"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"joined with Western goal-oriented materialism did not wholly succumb, as borne out by any history of post-Templar fraternal orders. As the Templars had gained power, they had become more materialistic and less spiritual minded. Rites such as The Stifling Air , therefore, presented tim ely and compatible statements to men who had turned from their earlier heritage of se lf-sacrifice, abstinence and poverty. The fraternal attainment conferred by L’Air Epais would correspond to the THIRTY-FOURTH degree of FREEMASONRY, if such a grade existed. The present Scottish Rite ends at the Thirty-second degree (Master of The Royal Secret), with an additional degree confe rred under honorary circumstances. Correspondingly exalted status is attained in York Rite Masonry at its tenth grade, which carries the title of Knight Templar. The original Templars’ rite of the Fifth degree symbolically guided the candidate through the Devil’s Pass in the mountains separating the East from the West (the Yezidi domain). At the fork of the trail the candidate would make an important decision: either to retain his present identity, or strike out on the Left-Hand Path to Schamballah, where he might dwell in Satan’s household, having rejected the foibles and hypocrites of the everyday world. A striking American parallel to this rite is enacted within the mosques of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine , an order reserved for thirty-second degree Masons. The Nobles have gracefully removed themselves from an y implication of heresy by referr ing to the place beyond the Devil’s Pass as the domain where they might “w orship at the shrine of Islam.” L’Air Epais is impossible to perform without an indiscreet degree of blasphemy toward the Christian ethic, hence its exclusion from Masonic r itual, thereby halting any further progression beyond the Thirty-third degree Scottish Rite a nd Tenth grade New York Rite level. The Order of the Rosy Cross of Aleister Crowley’s magic curriculum provided an interesting comparison in its Seventh degree (Adeptus Exemptus). In that rite, the alternative to taking the Left-Hand Path was to become a Babe of the Abyss, which is not contradictory and confusing as it sounds, if one considers Crowley’s ofttimes Machiavellian modus opera ndi. Crowley, nobody’s fool, simply set up a magical maze so that students whose consciences w ould only allow them to tread the Right-Hand Path would nevertheless wind up on the Left. Fortunately, precious few of Crowley’s disciples progressed as far"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"as the grade of Adeptus Exemptus , thus neatly preventing problems that might have arisen from such rude spiritual awakenings. The overtly anti-Christian sentiments of The CeremonyOf The Stifling Air classified it as a “Black Mass,” according to the accounts that we re employed to indict the Templars. Upon assuming the Sixth degree, a candidate renounced all life-defying spirituality and acknowledged an understanding of the material world as a prerequisite to higher planes of existence. This is a ritual of the death-defiant and allows any unconscious death motivations to be exorcised. It is a statement of rebirth, of the delights of life as opposed to the negation of death. The celebrant in the original version of L’Air Epais is represented as a saint, martyr, or other paragon of selflessness. This is done to emphasize the transition from self-denial to self-indulgence. If the celebrant is patently masochistic, he can, through transference, become a surrogate for members of the congregation who may harbor the same propensity. He suffers a fate worse than death, when, within the coffin, instead of experiencing the hoped-for spiritual reward, he is confronted with unexpected passions from which he has long abstained...When a “man of God” is portrayed by the celebrant, the ritual will serve to weaken the collec tive structure of the organization he represents...When the L’Air Epais was resumed in 1799, it served as a celebration of the successful curse placed upon Philip and Pope Clement V by Jacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the Templars, who had been condemned to death along with his Knights. The present text employs the actual curse leveled against the King and the Pope by de Molay. Though the dialogue of the Priest of Satan, the King and the Pope are presented in modern French prose, the statements of de Molay have been retained in their actual stilted delivery. Portions of the text appear in Raynouard’s drama of 1806, Les Templiers. The numerous manifestations of Satanism in Masonic ritual, for instance, THE GOAT, THE COFFIN, THE DEATH’S-HEAD, etc., can easily be euphemized, but the rejection of certain values demanded by L’Air Epais cannot be cloaked in accepted theologies. Once the celebrant has taken this degree, he embarks upon the Left-Hand Path and chooses Hell in place of Heaven. Besides being both ritual and ceremony, The Stifling Air is a memento mori carried to its highest power. "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"REQUIREMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE The chamber must either be black, or mirro red. A mirrored chamber provides greater confrontation for the celebrant, making him hyperconscious of his role. Mirros also serve to “rob the soul” according to old tradition. An austere chair is provided in which the celebrant sits during the first part of the ritual. The coffin may be of any type, althoug h a traditional HEXAGONAL style is recommended, as this is the type depicted in the actual sigil of the Si xth degree of the Templars and, combined with the sull and crossbones, is retained in Masonic symbology. The coffin must be large enough to accommodate two persons, hence special construction or modification is likely to be necessary. The usual devices of Satanic ritual are all employed. Additiona l accouterments include a cat-o’-nine-t ails with which to scourge the celebrant, a cruet for the Wine of Bitterness, and a goblet. The celebrant (Pope) is attired in tattered and decaying vestments. The King is represented as counsel for the celebrant; he wears rags and a mise rable crown made out of cardboard. De Molay is dressed in Satanic splendor, with the mantle of the Templars and the symbols of his office. He carries a sword. The woman in the coffin should be sensually appealing and seductive, the opposite of the wan, pale concept usually associated with death. PROCEDURE FOR PERFORMANCE The ceremony begins in the customary manner, as described in The Satanic Bible . The Twelfth Enochian Key is read and the Tribunal begins. After the accusations have been made, and the King allowed to intercede on occasion, judgm ent is passed and the priest reads the Denunciation (City Of Dreadful Night) . Stopping halfway through the Denunciation , the priest signals that the Wine of Bitterness be proffered to the celebrant who, accepting his last drink, listens wh ile the litany is completed, after which the priest signals to make ready for the final abasem ent and joy for the celebrant . The lectors (guards) remove the celebrant from his seat and place him, face do wnward, on the coffin’s lid . The priest then reads Biblical passage, Hebrews 1:6-12. After the scourging, the celebrant is lifted from th e lid of the coffin. The priest then knocks three times on the coffin with a staff or the pommel of the swor d. A scream is heard from within the coffin, and the lid lifts from the inside. The occupant’s arms b eckon seductively. The celeb rant is lowered into the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"coffin by the lectors, who leave him to his doom or renewal, as the case may be. As the infusion takes place in the coffin, th e priest reads the Thirteenth Enochian Key . When the infusion is complete, the woman within shouts “ Assez! ” (Enough!), and the celebrant is remove d from the coffin and directed by the priest to speak. The celebrant proclaims his homage to Satan, and, showing his new allegiance, casts aside his symbols of martyrdom. The priest calls for the King, ostensibly to pursue his case. It is discovered that the King has disappeared. He has been banished to the place of eter nal indecision and regret, where he must stand in a humorless wind, his tatters blowing, with none to see...forever. The priest presents his final proclamation and the ceremony is closed in the standard manner. THE TRIBUNAL The priest introduces the participants: his High Court convenes tonight, he says, to hear the case of Pope Clement and the King of France, Philip, who are accused of conspiracy, murder, and treason. He then asks Clement to justify his actions: POPE “Why am I here What is the meaning of this? I cannot comprehend the mystery of my presence in this place. It is as if a stra nge and overpowering summons intrudes upon my rest. A curse must be upon me, yet, for even after death, the torment of the Templars is not still. They have destroyed this Pope, and with me they have taken the King. Yet here am I as it was in centuries past. Will not their power stop with death? KING The matter is old and should be forgotten. PRIEST The matter cannot be forgotten. Many men died, among the bravest in France. POPE I did not condemn them. The King, Philip, condemned them when he was informed of their indiscretions. He obtained damning evidence against the Templars. He had no choice, when confronted with the evidence. They wealth beyond their station, and power as well. They had become arrogant in their manner towards the guardians of decency. They conducted strange, dark rites,"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"unholy and terrible, which violated the precincts of the Church. So he condemned them to death. It was only right. DE MOLAY What right did he have to condemn men to death for such reasons? What title gave him the privilege? My Knights and I swore to insure victory for our sacred banner—to dedicate our lives to the protection of our Temple— yet with it we submitted our pledge to the King that our power would be his to wield. PRIEST Philip only had the authority of a profane ruler, and he tried to ignore the superios force, the power of the Magicians who today have called forth this High Court. POPE Philip was their King, he was their ruler. But he was also their guide, their spiritual guide. The Templars were arrogant, they claimed to be above all the laws. They had to be crushed, they had to discover the lesson of humility in the jails of their King. You will inform the King, whose shackles bound us, that we offered ourselves to his cause, yet he wished to find us unworthy and deemed us anathema because we had our Temple, and did not wish to sacrifice our beliefs—our beliefs which gave us inner strength. One can drag an innocent man into a prison cell, but if he is armed with inner strength and is truly generous, he is not debased by the weight of his shackles. KING That may be true, Molay. Though your courage was not lessened by imprisonment and torture, you did in fact confess your heresies, your evil crimes and those of your Order—your unholy acts. PRIEST You tortured them! You treated the Knights of the Temple, who, in their strength and all their lives, fought to protect your throne, as you would have treated murderers or thieves!

He speaks to the crowd: ‘People of France, remember our last words: we are innocent; we die as innocents. The verdict that condemns us is an unjust one, but elsewhere an august Tribunal exists—one which the oppressed never implore in vain, for its judgments are without piety. I dare to ci te you before that tribunal, O Pope of Rome! Another forty days shall pass and then you shall appear before it!’ (Pages 54-75) REST OF SCRIPT OMITTED DAS TIERDRAMA THE SEVENTH SATANIC STATEMENT The substance of TIERDRAMA is the admission of one’s quadrupled heritage. The purpose of the ceremony is for the participants to regress willingly to an animal level, assuming animal attributes of honesty, purity and increased sensory perception. The priest who pronounces the Law maintains the cadence and order needed to remind each participant that though he is an animal, he still is a man. It is this that gives the TIERDRAMA its profound effect. The rite was originally performed by THE OR DER OF THE ILLUMINATI, founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt as an extension of existing Masonic ritual. Ten years earlier, Gotthold Lessing had influenced many Germans’ opinions on the limits of the arts with his criticial treatise, Laocoon. The inte llectual climate in Germany had reached the point of controversy that in England gave rise to the HELL FIRE CLUB. Passing off the Bavarian Illuminati as a society with a purely political base is a blunder often made by those who naively think that politics and magic ritual do not mix. Masonic orders have contained the most influential men in many governments, and virtually every occult order has many Masonic roots. The rites of the Illuminati became the basi s of the curriculum of the later ORDO TEMPLI ORIENTIS, founded in 1902 by Karl Kellner and Adolf Wilbrandt. A similar curriculum, with strong Rosicrucian overtones, was in the Englis h ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN in 1887."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" The teachings of the Illuminati hold that all is material, that all religions are of human invention, that God is man, and man is God, and the world is his kingdom. The TIERDRAMA reinforces this message. It was first performed by Dieter Hertel in Munich, July 31, 1781; the present manuscript dates from 1887. Many scholars have written segments of THE LITA NY into literature and drama. It is apparent that many writers were members of the Order, or of groups which developed from it. Vivid examples can be found in the works of Arthur Machen, W.B. Yeats, Robert W. Chambers and James Thompson. Works notable for their reflections of the TIERDRAMA are H.G. Well’’s most Satanic work, THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, which employs portions of the LITANY in a masterful sequence...Aldous Huxley’s APE AND ESSENCE...It is likely that Aleister Crowley wa s familiar with the ceremony, as his BOOK OF THE LAW bears a subtle hint in its title to the cred o of the TIERDRAMA, THE LITANY OF THE LAW. The message of Nietzsche’s ZARATHUSTRA, that advises an identification with the beast as a pre-requisite to the role of God-man, is eloqu ently ritualized in the TIERDRAMA’S LAW OF THE JUNGLE. The ceremony of DAS TIERDRAMA is begun with an illuminator behind the priest, who stands inside the diamond,, thus formed while he performs the opening rubrics. THE SECOND ENOCHIAN KEY is employed. The chalice is not completely drained. Names are called which have animal counterparts: 1. BAST 2. TYPHON 3. FENRIZ 4. MIDGARD 5. BEHEMOTH 6. PAN After gazing around the clearing, the priest stands in the center and motions to the illuminator, who steps forward with his light. He is about to su mmon the beasts...The gait of each participant should suggest the movements of the beast he represents...As he chants, the beasts appear, gradually gathering around him..."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"INVOCATOR Man is God.

At the fork of the trail the candidate would make an important decision: either to retain his present identity, or strike out on the Left-Hand Path to Schamballah, where he might dwell in Satan’s household, having rejected the foibles and hypocrites of the everyday world. A striking American parallel to this rite is enacted within the mosques of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine , an order reserved for thirty-second degree Masons. The Nobles have gracefully removed themselves from an y implication of heresy by referr ing to the place beyond the Devil’s Pass as the domain where they might “w orship at the shrine of Islam.” THE LEFT-FOOT OF THE KABBALAH FRAGMENT OF KEY OF SOLOMON THE QABALISTIC INVOCATION OF SOLOMON Given by Eliphaz Levi in ‘Ritual de la Haute Magie,’ Chapter Xiii POWERS of the Kingdom, be beneath my LEFT FOOT, and within my right hand.

Round about them will serve youths of perpetual freshness, with goblets, shining beakers, and cups filled out of clear- flowing fountains: And there will be Companions with beautiful, big and lustrous eyes, like unto Pearls well-guarded. A Reward for their Deeds of their past life. Surah 56:91-94 – And if he be of the Companions of THE RIGHT HAND, for him is the salutation, “PEACE unto you!” from the Companions of THE RIGHT HAND. And if he be of those who deny the truth who go wrong, for him is Entertainment with Boiling Water, and burning in Hell-fire. Surah 69:19-20 – Then he that will be given HIS RECORD IN HIS RIGHT HAND will say: “Ah here! Read my RECORD. I did really think th at my Account would one day reach me!” Surah 69:25-33 – And he that will be given his RECO RD in his LEFT HAND, will say: “Ah! Would that my record had not been given to me! And that I ha d never realized how my account stood! Ah! Would that Death had made an end of me! Of no profit to me has been my wealth!

This was he that would not believe in Allah Most High. Surah 69:45-46 – We should certainly seize him by HIS RIGHT HAND and We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart.” Surah 72:1-3 – Say: It has been revealed to me that a company of Jinns listened to the Qur-an. They said, “We have really heard a wonderful Recital! It gives guidance to THE RIGHT, and we have believed therein: We shall not join in worship any gods with our Lord, and exalted is the Majesty of our Lord: He has taken neither a wife NOR A SON.” Surah 90:17-20 – Then will he be of those who believe , and enjoin patience, constancy, and self-restraint, and enjoin deeds of kindness and compassion.

THE RIGHT SIDE (Why Islamic Beas t Allah is Spiritual Mark on Right Hand) – When taking a bath, Muslims are instructed to wash the lower part of the b ody and the armpits first. Then they are allowed to wash the rest of their bodies. But it ALWAYS HAS TO BE THE RIGHT SIDE FIRST and then the left. Muslims are instructed that they have to use their RIGHT SIDE for all things first. For instance, if you are putting on your sneakers, you have to put your right foot into the right sneaker first. The same thing when taking them off, you take the right sneaker off first. When putting on a shirt the right arm goes in first. When entering a house, you have to enter with the RIGHT FOOT first. When entering a bathroom, a Muslim has to enter with the left foot first and when coming out, with the RIGHT FOOT first. Muslims are instructed to sleep in certain positi ons. They are not allowed to sleep on their backs or on their stomachs or on their left sides. They have to sleep on their RIGHT SIDES. On Fridays, a man may volunteer to vacuum before ea ch prayer service making ce rtain that the carpets are clean to receive the foreheads of those who will soon bow in prostration to Allah. When Muslims bow their foreheads to the ground, they face towards Mecca, which is why at the Dome of the Rock, Muslims turn their backs on Jerusalem towards Mecca. Ther efore, the RECORD in the RIGHT HAND of Muslims is the name of Muhammad/Allah and on their forehead is prostration to Allah towards Mecca in Arabia. DEMOCRATS ON THE LEFT AND RE PUBLICANS ON THE RIGHT [POLITICAL LEFT AND RIGHT – WH AT DOES THAT MEAN REALLY?] "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE BIBLICAL DEFINITION OF “LEFT” VERSUS “RIGHT” Remember that demonic occult language has been preparing the Global Community for the Coming of the Devil’s Anti -Christ and so we can assume that since the devil is always working in opposites ca lling UP DOWN and RIGHT LEFT, he will enforce his mark on our RIGHT HANDS because he wants to imitate the Right Hand of God. For now, the spiritual significan ce of CHRISTIAN REPUBLICANS ON THE RIGHT and SECULAR DEMOCRATS ON THE RI GHT has a Biblical language that can’t be ignored.

Therefore, before the God of Israel comes, with Jesus sitting as Messiah and Lord at His own Right Hand, the devil’s anti -Christ will enforce the mark of his name on our RIGHT HANDS because he will attempt to imitate God and replace God with a counterfeit ‘god’ made to look like ‘The God of Israel.’ Muslims have been prepped to ‘receive their RECORD IN THEIR RIGHT HANDS’. Would it be surprising if the All-Seeing Eye of Osiris is the Pyramid on our foreheads and RIGHT HANDS? For now, the REPUBLICAN party is on the RIGHT, supposedly representing CHRISTIANITY, while secular, Globalist De mocrats are on the LEFT, but we must not always assume that CHRISTIAN REPUBL ICANS ON THE RIGHT are following the RIGHT HAND of the GOD OF ISRAEL, b ecause many REPUBLICANS have been MASONS or FORMER MASONS a nd we’ll never really be able to meet them face to face and have a personal discussion with them about what they mean when they sing, “IN GOD WE TRUST.” We know what the Satanic Bible thinks about THE LEFT and THE RIGHT, however, everything will be reversed as it’s always b een since the Muslims have bowed South with their backs to the barren Foundation Stone unde r the Temple Mount’s Dome of the Rock.

He left the Order after a row with its founders and then travelled to Mexico, I ndia and Ceylon, where he was introduced to yoga and Buddhism which replaced his in terest in the occult until an experience in Cairo in April 1904. Crowley was aske d by his wife, Rose, to perform an esoteric ritual as an experiment. During the ceremony, she entered a trance-like state and became the medium for the word s of a communicator. “They are waiting for you,” she said to Crowley. “They,” sh e said, being Horus, the god of war and the son of Osiris, according to the beliefs of ancient Egypt. The communicator told Crowley to be at his desk in his hotel r oom between noon and one o’clock on three specific days. He agreed and in these periods he wrote, via automatic writing, a document called The Book of the Law . This tome spoke of a race of supermen and condemned the traditional Judeo-Chris tian religions, pacifism, democracy, compassion and humanitarianism. “Let my servants be few and secret: they shall rule the many and the known,” the communicator revealed. The message continued: “We have nothing with the ou tcast and the unfit; let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings; stamp down the wretched and the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"the world. ...

Trample down the heathen; be upon them, O warrior, I will give you their flesh to eat. ... Sacrifice cattle, little and big; after a child ... kill and torture; spare not; be upon them!” Needless to say, Crowley was one of two Englishmen (the other being Houston Stewart Chamberlain) who would influence the thinking and beliefs of Adolf Hitler. The same communicator confirmed that Crowley was the “Beast 666” who had come to destroy Christianity , something his mother had to ld him earlier in his life. Crowley apparently tried to ignore what he had written with hi s guided hand, but it would not go away, and from 19 09 on he began to take it very seriously. He said: “After five years of folly and weakness, miscalled politeness, tact, discretion, care for the feeling of others, I am weary of it. I say today: to hell with Christianity, Rationalism, Buddhism, all the lumber of the centuries. I bring you a positive and primeval fact, Magic by name ; and with this I will bu ild me a new Heaven and new Earth. I want none of your faint approval or faint dispraise; I want blasphemy, murder, rape, revolution, anything, bad or good, but strong.” Crowley left his former tutor, MacGregor Mathers, a broken man as he embarked on a psychic war against him. Them both conjured up demons to attack the other. Crowley welcomed the First World War as necessary to sweep away the old age and usher in the new one. After going public with hi s revelations, he was made head of the German-based Ordo Templi Or ientis. He founded his cult of Thelema in Sicily in 1920, but was expelled in 1923 amid accusations o f, among other things, blood drinking, drug taking, and child sacrifice. Crowley is known to have fa voured the Nazi war effort and, whilst abroad, once notoriously wrote in The Fatherland : “The sovereignty of England must be destroyed once and for all. England must be divided between the Continental Powers. She must be a mere province, or better still, colony of her neighbours, France and Germany.” The historical affin ity between Nazism and the occult has been well documented in a wide variety of books on the subject, including Satan Wants You by Arthur Lyons, From Satan To Christ by Seán Manchester , Satanism and the Occult by Kevin Logan, The Twisted Cross by Joseph J Carr, The Occult & the Third Reich by J M Angebert, Occult Reich by J H Brenna, Satan and the Swastika by Francis King, The Spear of Destiny by Trevor Ravenscroft, Hitler:"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Occult Messiah by Gerald Suster, Germany Possessed by H G Baynes, Hitler’s Cross by Erwin W Lutzer.

He was obsessed with the Satanist and changed his name to “Edward Crowle y” in 1998. He had stabbed the boy, Diego Pineiro-Villar, over thir ty times in Covent Gard en, London, on 8 May 2000. Police found a holdall that Bibby had kept with him. It contained a small number of legal documents about hi s change of name, and a chilling sketch that police believe was drawn a few weeks before the attack. Entitled Delendus Est Pineiro , which roughly translates as “destr oy Pineiro,” the pencil diagram makes references to child sacrifice, black magic and Greek mythology. The symbols relate to quotations from Crowley’s works. There are a number of references to child sacrifice. The most notori ous came from Aleister Crowley’s Magick in Theory and Practice. It reads: “For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim wh ich contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect inno cence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.” HENRY BIBBY alias EDWARD CROWLEY Ordo Templi Orientis, once headed by Crowley, boasts a membership of three thousa nd in forty countries, half of whom are in the United States of America. There are many mo re rival organisations describing themselves as the OTO. Crowley held an extremely high Freemasonic degree and modern witchcraft’s three initiations are transp arently derived from the three degrees of Craft Masonry. Someone to perpetuate the cult of Aleister Crowley is the American film maker Kenne th Anger. Born in 1930 in Santa Monica, California, Anger grew up in the shadow of Ho llywood and participated in his first film rôle at the age of four years. From his late teens he became obsessed with homo-erotic themes and diabolism. Th is led to him becoming, in his own words, “a disciple of the Satanist Aleister Crowley.” His most infamous film is Lucifer Rising which was begun in 1966, but production came to a halt when its lead actor died and the person to replace him then stole all th e central footage. Anger releas ed the remaining footage in 1966, followed by a 25 minutes’ version in 1973. The completed 45 minutes’ version was finally released in 1980. French Satanist and author Jean-Paul Bourre, an ardent Crow ley disciple, came to London in January 1980 where he visited Highga te Cemetery with a fellow diabolist. Bourre has perfected his own version of the Black Mass which he describes as a Red Mass. Crow ley and his disciples perform something descri bed as the Mass of the Phoenix, which is also known as the Mass of the Vampire. Curiously, Highgate Cemetery became notor ious for a suspected vampire contagion in the decade prior to Bourre’s arrival.

Hubbard and the Occult I stand before you having been accused in print by L. Ron Hubbard's followers of having an avid interest in black magic. I would like to put firmly on record that whatever interest I have is related entirely to achieving a bett er understanding of th e creator of Dianetics and Scientology. Hubbard's followers have the right to be made aware that he had not only an avid interest, but that he was also a practitioner of black magic. Today I shall discuss these matters in depth, but I shall not repeat all of the proofs which already exist in my book A Piece of Blue Sky (001) ."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Scientology is a twisting together of many thr eads. Ron Hubbard's first system, Dianetics, which emerged in 1950, owes mu ch to early Freudian ideas (002) . For example, Hubbard's \"Reactive Mind\" obviously derives from Freud's \"Unconscious\". The notion that this mind thinks in identities comes fr om Korzybski's General Semantics. Initially, before deciding that he was the sole source of Dianetics and Scientology (003) , Hubbard acknowledged his debt to these thinkers (004) . Dianetics bears marked similarities to work reported by American psychiatrists Grinker and Spiegel (005) and English psychiatrist William Sargant (006) . The first edition of Hubbard's 1950 text Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health (007) carried an advertisement for a book published a year earlier (008) . Psychiatrist Nandor Fodor had been writing about his belief in the residual effects of the birth trau ma for some years, following in the footsteps of Otto Rank. In lectures given in 1950, Hubbard also referred to works on hypnosis which had obviously influenced his techniques (009) . The very name \"Dianetics\" probably owes something to the, at the tim e, highly popular subject of Cybernetics. (010) By 1952, Hubbard had lost the rights to Dian etics, having bailed out just before the bankruptcy of the original H ubbard Dianetic Research Foun dation. He had also managed to avoid the charges brought against th at Foundation by the New Jersey Medical Association for teaching me dicine without a license (011) . In a matter of da ys in the early spring of 1952, Hubbard moved from his purporte d \"science of mental health\" into the territory of reincarnation and spirit posse ssion. He called his new subject Scientology, claiming that the name derived from \"scio\" and \"logos\" and meant \"knowing how to know\". However, Hubbard was notorious for hi s sly humour and \"scio\" might also refer to the Greek word for a \"shade\" or \"ghost\". Scientology itself had already been used at the turn of the century to mean \"pseudo-science\" and in something close to Hubbard's meaning in 1934 by one of the proponents of Aryan racial theory (012) . Other possible links between Hubbard's thought and that of the Nazis will be made clear later in this paper. Scientology seems to be a hybrid of science-fi ction and magic. Hubbard's reflections on philosophy seem to derive largely from Will Durant's Story of Philosophy (013) and the works of Aleister Crowley. Alei ster Crowley is surely the mo st famous black magician of the twentieth-century. It is impossible to arrive at an understanding of Scientology without taking into account its creator's exte nsive involvement with magic. The trail has been so well obscured in the past that ev en such a scholar as professor Gordon Melton has been deceived into the opinion that Hubbard was not a practitioner of ritual magic and that Scientology is not related to magical beliefs and practices. In the book A Piece of Blue Sky , I explored these connections in detail. The revelations surrounding Hubbard's private papers in the 1984 Armstr ong case in California makes any denial of the connections fatuous. The significance of these connections is of course open to discussion. The chapter in A Piece of Blue Sky that describes Hubbard's involvement with the ideas of magic is called His Magickal Career. I hope I shall be excused for relying upon it. I shall also here describe furt her research, and comment par ticularly upon Hubbard's use of"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"magical symbols, and the inescapable view that many of the beliefs and practices of Scientology are a reformulat ion of ritual magic. (014) In 1984, a former close colleague of Hubbard's told me that thirty years before when asked how he had managed to write Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health in just three weeks, Hubbard had replied that it had been automatic writing. He said that the book had been dictated by \"the Empress\". At the time, I had no idea who or what \"the Empress\" might be. Later, I noticed that in an article printed imme diately prior to the book Dianetics , Hubbard had openly admitted to his us e of \"automatic writing, speaking and clairvoyance\" (015) . However, it took several years to understand th is tantalising reference to the Empress. In the 1930s, Hubbard became friendly with fe llow adventure writer Arthur J. Burks. Burks described an encounter with \"the Redhead\" in his book Monitors . The text makes it clear that \"the Redhead\" is none other th an Ron Hubbard. Burks said that when the Redhead had been flying gliders he would be saved from trouble by a \"smiling woman\" who would appear on the aircraft's wing (016) . Burks put forward the view that this was the Redhead's \"monitor\" or guardian angel. In 1945, Hubbard became involved with Crowley's acolyte, Jack Parsons. Parsons wrote to Crowley that Hubbard had \"described his angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair, whom he calls the Empress, and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times.\" In the Crowleyite system, adhere nts seek contact with their \"Holy Guardian Angel\". John Whiteside Parsons, usually known as Jac k, first met Hubbard at a party in August 1945. When his terminal leave from th e US Navy began, on December 6th, 1945, Hubbard went straight to Parsons' house in Pasa dena, and took up residence in a trailer in the yard. Parsons was a young chemist w ho had helped to set up Jet Propulsion Laboratories and was one of the innovators of solid fuel for rockets. Parsons was besotted with Crowley's Sex Magick, and had recently become head of the Agape Lodge of the Church of Thelema in Los Angeles. The Ag ape Lodge was an aspect of the Ordo Templi Orientis, the small international gr oup headed by Aleister Crowley. Parsons' girlfriend soon transferred her affec tions to Hubbard. With her, Hubbard and Parsons formed a business partnership, as a co nsequence of which Parsons lost most of his money to Hubbard. However, before Hubbard ran away with the loot, he and Parsons participated in magical rituals which have received great atte ntion among contemporary practitioners. Parsons and Hubbard together performed thei r own version of the secret eighth degree ritual (017) of the Ordo Templi Orientis in Janua ry 1946. The ritual is called \"concerning the secret marriages of gods with men\" or \"the magical masturbation\" and is usually a homosexual ritual. The purpose of this ritual was to attract a woman willing to participate in the next stage of Hubbard and Parsons' Sex Magick."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Hubbard and Parsons were attempting the mo st daring magical feat imaginable. They were trying to incarnate th e Scarlet Woman described in the Book of Revelation as \"Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth ... drunken with the blood of saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.\" (018) During the rituals, Parsons described Babalon as \"mothe r of anarchy and abominations\". The woman who they believed had answered their call, Marj orie Cameron, joined in with their sexual rituals in March 1946. Parsons used a recording machine to keep a record of his ceremonies. He also kept Crowley informed by letter.The correspondence still exists. Crowley wrote to his deputy in New York \"I get fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts\". Crowley was being disingenuous. His own novel The Moonchild describes a ritual with a similar purpose. Further, th e secret IXth degree ritual of the Ordo Templi Orientis (019) contains \"Of the Homunculus\" in which the ad ept seeks to create a human embodiment of one of the energies of nature - a god or goddess. The ritual says \"to it thou art Sole God and Lord, and it must serve thee.\" In fact, Hubbard and Parsons were committi ng sacrilege in Crowley's terms. Crowley respelled \"Babylon\" as he respelled \"magic \". His magick was entirely dedicated to Babalon, the Scarlet Woman. Crowley believed himself the servant and slave of Babalon, the antichrist, styling himself \"the Beast, 666\" . For anyone to try to incarnate and control the goddess must have been an impossible blas phemy to him. Crowley, after all, called Babalon \"Our Lady\" (020) . Hubbard and Parsons attempts did not end with the conception of a human child. However, just as Crowley said that \"Gods are but names for the forces of Nature themselves\" (021) , so it might be speculated that Hubbard embodied Babalon not in human form, but through his organization. Parsons sued Hubbard in Florida in July 1946, managing to regain a little of his money. The record of their rituals was later tr anscribed and has since been published as The Babalon Working (022) . Parsons made a return to Magick, writing The Book of the Antichrist in 1949 (023) . Parsons pronounced himself the Antichrist. In a Scientology text, Hubbard spoke favourably of Parsons, making no mention of th eir magical liaison (024) . A Piece of Blue Sky covers Hubbard's involvement with Parsons in much greater detail than I have given here. Hubbard's interest in the occult was kindled l ong before he met Parsons . It dates back at least to his membership of the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis or AMORC, in 1940. Hubbard had completed the first two ne ophyte degrees before his membership lapsed, and later there were private complain ts that he had incor porated some of the teachings he had promised to keep secret into Scientology (025) . Having stolen Parsons' girl and his money, Hubba rd carried on with magical practices of his own devising. Scientology attempted to reclaim documents which recorded these"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"practices in its case against former Hu bbard archivist Gerald Armstrong. Some $280,000 was paid to publishers Ralston Pilot to prevent publication of Omar Garrison's authorised biography of Hubbard. However, Garrison reta ined copies of thousands of Hubbard documents and showed me one which had been referred to in the Armstrong trial. The Blood Ritual is an invokation of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, performed by Hubbard during the late 1940s. As the name suggest s, the ritual involved the use of blood. Hubbard mingled his own blood with that of hi s then wife (the girl friend he had stolen from Parsons and with whom Hubbard contracted a bigamous marriage). In a 1952 Scientology lecture, Hubbard refe rred to \"Aleister Crowley, my very good friend\" (026) . In fact, the two black magicians neve r met, and Crowley expressed a very low opinion of the man who he saw had tricke d his disciple Jack Parsons. Even so, Hubbard had a very positive regard for Crowley, calling his work \"fascinating\" (027) and recommending one of his books to Scientologi sts. Having referred to Crowley as \"The Beast 666\", Hubbard said that he had \"picked a level of religious worship which is very interesting\" (028) . He also made it clear that he ha d read the fundamental text of the Crowley teaching, The Book of the Law (029) . In his 1952 lectures, Hubbard also referred to the Tarot cards, saying that they were not simply a system of divination but a \"philosoph ical machine\". He gave particular mention to the Fool card, saying \"The F ool of course is the wisest of all. The Fool who goes down the road with the alligators barking at his h eels, and the dogs yapping at him, blindfolded on his way, he knows all there is to know and does nothing about it ... nothing could touch him\" (030) . The only Tarot pack which has an alli gator on the Fool card is Crowley's (031) . When I interviewed Gerald Armstrong, Hubbard's archiv ist, in 1984, he told me of a Hubbard \"scale\" dating from the 1940s. At the base of the scale was th e word \"animals\". It then ascended through \"labourers, farmers, financ iers, fanatics\" and \"the Fool\" to \"God\". Hubbard seems to have seen himself as th e Fool and was perhap s trying to create a trampoline of fanatics through whom he coul d achieve divinity. I ndeed, if Scientology could live up to its claims, then Hubbard would be a \"godmaker\". Of course, the Tarot pack also contains th e Empress card and knowing this it is finally possible to understand what Hubbard be lieved his Guardian Angel to be. Crowely examined the Tarot in The Book of Thoth (032) . Of the Empress card he said \"She combines the highest spiritual with the lowest material qualities\" (033) . Crowley identifies the Empress as the \"Great Mo ther\", and indeed on her robe are bees (034) , the traditional symbol of Cybele. Crowley is not alone in the belief that different cultures give different names to the same deities. The worship of Cybele goes back to at least 3,000 B.C. She entered Greek culture as Artemis and to the Romans was Diana, the huntress. Crowley also identified the Empress with the Hindu goddess Shakti (035) , and the Egyptian goddesses Isis and Hathor. Crowle y directly identifie d Isis with Diana (036) . More usually, Crowley called th e Empress by the name Babalon (037) ."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Contemporary New Age groups see the Great Mo ther in the aspect of Gaia the Earth Mother. This is far from Crowley's view . Diana, the patroness of witchcraft (038) was seen by Hubbard rather through the eyes of Cr owley than as a benevolent, loving mother. Hubbard made no reference for example to Robert Graves' White Goddess , but only to Crowley and peripherally to Frazer's Golden Bough and Gibbon's Decline and Fall , both of which give reference to the cult of Dian a. To Crowley the Great Mother, Babalon, is, of course, also the antichrist. While Crowley's path was submission to the Empress, Hubbard seems to have tried to dominate the same force, bri nging it into being as a servile homunculus. Hubbard's eldest son, although a questionable witness, was insi stent that his father taught him magic and privately referred to the goddess as Hathor. The Blood Ritual confirms this assertion if nothing else. Publicly, Hubbard was taken with the Roman name of the goddess, Diana, giving it to one of his daughters and also to one of his Scientology Sea Organization boats. Curiously, this boat had been renamed from The Enchanter and before Scientology he had owned another called The Magician . Hubbard had also used Jack Parsons' money to buy a yacht called Diane (039) . \"Dianetics\" may also be a reference to Diana. Shortly before its inception, another former US Navy officer and practitione r of the VIIIth degree of the Ordo Templi Orientis had formed a group called Dianism (040) . When The Blood Ritual was mentioned during the Armstrong trial in 1984, Scientology's lawyer asserted that it was an invokation of an Egyptian goddess of love (041) . Hathor is indeed popularly seen as a winged and spotted cow which feeds humanity. However, there is an important lesson about Scientology in the practice of magicians. The teachings of magic are cons idered by many practictioners to be powerful and potentially dangerous and therefore have to be kept secret. One of the easiest ways to conceal the true meaning of a teaching is to re verse it. By magicians Hathor is also seen as an aspect of Sekmet, the avenging lioness. One authority on ritual magic has revealed the identity of Hathor as \"the destroyer of man.\" (042) The important lesson is that Scientology has both a public and a hidden agen da. Publicly it is a Church, privately as the record of convictions s hows, it is an Inte lligence agency. Many public Hubbard works speak of helping people. In his largely secr et Fair Game teachings, however, Hubbard is outspoken in his attack upon eith er critics of himself or of his work. For example, in What is Greatness? Hubbard says \"The hardest task one can have is to continue to love one's fellows despite all reasons he should not . And the true sign of sanity and greatness is so to continue.\" In one statement of the Fair Game Law, however, Hubbard said that opponents \"May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed\" (043) . Of practitioners unlicensed by him Hubbard said \"Hara ss these persons in any possible way\" (044) . Nor did he exclude the possibility of murder against those who opposed him (045) . The harassment of critics, may explain the dearth of academic research into Scientology. Hubbard's use of contradiction to captivate and redirect his followers is worthy of a separate study (046) , but it has its roots in his study of magic. Perhaps he related his \"Dianetics\" also to Janus, the two-faced god w hose name is sometimes spelled \"Dianus\"."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"While Hubbard was supposedly researching his Di anetics in the late 1940s, he was in fact engaging in magical rituals, and trying out hypnosis both on himself and others. During the 1984 Armstrong trial, extracts from Hubbard 's voluminous self-hypnotic affirmations were read into the record. Th e statements, hundreds of pages of them, are written in red ink and Hubbard frequently drew pictures of the male genitalia alongside the text (047) . Among his suggestions to himself we find: \"Men are my slaves\", \"Elemental Spirits are my slaves\" and \"You can be merciless whenev er your will is crossed and you have every right to be merciless\" (048) . Black magic is distinguished fr om white in the desire of th e practitioner to bring harm. \"Maleficium\" is the traditional word for su ch magic. The \"Suppressive Person declare\" and the \"Fair Game Law\" speak reams in terms of Hubbard's intent. Scientology is a neo-gnostic system, which is to say that it teaches the attainment of insight through a series of stages. These stag es are called by Scientol ogists \"the Bridge to Total Freedom\". The Bridge currently consists of some 27 levels. These levels might be compared to the initiations of magical syst ems. While the stages appear dissimilar to those of Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis, it is worth noting that both systems consist of stages, that both have secret levels and that both are numbered with Roman numerals. Hubbard also shared with Crowley a numbering system which begins at 0 rather than 1. The Scientology Bridge has as its end the cr eation of an \"Operating Thetan\". Hubbard used the word \"thetan\" to identify the self, the spirit which is the person. He claimed that the word derived from an earlier Greek usage of the letter theta for \"spirit\" (049) . I have been unable to find such a usage, but can comm ent that the theta symbol is central to the Crowley system where it is found as an aspect of the sign used for Babalon. To Crowley, the theta sign represented the essential prin ciple of his system - thelema or the will. (050) By \"Operating Thetan\", Hubbard meant an indivi dual or \"thetan\" able to \"operate\" freely from the physical body, able to cause effect s at a distance by will alone In Hubbard's words \"a thetan exterior who can have but doe sn't have to have a body in order to control or operate thought, life, matter, energy, space and time\" (051) . Hubbard used the term \"intention\" rather than \"will\" (052) , but the goal of Scie ntology is clearly the same as that of the Crowley system. The Scientologist wish es to be able to c ontrol events and the minds of others by intention. This seems to be exactly what Crowley called \"thelema\". In a 1952 lecture, Hubbard recommended a book wh ich he called \"The Master Therion\" (053) . This was in fact one of Crowley's \"mag ical\" names. I have been advised by an officer of one of the Ordo Templi Orientis gr oups that the reference is most likely to Crowley's magnum opus Magick in Theory and Practice . In that work, Crowley gave this definition \"Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will\" (054) . So the aim of both Crowley and Hubba rd seems to have been the same. As a recovering Scientologist, I must raise an ethical objection to the desire to control the minds of others without their consent. This is the purpose of many Scientology procedures (055) , and can be seen either as deliber ate \"mind control\" or as the black magician's contempt of others. Scientology is a curious hybrid of magic and psychology."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"After all, Hubbard boasted \"we can brainwash faster than the Russians - 20 seconds to total amnesia\" (056) . At the centre of Crowley's teaching is th e notion that we can each control our own destiny: \"Postulate: Any required Change ma y be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the prope r manner through the proper medium to the proper object\" (057) ; further \"Every intentional act is a Magical Act\" (058) ; \"Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have not been fulfilled\" (059) . Hubbard taught that everything is down to the intention of the individual. He called such intentions \"postulates\". The victim of any negative event is said to have \"pulled it in\". Hubbard taught a contempt fo r \"victims\" and regarded sympathy as a low emotional condition (060) . As Crowley put it \"Man is igno rant of the nature of his own being and powers ... He may thus subjugate th e whole Universe of which he is conscious to his individual Will\" (061) . Hubbard was to employ or parallel so many of Crowley's ideas and approaches that it is impossible, especially with Hubbard's refe rences to Crowley, to avoid comparison. For example, in his Dianetics: the Modern Science of Mental Health , Hubbard laid much emphasis on the recollection of bi rth. Crowley had earlier insist ed that the magician must recall his birth (062) . Crowley spoke of \"A equals A\" (063) , where Hubbard, again in Dianetics spoke of \"A equals A equals A\". Both men were noisy in their contempt for psychotherapists (064) . Both Hubbard and Crowley spoke of \"past lives\" rather than \"reincarnation\" (065) . Indeed, the notion of past lives a nd their recollection is essential to both systems, as Crowley wrote \"There is no mo re important task than the exploration of one's previous incarnations\" (066) . Scientology and Dianetic s also rely upon the supposed recollection of previous incarna tions. Crowley called this the \"magical memory\" (067) . Hubbard gave as the fundamental axiom of his system \"Life is basically a static. A Life Static has no mass, no motion, no wavelengt h, no location in space or in time.\" (068) Crowley was more succinct, calling the self \"nothing\" (069) . Hubbard was to say that even an \"Operating Thetan\" could not \"ope rate\" alone, and Crowley said \"Even in Magick we cannot get on without the help of others\" (070) . The first essential teaching of Scientology is that \"reality is basically agreement\" (071) or \"reality is the agreed-up on apparency of existence\" (072) , which Crowley expressed as \"The universe is a projection of ourselves; an image as unreal as that of our faces in the mirror ... not to be altered save as we alter ourselves\" (073) . The controlling power of thought, or will, is evident in both systems, Crowley has it \"we can never affect anything outside ourselves save only as it is also within us. (074) \" Both men believed that truth is unobtainable in the material world. Crowley expressed it thus \"There is no such thing as truth in the perceptible universe\" (075) . Hubbard said \"The ultimate truth ... has no mass, mean ing, mobility, no wavelength, no time, no location in space, no space.\" (076) "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Hubbard's concept of the \"t hetan exterior\" - operating ap art from the body is found in Crowley's \"interior body of the Magici an\" which can \"pass through 'matter'\" (077) . Both systems seek to get the spirit \"out of the body\" (078) . Crowley said \"Evil is only an appearance ... like good\" (079) , where Hubbard said that \"goodness and badness ... are ... considerations , and have no other basis than opinion\" (080) . Each spoke of a personal \"universe\" (081) . Hubbard also followed in Crowley's footsteps with the insistence that the meaning of words should be clarified or \"cleared\" (082) . Crowley announced that Christ was \"concocted\" (083) which tallies exactly with Hubbard's assertion that Ch rist was a hypnotic \"implant\" (084) . Here the major difference between Crowley and Hubbard becomes a pparent: Crowley was publicly outspoken about his views, Hubbard was careful to keep negative material secret. Scientology claims to be eclectic and non-denominational. Only in secret teachings is Hubbard's contempt for Christianity apparent (085) . The long series of lectures in which Hubba rd called Crowley his \"very good friend\" and recommended his writings, centres on a technique called \"creative processing\" by Hubbard. It is unsurprising that this technique is common to magicians. Nowadays it is more usually known as \"visualisation\". Scientology surely has the distinction of cont aining the largest collection of teachings produced by one man. There are more than a hundred books and over 2,500 recorded lectures. But there are also t housands of registered trademar ks, including many symbols. Many of these symbols have possible magi cal significance. It seems highly unlikely given his study of the occult that Hubbard was unaware of the earlier use of these symbols. The Scientology cross which Hubbard claimed to have seen in an old Spanish church in Arizona (086) is markedly similar to the Rosicrucian cross (087) and also to Aleister Crowley's OTO cross. Hubbard had been a member of the Rosicrucians. He had also commented on Crowley's Tarot which car ries the OTO cross on the back of every card. Hubbard cannot have been ignorant of these uses. The Scientology cross could also be seen as a crossed out cross, with potentially Satanic implications. It seems strange that Hubbard who called Scientology a \"better\" activity than Christianity (088) , called Christ an invention (089) and said that the \"Creator of Heaven\" would be found \"with beetles under the rocks\" (090) , should have adopted the exclusively Christian word \"chur ch\", the garb of Christian ministers and the use of the cross as a symbol. But Scientology is ba sed upon deceptions and contradictions. The Rosicrucians and the Freemasons shar e a ritual called th e \"grave of fire\" (091) . A senior Rosicrucian who had also studied Scie ntology told me that the initiate lies on a carpet within a pattern of lapping flames. He claimed that Scientology's Religious Technology Center - or RTC - symbol was very similar. (092) "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The RTC symbol contains the Dianetics tr iangle, which is a common magical symbol, representing the door of the Cabala, the letter Daleth. Hubbard indeed assigned it to the Greek equivalent of Daleth, Delta. The triangle on its base is also the symbol of Set, the Egyptian god called by some \"the destroyer of man\". The male equivalent of Babalon. Indeed, Crowley equates Set with Satan (093) . The triangle is univers ally recognised as a sign of malign power. Alexandra David-Neel commented upon its use as such among the Tibetans. Her best-selling books of the 1930s contain many other possible comparisons with Hubbard's work. The \"S and double triangle\" is a major symbol found throughout Scientology. The \"S\" supposedly represents \"Scientology\" a nd the two triangles Affinity-Reality- Communication and Knowledge-R esponsibility-Control. There is another possible interpretation. The \"S\" seen on its own can easily be seen as a snake. To Crowley, indeed, the \"S\" represented the tempting serpent, Satan. Perhaps Hubbard's \"thetan\" is pronounced to match with a lisped \"satan\"? He was after all wry in his humour. The two triangles can be assembled differently to fo rm the Star of David, called the Seal of Solomon by magicians (094) This symbol allegedly repr esents \"tetragrammaton\", the holy name of God which must never be spoke n. Perhaps breaking it apart is similar to hanging the Christian cross upside down. Next we see the Sea Organization symbol. The fi ve pointed star, or pe ntacle is the most commonly known symbol of magical power. It is held between two thirteen -leaved laurels. Armstrong told me in 1984 that judg ing by the papers in Hubbard's archive the creator of Scientology was more interested in numerology than any other aspect of magic. Among the more seemingly fanciful claims of Hubbard's oldest s on, L. Ron, junior, was that his father was the successor to the ma gicians who created Naziism. Naziism was certainly an authoritarian gr oup, a prototypical destructive cu lt. Recent revelations about leading Scientologist Thomas Marcellus long-running direction of the Institute for Historical Review can only add to speculation (095) . Dusty Sklar has said that had she known about Hubbard she would have us ed him in the last chapter of The Nazis and the Occult rather than Sun Myung Moon (096) . L. Ron, junior, was sure that the teachings of the Germanen Orden and the Thule Society had pa ssed directly to his father by courier. In this light, the white circle on a red square of Scientology's International Management Organization (097) can be readily compared to the N azi flag. The four lightning flashes or \"sig runes\" are also common to Naziism. No explanation is given for these sig runes by Scientology. They also appear on the RTC symbol. At the time that both of these symbols were introduced, Hubbard also create d the International Fi nance Police, headed by the International Finance Dictat or. An unusual choice of word. Hitler too had been aware of the power of occult symbols and rituals. Speaking of the Freemasons, he said: \"All the supposed abomina tions, the skeletons a nd death's heads, the coffins and the mysteries, are mere bogeys for children. But there is one dangerous element and that is the element I have copied from them. They form a sort of priestly nobility. They have developed an esoteric doc trine not merely formulated, but imparted through the symbols and mysterie s in degrees of initiation. Th e hierarchical organization"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"and the initiation through symbolic rites, that is to say, without bothering the brain but by working on the imagination through magic and the symbols of a cult, all this has a dangerous element, and the element I have ta ken over. Don't you see that our party must be of this character ... ? An Order, that is what it has to be - an Order, the hierarchical Order of a secular priesthood.\" (098) Having shown many comparisons between Cr owley's work and Hubbard's, and having shown the common intent of both systems, I sh all now move on to the secret rituals of Scientology. The attempt to obtain magical powers is certainly not unique to Hubbard and Crowley. Every culture seems to have had its own approach. One common element to most cultures is the belief in disembodied spirits. Disembodied spirits can be found in the teachings of all of the major religions (099) . Crowley shared with many the belief that such spirits can be used in the practice of magic (100) . Most of the secret teachings of Scientology c oncern such disembodied spirits. Towards the end of his life, Hubbard wrote some chirpy pop songs which were recorded under his direction (101) . One of these songs, The Evil Purpose , begins \"In olden days the populace was much afraid of demons / A nd paid an awful sky high price to buy some priestly begones\". The song goes on to explain that there are no demons, \"just the easily erased evil purpose\". In fact, the Operating Th etan levels are concerned almost entirely with \"body thetans\" or indwelling spirits or demons. Hubbard first floated the idea to his adherents in spring 1952, during his first Scientology lectures (102) . He spoke of \"theta\" as the life-f orce and went on to describe \"theta beings\" and \"theta bodies\". Mention wa s made again that June in the book What to Audit , which is still in print - minus a chapter - as Scientology: A History of Man . Here Hubbard said that we are all inhabited by seve n foreign spirits, the leader of which he called the \"crew chief\". The idea did not fi nd favour, so it was abandoned for fourteen years. In December 1966, in North Africa, Hubbard unde rtook \"research\" into an incident which he claimed had occurred 75 million years a go. In a tape recorded lecture given in September 1967, Hubbard announced his revelation to Scientologists. On the same tape he boasted about his wife Mary Sue Hubbard's use of \"professional Intelligence Agents\" to steal files. His wife, the controller of all Scientology orga nizations subsequently went to prison. Scientology continues to claim that its creator knew nothing of the events that put his wife in prison, but also continue to sell this tape. Armstrong, Hubbard's former archivist has said that the H ubbard archive contains letters written while he was creating Operating Thetan level three. In his lectur e, Hubbard claimed to have broken his back while researching. Armstrong told me in 1984 th at Hubbard had in fact got very drunk and fallen down in the gutter. A doctor had been called out to him to deal with a sprain. Hubbard also detailed his drug use in this correspondence. In Fe bruary 1967, Hubbard flew to Los Palmas and the woman who atte nded him there has told me that he was taking an enormous quantity of drugs a nd was in a very debilitated state."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The result of Hubbard's \"research\" was a mi xture of science-fiction and old-fashioned magic. According to Hubbard, 75 million ye ars ago, Xenu, the overlord of 76 planets, rounded up most of the people of his empire - some 178 billion per planet - and brought them to Earth. Here they were exploded in volcanoes using hydrogen bombs and the spirits or thetans collected on \"electronic ribbons\". Disorien tated from the massacre, the disembodied thetans were subjected to some 36 days of hypnotic \"implanting\" and clustered together. From seven indwelling sp irits per person Hubba rd's estimate had gone into the thousands. The \"implants\" supposed ly contained the blueprint for future civilizations, including the Christian teachi ng, 75 million years before Christ. Operating Thetan level three has to be kept secret , according to Hubbard, because the unprepared will die within two days of di scovering its contents. The story has in fact been published in many newspapers without noticeable loss of life. Hubbard was so taken with his science fiction, that he fina lly wrote a screenplay called Revolt in the Stars about the \"OT 3\" incident, ignoring his own warnings. It is often the case with Hubbard's work that he has simply taken other ideas and dressed them up in new expressions. Careful study shows that Dianetics is largely a rewording of existing work. The original language of Dian etics included such words as \"operator\", \"reverie\" and \"regression\" common to hypnotic practitioners at the time. On leaving Scientology, most people cannot see that the \" body thetans\" of Operating Thetan levels three to seven are in fact the demons of Chri stian belief. The \"OT levels\" are factually the most expensive form of exorcism known to man. Unfortunately, such beliefs and practices can have a severe effect upon pract itioners, who take Hubbard's warnings to heart and come to believe themselves multiple pe rsonalities. I have been called in to help several times in such instances. Indeed, the whole process of \"auditing\" can be seen as an update of magical ritual. Scientology is a mixture of occult ritual and 1950s style psychotherapy. The adherents travel through increasingly expensive initiations with the hope of attaining supernatural powers. There are badges, symbols and title s for almost every stage of the way. Other links with ritual magic have emerged. A peculiar event occurred aboard Hubbard's flagship, the Apollo , in 1973. Those aboard ship responsible for overseeing the management of Scientology organizations were involved in a ceremony called the Kali ceremony after the Hindu goddess of destruction. The whole was staged very seriously, and the managers were led into a dimly lit hold of the ship and ordered to destroy models of their organizations. A few years before, a high-ranking Sea Organi zation officer claims to have been ordered to Los Angeles where he was meant to mount an armed attack on a magicians' sabat. He did not mount the at tack but claims that the meeting happened exactly where Hubbard had told him it would. In 1976, Hubbard ordered a secret research pr oject into the teachi ngs of gnostic groups. He had already carried out a pr oject to determine which of his ship's crew members were \"soldiers of light\" and which \"soldiers of darkness\". The latter group were apparently promoted. Jeff Jacobsen has provided insi ght into a possible connection between Hubbard's OT levels and gnostic teachings (103) . Jacobsen quotes from the third century"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Christain gnostic Valentinus: \"For many spir its dwell in it [the body] and do not permit it to be pure; each of them brings to fruition its own works, and they treat it abusively by means of unseemly desires\". Jacobsen goes on to cite the gnostic Basilides, man \"preserves the appearance of a wooden horse, according to the poetic myth, embracing as he does in one body a host of such different spirits.\" Jacobsen points out that multiple possession seems to have been considered normal by these gnostics. Possession equates to madness in orthodox Christianity, and exampl es of multiple possession are rare (the Gadarene swine for example). Jacobsen dr aws other interesti ng parallels between gnosticism and Scientology. Another former Sea Organization member affida vited a meeting in th e 1970s with an old man whose description fitted Hubbard's. She cl aimed to have been taken to the top floor of a Scientology building by high-ranking offi cials and left there with this man, who performed the sexual act with her, but very slowly (104) . Indeed, in the way advocated by Crowley and called karezzo. No outside witn ess has corroborated this statement. I have already said that the public and privat e faces of Scientology are very different. The vast majority of Hubbard's followers ar e good people who genuinely believe that the techniques of Scientology can help the worl d. Most are ignorant of the hidden Fair Game teachings. Hubbard presented himself as a me ssiah, as Maitreya the last Buddha, but in fact he was privately a highly disturbed a nd frequently ill man. There are a number of reports of his drug abuse. He advocated the use of amphetamines (105) . He admitted to barbiturate addiction (106) and was also at times a heavy drinker. His treatment of those around him was often deplorable. Although holdi ng himself out as an authority on child- rearing, his relationship with hi s children was genuinely dreadful. He disowned his first son, barely saw his first daught er, denied paternity of his second daughter, and Quentin, the oldest son of his third marriage, committed suicide. Quentin had reached the highest level of Scientology twice . He was a Class XII auditor and a \"cleared theta clear\", but he was also a homosexual. Hubbard was publicly homophobic - saying that all homosexuals are \"covertly hostile\" or backstabbers. I ha ve received alarming reports of his sexual behaviour. I must emphasise th at these reports are not corr oborated, so can only stand as allegations. One Sea Organization officer clai ms to have witnessed a sexual encounter between Hubbard and a young boy in North Af rica. Another claims that Hubbard admitted to a sexual relationship with one of his own children. It is impossible to substantiate such reports. But such behavi our would be in keeping with an extreme devotee of Aleister Crowley who said that in the training of a magician \"Acts which are essentially dishonourable must be done.\" (107) In conclusion, I believe that Hubbard was a classic psychopath. Some trauma in infancy separated him from the world and made him unstrusting of other people. This developed into a paranoia, a need to control others. He created a dissociated world, inhabited by the Empress. Bear in mind that he actually saw the Empress in full col our, and that she spoke to him (108) . From his comments about automati c writing and speaking, it could be averred that Hubbard was in fact \"channelin g\" the Empress. Hubbard separated off a compartment of himself calling it the Empress and gave in to its urgings. He lived a life of dreadful contradiction. He claimed expertise in all things, but factually was a failure at"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"most. Some will see him as having a psychiatri c complaint, others will believe that he invoked the very devil, or Babalon, and was possessed. Hubbard's own belief lives on with all of its contradicti ons in his teachings. Ultimate ly, as Fritz Haack put it, Scientology is twentieth-century magic. Footnotes 1.

SECRETS OF THE MASONIC ONE DOLLAR BILL The Two Seals of Our Doom Few things in this life have held the attention of Man as successfully as that of a good mystery. How many ti mes did we, as young people, pick up a \"Hardy Boys\" mystery or try to unravel the intricate web of mysterious, unexplainable clues with which Sherlo ck Holmes had to deal? And yet, for over two hundred years, one of the gr eatest mysteries of all time has been staring us in the face. We wrestle wi th this mystery each and every day of our lives without so much as giving it a passing thought. With its majestic wings, mightily spread, I am referring to the Great Seals of the United States found on the back side of \"Your\" One Dollar Bill of United States Currency."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Before we continue to address this topi c any further, it would be in your interest to physically get out a \"One Dollar Bill\" and follow along with the detailed illustrations found in this chap ter in order that you get the 'big picture'. Looking directly at the back side of the one dollar bill you now hold, you can plainly see that it has two distin ct seals between the four number 1's and the four 'one' words spelled out. How did these two 'Great' Seals originate? Well, I know three stories d ealing with its origins. The first one tells of how Thomas Jeffers on, a Mason; Benjamin Franklin, a Rosicrucian; and John Adams, also a Mason, were commissioned, on July 4, 1776, to design these seals. This is the historical aspect. The second story relates that these three patriots were given the design by \"Illuminated\" Masons. The third story holds that, while trying to design this seal in his home, on June 17, 1782, Thomas Jefferson was suddenly approached by a \"being\", cloaked in black. The \"being\" allegedly presented Jefferson with a red velvet bag whic h contained two plaques. Turning around, the \"being\" walked into Jefferson's garden and mysteriously vanished. The two plaques that were in the red velvet bag were the two Great Seals of the United States. I, personally, agree with the latter story. As you continue in this chapter, you will realize that these seals are too br illiantly put together that it had to be demonically-inspired by Satan. Whichever story 'you' wish to believe, one truly outstanding fact remains unchanged; these seals were not to ina ugurate the Declaration of Freedom, but were designed as a tribute to a 'N ew World Order' that would take over the original Thirteen Coloni es of the United States. It was on May 1, 1776, when Dr. Adam Weishaupt founded the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati. Weishaupt wa s a Professor of Je wish Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt in B avaria, Germany. He was born a Jew and later converted to Roman Catholicism. A former Jesuit Priest, he left the order to form his own organization. It was Weishaupt's belief that only a chosen few had enough \"illumination\" to guide and rule the world. The problem was simply this: Where wo uld he find these few intellectual"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"\"lightbearers?\" Subsequently, he found them in various lodges and orders of the day. He infiltrated the Jesu it Order, the Masonic lodges, the Rosicrucian Order and other orders of antiquity. But, all this didn't happen without reprisal. Many members of l odges and orders, who realized that they and their secrets societies and or ganizations had been infiltrated, virtually warned Weishaupt to discont inue his activities. Fortunately for Weishaupt, Thomas Jefferson, in 1784, ha d recently been named the United States Ambassador to France. Jeffers on, a Mason, favored Weishaupt's 'new order' and came to his aid. The 'new order' was now guaranteed to continue and it eventually became know n as the \"Order of the Illuminati.\" As their founder continued to expa nd the ranks and membership, two major events transpired; 1. Five years after he was named Am bassador to France, Thomas Jefferson returned home to become Secretary of State. 2. Shortly after his arrival, on Se ptember 15, 1789, the United States Congress officially adopted the Great Seals of the United States which were, originally, and in fact, the Two Great Seals of the Illuminati. DECIPHERING THE CODES OF THE TWO GREAT SEALS In order to properly decipher the cod es held by these seals, one must have a working knowledge of \"G ematria,\"(which is the study of the meanings behind a number). Many good books have been written on the subject and can be found readily available in public and university libraries or Christian bookstores. Now, Take the one dollar bill you have ready for the following exercise and look at its back side, focusing your atte ntion on the Great Seal to your left. Compare your bill to Figure 1 on the next page. Directly above the capstone of the py ramid, is a Latin expression, \"ANNUIT COEPTIS\", and directly beneath th e base of the pyramid is another expression, in Latin, \"NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM.\" These Latin expressions, when translated to E nglish, mean respectively, \"Announcing the Birth\" (or arrival), and \"New Worl d (secular) Order.\"So here we have a clear-cut warning: \"Announcing the Birth of a New World Order.\" Next, we see the capstone separated from the pyramid, with an eye in the center. This is NOT the all-seeing eye of God. If it were, the point of the capstone would be pointing down, indicating G od looking into the affairs of Man. I might add that the three si des of the capstone would normally represent God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, but since"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"the capstone is facing upwa rd, it therefore means th at Man is \"invading the heavenlies.\" In occult mysticism, the three sides mean: *Satan, *the Antichrist, *and the False Prophet. As for the rest of the pyramid, it is made up of exactly 13 steps. These steps represent the Organizationa l Chart of the Illuminati. (Note: Additional direct commentary relating to this corporate breakdown can be found in a audiocassette work en titled \"The Illuminati's New World Order\" available from USCCCN II/American Focus Publishers or through your local bookstore) The first block in the first level re presents the \"Council of Thirteen\". This Council is comprised of the thirteen mo st powerful witch es alive today. For those witches, or anyone else connected with the Illuminati, the \"Council of Thirteen\"takes its orders only from the House of Rothschild in Scotland. Phillipe and Edmond, who were the heads of this house, were considered literal 'gods' upon this planet and their word was LAW. In the last five years both Phillipe and Edmond have died and complete control of the House of Rothschild, and the Order of the Illumi nati, is now in the hands of Lord James Rothschild. The second block in the pyramid re presents the \"Council of 33.\"This Council consists of the 33 highest-ranki ng Masons in the entire world. The third block in the pyramid is known as the \"Council of 500.\" This Council consists of the 500 richest people and various corporations in the world. The \"Council of 500\" is headed by Qu een Juliana of the Netherlands. Her personal estate is valued at over three billion dollars, making her one of the richest ladies in the world. It is also interesting to note, that her husband, the Prince Consort, Prince Bernhard heads the Bilderbergs, the notorious and infamous group who first met in 1954 at the Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland. Most of the polit ical and economic plans of the world are created through the members of this group. One last thing to take note of, the 1976 meeting of the B ilderberg Society had to be canceled due to the \"Lockh eed bribery scandal\" in which Prince Bernhard himself was involved. The remainder of the blocks within the pyramid represent those of various orders and lodges as discussed in related chapters of \"Secrets of the Illuminati\"and \"The Illuminati's New Wo rld Order\" audiocassette series."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"At the base of the pyramid, in Roman numerals, is MDCCLXXVI, which equals the year \"1776.\" It is highly important to note that most American s and people of the world are led to believe that this represen ts July 4, 1776 in which America declared her independence. This gross error is taught in America's schools and is incorporated in mainstream curricula which are used to teach America's children. This is not true! The MDCCLXXVI represents May 1, 1776, the founding date in which the Illuminati was officiated. As Jesus Christ is to be the fo undation for a good Christian life (I Corinthians 3:11), the Illuminati based their foundation on the evil ways of their god, Lucifer (Satan). In short, this first seal is telling us that on May 1, 1776, a 'New World Order' had been cr eated. The head of this order is Lucifer and it would be based upon depr avity and rebellion. This group, of course, is unlike any other on Earth, for it is 'hell- spawned' with the intent of taking over planet Earth for Satan. Now, let's examine the second part of the seal, located on the right hand side of the back of the dollar bill, th en follow along with Figure 2. Starting from the top, we see a cluster of 13 stars surrounded by 28 glowing guide lines. Thirteen (13), in Gematria, is the num ber for \"depravity and rebellion,\"and twenty-eight (28) is the num ber for \"eternal life.\" Much more will be said concerning this cluster of stars, but, for now, let's continue examining this seal. Conti nuing downward, we see another Latin expression on a banner, consisting of 13 letters, held in an eagle's beak. The Latin expression, \"E PLURIBUS UNUM, \", which, in translation, means \"One out of Many.\" But, the question that should be asked is... \"One out of many WHAT?\" If you will recall, the Illuminati was formed out of many groups, and out of them the finest members with the best potential were kept (\"One group out of many groups\"). We next consider the eagle. When th e first seals were presented to Thomas Jefferson at his home in Monticello on June 17, 1782, the familiar eagle hardly looked like one. In fact, if y ou compare Figure 3 to Figure 4, the first bird looks exactly like a mythical bird known as the Phoenix."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"In Egyptian mythology, the Phoeni x was a legendary bird that lived between five and six centuries and was, in the end, consumed in fire by its own act. Later, it resurrected itself fr om it's own ashes, giving itself a new and fresh life. Why a Phoenix of all available birds to represent? An interesting event which has been er ased from the annals of time and history took place during the formation of the United States. An insidious plan to take over the new Amer ican society was developed by the Illuminati. Many plans and papers had been drawn up in painstaking detail, and these plotted and sought to over throw the federal government through certain infiltrations, along with othe r countries such as Germany, France, and England. The plans were handed over to a courier named Lanzein Frankfurt, Germany one rainy night in February of 1785. The information held within the satchels would be circulated to various Masonic Lodges and Illuminati members. As this c ourier was riding through Ratisbon, Germany, on that cold and rainy night, Divine Intervention came into play. A bolt of lightning came streaming down from Heaven, striking the rider and killing him instantly. Later, when the body was discovered by the police, the pouches were opened and pl ans were found with in that would end our 'just-born' nation and successfu lly effect the overthrow of Europe. The papers also revealed eventual global conquest. The police subsequently raided all the Mas onic lodges and other group meeting places and found still other plans that coincided with the ones in their possession. These lodges, along with the Illuminati, were forced to go underground only to emerge later. But this was slowly accomplished and with the air of Christianity so as to fool everyone into thinking that these were Christian groups. But, as anyone who knows the true inner dealings and workings of those lodg es will tell you, they are based entirely upon the ancient Egyptian and Babylonian myst ery schools of Satan worship. Just as the Phoenix bird reportedly resurrect ed itself from the ashes, so did the Illuminati resurrect itself from hiding. Also, take note that the so-called eagle is looking toward the right-hand side of the currency, which is our (your) left. Since this bird is looking to ward the right, it looks on in favor of this 'New World Order.' Comparatively, the Nazi war bird of Wo rld War II was looking toward the left (our right). Since the bird was looking toward the left, it symbolically means that it looked away from what 'we' consid ered a good governmental system based upon democracy. It looked away in rebe llion or \"in favor of change.\" On the breast of the eagle is a very unusual shie ld of protection. If you look at the top of it, you will noti ce 12 horizontal lines above 18 vertical lines.Twelve"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"(12), again in Gematria, is the nu mber for a perfect government and eighteen (18) is the number for bondage. So this new government was goin g to be held in bondage. But then, bondage by who or whom? Those 18 lines are also set up in a very interesting pattern. There are six (6) sets of lines, and each set contains three lines, or three sixes (666). These six (6) sets are placed upon a white field and when this is done, the white field is broken into s even (7) sections. We now have six (6) sets of dark lines upon a field of white. Six (6) is th e number of Man and seven (7) is the number of God. Thus, the system was going to place Man above God. At the end of the eagle's two legs ar e eight (8) talons, clutching an olive branch, consisting of 13 berries with 13 leaves plus a cluster of 13 arrows. The olive branch is symbolic of peace and the berries are the fruit of that peace. The 13 arrows are symbolic of war and military strength. The talons or claws of this bird number eight (8). Eight (8) is the number for new creations. The talons of this bird are clenched , symbolizing that this new government will take over the old one by force. The new government, of course, will be run by the Illuminati. Underneath the shie ld are nine (9) tail feathers, used for guidance and control. Nine (9) is the number of finality, and coupled with the meaning of the tail feathers , this signifies that with guidance and control, this new government has finally arrived. It is now complete! So, in short, what this second seal is sayi ng, in light of the first seal, is that an old system is going to rise up a nd take over this new government by force, through the use of demonic control and influence. Before we continue with these seals, I must interject a little background information. Witches MUST obey certain laws of witchcraft in order for the force to work for them. This is not to say that witches have a force of their own, for, the only force of a witc h comes through demonic contacts and obedience. A witch, by himself or herself, cannot cause anything to happen. It is strictly by the follow-up actions of a demon. If every procedure is properly done, a demon must obey any order or spell given by a witch."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"This brings me to my next point. The casting of a spell can be done in several ways. Small ones require few things to be done by the witch, while the larger, more powerful spells require much more. When casting a spell, certain symbols must be used or the spell won't work. Take a look at Figure 5. This five-pointed star is called a Pentalpha. Now look at Figure 6. This interlaced, five-poi nted staris called a Pentacle; with a circle around it, it would properly calle d a Pentagram (which is only worn by initiated witches). I can remember in the 1960's and early 1970's that the only place an initiated witch could get an interlaced pentacle was in a 'head shop'. On the outside, this shop would appear to sell only records, posters and incense, but those on the 'inside' knew that they could buy occult paraphernalia and even illegal drugs if they desired. Today, one can buy the majority of these symbols at any gift shop. Even Avon and a number of major mail-order and catalog sales companies sell jewelry that look exactly like the ones in these diagrams. Unless a witch has a Pentagram on his or her person while casting a spe ll, nothing will happen. This is a basic law in witchcraft. A true witch is never without this sy mbol; it's as sacred to a witch as the Cross of Calvary is to a born-again be liever. It must be noted that all the symbols mentioned in this book were given to witches by demons who were under their control. Observe very carefully the symbol in Fi gure 7. It is commonly known as the Seal of David, the Jewish Star, the M ogen David, or the Seal of Solomon. This symbol is composed of two inte rlaced, equilateral triangles that symbolize the union of two realities; God with Man. Compare this to the symbol found in Figure 8. The symbol in Figure 8 is a satanic counterfeit of Figure 7 and is called a Hexagon. Y ou will note that it also has two equilateral triangles, but they are not interlaced. They are placed one on top of another. Satan, the master counterfeiter,devised this symbol to be used in worship of him. In order for a witch to conjur e a demon, and I mean a literal demon being summoned into our plane of exi stence, a witch must first draw, on the ground, a circle with a nine-foot ra dius. The outside of this circle is called a \"demon's trap,\" because that is th e literal function of this circle. If the circle remains unbroken, and if the witch is using the correct incantations, the demon must remain outside this circle and unconditionally do the will of the sp ellcaster inside the circle."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"This six (6)-pointed star with a nine (9)-foot radius circle, is called a Hexagram. It is the foulest, most evil of all symbols in the occult world. Observe very carefully Figure 9, for th e hexagram. Now take a careful look at Figure 10 and you will see how th at seemingly harmless cluster of five pointed stars now becomes a Hexagram with a \"demon trap\" around it just like Figure 9. The eagle, representing this newly-founded government, is being crowne d with demonic control. To continue with this virtual horror story, observe, very carefully, what happens when you connect and align all the 13's on the seal in Figure 11. You'll find the result is still anothe r Hexagram, and surrounding this seal is a circle or a \"demon trap,\" just as the 28 guide lines around the stars form a circle. So far, we have discovered two Hexagrams, each one containing a \"6\" because of its six points. Could it be possible, then, that another Hexagram lies somewhere on these seals to form a 6, 6, 6? You had better believe it! Figure 12 will show us and prove this . Notice that when you connect the pyramid with the thirteen's, you wi ll have another Hexagram. It has a \"demon trap\" around it making this three complete Hexagrams, each having six sides, or , if you will a \"6, 6, 6,\" THE MARK OF THE BEAST. Even if I were the severest of criti cs, and the sincerest of believers in coincidences, I still could not disp rove or have any doubts that these two seals were just accidents. I consider it impossible! *Every single connecting point fits in place, geometrically. *The line under the capstone goes under itself to connect, perfectly, at the ends. *The same thing happens with the fourth row of stars in the cluster of 13 stars.The lines run over the top of each other. As in the case of King Belshazzar in Da niel 5:27, this Great Seal is weighed in the balances and is found wanting."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"When these two seals were originally designed, did Thomas Jefferson, John Adams or Benjamin Franklin have any idea of the mystic symbol or symbolism behind them? I believe that Thomas Jefferson did and that Benjamin Franklin also had an idea of the truth. In all probability , John Adams remained in doubt. Years later, when Adams discovered the trut h about the Illuminati, he left the order to fight against them and their conspiracy. The Illuminati's two greatest wea pons are secrecy and money. Mayer Amschel Rothschild, head of the Hou se of Rothschild, and who was also head of the Illuminati, said in 1838..... \"Allow me to issue and control the money of a nation and I care not who writes its laws.\" How very true! Even in today's society, if a federall y-sponsored charity does not listen to what these groups want, it will be cu t off from all governmental funding. This is \"monetarial dictatorship.\" Down the corridor of ti me, a political figure emerged in the 1920's who would become President of the United States. During the 1932 presidential campaign, Franklin D. R oosevelt's political platfo rm was based on what he termed \"The New Deal,\" though many ru mors were spreading that this platform did not represent his true plan s. Fearing a deep er depression, the public began a run on the banks. Many closed their doors by the time Roosevelt was inaugurated. When \"FDR\" , as he was called, finally stepped into presidential office, it was with an air of great tension and anxiety, planned by the higher powers in control of Roosevelt. Even the Great Depression,beginning in la te 1929, was part of this overall plan. Congressman Louis T. McFadden, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, said... \"It was no accident. It was a carefully contrived occurrence. The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so they mi ght emerge as rulers of us all.\" So the Roosevelt administration asked the United States Congress to pass legislation which would fo rce the American people to give up their gold in exchange for paper money. When the passing of the appropriate legislation was accomplished, the Ameri can people were forced to give up their gold for this new paper m oney called \"greenbacks.\" They had received $20.67 in paper money for an ounce of gold. This sounded fair in"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the very beginning, but, shortly thereafte r, the government raised the price of gold to $35.00 an ounce. In short, the government (during the great depression) had robbed the American pop ulace of over three billion dollars. Senator Carter Glass was asked his opinion on this new development. He replied, \"President Roosevelt, I think that this is worse than anything that Ali Ba ba's forty thieves could ever have perpetrated.\" As Roosevelt's \"New Deal\"was put into motion, every new dollar bill coming off the presses carried with it two new seals which had never been there before; the Two Seals of the Illuminati. They could now openly declare that thei r conspiracy had finally born fruit, their \"NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\" or \"New Deal.\" What does all this point to? It points to the overthrow of our go vernment and places in jeopardy the benefits that accompany it, including th e right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Wake up, America! We're in trouble! So now we know that not only does th e Illuminati have their own official seal, but we also know that its desi gn equates with the number of the beast (666) as found in the Holy Scriptures. Before moving on, I feel it necessary to illustrate one more major point. Throughout the years I have been constantly asked if the Freemasons, or Masons as they are called, are in league with the Illuminati. The answer is yes! Once again we will turn to the Great Seals of the Illuminati to prove the point. In Figure 13, I want you to not ice that the lines which make up the hexagram, are passing through and c onnecting with certain letters. Starting at the bottom of the pyramid, which is the base, or foundation, we see the letter \"m\" with a circle around it. Following these lines in a non- stop fashion, the letters wh ich are touched upon are: \"M\", \"A\", \"S\", \"O\", \"N\". This correctly spells out the group known as the MASONS."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"At this point there can be no doubt th at the Masons are totally involved with the Illuminati. "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" CHAPTER 11 THE CURSE OF BAPHOMET History of the Baphomet Baphomet, the symbol of the satanic goat, us ually portrayed as a half human, half goat figure, or a goat head. It is ofte n misinterpreted as a symbol of witch-craft in general. It is used by Satanists, but is not used by neo- pagan witches who do not worship the devil. The origin of the Baphomet is unclear. It may be a corruption of Muhomet (Mohammed). The english witchcraft historianMontague Su mmers suggested that it was a combination of two greek words, baphe and metis , meaning \"absorption of knowledge.\" Baphomet has also been called the Goat of Mendes, The Black Goat and the Judas Goat. In the middle ages the Baphomet was believed to be an idol, represented by a human skull, a stuffed humans head or a metal or wooden human head with curly black hair. The idol was said to be worshipped by the Order of Knights Templar as the source of fertility and wealth. In 1307 King Phillip IV of France accused the Order of the Knights Templar of heresy, homosexuality and among other thin gs, worshipping this idol and anointing it with the fat of murdered children. Howeve r, only 12 of the 231 knights interrogated by the church admitted worshipping or having knowledge of the Baphomet. Novices said they had been instructed to worship the idol as their god and savior, and their descriptions of it varied: it had up to three heards and up to four feet; it was made of either wood or metal, or was a painting, sometimes it was a gift. In 1818 a number of idols called heads of Baphomet were discovered among forgotten antiquities of the imperial museum of Vienna . They were said to be replicas of the Gnostic divinity, Mete, or \"Wisdom.\" Perhaps the best-known repres entation of Baphomet is the drawing by the 19th century French magician, Eliphas Levi, called \"T he Baphomet of Mendes.\" Levi combined elements of the tarot devil card and the he-goat worshipped in antiquity in Mendes, Egypt, which was said to fornicate with its women followers ( as the church claimed the devil did with witches). Levi's Baphom et has a human trunk with rounded, female breasts, a caduceus in the midriff, human arms and hands, cloven feet, wings and a goat's head with a pentagram in the forehead and a torch on top of the skull between the horns. The attributes, Levi said, represented the sum total of the universe - intelligence, the four elements, divine revelation, sex and mother hood and sin and redemption. Hite and black crescent moons at the figure's side represent good and evil. Aleister Crowley named himself Baphomet wh en he joined the Ordo Templis Orientalis, a secret sexual magic order formed around 1896 in Germany"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Church of Satan, founded in 1966 in Sa n Francisco, adopted another rendition of baphomet to symbolize Satanism. The symbol is a goats head drawn within an inverted pentacle, enclosed in a outer circle, hebraic fi gures at each point in the pentagram spell ot leviathan, a huge water serpent associated with the devil. In Church of Satan rituals, the sigil of Baphomet is hung on the wall behind the alter. The Baphomet may also be worn as a medallion. The Scapegoat Baphomet A model sculpted by Artomic Cr eations prize sculpter, Mike Elizalde. Some have taken this piece and actually have claimed this to be their drawing, when it is only a mode l that is put together just with crazy glue and then painted. Quite an amazing model, as I am a proud owner of these very rare and hard to find sculpts! This is unique in its own way. The Goat of Mendes The original rendition of Eliphas Levi, born Alphonse Louis Constant in 1810 and died in 1875. This is most known picture of the Baphomet. The Ouroboros Baphomet Rendered by Lord Egan, High Priest of The First Church os Satan in Salem MA. This version features a serpent that is wrapped around the outer part of the circle, showing great power within, a nd keeping it there. The SKO sigil of Baphomet This rendition was created by Rev. R. Fair hall, owner and founder of The Satanic Kindred Organization. It was crea ted for Satanists, as certain people were trying to bring down other Satanic sites that were not aff iliated with them, and held the rendition of Anton Szandor LaVey's sigil of Baphomet on the front of The Satanic Bible. So it was made freely for those who chose to use it! It features the picture of a real, cashmiere goat, behind Rev. Fairhall's own version of the sigil of Baphomet. All hebraic characters ha ve been removed and the actual goat imposed of the real picture of the goat was hand drawn. KNIGHT’S TEMPLARS WORSHIP OF BAPHOMET King Phillip turned the responsibility of de stroying the Templars over to Guillaume de Nogaret. De Nogaret planted twelve of his own men in a number of Templar commandaries. These spies served the King we ll in his plan to destroy the Knights Templar. When the King struck at dawn of October 13, 1307, he was well prepared with"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"a list of offenses with which the Knights Te mplar were accused. These are some of the offenses. • 1.. Heresy against the Roman Catholic Church • 2.. Rejection of Jesus Christ, as exemplif ied by spitting and trampling on the cross • 3.. Sodomy and other acts of homosexua lity. Throughout history, these charges have been very common against orders that are confirmed celibates. Celibacy amongst men has commonly resulted in hom osexual practices. Today, we see a constant stream of homosexual activity by the priests of the Roman Catholic Church. • 4.. Several of the French Templars confe ssed to witchcraft, including one of the King's spies. \"Templars confessed to wo rshipping a bearded idol, apparently a head, which they called 'Baphomet'. This is a very serious charge, because it would label the Knights Templar as a Satanic group. However, historians have traditionally di smissed this charge, largely because most of the confessions were gained as the resu lt of horrific tortures inflicted by both the King's men and the Pope's Inquisitors. Howeve r, most historians conveniently overlook the testimony of the King's twelve spies, at least one of whom personally witnessed the witchcraft of Baphomet. SATANIST'S EXPLANATION OF BAPHOMET \"The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. The Baphomet represents the powers of darkness co mbined with the regenerative fertility of the goat. In its 'pure' form, the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of a man in the five points of the star -- three poin ts up, two pointing down symbolizing man's spiritual nature.\" \"In Satanism, the pentagram is also used, but since Satanism represents the carnal instincts of man, or the opposite of the spiritual nature, th e pentagram is inverted to perfectly accommodate the head of the goat -- its horns representing duality, thrust upward in defiance, the other three points in verted, or the trinity denied. The Hebraic figures around the outer circle of the symbol which stem fr om the magical teachings of the Kabbala, spell our Leviathan, the serpent of the watery abyss, and identified with Satan. These figures correspond with the five points of the inverted star. \" [Ibid] These are the traditional repr esentations of Baphomet. Howe ver, since neither of these symbols fit the confession of the Knights Te mplars, above, of a bearded idol of a head, we need to look further to see if Satanism has yet another representation of Baphomet. When we looked further we discovered th at Satanists do, ind eed, have another representation of Baphomet. Listen to the quote from the \"Encyclopedia of Occultism\" of Baphomet. (picture of Baphomet in the original) \" Baphomet: The goat-id ol of the Templars ... Some authorities hold that the Baphomet was a mons trous head, others that it was a demon in"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"the form of a goat ... A pantheistic and magical figure of the Absolute. The torch placed between the two horns, represents the equili brating, intelligence of the triad. The goat's head, which is synthetic, and unites some characteristics of the dog, bull, and ass ... The hands are human ... they make the sign of esotericism above and below, to impress mystery on initiates... and they point at two l unar crescents ... The lo wer part of the body is veiled ... The belly of the goat is scal ed ... The goat has female breasts ... On its forehead, between the horns and beneath the torch, is the sign of the microcosm, or the pentagram with one beam in the ascendant ... \" [\"Encyclopedia of Occultism\" by Lewis Spence copyright 1959 origina lly published in 1920] Clearly, this is the symbol which was describe d in the confession of the French Templars, above, including one of the twelve spies for the King. However, this occult encyclopedia also mentioned that several other Templars re ported other representations that seemed to correspond with the first two symbols of Bapho met, reported above. Listen again to the occult encyclopedia. \" Many Templars confessed to having seen this idol, but as they de scribed it differently, we must suppose that it was not in all cases represented under the same form. Some said it was a frightful head, with long beard and sparkling eyes; others said it was a man's skull; some described it as having three faces! ; some said it was of wood, and others of metal; one witness described it as a pain ting representing the image a man (ima.-o hominis) and said that when it was shown to him, he was ordered to ' adore Christ, his creator.' According to some it was a gilt figure, either of wood or metal; while others described it as painted black and white. A ccording to another deposition, the idol had four feet, two before and two behind; the one belonging to the order at Paris, was said to be a silver head, with two faces and a beard. The novices of the order were told always to regard this idol as their saviour. Deodatus Jaffet, a knight from the south of France, who had been received at Pedenat, deposed that the person who in his case performed the cere monies of reception, showed him a head or idol, which appeared to have three faces, and said, ' You must adore this as your saviour, and the saviour of the order of the Temple ' and that he was made to worship the idol, saying, ' Blessed be he who shall save my soul.' \" [Wright, \"Narratives of Sorcery and Magic\"), writing on the Baphomet, as quoted by the \"Encyclopedi a of Occultism\" by Lewis Spence copyright 1959 originally published in 1920] Thus, we can see that the Baphomet was wo rshipped under several different forms, including some of which we have not pictur ed. However, we can now be pretty certain that the Knights Templars were Satanic. We place great credence in the testimony of fellow occultists, because they are simply reporting the truth, and are not trying to discredit anyone or any organization. In this case, they heartily recommend the worship of Baphomet, since they worship him also.\" "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"English - The C urse O f Baphomet Page 2 Page 3 "},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Page 4 Page 5 Page 6 "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Page 7 Page 8 Page 9 "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Page 10 Page 11 Page 12 "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Page 13 Page 14 Page 15 "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Page 16 Page 17 Page 18 "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Page 19 Page 20 Page 21"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 MORMON AND MASONIC CONNECTION THE SALAMANDER LETTER Palmyra October 23 d 1830 Dear Sir Your letter of yesterday is received & I hast en to answer as fully as I can--Joseph Smith Jr first come to my notice in the year 1824 in the summer of that year I contracted with his father to build a fence on my property in the corse of that work I aproach Joseph & ask how it is in a half day you put up what requires your father & 2 brothers a full day working together he says I have not been w ith out assistance but can not say more only you better find out the next day I take the older Smith by the arm & he says Joseph can see any thing he wishes by looking at a stone Joseph often sees Spirits here with great kettles of coin money it was Spirits w ho brought up rock because Joseph made no attempt on their money I latter dream I c onverse with spirits wh ich let me count "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"their money when I awake I have in my hand a dollar coin which I take for a sign Joseph describes what I seen in every particular says he the spirits are grieved so I through back the dollar in the fall of the year 1827 I hear Joseph found a gold bible I take Joseph aside & he says it is true I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it because of the enchantment the old spirit come to me 3 times in the same dream & says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the spirit transfigured hims elf from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole & struck me 3 times & held the treasure & would not let me have it because I lay it down to cover over the hole when the spirit says do not lay it down Joseph says when can I have it the spirit says one year from to day if you obay me look to the stone after a few days he looks the spirit says bring your brother Alvin Joseph says he is dead shall I bring what remains but the spirit is gone Joseph goes to get the gold bible but the spirit says you did not bri ng your brother you can not have it look to the stone Joseph looks but can not see who to bri ng the spirit says I tric ked you again look to the stone Joseph looks & sees his wife on the 22d day of Sept 1827 they get the gold bible-- I give Joseph $50 to move him down to Pa Joseph says when you visit me I will give you a sign he gives me so me hiroglyphics I take then to Utica Albany & New York in the last place Dr Mitchel gives me a intr oduction to Professor Anthon says he they are short hand Egyption the same what was used in ancent times bring me the old book & I will translate says I it is made of precious gol d & is sealed from view says he I can not read a sealed book--Joseph found some giant silver specticles with the plates he puts them in a old hat & in the da rkness reads the words & in this way it is all translated & written down--about the middle of June 1829 Joesph takes me together with Oliver Cowdery & David Whitmer to have a view of the plates our names are appended to the book of Mormon which I had printed with my own money--space and time both prevent me from writing more at presan t if there is any th ing further you wish to inquire I shall attend to it Yours Respectfully Martin Harris W W Phelps Esq Joseph Smith and Kabbalah : The Occult Connection by Lance S.

Moshe Idel discusses the sexual polarity of divine qualities in Jewish mystical tradition. Most striki ng of such evidence is the image of the cherubim that adorned the Arc of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Solomon. In talmudic tradition the cherubim were male and female and were sometimes found in sexual embrace (see G. Scholem, Kabbalah [New York: Dorset Press, 1987], 130). The Talmud states, \"W hen the Israelites came up on the pilgram Festivals the curtai n would be removed for them and the cherubim shown to them, their bodies inte rlocked with one another, and they would say to them, `Look, you are beloved of God as the love between man and woman'\" (Yoma 54a, Bababatra 99a).

Scholem, On the Kabbalah, 103-104. Each Hebrew letter has a numerical value; words carry the value of the sum of their letters. These numerical sums are used in Kabbalah to extract various relationship and occult meanings from biblical texts, a practice called gematria. The numerical va lue of the Tetragrammaton (the name of God composed of the four letters, Yod he vav he , and read as Yahweh or Jehovah) is 45, exactly the same value carried by the name Adam; thus \"Jehovah\" = \"Adam.\" 18.

Though Kabbalah entered into the Christ ian consciousness mostly by passive transmission and assimilation, this wa s not always so. Abraham Abulafia, a seminal thirteenth-century Kabbalist, considered hims elf a prophet sent to Jew and gentile.

(Idel, The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia, 3). From the end of the thirteenth century, a number of Jewish converts to Christianity also brought with them into the gentile fold a knowledge of Kabbalah and christological speculations on Kabbalistic texts (Scholem, Kabbalah, 197). The works of Catalan philosopher and Chri stian mystic Raymond Lull (1232-ca. 1316) witness that elements of Kabbalah began penetrating Christian thought as early as 1300. Lull exhibits the influen ce of several Kabbalis tic concepts on his quest to develop a universal system of science and religion--a philosophy he hoped would reconcile religious conflicts among Jews, Moslems, and Christians (Yates, The Occult Philosophy, 17-22). 21. Walter Scott, ed., Hermetica (Boston: Shambhala, 1993), 31-2. Through patristic sources the name Hermes Trismegistos was well known in the Middle Ages; Roger Bacon called him \"Father of Philos ophers.\" The meaning of \"Thrice-Great\" was variously explained. Marcilio Ficino sugge sts it refers to his triple capacity of priest, philosopher, and king, a divine triad that recurs in various manifestations throughout the Hermetic-Kabbalistic tr adition (including perhaps the 1844 coronation of the Joseph Smith). See Frances A. Yates, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition (Chicago: University of Ch icago Press, 1964), 48-49. 22.

Its content was known to medieval scholars, and this, its central dictum, is often repeated in Hermetic writings from the Renaissance on. As with other Hermetic texts, the Tabula smaragdina probably dates to the firs t or second century C.E. 32. Robert Fludd, Utriusque Cosmi Maioris . . .

In Joseph Smith's translation of the B ook of Genesis, begun in 1831, one finds a clear parallel. Smith gives this new read ing for Genesis 2:5-9: \"For I the Lord God, created all things of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth . . . fo r in heaven created I them, and there was"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"not yet flesh upon the earth . . . . all thi ngs were before created, but spiritually were they created and made, according to my word.\" In Genesis 6:66 he continues the idea, \"And behold, all things have their likeness . . . . both things which are temporal and things which are spiritual; things which are in the heavens above, and things which are on the earth...both above and beneath, all things bear record of me.\" ( Joseph Smith's \"New Translation\" of the Bible , [Independence, MO: Herald Publishing House, 1970], 30.) Brigham Young developed the idea: \"We cannot talk about spiritual things without connecting with them temporal things, neither can we talk about temporal things without connecting sp iritual things with them. They are inseparably connecte d....\" Leonard Arrington emphasized the importance of this concept for an understa nding of early Mormonism's evolution: \"Joseph Smith and other early Mormon leader s seem to have seen every part of life, and every problem put to them, as pa rt of an integrated universe in which materialities and immaterialit ies were of equal standing, or indistinguishable, in God's kingdom. Religion was relevant to economics, politics, art, and science.\" (Leonard Arringtion, Great Basin Kingdom: Economic History of the Latter-Day Saints [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1958; reprinted Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press], 5-6.) It is a view closely parallel by the Hermetic tradition. 34. The Latin terms used were sciencia, intellectus and mens. 35.

The works of Magnus remained importan t to seventeenth-century alchemical scholars, as evidenced by the inclusion of two of his works in the influential compendium Theatrum Chemicum , vol. 2 (Usel, 1602), xxii, and vol. 4 (Strasbourg, 1613), xxxvii; another of his alchemical works was published as late as 1650: Albertus Magnus, Philosophia naturalis (Basel, 1650).

The concept of matter as uncreated caused considerable tension during the early Christian centuries, the period of alchemy's earliest evolution. Augustine attributed the idea to the Manichaeans ( De Actis cum Felice , 1:18) and specifically attacked the concept of co -eternal matter and spirit expressed by Simon ( Contra Faustum, XXI, 1, in Willis Barnstone, ed., The Other Bible: Jewish Pseudepigrapha, Christian Apocrypha, Gnostic Scripture [San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1987], 680). That a figure named \"Faust\" would subsequently emerge as the archetypal literary image of the alchemist is a complex and interesting historical side note to Augus tine's comments. Hippolytus attacked this same heresy expressed by the Gnostic Hermogenes (a name meaning \"born of Hermes\"): \"God created all things from coexistent and ungenerated matter\" ( Refutation of All Heresies, 7:10, 10:24). The concept of the increatum as the mother of all created things is fully deve loped in later alchemy, particularly in the work of Paracelsus; for a discussion, see C. G. Jung, Psychology and Alchemy, 2d ed. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Un iversity Press, 1968), 320-23. 46.

A. E. Waite (London, 1894). I know of no association between this meta phor and the Mormon Pearl of Great Price, first published in London in 1852. 47. In alchemy, the stone was the \"orphan\" ; the term \"son of the widow,\" now associated with Masonry, may be of Mani chaean origin.

A symbol's \"meaning\" is perpetually open to interpretation, but in this particular case there is strong historic al precedent for assuming a deeper allegorical text. This exact metaphor of the honey bee as the alchemist and the hive as the alchemical retort is presented on the title page of Michael Maier's Examen fucorum (Frankfurt: Nicholas Hoffman for Theodor de Bry, 1617), facsimile in Klossowski de Rola, The Golden Game, 65. (See Fig. 5.) The bee and beehive seems to have entered the symbolic voca bulary of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries through a rediscovered and infl uential work of the third century Neoplatonist Porphyry, De Antro Nympharum ( On the Cave of the Nymphs ). In this short essay, Porphyry examined severa l verses from the thirteenth book of Homer's Odyssey and showed how they were to be interpreted as an allegory of the immortal soul's passage through mort ality and on to liberation. The bees and hive are among the objects encountered in this \"cave of generation.\" As Kathleen Raine notes in her introduction to Thom as Taylor's translation of the work, \"Porphyry's interests in symbols and myths is central--in what Henry Corbin has called the mundus imaginalis, the imaginal world where sensible images are informed with meaning, and where hi gher worlds may be discerned under symbolic forms. . . . With the reviva l of Neoplatonic lear ning in Renaissance Florence, De Antro Nympharum spoke immediately to th e imaginative genius of those gifted painters whose works communicated the profoundest philosophic realizations in the lightest vest ures\" (\"Introducti on\" in, Porphyry, On the Cave of the Nymphs [Grand Rapids: Phanes Press, 1991], 10, 13.) It is this same intent to convey an understanding of \"higher worlds\" through symbolic forms that subsequently animated the seventee nth-century genre of \"hieroglyphic\" alchemical emblems; and it is only na tural that they would pay homage by echoing imagery from De Antro Nypharum. Porphyry associated Homer's Cave of the Nymphs with the cave-temples of an ancient mystery reli gion and gave a long discussion to the symbolic, allegorical meanings of the bees and honey combs found there. The web and beehive were s ubsequently linked together in emblems identifying the royal patron of the Rosicr ucian enlightenment, Fredrick V, Elector Palatine and King of Bohemia (this linkage helps identify their joint origin in Porphyry, a fact I have not seen elsewhere noted). Fredrick's reign became the focal point of reformative aspirations , and under his patronage in Oppenheim several of the most influential emblem atic \"Rosicrucian\" books were published. These included works published by the de Bry firm and several authored by Michael Maier ( Examen fucorum, noted above, is an example--on the title page Maier identifies himself \"Count Palatine, Free Knight of the Empire, Doctor of"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Medicine\"). The Rose Cross, spider's web, and beehive are again linked on the title page of Robert Fludd's a nd Joachim Frizius's collaboration, Summum bonum, The True Magic, Cabla, and Alchemy of th e True Fraternity of the Rose Cross (Frankfurt, 1629) (Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, 72, 102). The symbol of the beehive subsequently entered into Freemasonry as one of the ten emblems (including the \"All-seeing Eye\") given to a Master Mason at the time of his ceremonial initiation; in Ma sonry it was associated with the motto \"industry\" (Jabez Richardson, Richardson's Monitor of Free-Masonry [facsimile reprint, Chicago: Charles T. Powner, Co., n.d.], 40). Nearly every priesthood leader of Joseph Smith's church present in Na uvoo was \"given\" these two symbolic emblems when entered as Master Masons (see discussion below). In a bizarre historical twist, after the failure of the reign of Fredrick V, the next political kingdom to which this symbol would be widely linked was Brigham Young's Kingdom of Deseret. The beehive and th e motto \"Industry\" remain today the emblem and motto of its succe ssor, the State of Utah. 62. Upon a dwindling remnant of Utah's ni neteenth century Mormon facades these symbols still remain. See Allen D. Robe rts, \"Where are the All-Seeing Eyes?\" Sunstone 4 (May-June 1979): 22-37. 63. Jung gives extended discussion and docume ntation to each of these specific themes in Mysterium Coniunctionis. 64.

The allegorical nature of Masonic rituals is thoroughly evidenced in records of the eighteenth century. When these the rituals took form is a matter of supposition; Gould posits an origin of the Masonic rituals in the seve nteenth century, but subsequent historians have suggested that the ritual s as currently recognizable originated during the 1720s (see Michael W.

Brooke, The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644-1844 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994). Prof. Brooke reviews much of the material I have presented above, and draws very similar conclusions: \"The Mormon cosmology constructed by Joseph Smith was as optimistic as Renaissance hermeticism a nd shared with it a st artling number of common themes. . . . [Smith] reproduced the three heavens of the Cabala and hermeticism in the three Mormon heavens, the telestial, terrestial, and celestial kingdoms. Both hermeticism and Mormonism celebrate the mutuality of spiritual and material worlds, precreated intelligences, free will, a divine Adam, a fortunate, sinless Fall, and the symbolism and religious efficacy of marriage and sexuality. And, as in hermeticism, Adam, 't he father of all, prince of all, that ancient of days,' would occupy a cent ral position in Mormon cosmology. . . .Three centuries after the height of the Renaissance, Mormonism echoed the hermetics--and explicitly rejected Calv inism. . . .

During the early and mid-nine teenth century in England and Europe Mesmerism was closely linked with spirit ual alchemy by occultists interested in visionary states, and as Merkur no tes, \"In the Gold und Rosenkreuz, a development of the alchemical traditi on of Paracelsus and Boehme in late eighteenth-century German, the insignias of the ninth and highest degree, Majus, consisted of a `gleaming and fi ery' Urim and Thummim with a Schemhamphorash.

That Sachse, a late-ninet eenth-century Masonic historian, would perceive a variant Masonry in practice at Ephrata again indicates both the wide acceptance of Rosicrucian ties in Masonry in the nineteenth century and the wide latitude of esoteric things allo wed classification as \"Masonic.\" 98. Noted are: the presence of a Rosicrucian cross on the Smith family \"Holiness to the Lord\" magical parchment; the similarity of rituals used in the Ephrata commune for conveying Melchizedik pr iesthood and performing proxy baptisms for the dead to forms later incorporated by Joseph Smith; the use of pseudonyms exactly like those adopted in early Morm onism (\"Enoch\" as a code name for Joseph Smith) within the Ephrata Rosicrucia n society; and the similarity between one of Joseph Smith's 1829 revelations (r ecorded as D&C 7) and a Rosicrucian legend (Quinn, 133, 180-81, 169; Alderfer, 88). 99.

Homer makes particular note of the 28th degree of the Scottish rite, which is based on the 23rd degree of the Rite de Perfection. This degree is known as the \"Knight of the Sun,\" \"Prince of the S un,\" or \"Key to Masonry.\" As Homer suggests, the ritual of this degree has several motifs familiar to the Mormon temple ceremony: Father Adam is the presiding officer, accompanied by seven angels, including Michael, Gabriel, Raph ael, and Auriel; and the rite is to be administered in a room painted like a vast garden, with open fields, forests, and mountains. The rite has an obviously alch emical and Hermetic flavor, leading Macoy to suggest the \"28th degree of Freemasonry must have been composed by Freemasons who were also members of the Order of the Rosy Cross.\" The seal of the degree (illustrated in Macoy) is embl azoned with the Hermetic motto of the Tabula smaragdina (\"That which is above is al so below\"); over and under the image of God reflected in himself as dua l white and black triangles interwoven in the Seal of Solomon are inscribed th e terms common to Rosicrucianism and alchemy, \"Macroprospus\" or macrocosm and \"Microprosupus\" or microcosm.

A third issue deserves brief notation: the \"Joseph Smith to Joseph Hull\" letter, mentioned by Durham, said to have been written by Joseph Smith about Freemasonry. A copy of the original is in my possession, and a transcript (with some errors) was published with the Durham paper as Appendix A ( No Help for the Widow's Son: Two Papers on the In fluence of the Masonic Movement on Joseph Smith and His Mormon Church [Nauvoo: Martin Publishing Co, 1980], 29.) This torn and undated letter wa s discovered around 1966-67 in a group of miscellaneous manuscript materials by Ge orge Rinsland, an Eastern manuscripts dealer. In April 1967 Rinsland sent it, uns olicited and free of cost, to Steve Barnett, then an active collector and dealer of such materials in Salt Lake (Barnett to Lance Owens, 12 Feb. 1991). I have made an extensive study of the Smith-Hull letter's content and handwriti ng. It is my opinion that the letter is not in the hand of Joseph Smith, though the similarities are strong enough to suggest a period forgery of his hand. The signature essent ially matches Smith's post-1840 signature (when he ceased to append \"Jr.\"). The letter itself is interes ting, regardless of the author, and represents the type of esoteric Masonic thought to which Joseph Smith might have been exposed. In an esoteric disquisition, the Ma sonic temple is metaphoric ally interposed upon the world and the offices of the temple are placed geographically over the face of the globe, as they are arranged within th e Masonic temple ceremony. Symbolically, Masonic ritual is seen as an image of gr eater forces working historically in human society--a telling example of esoteric Ma sonic thought. This is just the type of expanded, esoteric interpretation one mi ght expect Joseph Smith to impose upon Masonic ritual. The dualistic view of humankind's guiding ge nius is also interesting: \"Mankind is guided through this life by two Spirit s viz light & Darkness two opposites & Thay appear in ten-thousands Shapes & thay have as many names as thay have Shapes.\" This theme of a compexio oppositorum , played against the image of the single all-seeing \"Eye/I\" of God, is echoe d again in the cryptic poem on the last page of the letter: \"that ou r 2 eyes Sprang from his 1; that our 2 Spirits did the Same; Light; Darkness.\" This dualism of tw o natures within the single \"I\" of God, of two eyes and two spirits, of Light a nd Dark, being born from his singleness, is the crux of an ancient heresy echoed in Joseph's vision of God: a holy wedding of uncreated matter's darkness with the supern al light of consciousness, intelligence or knowing, a creative union ceaselessly b earing new Gods in the dark/light transformation of man/woman. 115.

Yehuda Liebes also comments on this same Kabbalistic interpretation of Genesis 1:1 in Studies in the Zohar, 153-54. 139. In Kabbalistic interpreta tion, the \"Hidden Nothing\" in Kabbalah is not \"nothing\" in the common sense, but the vast unorganized mystery preceding creation. There is no truly ex nihilo creation in Kabbalah. Thus Joseph's translation \"organized\" acco rds with Kabbalah. Scholem, On the Kabbalah, 102- 103. See also Idel, Kabbalah, 220. 140.

In Larson's amalgamation, the bracketed words in th e reconstructed text \"ROSHITH [BARA ELOHIM] signifies [the Head] to bring forth the Elohim\" are interposed by Larson based on the assumption that in the original other Hebrew words may have been spoken but not recorded (Larson, 198 n15). Clayton's transcription stands well without these interpolat ions. Joseph's use of the words \"bring forth\" is also significant; this is a closer translation of the Kabbalistic concept of emanation implied in the verse and perhaps a better choice than the word \"created\" used by the Sperling translation of the Zohar quoted above (Scholem, Kabbalah, 98-99). 143. The full text of this passage in the Zohar is as follows: \"A further esoteric interpretation of the word bereshith is as follows. The name of the starting-point of all is Ehyeh (I shall be). The holy name when inscribed at its side is Elohim, but when inscribed by circumscription is Asher, the hidden and recondite temple, the source of that which is mystically called Reshith. The word Asher (i.e. the letters, Aleph, Shin, Resh from the word bereshith) is anagrammatically Rosh (head), the beginning whic h issues from Reshith\" ( Zohar I, 15a).

For thus has it been taught, `He who has not taken a woman is as if he were only a half'\" ( Zohar III, 81a). 149. See Quinn, 138-40. 150.

Joseph Smith and Kabbalah: The Occult Connection Why Did Joseph Smith Became a Mason? W. John Walsh Elder John A. Widtsoe by Elder John A. Widtsoe Nauvoo, the city beautiful, was founded by the La tter-day Saints in 1839, nearly ten years after the Church had been organized. The decade had been one of unreasoning persecution of the members of the Church. Th e forces of evil seemed to be combined against the restoration of the simple gospel of Jesus Christ. The Prophet, to save his life, was obliged to flee from Kirtland, Ohio, headquarters of the Church where a lovely temple and many progressive enterprises had been built. The Saints as a body were expelled from Missour i, under an \"exterminating\" order by the governor of the state, despite several succe ssful settlements by the Church within the state. In seeking a city of refuge, Nauvoo, then a squalid village called Commerce, was founded."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The settlement in Nauvoo was effected in the hope that the people might now live in peace to worship the God of heaven in their own way. There they built well, for soon Nauvoo was the most populous and thriving city in Illinois. But soon after their arrival there, neighbors began to question the doctr ines of the Church, notably revelation. The prosperity of the industrious Saints also in cited jealousy on the part of those who would not pay the price of toil fo r success, or who were specu lating in lands and other properties. Persecution began to rise there as in other places. Political differences and hopes also entered into the picture. The Saints knew well enough the sufferings from mob persecution. Joseph Smith, the leader, looked for means to quell the rising tide of opposition. Many of the Saints were Masons, such as Jo seph's brother Hyrum, Heber C. Kimball, Elijah Fordham, Newel K. Whitney, James Adams, and John C. Bennett. These members called attention to the spirit of brotherhood and brotherly love which are the foundations of Masonic fraternity and which characterize Ma sonic activities: -- as, for example, from this writer, On the rolls of Masonry, those lodges will st and highest in which not some few, but each and every member cheerfully gives of his time and labors to make the others happier, not some of the time but all of the time. This ideal agreed well with the high ideals of the Prophet. Moreover, it was conceded that many of the prominent and influential men of the state were Masons who could be friends when needed. Association with such a fraternity might help to lessen the mob persecutions to which the Church had been subjected in Ohio and Missouri, so reasoned the Prophet's advisors. The people of the Church needed friends. The work in Nauvoo would be hindered if opposition to the Church were allowed to grow . The Prophet and his brethren and sisters of the Church had suffered much without cause. They wanted peace. Perhaps Masonry would help. So, in the light of hist ory, ran the thoughts of the people. With the acquiescence of the Pr ophet, members of the Church already Masons petitioned the Grand Master of Illinois for permission to set up a lodge in Nauvoo. In answer they were granted permission, in October, 1841, to hold lodge meetings; but it was March 15, 1842, before authority was given to set up a l odge in Nauvoo and to induct new members. Joseph Smith became a member. At the time of the lodge organization, Joseph Smith received some of the degrees in Masonry. He was never an active Mason. His other work consumed his time and energy. His history show s that he was extremely busy at this time with a multitude of Church problems. Lodge matte rs would have to be left in other hands. Meanwhile, large numbers of Nauvoo citizens were inducted into the fraternity. Soon the Nauvoo lodge had more members than all the ot her Illinois lodges together. It became the largest in the state. In this rapid growth, some lodge e rrors appear to have been made. These however could easily have been corrected."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"However, Joseph's Masonic membership di d not lessen the persecution. The religious claims of the Mormons were ridiculed; thei r political power seemed a threat; and their prosperity nettled the less successful neighbors. The attempt to win sufficient friends th rough Masonry to stop persecution failed. The Masons after all were only a small fracti on of the people of the territory surrounding Nauvoo. And no one knows with certainty whet her any of them took part in the \"Mormon\" persecutions. The whole terrible affa ir leading to the assassination of the Prophet and his brother Hyrum wa s a local affair within th e Nauvoo territory, where lived people of many faiths and allegiances. Evidences and Reconciliations, p.357 Copyright © by Bookcraft by W. John Walsh It is rather common for enemies of the Church to attack Latter-day Saints because some of our early Church leaders, including Joseph Smith, were associated with the Freemasonry movement. Many of these critcs ha te Freemasons with the same degree of passion with which they loath Latter-day Saints . Therefore, it seems appropriate to make a few comments about Freemasons. The following is information received from a local lodge: Freemasons are respectable citiz ens who are taught to conf orm to the moral laws of society and abide by the laws of the governme nt under which they live. They are men of charity and good works. They remain unc hallenged as \"the world's greatest philanthropy!\" The Freemasons of America contribute almost two million dollars every day to charitable causes which they, alone, have establishe d. These services to mankind represent an unparalleled example of the humanitarian commitment and concern of unique and honorable Fraternity. Many of our nation’s early patriots were Free masons, as well as thirteen signers of the Constitution and fourteen Presidents of the United States, beginning with George Washington. Today, the more that four million Freemas ons around the world come from virtually every occupation and profession. Within the Frat ernity however, they all meet as equals. They come from diverse political ideologies, but they meet as friends. They come from virtually every religious belief, but they all believe in one God.

If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself. --Joseph Smith, April 7, 1844. IF THERE IS A RELIGION uniquely and intrinsically American--a religion worked from its soil, and cast in the ardent furnace of its primal dreams--that religion must be Mormonism. Founded in 1830 by the then twenty -four year old Joseph Smith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (as it is formally named) has emerged from relative insularity during the mid-tw entieth century to become a world-wide movement now numbering nine million members. Patriotic, cons ervative, influential, and vastly wealthy: modern Mormonism is a bastion of American culture. Despite its success and respectab ility, however, a fundamental crisis looms before Joseph Smith's church--and the crux of the predicamen t is Joseph Smith. Late twentieth-century Mormonism is being forced into an uncom fortable confrontation with its early nineteenth-century origins--an inevitable en counter given the preem inent import of the founding prophet to his religion. From the start, Joseph Smith has been cast by his church as a man more enlightened than any mortal to walk the earth since the passing of the last biblical apostles. No historic al life could be granted a mo re mythological tenor than has his. To Mormons, Joseph Smith is, simply, \"T he Prophet\". He bares the imago Christi. He alone stands as doorkeeper to the last dispensation of time; to him angels came and restored God's necessary priestly \"keys\" a nd powers; he built the Temple and taught the ancient rituals which therein make of men and women, gods. But now, one hundred and fifty years after hi s death, Smith's place in Western religious history is undergoing an impor tant and creative re evaluation. Historians and religious critics alike are examining him anew. And in his history's newest reading, themes unrecognized by its orthodox inte rpreters are quickly movi ng to stage center. Quite simply put, modern Mormonism--guardian of the Prophet's story--has no idea what to do with the rediscovered, historical, and rather occult Joseph Smith. Two years ago, Harold Bloom's boldly origin al work, The American Religion, offered introduction to this unknown Prophet. Th e intrinsic and true American religion, pronounces Bloom in his widely reviewed book, is a kind of Gnosticism--alone a surprising enough declaration. But in evidence of this American Gnosis and as first hero of his story, Bloom gives us Joseph Smith. Of the man himself, he judges: Other Americans have been religion makers....but none of them has the imaginative vitality of Joseph Smith's revelation, a judgment one makes on the authority of a lifetime spent in apprehending the visions of great poets and original speculators.... So self-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"created was he that he transcends Emerson and Whitman in my imag inative response, and takes his place with the gr eat figures of our fiction.\" 1 And of his religious creation, The God of Joseph Smith is a daring revival of the God of some of the Kabbalists and Gnostics, prophetic sages who, like Smith himself, asserted that they had returned to the true religion....Mormonism is a purely Ameri can Gnosis, for which Joseph Smith was and is a far more crucial figure than Jesus coul d be. Smith is not just 'a' prophet, another prophet, but he is the essentia l prophet of these latter days, leading into the end time, whenever it comes. 2 II. Joseph Smith a modern Gnostic prophet? Cert ainly nowhere within the vast domains of America religion did this proclamation cause more consternation or amazement than within its Mormon provinces and borderla nds. But Bloom (a self-pronounced \"Jewish Gnostic\") is no casual observer ; his knowledge of Gnosis and Kabbalah is tempered by vast experience critiquing the creative matrix of its vision. His thesis deserves--and is receiving--attention. Joseph Smith is taking on a new visage, and words like \"gnostic\", \"kabbalistic\" and \"hermetic\" have suddenl y gained a quite prominent place in the vocabulary employed by those trying to understand him. [See the sidebar, \"Joseph Smith A Gnostic?\"] In the form now foreshadowed, Joseph Smith's story is, of course, almost entirely unknown to his church. The oft-repeated orthodo x version of the story--and the mythic function of that story's recounting--remains so central to the Mormon past and present that it must be heard before exploring the evolving (and in turn, heretical) rereading. That story begins around 1820 when the adol escent Smith retired to a grove near his family's farm in Palmyra, New York and knelt in prayer. Troubled over his own deeply aroused religious yearnings and uncertain wher e to turn for sustenance, he felt compelled to petition God's mercy. \"The Lord heard my cr y in the wilderness\", he wrote in his dairy several years later, \"and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonda y came down from above and rested upon me and I was filled with the spirit of God a nd the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\" 3 When he came to himself again, he was lying on his back, totally drained of strength, looking up at heaven. This was the new Prophet's first vision. The young man apparently told several persons about his experience but, outside his own closely knit family, the account was met with general derision. Then in 1823 there came a second manifestation. On the night of Sept ember 21, while engaged again in prayer, a light suddenly began filling his room. Within the light there appear ed an angelic being. \"His whole person was glorious beyond de scription, and his countenance truly like lightening.\""},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The angel--named Moroni--explained ther e was a book deposited in a nearby hill, a record written upon gold plates by the ancient inhabitants of the American continent. Joseph was instructed that in due time he would be allowed to obtain the record and commence its translation. No sooner had th e messenger departed and the vision ceased, than it began again. Three times the messe nger came, each time repeating exactly the same message. As the cock crowed dawn, th e final apparition e nded. His experience had occupied the entire night. That day Joseph visited the hill. Straight way he found the location shown him in the vision, and there unearthed a stone box contai ning the plates. The angel Moroni again appeared, however, warning he could not yet re move the plates from their resting place. Instead, he would need return to the spot on this same appointed da y each year for four years. Only on the fourth visit would he be allowed to remove the treasure and begin the work of translation. Smith did as instruct ed and four years later, on September 22, 1827, the angel delivered the record to his charge. Soon after obtaining the records, Joseph began his translation. The record was engraved upon the plates in \"reformed Egyptian\", a la nguage Smith read by gazing into the \"Urim and Thummim\", the biblical \"see rs\" delivered to him with th e plates. Called the Book of Mormon after its last ancient redactor and scribe, the reco rd purportedly contained an abridged history of America's ancient inhabita nts--descendants of a Jewish clan who fled Jerusalem shortly before dest ruction of the first Temple. Led by their prophetic patriarch, the wandering Israelites had built a boat, launched themselves into the ocean, and eventually been washed ashore somewhere in the Americas. After arrival in the new land, their descendants multiplied greatly, but were plagued by perpetual fratricidal divisions: a few of the people remained loyal to God, the prophets and their heri tage as descendants of Israel, while many more became unbelieving pagans. According to the book, Christ had appeared after his resurrection and taught this American remnant of Israel. For a century th ereafter the converted Christians lived in peace; but, inevitably, dissension returned. A bout 400 years after Christ's visitation there came a final series of great wars in which th e barbarous unbelievers vanquished the last of Christ's people. Prior to this final cat astrophe, the golden records comprising the Book of Mormon were hidden up to await the time when God would call them forth again. The call came in 1830. In March of that year three thousand copies of the Book of Mormon were printed. A few weeks later the Church of Christ (as it wa s first named) was established with Joseph Smith as its prophe t, seer and revelator. Though central to the events, the B ook of Mormon was, however, only one element in the complete \"restoration\". Smith soon produced several other less noted pseudepi graphic works, prophetic texts authored under identity of the ancients: books of Enoch, Abraham, and Moses. After the Angel Moroni (who, we should add, returned and retrieved from Smith the golden plates),"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"several other angelic messengers also came bear ing \"keys\" pertaining to the true church of God--priestly powers and consecrations lost in the great apostasy overtaking Christianity after its first centuries. John th e Baptist appeared and ordained Smith and a disciple to the lesser, or Aa ronic, priesthood, granting the aut hority to baptize. Next came a visitation of the apostles Peter, James and John, who ordained Joseph to the higher priesthood after the ancient order of Melc hizedek. By 1836, Elijah, Moses, and Christ had all appeared to the new prophet, restoring the fullne ss of God's power and truth. Duly ordained to the restored priesthood, and with Book of Mormon in hand, Joseph's disciples fanned out across th e northeastern states. Their me ssage was simple: the ancient church of God had been restored with its powers, priesthood, and with a re-opened canon--a restoration accomplished by God through a modern prophet. The flock grew quickly. By 1836, a Mormon communalist society flourish ed at Kirtland, Ohio (near Cleveland), and a second gathering of Saints was taki ng form on the Missouri frontier. But between 1837 and 1839 a series of disasters struck. First, amidst a general financial collapse, the Kirtland community was abandoned. Then th e new Zion in Missouri came under violent persecution, culminating in the \"Mormon wa r\", a conflict which finally forced all Mormons out of the state unde r threat of extermination. From this 1839 debacle in Missouri, the beleaguered Mormon refugees retr eated to Illinois, a nd the new city named by the Prophet \"Nauvoo\". Over the next four years the Mormon settlement at Nauvoo emerged from a swampy backwater to become, in 1844, one of the largest cities in state of Illinois. Nearly twenty thousand converts answered the call to Joseph's new Zion, four thousand of them arriving from England alone. Handsome brick homes and shops lined the city's well-planned streets; riverboats unloa ded at its Mississippi docks. And on the bluff above, overlooking the city and river, masons raised a new temple after the ancient order of Solomon. But behind a facade of success, danger and turmoil encompassed the Prophet. By the Spring of 1844 rumors of his multiple marriages and sexual liaisons, of strange rituals and unorthodox teachings, heralded growing turmoil within the Mormon community. Plots abounded. Events were quickly escalating towards scandal and open schism. In early June prominent Mormon dissidents assembled a press in Nauvoo with the intent to publish a paper exposing"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Smith's secret teachings, including the pr actice called po lygamy. The first (and only) issue of the paper did just th at, creating an intole rable situation for Smith. He responded by declaring the press a public nuis ance and ordering it destroyed. For his enemies, this act of obstructing a fr ee press was the last straw: the Prophet had proven himself a theocratic tyrant, and played directly into their hands. He was charged with treason and commanded by the Governor of Illinois to surrender himself. Hoping to avoid the mob violence sure to be directed at Nauvoo if he resisted or fled, Smith surrendered to jail in the nearby but hostile village of Carthage, well aware that he would probably never be allowed to escape alive. As expected, his most rabid enemies quickly gathered to Carthage, and on June 27, 1844 a mo b with painted faces--composed in part of the militia assigned by the Governor to protect him--battered down the jail doors and there shot to death both Joseph and his brother, Hyrum. III. This summary of Smith's history is widely canonized in published accounts of his life. But there is another side to the history just now emerging. Te n years ago a bizarre series of events focused attention on several othe r even more curious facts--elements never before integrated into narrations of Joseph Sm ith's story. When add, they change its tenor entirely. In the early 1980's an obscure book dealer in Salt Lake City named Mark Hofmann began unearthing a series of previously unknown doc uments relating to the early history of Mormonism. Most troublesome among these wa s a letter purportedly written in 1830 by one of Joseph's first disciples. Brimming with references to treasures and enchantments, the letter related how Joseph Smith actually obtained the B ook of Mormon not from an angel, but from a magical white salamander which transfigured itself into a spirit. When disclosed publicly in 1985, the \"Salamander letter\"--as it became known--received prominent discussion in the national media, a nd stimulated intense new activity in circles studying early Mormonism. Unsettled by the damaging publicity brought by the letter, Mormon church authorities began negotiating with Hofmann to purchase and sequester other \"newly discovered\" materials, particularly any that might im pugn orthodox versions of their history. These secret and highly irregular dealings trag ically unraveled afte r a Mormon historian involved with the documents was the victim of a brutal bomb murder. Complex forensic investigations revolving around the murder eventually reveal ed the \"Salamander letter\" and several companion documents to be bogus-- the pathologically in tuitive creations of Hofmann, a master forger turned killer. 4 By then, however, several historians alrea dy had undertaken detail ed reevaluations of Smith, focusing careful attention towards any overlooked associations he might have had with things magical. Ironically, investigator s soon brought to the surface a wealth of unquestionably genuine historical evidence --much of it long available but either misunderstood, suppressed, or ignored--substantia ting that Smith and his early followers"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"had multiple involvements with magic, irre gular Freemasonry, and traditions generally termed occult. IV. Though a work still very much \"in progress\", Joseph Smith's story is now being pieced together in a new and entirely unorthodox fashion. 5 Beginning in his late- adolescent years Joseph was first recognized by others to have paranormal abilities, and between 1822 and 1827 he was enlisted to act as \"seer\" for several groups engaged in treasur e digging. Not only did he possessed a \"seer stone\" into which he could gaze and locate thin gs lost or hidden in the earth, but it has recently became evident this same stone was probably the \"Urim and Thummim\" later used to \"translate\" portions of the Book of Mormon. According to contemporary accounts of the book's writing, Joseph would place his \"see r stone\" in the crown of his hat, and then bend forward with his arms upon his knees and his face buried in the hat. Gazing into the stone while in this posture, he would visualize and then dictate the words to a scribe seated nearby. The treasure digging ac tivities also had involved magical rituals, and it is likely Joseph Smith was cognizant of at least the rudiments of ceremonial magic during his adolescent years. A possible occult mentor to the young Smith has also been identified--a physician named Dr. Luman Walter. Walter was a distant cousin of Smith's future wife and a member of the circle associated with Smith's early treasure quests. By contemporary reports he was not only a"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"physician, but a magician and mesmerist who had traveled extensively in Europe to obtain \"profound learning\"--probably incl uding knowledge of al chemy, Paracelcian medicine, and hermetic lore. Other pieces of evidence added to the picture. Three very curious parchments and a dagger owned by Jo seph Smith's brother, Hyrum, have been careful preserved by his descendants as sacr ed relics, handed down from eldest son to eldest son after his death. Family traditi on maintained they were religious objects somehow used by Hyrum and Joseph. When finally allowed scrutiny by individuals outside the family, it was recognized they were the implements of a ceremonial magician. The dagger bears the sigil of Mars. The three parchments, each apparently intended for a different magical operation, are inscribed w ith a variety of magic symbols and sigils. Another heirloom also fell into perspective: a \"silver medallion\" owned by Joseph Smith and carried on his person at the time of his murd er in Carthage jail, was identified to be a talisman. It is inscribed front and back with the magic square and sigil of Jupiter, the astrological force associated with the year of Joseph Smith's birth. All of these items could have been constructed using the standard texts of ceremonial magic available in the late eighteenth and early nine teenth century: Agrippa's Occult Philosophy, Sibly's Occult Sciences, and Barrett's The Magus. In this light, the vis it of the angel Moroni took on unusual aspects. The angel had appeared on the night of the Autumnal equinox, between midnight and dawn-- hours auspicious for a magical invocation. On the day of the equinox Joseph had subsequently made his four annual visits to the hill. When finally he retrieved the plates, it was the eve of the equinox, in the first hour after midnight. Accounts suggested he had been required to take with him that night a consort (his wife), to ride a black horse, and to dress in black-- all lending a further ma gical tenor to the operation. Historians puzzled over how this information fit into the more commonly recounted story of Smith. Had the magical parchments been us ed to invoke the Angel Moroni or other of the angelic visitors seen by Jo seph? And above all, how did th is relate to the doctrinal substance and evolution of Mormonism, whic h seemed outwardly devoid of a magical tenor? V. While ceremonial magic was a virtually unknown --or at least, little documented--element in Mormonism as encountered by Joseph's follo wers, other occult aspects in his religion were openly evident. The most obvious was its irregular Masonic connections. In 1842,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"two years before his death, Joseph had embraced Masonry. But long before his own initiation as a Mason in Nauvoo, he had trav eled in company with Masons--a society which included, among other prominent disciples, Brigham Young. His earliest connection with the Craft probably came with his brother (and clos e life-long companion) Hyrum's initiation as a Mason around 1826, just shortly before Joseph began work on the Book of Mormon. 6 Sometime before 1826, Joseph may even have had contact with the hist orically important Masonic figure, Capt. William Morgan. Morg an published the first American authored exposé of Masonic rites at Batavia, New York in 1826; his disappearance (and assumed murder) just before the book's printing was widely judged an act of Masonic vengeance and sparked a national wave of fierce anti-M asonic activity. Given their close geographic proximity--they lived about twelve miles apar t--it is quite possibl e Morgan and Smith met; one nineteenth century Masonic historia n even suggested that Smith influenced Morgan. Interestingly, in 1834 the widow of William Morgan, Lucinda, converted to Mormonism along with her second husband, George Washi ngton Harris. Harris was also a Mason and former associate of William Morgan. Jo seph Smith became closely acquainted with George and Lucinda around 1836, and sometime thereafter he entere d into an intimate relationship with Lucinda. Eventually Lucinda became one of his ritually wed \"spiritual wives\"--a relationship which fully evolved de spite her still being married to Harris. The Prophet's intercourse with Masonry after 1841 became extremely complex. In June of 1841, efforts to establish a Masonic Lodge at Nauvoo began, and a few months later a dispensation for the Lodge was granted. On March 15, 1842 the lodge was installed, and that evening Joseph Smith was initiated. The next day he was passed and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason. Two days later Smith organize a \"Female Relief Society\", perhaps intending it to be a Ma sonic auxiliary, or the beginning of an \"adoptive\", androgynous new Mormon Masonry. Eventually ever officer of the Female Relief Society also became a spiritual wife a nd consort of Joseph's, with his first wife Emma acting as president of the Society (a situation understandably complicated by the fact that Emma did not completely unde rstand Joseph's relations hip with the other women). These last three years before his murder in 1844 were unquestionably the most creative period in a uniquely creative life. Shortly after his Masonic initi ations, Smith began formulating the rituals that would be instituted in his own Mormon Temple, then still under early phases of construc tion in Nauvoo. Six weeks later a first version of this \"endowment\" (as the ritual wa s subsequently called) was given by Joseph to a \"Holy Order\" of nine disciples, all of whom were Master Masons. Many elements of the \"endowment\" ritual directly paralleled Ma sonic ceremony, a fact plainly evident to participants. Smith explained to his followe rs that Masonry was a remnant--even if somewhat corrupted--of the ancient priest hood God had commissioned him to restore in its fullness. In turn, essentially every prom inent male figure in the Mormon Church who was present as an adult in Nauvoo became a Master Mason."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Another unusual element entered the matrix of Smith's creativity around this time. From his associations with ceremonial magic and then Masonry, Smith had almost certainly heard of \"Cabala\". But in 1841 a Jew raised in the Polish borderlands of Prussia, educated at the University of Berlin, a nd familiar with Kabbalah, joined the Mormon church, migrated to Nauvoo, and there became Smith's frequent companion and tutor in Hebrew. Documentation has recently come to light suggesting this individual, Alexander Neibaur, not only knew Kabbalah, but probabl y possessed in Nauvoo a copy of its classic text, the Zohar. Joseph likely became familiar with the Zohar while under the tutelage of Neibaur. Indeed, it appears Smith's April 7, 1844 public declaration of a plurality of Gods was supported by an exegesis on the first He brew words of Genesis (Bereshith bara Elohim) drawn from opening section of the Zohar. 7 During the period after 1841, Joseph introduced the practice of plural \"celestial marriage\"--what later evolved into Mormon polygamy in Utah--to a small group of his most trusted followers. In this era not only men, but a few women--like Lucinda-- secretly took a \"plural\" spouse. The sacred wedding ritualized by Smith was a transformative union that anointed men and women to become \"priests and priestesses\", \"kings and queens\", and then ultimately Goddess and God--the dual creative substance of Divinity in eternal, tantric intercourse. The ceremony was intended to be performed in the holiest precincts of his new Temple. By late 1843 Joseph revealed seve ral ritual extensions to the \"endowment\", all ultimately incorporated into Mormon Te mple ceremony. This legacy of mysterious initatory rituals rev ealed by Joseph Smith between 1842 a nd 1844 remains little altered as the sacred core of Mormonism. Fifty years later, at the end of the nineteenth century, lead ers of the Utah church would still occasionally state in private that the Mormon temple ritual embodied \"true Masonry\"--a fact unknown to most modern Mormons. But then, of course, almost all of this history is unknown to the average mode rn Mormon. Even well-educated \"Latter-day Saints\" today seldom understand the origins of the compass and square embroidered upon the breasts of the ritual garment worn by temple initiates. The relationship of these temple rituals' development with Joseph Smith's occult vision and the concurrent introduction of Masonry in Nauvoo is now, however, becoming the subject of intense renewed interest. VI."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"In the autumn of 1994 pieces of the prophet puz zle began falling into place; a unifying pattern was discerned within the unusual array of historical information outlined above. Joseph Smith's quest for a sacred golden trea sure buried in dark earth, his involvement with ceremonial magic, the angelic visitations , the pseudepigraphic te xts he \"translated\", his declaration of Masonry as a remnant of priesthood, and his restoration of a Temple with its central mystery of a sacred wedding--a ll could be fitted into one very recently recognized context: Hermeticism. Not only did Smith have numerous documented a ssociations with hist orical legacies of Hermeticism such as magic and Masonry, but his religious creation also evidenced several parallels with Hermetic ideas. John L. Brooke, professor of history at Tufts University, has recently explored this s ubject in a seminal 1994 study of Mormonism and Hermeticism, The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644-1844 . 8 Brooke notes the \"striking parallels between the Mormon concepts of coequality of matter and spirit, of the covena nt of celestial marriage, and of an ultimate goal of human godhood and the philosophical tradi tions of alchemy and Hermeticism, drawn from the ancient world and fused with Christianity in the Italian Renaissance. \" Of course, in this light Harold Bloom's poetic reading of Joseph Smith as a \"Gnostic\" takes on broadened nuances: though unnoted by Bloom, Smith's relig ion-making imagination was allied in several ways with remnants of an hermetic tradition frequently linked to gnosticism. In investigating Smith's connect ion with Hermeticism, histori cal attention is also being newly focused on evidences supporting an oft-ig nored claim of esoteric lore: the import of Hermeticism in the evolution of early Am erica's religious consci ousness and political culture. This has broad implications for our understanding of the new nation's religious history. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there devel oped within Europe's religious crucible a complex alloying of Hermeticism and alchemical mysticism with radical aspirations for Christian reformation. Brooke well documents how this intersection between dispensational restorati onism and the hermetic occult flowed into early American culture and re ligion: among Quakers, Pietis ts, and perfectionists coming to Pennsylvania and New Jersey between about 1650 and 1730; thr ough the \"culture of print\" conveyed by alchemical and hermetic texts brought from Europe; and in the development of late-eighteenth century esoter ic Masonry with its rich foundations in Kabbalistic, hermetic and alchemical mythology. As a young man in the company of occult trea sure seekers, drawing magic circles and battling enchantments in the Pennsylvani a countryside, Joseph Smith probably first learned about this alternative and very un-Pu ritan religious vision. Smith may even have there heard the old Rosicrucian legend of a sixteen year old prophet named Christian Rosencreutz and the mysterious Book M whic h he had translated. Certainly he would have learned of alchemy's transmutational mystery, and of the Philosopher's Stone. Soon after, the eighteen year old Smith found his own sacred treasure bur ied in earth, a treasure golden and yet--as alchemical lore promised--o f substance more subtle than vulgar gold. Gazing into his seer stone, he saw in the B ook of Mormon's golden plates a of record ancient fratricidal oppositions, a nd a Christ who brought union."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"For a decade, Brooke suggests, Smith's emergent hermetic theology was disguised under the coloring of traditional Christian restora tionism and formed as new Christian church. But finally, in the last years of his life, the veil was parted: At Nauvoo he publicly and unequivocally anno unced his new theology of preexistent spirits, the unity of matter and spirit, and the divinization of the faithful, and he privately pursued the consummation of alchemical-celesti al marriage as the ultimate vehicle to this divinity. The alchemical-hermetic term of coniunctio powerfully summarizes the resolution that Smith had achieved at Nauvoo by the summer of 1844. He had established a theology of the conjunction--the unificat ion--of the living and the dead, of men and women, of material and spiritual, of secu lar and sacred, all un ited in a \"new and everlasting covenant\" over which he would preside as king and god. In these circumstances the conventional boundary be tween purity and danger, right and wrong, law and revolution, simply melted away.... In effect the greater Mormon emergence can be visualized as meta-alchemical expe rience running from opposition to union, an experience shaped and driven by the personality of Joseph Smith. 9 VII. How this strange hermetic religion evolved into today's Mormon church is one of the more interesting questio ns awaiting detailed study, partic ularly as the contours of Joseph Smith's vision become more sharply define d. I can here, however, give only a rough summary of what followed Smith's death. Joseph established no clear order of prophetic succession, and in the chaotic period after his martyrdom several followers claimed his office and prophetic mantle. Brigham Young, long a loyal apostle to Smith, emerged as the natural organizational leader and was eventually proclaimed the new \"prophet, seer and revelator\"--a position he held until his death three decades later. Forced to abandon Nauvoo in the winter of 1846, Brigham Young led his people through their difficult fli ght to the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and there organized the new Mormon society. Young staunchly defended the teachings and rituals presented by Smith in Nauvoo, including the temple ceremonies and the doctr ines relating to polyga my. Isolated in the Rocky Mountain wilderness, he hoped to real ize Joseph's millennial dreams and establish Zion unhampered by a hostile, misunderstandi ng world. But it was not to be. With the full force of the United States government and a Victorian public morality marshaled against the Mormon church, in 1890 the pr actice of polygamy had to be publicly abandoned. After its defeat in that e pochal battle, Mormonism slowly found accommodation with the world it had fled. In the process, many elements of Joseph's mystery religion were necessarily veil or attenuated--and by the late twentieth century, perhaps largely forgotten. For students of religion, the Prophet Joseph Smith today remains a grand American enigma--too potent a force to be dismissed uncommented, and yet too complex for facile categorization. In the final analysis, I must agree with Bloom that \"we do not know"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Joseph Smith, as he prophesied that even his own could never hope to know him. He requires strong poets, major novelist, accomplished dramatists to tell his history, and they have not yet come to him.\" But the tides ma y be shifting. While the Prophet still awaits his poets, historians are examining with new wonder this most extraordinary chapter in American religious history. A \"Gnostic\" Joseph Smith? Harold Bloom's coupling of Joseph Smith to the Gnostic tradition has aroused animated disagreement among students of Mormonism and Gnosticism alike. Several questions crucial to modern Gnostic studies are rais ed by this emerging dialogue: What is the relationship of later \"Gnostic\" movements to classical Gnosticism? Were rudiments of the tradition conveyed to post- classical groups by historical links (oral transmissions, myths and texts); was it instead the independent product of a recurrent type of creative vision? Or are dual forces of historical transmission a nd primary Gnostic experience generally interdependent, even occultly lin ked? While Joseph Smith had historical connection with late remnan ts of Gnosticism conveyed by Renaissance Hermeticism and Kabbalah, his religious creation nonetheless clearly derived in large part from a personal experience. Was that primal cr eativity \"Gnostic\"? If so, how did it relate to the matrix of tradition? The complexity of these questions defy si mple declarations. Nonetheless, Smith did apparently espouse themes familiar to Gnosticism--prominent among them being his affirmation of the reality and necessity of c ontinuing, individual revelation as the source of salvific knowledge. Joseph Smith and his religion eschewed theology in favor of the dynamic process of revelation. The result was best summarized in what Bloom remarked to be \"one of the truly remarkable serm ons ever preached in America\", a discourse delivered by the Prophet on April 7, 1844. K nown as the the King Follett Discourse, it was Joseph's last major address to his church, presented just ten week s before his death at age 38. \"There are but very few beings in the wo rld who understand rightly the character of God,\" he began. \"If men do not comprehe nd the character of God, they do not comprehend their own characte r.\" Within humankind there is an immortal spark of intelligence, taught the Prophet, a seed of divine intellect or light which is \"as immortal as, and coequal with, God Himself.\" God is not, however, to be understood as one and singular. Turning to Hebrew a nd an oddly Kabbalistic exegesis of the first three words of Genesis (an exegesis probably taken direc tly from the Zohar), Smith pronounced there are a multitude of Gods emanated from th e First God, existing one above the other without end. He who humankind calls G od was Himself once a man; and man, by advancing in intelligence, knowledge--conscious ness--may be exalted with God, become as God."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Near the beginning of his mi nistry in 1833, Smith declared \"the glory of God is intelligence\", eternal and uncreated. Those who wish to find in him a Gnostic have pointed out that Smith used the word \"intel ligence\" interchangeably with \"knowledge\" in his prophetic writings during this period. Inde ed, they suggest, his words might be read poetically to proclaim God's glory is Gnosis--a Gnosis that saves woman and man by leading them together to a single uncr eated and intrinsically divine Self.
