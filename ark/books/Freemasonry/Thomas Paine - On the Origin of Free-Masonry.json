It is only in the Master- Mason's Lodge that whatever know- ledge remains of the origin of masonry is pre-* served and concealed.

There was no difficulty in his doing this as it is mere form. . In his introduction he says, \" The original in- stitution of masonry consisted in the foundation of the liberal arts and sciences, but more espe- cially on Geometry; for at the building of the Tower of Babel the art and mystery of Ma- sonry was first introduced, and from thence handed down by Euclid, a worthy and excellent Mathematician of the Egyptians ; and he com- municated it to Hiram, the Master Mason con- cerned in building Solomon's Temple in Jeru- salem.\" Besides the absurdity of deriving masonry from the building of Babel, where, according to the story, the confusion of languages prevent- ed builders understanding each other, and conse- quently of communicating any knowledge they had, there is a glaring contradiction in point of chronology in the account he gives."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6. UN THE ORIGIN Solomon's Temple was built and dedicated 1004 years before the christian era; and Euclid, as may be seen in the tables of chronology, lived 277 years before the same era. It was there- fore impossible that Euclid could communicate any thing to Hiram, since Euclid did not live till 700 years after the time of Hiram. In 1783 captain George Smith, inspector of the Royal Artillery Academy, at Woolwich, in England, and Provincial Grand Master of Ma- sonry for the county of Kent, published a treatise entitled The Use and Abuse of Free -Masonry, In his chapter of the antiquity of masonry he makes it to be coeval with creation, \" When, says he, the sovereign architect raised on masonic principles, the beauteous globe, and commanded that master science, Geometry, to lay the plane- tary world, and to regulate by its laws the whole stupendous system in just unerring pro- portion, rolling round the centra! sun. 5,1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"OF FREE-MASONRY. 7 iZ But, continues he, I am not at liberty pub- licly to undraw the curtain, and openly to des- cant on this head, it is sacred, and ever will remain so; those who are Honoured with the trust will not reveal it, and those who are ignor- ant of it cannot betray it,\" By this last part of the phrase, Smith means the two inferior classes, the fellow-craft and the entered apprentice, for he says in the next page of his work, \" It is not every one that is barely initiated into Free- Ma- sonry that is entrusted with all the mysteries thereto belonging; they are not attainable las things of course, nor by every capacity.\" The learned but unfortunate Doctor Dodd, Grand Chaplain of Masonry, in his oration at the dedication of Free-Mason's Hall, London, traces Masonry through a variety of stages. Masons, says he, are well informed from their own private and interior records that the build- ing of Solomon's Temple is an important era, from whence they derive many mysteries of their art. \" Now, says he, be it remembered that this"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3 ON THE ORIGIN great event took place above 1000 years before The Christian era, and consequently more than a century before Homer, the first of the Grecian Poets, wrote; and above five centuries before Pythagoras brought from the east his sublime system of truly masonic instruction to illuminate our western world. \" But remote as this period is, we date not from thence the commencement of our art. For though it might owe to the wise and glori- ous King of Israel, some of its many mystic forms and hieroglyphic ceremonies, yet certainly the art itself is coeval with man, the great subject of it. \" We trace, continues he, its footsteps in the most distant, the most remote ages and nations of the world. We find it among the first and most celebrated civilizers of the East. We deduce it regularly from the first astronomers on the plains of Chaldea, to the wise and mystic kings and priests of Egypt, the sages of Greece, and the philosophers of Rome.\""},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"OF FREE-MASONRY. 9 From these reports and declarations of Masons of the highest order in the institution, we see that Masonry, without publicly declaring so, lays claim to some divine communication from the creator in a manner different from, and un- connected with, the book which the christians call the bible ; and the natural result from this is, that Masonry is derived from some very an- cient religion wholly independent of, and uncon^ ftected with that book. To come then at once to the point, Masonry (as I shall shew from the customs, ceremonies, hieroglyphics and chronology of Masonry) is derived, and is the remains of, the religion of the ancient Druids ; who like the magi of Persia and the priests of Heliopolis in Egypt, were Priests of the Sun.

At what period of antiquity, or in what na- tion, this religion w r as first established, is lost in the labyrinth of unrecorded times. It is gene- rally ascribed to the ancient Egyptians, the Babylonians and Chaldeans, and reduced after- w r ards to a system regulated by the apparent pro- gress of the sun through the 12 signs of the Zodiac by Zoroaster the law- giver of Persia, from whence Pythagoras brought it into Greece, It is to these matters Dr. Dodd refers in the passage already quoted from his oration.

Smith, in his chapter on the Antiquity of Ma- sonry in Britain, says, that, \" Notwithstanding the obscurity which envelopes Masonic history in that country, various circumstances contri- bute to prove that Free-Masonry was introdu- ced into Britain about 1030 years before Christ.\" It cannot be Masonry in its present state that Smith here alludes to. The Druids flourished in Britain at the period he speaks of, and it is from them that Masonry is descended. Smith has put the child in the place of the parent. It sometimes happens ns well in writing as in conversation that a person lets slip an expression that serves to unravel what he intends to conceal, and this is the case with Smith, for in the same"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ON THE ORIGIN chapter he says, \" The Druids, when they com- mitted any thing to writing, used the Greek al- phabet, and I am bold to assert that the most per. feet remains of the # Druids' rites and ceremonies are preserved in the customs and ceremonies of the Masons that are to be found existing among mankind.

Free Masons Hall, in great Queen-street, Lin- colns Inn fields, London, is a magnificent build- ing, and cost upwards of 12,000 pounds sterling. Smith, in speaking of this building says (page 152) '• The roof of this magnificent Hall is, in all probability the highest piece of finished ar- chitecture in Europe. In the center of this roof, a most resplendent sun is represented in burnished gold, surrounded with the 12 signs of the Zodiac with their respective characters : Aries fy^. Libra =z=. Taurus &.

Because all churches and chapels are or ought to be so. This answ r er, which is mere catechismal form', is not an answer to the question. It does no more than remove the question a point further, which is, why ought all churches and chapels to be so? But as the Entered Apprentice is not initiated into the druidical mysteries of Masonry, he is not asked any questions to which a direct answer would lead thereto. Q. Where stands your Master? A.

Here the name of the sun is mentioned, but it is proper to observe, that in this place it has reference only to labour or to the time of labour, and not to any religious druidical rite or cere- mony, as it would have with respect to the situation of Lodges East and West.

The christians never bury their dead on the north side of a church ; and a Mason's Lodge always has, or is supposed to have, three windows, which are called fixed lights, to distinguish them from the moveable lights of the sun and the moon. The Master asks the Entered Apprentice Q. How are they (the fixed lights) situated? A. East, west, and south. Q. What are their uses ? A. To light the men to and from their work. Q. Why are there no lights in the North ? A. Because the sun darts no rays from thence. This among numerous other instances shews that the christian religion and Masonry have one and the same common origin, the ancient wor- ship of the sun.

The sun is then arrived at the sum- mer solstice, and with respect to his meridional altitude, or height at high noon, appear for some days to be of the same height. The astronomi- cal longest day, like the shortest day, is not every year, on account of Leap year, on the same numerical day, and therefore the 24th of June is always taken for midsummer day; and it is in honour of the sun, which has then arrived at his greatest height in our hemisphere, and not any thing with respect to St. John, that this annual"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"OF FREE-MASONRY. 19 festival of the Masons, taken from the Druids, is celebrated on midsummer day. Customs will often outlive the remembrance of their origin, and this is the case with respect to a custom still practised in Ireland, where the Druids flourished at the time they flourished in Britain. On the eve of St. John's day, that is, on the eve of midsummer day, the Irish light fires on the tops of the hills. This can have no reference to St. John ; but it has emblemati- cal reference to the sun which on that day is at his highest summer elevation, and might in common language be said to have arrived at the top of the hill. As to what masons and books of masonry tell us of Solomon's Temple at Jerusalem, it is no ways improbable that some masonic ceremonies may have been derived from the building of that Temple, for the worship of the sun was in prac- tice many centuries before the temple existed, or before the Israelites came out of Egypt. And"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"S3 ON THE ORIGIN we learn from the history of the Jewish Kings, 2 Kings, chap. 22, 23, that the worship of the sun was performed by the Jews in that temple. It is, however, much to be doubted, if it was done with the same scientific purity and religious mo- rality, with which it was performed by the Druids, who by all accounts that historically re- main of them, were a wise, learned and moral class of men. The Jews, on the contrary, were ignorant of astronomy, and of science in general, and if a religion founded upon astronomy, fell into their hands, it is almost certain it would be cor- rupted. We do not read in the history of the Jews, whether in the bible or elsewhere, that they were the inventors or the improvers of any one art or science. Even in the building of this temple, the Jews did not know how to square and frame the timber for beginning and carrying on the work, and Solomon was obliged to send to Hiram, King of Tyre, (Zidon) to procure workmen; \" for thou knonvest, (says Solomon to Hiram) 1 Kings, chap. 5, v. 6) that there is not among us any that can skill to hem timber"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"OP FREE-MASONRY. 21 like unto the Zidonians.\" This Temple was more properly Hiram's Temple than Solomon's, and if the Masons derive any thing from the building of it, they owe it to the Zidonians and not to the Jews. — But to return to the worship of the sun in this Temple. It is said, 2 kings, chap. 23, v. 5, \" and King Josiah put down all the Idolatrous priests that burned incence unto the sun, the moon, the planets and to all the host of heaven.\" — And it is said at the 11th v. M and he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the Lord, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire, v. 13, and the high places that were before Jerusa- lem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Astoreth, the abomination of the Zidonians (the very people that built the temple) did the king defile. Besides these things, the description that"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 ON THE ORIGIN Josephus gives of the decorations of this Tem- ple, resemble on a large scale, those of a Ma- son's Lodge. He says that the distribution of the several parts of the Temple of the Jews represented all nature, particularly the parts most apparent of it, as the sun, the moon, the planets, the zodiac, the earth, the elements, and that the system of the world was retraced there by numerous ingenious emblems. These, in all probability, are what Josiah, in his ignorance, calls the abomination of the Zidonians.* Every tiling, however, drawn from this Templef and * Smith in speaking of a Lodge says, when the Lodge is revealed to an entering Mason, it discovers to him a represen- tation of the World; in which from the wonders of nature we are led to contemplate her great original, and worship him from his mighty works; and we are thereby also moved to exercise those moral and social virtues which become mankind as the servants of the great Architect of the world. t It may not be improper here to observe, that the law called the law of Moses, could not have been in existence at the time of building this Temple.

Another circumstance which shews that Ma- sonry is derived from some ancient system, prior to, and unconnected with, the christian re- ligion, is the chronology, or method of counting time, used by the Masons in the records of their Lodges. They make no use of what is called the christian era, and they reckon their months numerically as the ancient Egyptians did, and as the Quakers do now. I have by me a re- cord of a French Lodge at the time the late Duke of Orleans, then Duke de Chartres was Grand Master of Masonry in France. It begins as follows : about with cherubims and palm-trees, and open flowers, and that he made a molten sea, placed on twelve oxen, and that the ledges of it were ornamented with lions, oxen and cherubims; all this is contrary to the law called the law of Moses."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 ON THE ORIGIN \" Le trentieme jour du sixieme mots de Van de la V.

D. mean in the year of the Lord. But A. L. like V. L. refers to the same chronological era, that is, to the supposed time of the Creation. Though the Masons have taken many of their ceremonies and hieroglyphics from the ancient Egyptians, it is certain they have not taken their chronology from thence.

Every thing used as an hieroglyphic, has reference to the subject and purpose for which it is used; and we are not to suppose the Free- Masons, among whom are many very learned and scientific men, to be such idiots as to make use of astronomical signs with- out some astronomical purpose.

There is a society of Masons in Dublin who take the name of Druids; these Masons must be supposed to have a reason for taking that name, I come now to speak of the cause of secresy used by the Masons. The natural source of secresy is fear. When any new religion over-runs a former religion, the professors of the new become the persecutors of the old.
