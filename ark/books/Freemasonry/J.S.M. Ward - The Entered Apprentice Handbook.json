I ndeed, it would b e surprising if this were the ca se. Like Holy Writ, the Ritual is capable of many interpretations. It is a gradual acc retion in which succee ding epochs have left their mark. Evolution takes place und er the a lternation o f f orces that m ake f or difference a nd agreement. The process demands a c ontinual adjustm ent between these a pparently contrary, bu t i n reality complementary factors. Each age sets out t o b alance a ny deficiency in the prece ding period. When materialism has been pu shed to excess , the tendency is rectified b y a spiritual revival. On the other hand, an age in which zeal for the gifts of the spirit has caused n eglect of temporal welfare is naturally followed b y a renaissance of the just claim s of the flesh. The subject m atter of Mas onry is the relationship b etween Spirit and Matter, b etween Heaven and Earth, b etween God and Man, b etween the Soul and the Body. Emphasis is everywhere laid on the nece ssity of their reconciliation. Consequently to attain the just mili eu emphasis has s ome tim es to b e laid on on e side a nd sometim es on the other. For example, the Cross and the Square, which h ave now such d eeply spiritual significance , were originally signs of Earth, and b eca me respectively, the e ssential symbols of Christianity and Masonry, beca use it was nece ssary to p roclaim t he fact that professions of piety towards God were idle, un less they bore fruit i n k indly relationship between man and man. Bro. Ward regards the J.W. as representing the bod y, and the S.W. the soul, althou gh the e mble ms and jewel of the former are ce lestial and o f the latter terrestrial. The fact is that things divine a nd hu man are so interwoven in Masonry as to b e inseparable. Duty towards God and towards our neighbo r are but different aspects of the same truth. For t he Fatherhood o f God im plies the Brotherhood o f Man, and, conv ersely, he who d evotes him self to the service of his fellow creatures proves, through h is brotherly relationship, h is descent from t he Father of AII. The issue of Bro. Ward's s eries of handbook s canno t fail t o acc omplish its main ob ject, which is to lead no t only juniors, bu t also those well versed in the ritual, to mark, learn and inwardly digest the significance of the ce remonies, which when p roperly und erstood, causes our jewels and emblems to glow with an inner light which infinitely enhances their beauty. The ready rece ption which Bro.

The W.M. calls the brethren together with on e kno ck so as to remi nd them t hat the bod y must be prepared to ob ey the higher f ac ulties, for if it i s not, no spiritual progress is possible. The first question and answer of the J.W. indicate this quite c learly, for the J.W. represents the bod y and so h e satisfies him self that m an's bod y is on guard against outside influences. The S. W., representing the Soul, n ext proves that all present have made some progress towards the light. It i s only when this has been achieved that any real advancement becomes possible, and on ly those who h ave started can h elp those who still remain in spiritu al darkness. The next series of questions indicates that Man h as a seven - fold n ature. The Ancient Egyptians held this view , and it i s endo rsed in Masonry by the fact that it takes s even to make a perfect lodge. There is also, no doub t, an astrological r eference to the seven p lanets and a c onn ection with stellar worship, bu t as our system i s mainly solar, it i s alm ost im possible to give a logical planetary interpretation to the seven who form a lodge, o r to the seven o fficers. In short, the planetary symb olism has become disorganized by the stress laid on the solar aspect of the three principal officers who rule a lodge. Moreover, the predomi nance of the solar aspect has emphasized the triune nature of man, and symbolizes it i n these officers. Thus it wil l be seen that too much stress must not be laid on the planets, as represented b y the seven o fficers, and a passing reference to the fact that it i s s till remembered in the number seven is all t hat can b e logically maintained."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Simil arly there is merely a hint of the seven - fold n ature of man. If ours were a stellar system, then clearly the Tyler would represent t he bod y, the divine spark would b e represented b y the W.M. , the various officers between would symbolize the various s ub - divisions of the non - mate rials parts of man, such as his astral bod y, h is intellectual faculties, and so forth. Since, ho wever, ou r system i s s olar in the main, we shou ld continue to interpret our symbols from t hat aspect, making but passing reference to stellar influences when t hey occur. The duties of the Tyler are c onsidered elsewhere, so we will pass to the I.G. Althou gh in some popu lar workings he a nd the other two subo rdinate officers are not allowed to speak for themselves, the Wardens doing this work, in many other r itual s they are a llowed to answer the W.M. direct. The I.G. stands for the power which p ermit s the Soul to enter flesh at any given moment. The Soul m ay desire to b ecome incarnate, bu t unless its tim e has come it i s turned b ack at the threshold, and even if it forces itself into b irth it i s cut short. Entry into life is not an acc ident, bu t ordained o f God, Who works through His s piritual as well as through His human agents. Those who saw Maeterlinck's play, \"The Blue Bird,\" will remember that the same idea i s dealt with in on e of the scenes. Spiritually, the I.G. represents the warning which must be given to those who attempt, withou t due ca ution, to p robe into the Mysteries of God. They must neither rush forward hastily, no r, having once started, withdraw s udd enly; for, if they do, d ire e vil will befall. This warning all t he Mysteries gave, and it i s certain that those who d abble in the so - called o ccult run grave risks unless they use the utm ost caution. Hence it i s absolutely essential that the ca ndidate s hou ld b e properly prepared b efore he starts on h is quest. The J.D. represents the physical m eans by which the Soul, represented b y the S.W., passes on the inspirations rece ived from t he Spirit, the W.M., to the material world. In this s ense therefore he r epresents intelligence, and the five senses of man, whereas the S.D. stands for intuition, whereby the Soul obtains its inspiration from t he Divine. In the a ncient operative days these officers no doub t had a practical use, the S.D. b eing the personal m es senger of the Master, who took messages to the S.W., no t m erely when in Lodge, bu t when h e was at a distance, employed on h is task, o r possibly when h e was resting from his labou rs, In like manner the S.W. 's deac on was s ent by him t o find the J.W. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The J. W. d escribes his position in L. and indicates quite c learly that he represents the Sun at noon. From t he operative point of view it m ust be remembered that Noon h as always been, and still i s, a workingman's dinner hou r, h ence the special duty of the J.W. ; but i n the spiritual sense, since he stands for the bod y, it i s natural that he shou ld h ave c harge over the bod y's needs. As he a lso represents the preservative side of God, h is interest in the physical well - being of man is appropriate. With this in mi nd the F. C. will realize the significance of the P.W., and its conn ection with C. and W. , which are the e mblems of the God o f Vegetation in the more primiti ve rites. When men evolved, and the solar system of r eligion d eveloped, the God o f Vegetation b eca me the Preserver. This characteristic of the J.W. is emphasized b y the upright li nes of his plumb, which latter remi nds us of water which falls from heaven, and o f the ca st m arks of Vishnu in India. This aspect of the J.W., as representing the Preserver , i s carefully maintained throughou t the whole of the three degrees and must never be forgotten. In like manner, the fact that he stands for the bod y is also maintained throughou t. Bearing this in mi nd , we shall perceive the significance of the fact that the Architect of K.S. 's Temple was the J.W. Finally, b read and water represent the bare nece ssities, withou t which mortal li fe ca nno t be preserved. Luxuries, which are obtained when we have ac quired worldly possessions, i.e., wealth, lead to the death o f t he soul, and even o f the bod y, un less employed with the greatest caution. Some masons claim t hat the J.W. o riginally sat in the North to mark the Sun at noon, meaning to see, o r point out, that it had reac hed the mi dheavens. Honestly, I can find no real e vidence in suppo rt of this view, which likewise place s the W.M. in the West and the S.W. in the East. It is due, in my opinion, to a c omplete mi sund erstanding of the use of the words \"to mark.\" This phrase im plies that the J.W. is place d on a ce rtain spot to mark the position of the Sun at noon, and no t that 'he may see it. In a c losed - in bu ilding, such as a lodge room was, it would b e desirable to mark the three positions of the Sun, for the ca ndidate has to p ass through eac h po int in turn, and these thre e officers, who represent the Sun in its three a spects, would n aturally sit i n the positions in u se in a speculative lodge. Any arguments addu ced from t he rituals of the modern Operative Lodges are vitiated b y two facts - (1) we have no evidence that this p eculiarity is really old (it m ay be due to Stretton's inventive mi nd) and (2) the Operatives, if old, would b e descended from t he Guild Masons and no t from t he Freemasons ; and this mi ght be a peculiarity of theirs, o r deliberately adop ted so as to d iffere ntiate them from t he Freemasons. That the Guild Masons and Freemasons were quite distinct has been p roved as far back as 1913, and the fact is gone into in my other book, \"Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"That the Operatives are not descended d irect fro m t he Mediaeval Freemasons is s hown b y the fact that they have e ntirely different signs from our own. Thus we need no t discuss further the question as to whether the J.W. shou ld b e in the North o r South. The S.W., as he indicates in h is reply to the W.M. , represents the Sun in its s etting, and so the Destructive Side of the Deity, o r Shiva. He a lso stands for the Soul. Shiva shall close not only our mortal li fe, bu t Tim e itself. But I have dealt with this s ide of the S.W. v ery fully elsewhere. It shou ld be noted, ho wever, that the S.W. is associated with level and ho rizontal li nes , and no t with p erpendiculars, and h ere a gain h e follows the Hindoo system, for Shiva's caste mark is two o r more parallel li nes. As the Great Leveller this is most natural, and it remi nds us that in the sight of God all souls are e qual, even thou gh in mortal li fe their stations may appear to d iffer. Shiva is associated with the e lement of Fire, whereas Vishnu is associated with Water, and as we see that great care has been take n to maintain the c onn ection b etween the J.W. and Water, so we find that with u s the S.W. is s imil arly associated with Fire, thou gh perhaps less obv iously. Firstly, h is level is of a triangular form with the point upward, the world - wide symbol for Fire. Ag ain, the S.W. 's P.W. h as hidden within it t he same idea. A smit h who works in metals can on ly do so b y the help o f fire, and in on e ritual this fact is s tressed. Thus metals come out from t he dark earth, and the Sun sinks in the West into darkness and the grave, as does man. But, b y means of fire, man ob tains wealth from t he metals hidden in the ea rth, and in like manner the Soul of Man rises refined and pu rified from t he grave by means of the divine fire within. Moreover, on e ca nno t ignore the fact that there is here a hint of the nece ssity of the purging fire of remorse to cleanse a way our sins. The S. W. is the Soul, the link b etween mortal li fe a nd the Divine Spark , bu t he ac ts on instructions from t he Spirit; i n o ther words, it i s only when God d ecr ees our death that the Soul departs from t he bod y. The W.M. represents, as his words indicate, the c reative side of God and the Divine Spirit in Man. He sets us to work on earth, bu t delegates to another the task o f calling us back whence we ca me. He repr esents the male a spect of the Deity, as is s hown b y the tau crosses, called levels, on h is apron, and b y his use of the gavel, which represents the same emblem. The Tau Cross is, o f course, a phallic symbol and stands for the male a nd creative a spect in Ma n. As the three principal officers represent the Sun (a masculine planet) in v arious phases, it is natural that they shou ld all wield the gavel, bu t the two wardens are less essentially male than the W.M., as is indicated b y the fact that they do no t have the tau cross or"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Master's level on their aprons. The Spirit, b eing active, is male; whereas both soul and bod y, b eing more or less passive, are female. The femi nine side of the S.W. o r Soul is deliberately emphasized later - in the first degree - by a referen ce to the Moon, a femi nine planet, the e mblem of the Soul and o f the psychic nature in man. Nor can we ignore the fact that the West is kno wn as the femi nine quarter of the heavens, whereas the East is the masculine; it i s also worth no ticing that Shiva is often d epicted with the moon. Finally, b efore declaring the L. op en, the W.M. o ffers up a prayer, thereby remi nding us that the Divine Spark in Man, o r the Spirit, must turn to the Source of All for aid if it would control bod y and soul. The three kno ck s, as distinct from t he one kno ck with which the procee dings s tarted, indicate that the members are a bou t to work for the union and advancement of bod y, soul and spirit, and no t for the bod y only. But the way in which the three kno cks are given show that, as yet, there is no un ity between the three e lements which constitute Man. CHA PTE R II. THE T YLER The first thing that greets the e yes of the a spirant to ou r Order is a man, whom he soon discovers is called the Tyler, standing in front of the doo r with a d.n. s.d. in h is hand. He naturally wants an answer to the question which actually occurs in a ce rtain famous old ritual, \"Why does the Tyler wear a s.d.?\" - and the a nswer is, \"To guard the brethren and to hele the Word.\" Let us consider this answer: - \" To guard the brethren. \"In certain o ld rituals of the 18th century we a re told that Masons' Lodges formerly met in the open - \"on the highest hill or lowest valley, where never dog barked no r cock crew.\" Brethren will no doub t have read the interesting artic le in the \"Masonic Record\" relating to this s tate of affairs, bu t I am bound to say that I do no t think that the ordinary mediaeval lodge met in such p lace s. The reference to the c ock, together with certain d etails we possess with regard to those lodges wh ich d id meet in the open, (they were mostly in Scotland) indicate that they were not ordinary Craft lodges, bu t much more probably Templar Lodges. The Templars in the 18th century claim ed to b e descended from a bod y which h ad b een supp ressed in the years 1 307 to 1314 - , and actually prescribed. There was every reason therefore why they shou ld meet in ou t of the way place s, bu t no such reason existed in the ca se of a lodge of ordinary Freemasons. That such a phrase shou ld h ave wandered into a c raft ritual fro m Templary is perfectly natural, bu t it i s not safe to argue from t his that all Masonic lodges met und er the ca nop y of heaven. In those ea rly days, many higher degrees were worked in o rdinary Craft Lodges, in a way not permitt ed to - day; and this may easily acc oun t for phrases more appropriate to a Templar Prece ptory being found in a Craft working. I mi ght add that until"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the mi ddle of the 19th century Templar meetings were a lways called \"Encampments,\" indicating that they were ca mps held in the open fields. But in mediaeval tim es we kno w that the Freemasons had Lodge buildings, and if they went to a new place to bu ild a church o r castle , the first thing they did was to erect a temporary Lodge room, which they attended b efore starting the day's work. Those in terested will find abund ant details in Fort Newton's interesting littl e book, \"The Builders.\" There a lso it i s clearly shown that there were two k inds of masons in those days, and the man who conclusively proved this was not a modern Speculative Freemason. The two group s were the Freemasons and the Guild Masons. The former were lineal descendents of the Comacine Masons - who, incidentally, kn ew a certain Masonic Sign - and these men were skilled architects, free to go anywhere. They had a monopo ly of ecc lesia stical building and o f work ou tside the towns, e.g. castles. The Guild Masons were humbler f olk. They were not allowed to bu ild ou tside their particular city, bu t had a monopo ly of all building inside that city, with on e im portant and significant exceptio n: - they were not allowed to bu ild ecc lesiastical buildings. In return for their charter they had to maintain the fortifications. When a c hurch h ad to b e built t he Freemasons were sent for, and apparently they called on the Guild Masons to h elp them with t he rough work, e.g., to square the stones, etc. I suggest t hat Speculative Freemasonry is mainly descended from t he Freemasons, whereas the few O perative Lodges that survive a re probably descended from t he Guild masons. This theory is borne out by the fa ct that while the Operatives have our g.s. they have not our s.ns, yet these s.ns are unqu estionably old. They would all have the same g. for conv enience in p roving to the Freemasons that they were really masons, bu t they would k eep their s.ns to themselv es, as did the Freemasons, since they did no t want the other group to h ave acce ss to their private meetings. Further, we find that the Master Masons of the Freemasons were e ntitl ed to maintenance as \"gentlemen,\" clearly indicating that they were different from ordinary craftsmen (See Fort Newton). After the Reformation no doub t Freemasons and Guild masons tended to amalgamate, and this explains much. Now if the Freemasons erected a lodge before they started to bu ild a c hurch o r castle, we shall see that t heir meeting in the open would b e merely occa sional, e.g., while the temporary lodge was being built, and no t a regular custom ; but the very fact that is was a temporary building, and op en to approach b y all and sund ry who came to the site of the new edif ice, is quite sufficient to explain why they had someone on guard. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Why, ho wever, is he ca lled a Tyler, instead o f Sentinel, or some simil ar name? There a re three e xplanations, and we ca n adop t which we please: - 1. To tile is to cover in; hence the Tyler is one who covers or concea ls what is going on in the lodge. 2. In the old mediaeval Templar ceremony there were three sentinels; one inside the doo r, one outside, and on e on the roof or tiles, who could see if anyone was approaching the building. It wil l be remembered that the old Templar Churches were round, so that a man perched on the roof was able to see in every direction. 3. That the tilers were inferior craftsmen as compared with the genuine Freemasons; poo r brethren, as it were, and no t admitt ed to full m embership, althou gh on e or two were chosen to act as Outer Guards. I am not greatly im pressed with the latter theory, and my person p redilection is in favou r of No. 1 ; but there is a good d eal to b e said for No. 2. The tyler guarded the brethre n from \"cowans\" or eavesdropp ers. The former word is s till used in the c oun try districts of Lancashire a nd Westm orland for a dry - dyker, that is, a man who bu ilds rough walls between the different fields, o f rough, uncut, and un mortared stones. When I was living in Yorkshire I had a number of fields s o surround ed; t he stones for which were picked from t he hillside, and p iled on e upon another. No p articular skill was needed to bu ild such a wall; I repaired several m yself. In o ther words, a \"Cowan\" is one wh o p retends to b e a mason b eca use he works in stone, but is not one. Some fanciful derivations have been suggested from \"Cohen,\" the Jewish priest. I disagree e ntirely with this view. Why shou ld the Jewish Cohens be more likely to pretend to b e Freemasons t han any other priests? As the other word is s pelt as we spell ours, and means what I have stated, I see no reason to invent this s uggestion regarding the Jewish p riests, who were a lways few in nu mber, and in the Middle Ages hardly existed: - the Jews were dr iven ou t of England b y Edward I., and no t re - admitt ed un til t he tim e of Cromwell. \"Eavesdropp ers\" means men who listen und er the ea ves. The ea ves of a primiti ve or of a mediaeval cottage overhun g a c onsiderable distance beyond the walls, and b etween the r oof and the wall was an op en space . Through this s pace the smoke of the fire e scaped; the general arrangement being very simil ar to that found in the tropics. The walls of such a c ottage were often on ly five to six feet high, and thus a man could stand und er the ea ves in the shadow, h idden from t he light of the sun o r moon, and bo th see a nd h ear what was going on inside, withou t those who were in the lodge kno wing he was there. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"But the Tyler was on guard ou tside the doo r of the Lodge; he was armed with a d ..n s..d, and woe betide a ny eavesdropp er he discovered, for our mediaeval brethren undoub tedly interpreted their obligations literally. Incidentally, I und erstand that nomi nally the duty of carrying out the pen. still rests on the shou lders of the Tyler. With regard to the use of temporary buildings on o r near the site of the e difice, it shou ld be noted that during the building of Westmi nster Abbey there was at least one, if not two, such lodges, and they are mentioned in the records of the Abbey. One s eems to h ave stood on the site of the subsequent nave. Thus we ca n see that it was essential that there shou ld b e a n Outer Guard to k eep o ff intruders, o wing to the fact that Lodges were usually held in temporary buildings, o ften with ov erhanging eaves an d an op en space between the top o f the walls and the beams which suppo rted the roof. The word \"hele\" shou ld, in my opinion, b e pronoun ced \"heal,\" not \"hale.\" The use of \"hale\" is due to the fact that in the 18th century the words \"concea l,\" and \"reveal,\" were pronoun ced \"concale\" and \"revale.\" Since the words obv iously were a jingle, I consider it is more c orrect to - day to p ronoun ce it \"heal.\" Moreover, the word \"hele\" means to cover over. You still hear the phrase used, \"to h ele a cottage,\" or even a hay stack, and the word \"Hell\" im plies the place that is covered ov er, e.g., in the ce ntre of the ea rth. \"Hele\" is conn ected with \"heal\" - to cover up, o r to close up, a wound - and the meaning therefore is tautological, v iz, \"to cover up the word.\" (The Masonic s - t\") The use of the pronun ciation \"Hale\" is to - day most mi sleading, and is apt to cause a newly initiated Bro. to think h e has to \"hail\" something, or \"proclaim it aloud. \" The C. is taken in h and b y the Tyler, who makes him sign a form t o the e ffect tha t he is free a nd o f the full age of 21 years.

Any real hardship is removed b y the fact the G.L. has power to d ispense, which po wer it constantly uses in the ca se of the University Lodges at Oxford and Cambridge.

The next thing that happens is tha t the C. is prepared b y the Tyler. This is a very im portant m atter.

It i s po ssible that t here was a practical as well as a symbolical m eaning in this , and also in the ca se of our deprivation o f m..s.

The b.b. is in o rder that the S.I. can b e a pplied. The Scotch ritual, ho wever, says it i s to show your sex, bu t I am i nclined to think this is a modern gloss.

In India this C.T. is the e mblem of Yama, the God o f Death, with which h e snares the souls of men and d rags them forth from t heir bod ies. It is carried b y - Shiva to indicate his destructive c haracter in relation to hu man life. There a re in mas onry meanings within meanings, and I will t herefore indicate a few of those a ssociated with the C.T. , bu t I shall not do so with all t he details upon which I shall touch. The C.T. is an emblem of Death. It is fastened round the necks of captives as s howi ng that they are a t the a bsolute mercy of their conqu eror. Thus the burghesses of Calais had to come before Edward III. in their shirts - note that - with c.T. 's round their necks. They were only saved b y the desperate pleading of good Queen Philippa.

Some c ome into the world with a ca ul which may strangle them i f not removed, and in any case we a re said to b e born in o riginal sin and therefore doo med to d ie. *See \"Freemasonry and the Gods\" Birth, in the very nature of thing s, means death, and that is why the Hindoo s have made Shiva, the Lord o f Death, also the Lord o f Birth. We ourselves are ca ptives - souls bound by the c hains of the flesh - and o ffenders against the Law of the King of Kings. Further, we come in bond age to sin, seeking to b e freed from our bond s by the word o f God. The holding of the C.T. , and the dangers entailed, are sufficiently explained to n eed no further mention just now, thou gh this does not im ply there a re not inner meanings.

It is M . . . 1 s! - that is im portant. \"Valuables\" is a real, bu t subsidiary, meaning. Let us consider this carefully. There is an explanation o f why it i s don e in the lecture, - now, alas, seldom read in Lodge - and also , o f course, in the questions. These lectures were the real instruction; on them were based the tracing board Lectures, which were pictorial summ aries, on which were set certain qu estions. Now the lectures (which can b e bou ght at any Masonic furnishers) t ell us that at the building of the Temple no metallic im plements were used. Why? Beca use metals came from below. They were the gifts of the Thon ic Gods: - the Gods of the Underworld - useful, no doub t, bu t being g ifts of the Gods of the Underworld they were in their very nature evil, and abho rrent to the Gods of Light, whom t he white race s worshipped. For this reason the Egyptians continued to u se stone knives to op en the c orpse preparatory to embalmi ng it, long after they used metal knives constantly. The holy dead must not be polluted with the gifts of the e vil powers. If there is anything in the theory of an electric or magnetic discharge being made a t the tim e when a metal point is applied to the n. 1. b. at the ob. , this would also b e a practical reason; t he presence of metal mi ght m ake such a charge dangerous. But the first reason is no doub t the original one, and p robably the only one. The idea that we bring nothing into this world is, o f course, likewise obv ious; but it s full significance is lost in ou r ritual, althou gh seen in the Irish. There a C. is deprived o f metals in the first and in the second d egrees. The significance of this will be realized b y M.M.'s if they pond er awhile on the meaning of the S.W.'s P.W. - \"How hardly shall a rich man enter th e kingdom of Heaven.\" That worldly possessions hamper a man's s piritual progress is proclaim ed b y every religion in the world which can truly be ca lled great. The Buddh ist m onk and the mediaeval friar alike a gree on this. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Why p.w.s. at all? Here we wander into a strange field, no less than that of old world magic, I think. The C. enters an E. A. Lodge from t he outside world. Prior to h is entry this Lodge has been op ened b y a peculiar ceremony : - a ce remony which, in the technical language of magic a nd the occult, raises the vibrations of those present; t hus they are , as it were , raised to a higher key, and force is generated. Now those who h ave studied such matters kno w that a bod y of men who are a ll concentrating on a particular subject do generate a pec uliar, subtle, bu t powerful force, which h as not been acc urately defined b y science , bu t is loosely called magnetic. In the old d ays of phenomenal m agic ce rtain words, when u ttered in the c orrect tone, were believed to b e in consonance with this \"power,\" like a tuning fork is to a violin. Therefore we give this p.w. to the C. to raise him quickly to the same \"power\" as the Lodge. But I am afraid I may be getting rather deep for our youn ger readers. All I need say further is that such p. w.s are universal in the great m ystery rites, ancient or modern, and it i s not surprising, therefore, that in some rituals we find a P.W. leading to the 1 d egree.

It remi nds us of the pain we, as distinct from our mothers , suffered when we e ntered this physical world. It is a test of our courage a nd ob edience. Probably in o lden d ays blood was drawn, as a sacrifice. The Can. comes s eeking for kno wledge; self - restraint and qu iet confidence shou ld mark h is bearing. In all primiti ve initiatory rites most painful tests are a pplied, and if the ca ndidate does not bear them with courage he is rejected, and told that henceforth h e is to d ress as a woman and will be treated with contempt by the men o f the tribe. We note that the instrument is a Latin cross, the a ge - old symbol of suffering, and this is the only place in the Lodge where the C. sees this cross, (e.g. when it i s s hown h im l ater) thou gh M.M. ' s may realize that there does come a tim e when h e treads the Way of the Cross of suffering. The use of a Latin Cross as the S.I. is peculiarly significant, for it i s associated with p ain and the danger of death, and tells us, in symbolic language, that th e way of life is the path of suffering, and b egins with the threat of death and ends in d eath itself: but by this hard road we draw nearer to the object of our quest.

At Leeds, ho wever, they have a working which is, they say, derived from t he Old York ritual, and it does explain this passage. I saw this ceremony at Alfred 306, Leeds. The C. was brought in h - w and b idden to k . . l., and after the prayer, the W.M. said: - \"Mr. Brown it i s but fair to tell you o f the perilous position in which you are now place d. Before you stand on e with a d.s. in h is hand, po inted at your n. l.b. , and b ehind you on e holds the e nd o f the c.t. which is abou t your neck; i n this position o f difficulty and danger, in whom do you pu t your trust?\" Answer: - \"In God. \" W.M.: - \"Right glad am I to see your faith is s o well found ed; relying, etc.\" Here you see the C. is in d anger. Next the C. is t aken round with the Sun, for this is the road o f life , and in all ancient religions on entering a temple a man h ad to follow this path. In Burma to this day y ou are expected to p ass round the pagoda in this manner. The words are: - \"Brethren in the N.E.S. a nd W. will t ake notice. \" It is clear therefore that emphasis is laid on the fact that the candidate is following the path o f the Sun, for otherwise why not employ the more usual phrase, \"North, South, East and West?\" Now the Swastika, which may be regarde d as the \"lost sign\" in Freemasonry (+), indicates the path o f the Sun and is the e mblem of life, whereas the Swastika is the e mblem of the life beyond the grave, for, acc ording to ancient symbolism and eschatology, the departed soul went through the und er world the reverse way, just as the Sun was s uppo sed to do, e.g. W.S.E.N. This then, is the road o f the Spirits. Thus the ca ndidate starts on the symbolic (+) First suggested b y Wor. Bro.

This lesson is s till t aught in certain foreign rituals. In \"Free masonry and the Ancient Gods\" I have discussed the probabilit y of the theory that the Swastika was once used in ou r Lodges to represent God, as it still i s in the operative lodges, and h ave shown that a square - a - gamm a *, the Greek \"G,\" and therefore that t he fourfold gamm a represents the four letters of the Hebrew alphabet which d enote the sacred n ame of God.

Beca use the Preserver in ancient mythology is always depicted as trampling with h is l. f. on the Serpent of Evil. This is s o, alike in ancient Egypt, in India a nd elsewhere. But some may ask \"Why shou ld Horus or Krishna plant his l. f. on the serpent of Evil?\" Major Sanderson, who h as s pent m any y ears in Nyasaland as M edical Officer of Health and h as been initiated into several native rites, tells me that among many primiti ve race s there is a superstiti on that when entering a shed where rice is s tored on e must enter r. f. first, \"so as not to hu rt the Spirit who rules over the rice store.\" The same idea prevails among these people wherever food is s tored, and we here get an explanation o f \"l. f. f.\". When fighting against the Spiri t of Evil you do d esire to hu rt him , and so reverse the superstiti on, and step o ff l. f. f.. This is M ajor Sanderson's view, and I consider it i s probably the c orrect one. It m ay also b e well t o po int out that our ceremonies have c ome in contact, at vario us periods, with many different religious beliefs, and this fact explains why there a re often several m eanings attached to certain po ints in the ritual, all of which may be c orrect. The great serpent, Apepi, in Egypt, represents the powers of spiritual ev il, e.g. the Devil. But it also specifically refers to ignorance, as is s hown in the Indian legend in which Krishna tramples on the five - headed cobra. The five heads, moreover, also h ave a reference to ou r five senses, which in that allegory must be c leans ed o f every evil t hou ght. Thus we may consider that t he World is represented b y the C.T. and H.W., and the brotherhood h elps us to free ourselves from t hem. The Flesh is represented b y the f. r. s. , in which we \"trample\" on the Tau Cross, while the Devil is represented b y the snake, o f whose e xistence we a re remi nded b y the warning to \"step o ff with the l. f. f.\". Strictly, the C. shou ld enter the L. in the N. , no t in the West. The North is the place of darkness, and at birth we c ome out of darkness int o ph ysical li ght, and so in the spiritual journey. This is don e a t Leeds. Out of darkness, Light.

The J.D. gives the pass word \"Free and o f G.R. , \" and the Wardens ackno wledge its potency and b id h im enter ( Note \"enter,\") as if he were outside a doo r on which h e ha d kno cked for admi ssion. This brings to ou r mi nd the three regular kno cks. For r easons which canno t be stated h ere, bu t which I will deal with more fully later, I suggest that the E.A. kno cks remi nd u s that m an is Body, Soul and Spirit, and as in this sta ge of ignorance the Body is as im portant as the other two, the three kno cks are a ll of equal duration. Lest any mi sund erstand this, I would argue that in the process of creation the Spirit first comes from God, second ly, clothes itself with a Soul, and fin ally enters flesh. Thus, the first kno ck represents the Spirit, seeking God whence it came, the second, the Soul, and the third, the Body. To und erstand the full m eaning of this passing by the Wardens one needs to consider why the C. is being led round th e L.. There a re two reasons given - (1) To show that he is properly prepared. (2) To show that he is a fit and p roper person to b e made a mason. Being made a mason symbolizes the birth o f the Christ within, and b efore a nyone ca n attain to this mystical r e - birth h e must have progressed some way along the road o f evolution, h ave gained certain experiences, and learned certain lessons. Think again o f the P.W., F. and o f G.R.! In the ea rlier stages man is bound in materialism earthly things satisfy, and h e is ruled b y his physical passions. The C. for masonry has begun to d esire more than the material: he has felt t he desire for spiritual growth and kno wledge, and so has become \"free. \" This is recognised as he passes the J.W. , who represents the Material Nat ure. Next he a pproaches the S. W. - the representative of the Soul - and with the a id o f the P.W. is again b idden to enter. Notice, h aving passed the material stage, when the Body reigns s upreme, the Soul imm ediately, takes control, and p resents the C. to the W.M. - i.e. the Soul calls upon the Divine Spirit of God to give L. to the C. The reply is s ignificant, bu t i s alm ost i ncomprehensible unless one und erstands the symbolical j ourney which the C. h as just t aken, and on e is apt t o wond er why the questions whi ch follow w ere not asked at the very beginning of the ce remony. Really they are most im portant! They constitute the final testing of the C. b efore he is bidden to advance towards the E. to rece ive the L. , and enter on the pathway which b egins with initiat ion and ends with God Him self. Also they \"are very searching: t he C. b eing required to d eclare solemnly that he c omes s eeking kno wledge, no t beca use others desire him t o do so, no r yet for unworthy motives of personal gain, bu t beca use he is prompted from within b y a genuine desire to h elp Humanity. Then follows a hint that the journey upwards is by no means easy, and p atience, p erseverance, caution and courage a re essential if we a re to achieve our goal.

This is by three squares which symbolize, no t only uprightness of life, bu t also the three letters of the Great Name, Yod, He, Vau; Male, Female, and Vari able. In o ther words, God the Father, Mother, and child; and the fourth square is on the Ped., which gives us the final He, or the c omplete name of Him we seek, - Jehov ah, o r J.H.V.H. But the letter HE (pronoun ced Hay) is female, and its female a spect is e mphasized b y the position o f the sq. and c.s., which form a lozenge, itself a well kno wn symbol for the Vesica Piscis, as all who study heraldry kno w ; for in h eraldry a woman's arms are place d, not on a shield, as are a man's, bu t on a lozenge. A great t ruth is here taught, - that eac h soul is part of the Divine whole a nd canno t be separated from t he God we seek. The C. is only just abou t to emerge from t he darkness of gross materialism, yet the God h e seeks is within h im . True He is s o v eiled that m any do not realize His presence, just as hund reds of C's tread ou t the proper steps withou t ever realizing their full significance, bu t those who rise a bov e the material start on the path o f return to God, and eac h stage that they pass as they progress along the path, reveals more fully His Nature a nd Being. Notice, the C. on ly treads three squares, - Yod, He, Vau; Male, Female, Variable; t he fourth square needed to complete the whole is on the Ped. This is particularly significant - never whilst in the flesh shall w e be a ble fully to comprehend His nature. No finite mi nd can comprehend the Infinite Deity. It is only after we have left the first initiation long behind, and traveled far, that we ca n hop e to ob tain that transcendent kno wledge which enables us to und erst and fully, the Nature a nd Being of Him Who is the beginning and end o f all. Again comes the remi nder that Masonry is free ; entrance to the path can on ly be gained by those who h ear the ca ll from within. No - one is coerced; - even at this late stage the C. i s given an oppo rtunity to retire. Thus he is asked if he is willi ng to take a serious Ob., and on h is agreeing to do so, the W.M. d irects him t o k. on h is l. k. etc. It shou ld b e noted that the l. side of an individual i s usually said to b e \"Femi ne,\" and i t i s not surprising, therefore that in this, the first and femi ne degree, the C. is told to k. on h is l. k.. Notice the exact position! On the l. k. k eeping the r. f. in the f. o f a s. Now w hen you k. on the l. k. you must of nece ssity form a sq. at that k . , and, if you try it, you will find that you canno t keep the r. f. in the form of a sq. withou t keeping the r. k. in the form of a sq. also; so once a gain we get three sq's, with the fourth on the Ped. Thus we get another glim pse of the truth already hin ted at, that eac h soul is part of the Divine whole, and canno t be separated from God. The C. is only just abou t to emerge from t he darkness of ignorance , and yet he is instructed so to k. that by his very attit ude, - i.e. b y formi ng three sq.'s with his bo dy (the fourth b eing on the Ped.) he shows s ymbolically that the God h e seeks is within.

In all t he a ncient m ysteries an ob. was exacted, and for this reason: - The secret teac hings given in these mysteries disclosed an inner meaning, o ften of a most exalted k ind, un suitable for the general pub lic, who were lacking in educat ion. In the a ncient world the e xternal religion, with its worship o f many gods, suited the ordinary man in the street, who was incapable of comprehending more a dvanced spiritual truths. It would h ave been d angerous, alike to the popu lace a nd to the preac he r, to h ave shou ted aloud such a doctrine a s the e ssential unity of God, and still m ore fatal to h ave attempted to d escribe His Nature. The danger to the popu lace was that the preac her mi ght have destroyed their belief in the religious s ystem i n which they had b een reared, while failing to conv ert t hem properly to the new doctrine. For the preac her, the fate of Socrates, and the failure of the so - called h eretic King of Egypt - who tried to popu larize the worship o f the one God, und er the symbol of the Atendisk , o r disk o f the Sun - are sufficient evidence of the risks which would b e e ncoun tered. Moreover, these mysteries all purported to teac h certain o ccult secrets, whose diffusion among vicious, or ignorant, men would h ave been d angerous. Even in the Middle A ges these dangers were still very real. Any deviation from orthodo xy mi ght have e ndangered the social fabric of the c omm unity, and such an attempt was certain to invo lve the a dvo cate of new doctrines in a struggle with Church and State which could on ly hav e e nded at the stake. Within an o ath - bound Society men felt free to speculate a nd compare their personal standpo ints, while to the outside world they continued to conform t o o rthodo xy. The fate of the Templars must have been an ever present warning to the speculative mi nd, in the Middle Ages. In addition, there is littl e doub t that the building trades, like other Guilds, h ad im portant trade secrets, and wished to safeguard these from i nterlopers. A mediaeval Guild , on the one hand p rotected the interests of its members, while on the other it t rained those members, and inspected and p assed their work; t hus protecting the c omm unity from deliberate fraud o r careless work. Nor must it be forgotten that in a building bad work mi ght invo lve ac tual danger to the users of that building. For all t hese reasons it was right and p roper that no on e who was not a member of the fraternity shou ld b e in po ssession o f its trade secrets."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" The ob. is undoub tedly ancient, bu t it s full significance is realized b y few.

The W.M. represents the rising Sun, and in this sense he c overs two d istinct m eanings: the first in conn ection with the nature of God, and the other w ith regard to the nature of man. And a simil ar dual character exists in the ca se of S.W. and J.W.. The W.M. represents God the Creator, He who calls the Lodge into b eing, He who created the World ou t of Chaos. In India this aspect of God, the Incomprehens ible, h as been individualized as Brahma, so that the devotee many be a ble to comprehend Him , at least in p art. It is the Master who op ens the Lodge, who calls it out of nothing. He sits in the East, the place of light; but thou gh h e opens, h e does not clo se the lodge. That is the work o f another aspect of the Divine Being. In the nature of man the W.M. represents the Spirit, the Divine Spark within u s, ever striving for the light, n ever truly separated from t he divine source of its being. This dual aspect of the W.M. and h is principal officers must be borne in mi nd, if we a re to d elve down into the inner, or esoteric, meaning of our wond erful rituals. The S.W. represents the Setting Sun, and h ence the Destructive, o r Transformative , aspects of the Deity. Among the Hindoo s this aspect is called Shiva. He shall one day close the Grand Lodge of this World, when tim e shall be swallowed up into Eternity. The S.W. closes the Lodge. As the Destroyer he remi nds us that Death, the great leveler, will bring all m en low, and h is s ymbol is the Level. This in itself remi nds us of the ca ste mark of Shiva, which consists of horizontal li nes. But in the nature of Man h e represents the Soul, which alone e nables the Spirit t o raise the bod y towards divine things. Withou t t he medium of the Soul, the Spirit would b e unable to influence the bod y. It is for this reason that the C. is invested in craft m asonry by the S.W. o r Soul, and no t by the W.M. , representing the Divine Spark. Thus we learn that we must raise ourselves , s tep b y step , towards the Divine Light. Shiva is, abov e a ll, the great M.M.. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The J.W. represents the Sun in its M eridian. He stands for the Way of Life, the balance between b irth and d eath. His is the sunn y side of life. He ca lls us from l abou rs to refre shment and from refreshment t o labou rs. In the divine a spect he represents the Preserver, called Vishnu in India, o f whom it i s s tated that as Rama he sent the skilful craftsmen , Hanuman , to bu ild the bridge for Him , b y means of which He c rossed the str aits to fight against the powers of evil i n ancient Ceylon. Vishnu is associated with the e lement of water and with corn, and h is caste mark is a perpendicular, straight li ne , referring to the rain which falls from heaven. This s ymbol is remembered in ou r lodges by the plumb rule. In the nature of man h e stands for the bod y, which p erishes. He is H.A.B. in the Grand Lodge a t Jerusalem. He represents the life a nd sufferings of the bod y, on ly termi nated b y death; the bod y which in every man d ies before its divine work is acc omplished. Our divine temple is not finished at death: all t hat we ca n hop e is that the found ations have been well and truly laid. In short, in this life we ca nno t hop e to \"see God face to face ,\" nor, b eing finite, can we truly comprehen d the Infinite , bu t we ca n hop e to make such progress that, when called h ence, we shall be a ble to continue , and complete , the work of our own salvation on the found ations of a good and spiritual earthly life. Finally, it will be noted that in every de gree these three officers co - operate to advance the C., and so it i s in the spiritual li fe, for bod y, soul and spirit' must co - operate if r eal progress is to b e a ttained. Next the C. is informed o f the three great dangers - note the triplicity again - and the few sentences devoted to them m ust be c onsidered in the light of what has already been written b y me on the S.I., the C.T., and the Ob.. At the doo r of the L. the C. was in great danger, b eca use e ntrance thereat m arked the beginning of the ce remony of in itiation into m., and initiation symbolizes the mystical re - birth, the e nd o f the descent into matter and the beginning of the a scent to God, and there can b e no more c ritical tim e than that. The S.I. warns us of the dangers of r ushing unp repared into the field o f occultism, while the C.T. indicates the danger that the Divine Spark may be quenched, strangled b y materialism, if we do no t continue steadfastly. But even when these dangers are passed, throughou t the whole of our mystic journey there remains tha t last danger of our ob., n amely, that of infidelity to the vows which marked our entrance, o r of abandon ing our f urther quest for light; - kno wing the right, bu t deliberately choo sing the wrong. This means death; not prim arily physical death, bu t that great er death, referred to b y our Hindoo Brethren as \"Being born again at the bottom of the ladder of evolution up which we have for so long been ascending. \" We next come to the moment, so long expected, when the s. . . . s are disclosed. No doub t many Brethr en could no t supp ress a slight feeling of disappo intm ent at their comparative insignificance. Was s uch a tremendou s Ob. n ece ssary to safeguard a S. , W. , and G. which appear to b e Purely arbitrary?"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" This question is a fair one, and the a nswer is that the Ob. safeguards, no t so much the G., etc., which are but the outward and v isible signs, as the inner esoteric meaning, h idden in our ritual, and n ever properly explained. Firstly, the W.M. instructs the C. in the f. r. s., which on investigation p roves to be the tau cross. The tau cross was originally the phallus, and h as many inner meanings. It is the e mblem of generation and creation, bu t since these powers may be prostituted they must be brought und er control. As the f. r. s. , it represents our natural and anim al passions, which must be trampled und erfoot and b rought und er complete c ontrol, o therwise we ca nno t make a ny advancement in Freemasonry. In p lain language , un less we bring our passions into complete subjection, we ca nno t hop e to advance towards a true kno wledge of God. For that, I consider, is the real search, o r quest, in Freemasonry. Therefore in every one of the Craft degrees we trample on the tau cross. It will be remembered that one of the c harges against the Templars, in 1307, was that th ey trampled on the c ross, and this charge seems to b e c orrect. Yet these same men adored the Cross three tim es a year in their ceremonies and, moreover, fought and d ied for it on many a corpse - strewn field in Palestine. I have no doub t this act of theirs was a symbolic one , associated more with the c ross as an emblem of our passions than with the Christian cross of suffering. Yet symbols emerge by im perceptible degrees into eac h o ther, and so it i s that we ca n truly say that Christ was crucified on the Cross of our passions. In mediaeval pictures you will usually find that while Christ hangs on a Latin, o r four armed cross , the two thieves are hun g on Tau , o r three - armed crosses. This indicates that they died for their own sins, but Christ, Who h angs o n the c ross of sacrifice , died for the sins of others. Thus, my brothers, the f. r. s. is full of inner meaning nor is this the only place in which we meet with the tau cross in the c raft. Its higher and ho lier aspect when associated with the W.M. I shal l discuss later. CHA PTE R VI. CON CLUSION O F THE CEREMONY Having taken the f. r. s. the C. is given the S.. This he is told refers to the P. o f his Ob., and no doub t it does, bu t it also seems to refer to something much more startling. The part of the bo dy indicated h as always been regarded as an im portant occult centre. In some strange way, the laws of which are but littl e und erstood, it has always been associated"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"with the phenomena kno wn amongst psychic students as M aterializations. As, ho wever, this s u bject li es s omewhat outside our theme, we will discuss the point no further. But all our P. 's have a striking analogy to the legend o f the c reation o f man as given b y the Hindoo sages. From Brahma sprang all four castes. From His head came the Brahmi ns, from His Breasts the Kshatra, o r fighting caste, from His Belly, the peasants, and from His feet, the Sudras. The latter were not true Arians, and were not twice born men; i n o ther words, on ly the first t hree ca stes were regarded as really and truly admi ss ible to the Temple of the High Gods, and free to p articipate in Their worship. It will be noted that in this degree the S..n suggests the c utting off of the first caste from those below. This S..n, Bro. Major Sanderson suggests, was originally a mantra, o r magic prayer, which must be most carefully guarded from t he profane. The T. appears to b e a n arbitrary one, althou gh it m ay possibly refer to a ce rtain p illar. Explanations of this, together with the meaning, d erivation , and significance of the W. , ar e reserved for the next volume, for reasons which will be obv ious to those e ntitl ed to kno w them. No doub t, ho wever, the basic idea of both p illar and word is phallic, and o ther interpretations have e volved later. Having rece ived s. w. and t. , the C. is warned to b e ca utious and told ho w to rece ive a challenge, then, h aving been given strength to h elp h im on h is way, h e is s ent forth in order that the im portant lesson o f caution may be im planted in h is mi nd. The testing by J.W. and S.W. are obv iously of practical use, bu t I think that here a lso there is an inner meaning. The Body and Soul test the Cand. to see that the lessons have been well and truly learnt; also there seems to b e a definite a strological reference. Having satisfied these im portant offi cers, the s.w. asks for some special m ark o f favou r. That is, the Soul calls on the Spirit, bu t is told that it i s the Soul which must invest the regenerate man with the outward signs of the c hange he has und ergone. This point has already been mentioned, b ut it s deep significance must not be forgotten. It m ay truly be said that it i s the S.W. who sets the seal on the ca ndidate's initiation, and p roclaim s him as at length a member of the Order. The a ddress of the S.W. and the subsequent one by the Master, a re fairly self - explanatory. But one or two po ints deserve stressing. The reference to the a ntiquity of the a pron refers mainly, o f course, to its use a mong the Operatives, and im plies the dignity of hon est labou rs. The present form of our apron is compar atively modern, bu t there is evidence that our predece ssors, the Comacine Masons , wore a prons when they met in Lodge , and aprons have had a special significance a mong"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"many religious s ystems. Thus s ome of the Chinese gods wear aprons , and I have a pho tog raph o f one (See The Hung Society, Vol. III., op. p. 122 ) and this \"God\" is making a ce rtain h igh d egree sign. Among the a ncient race s of America the a pron was also evidently used with a religious s ignificance (see picture of the Toltec Preserver in \"Freem asonry and the Ancient Gods\"). The a ddress of the W.M. lays s tress on the im portance of not entering the L. if a brother is at variance with another. At first sight this may seem a somewhat unn ece ssary charge. Normal, well condu cted gentlemen are not li ke ly to start an un seeml y wrangle in Lodge , even if they are a t enmit y; and shou ld two men so far forget the c omm on d ece ncies of life as to do so, the W.M. has ample power to d eal with the situation. The real significance of the injunction, ho wever, is tha t it im plies that the mere presence of two b rethren who are a t variance will disturb the harmonious atm osphere of the meeting. This is a purely spiritual atm osphere, and the belief that such d isturbance would occur withou t any open d isagreement, is correct . In short, such d ifferences disturb the spiritual atm osphere, p revent concentration, and can be detected b y sensitive individuals. Every Lodge has an \"atm osphere of its own,\" and any sensitive man who comes to it can detect it * I have myself noticed the different \"atm ospheres\" of various lodges, and also variations in that of my own. Too much regard therefore ca nno t be paid to this rule, and if ignored the Lodge will certainly suffer. The C. is place d in the N.E. corner of the Lodge for the reason give n in the ritual, bu t it i s im portant to remember that he him self is building his own temple - a spiritual temple to the glory of God. Why shou ld the c ornerstone be laid in the N.E.? This was for a very practical reason; namely, so that t he Operatives could work round with the Sun, and thus obtain the maxim um amoun t of light. Symbolically, it refers, o f course, to the journey of the soul, which b egins in the N., enters life a t the East, at birth, and so p rocee ds to the West, where death ends our day. The pos ition in which the C. stands is not only a sq., the e mblem of rectitude a nd o f God, but at the particular point he make a \"Lewis,\" or angle c lamp, which b inds together the life which h as been (in the North) and h is future life (in the East). In ph ysical li fe the North is pre - natal, bu t in the spiritual it i s before we turned to b etter things. Abov e a ll, such a c lamp gives rigidity and strength to the c orners, and assures s tabilit y. It will be noted that this position in like manner makes a \"footing stone.\" "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The testing of the ca ndidate is explained, bu t perhaps I ought once more to remi nd my reader that it i s absolutely essential that we shou ld leave behind u s the baleful gifts of the und erworld and the ca nker of wealth, which d estroy spirituality. The lect ure on the working tools explains itself. It appears to b e mainly 18th century work. CHA PTE R VII. THE CHA RGE When the C. h as been restored to h is personal comfort he rece ives the c harge. The first significant point is the phrase \"Ancient, no doub t it i s, as having subsisted from tim e imm emorial.\" In \"Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods\" I have e ndeavored to show that this phrase is literally true , and a strong claim can b e made that m odern Freemasonry is the lineal descendant of the Ancient Mysteries, v ia the Roman Colleges of Architects, the Comacine Masons, and the Mediaeval Freemasons. The other significant phrase is that relating to \"The Ancient Landmarks.\" Much learned discussion h as taken p lace c oncerning what t hese a re. Comm on sense indicates the f ollowing points as obv iously falling within this heading, whereas many others may be matters of opinion, on which b rethren are e ntitl ed to d iffer. 1. - The signs, words and tokens. If these were c hanged it would shatter the universality of Freemasonry and p revent old masons recognizing new ones, o r members of various jurisdictions doing so. It m ust be ac kno wledged that the c harge mad b y the Ancients against the Moderns, that they had removed the Ancient Landmarks, was largely justified, for they appear to h a ve transposed the w.s. in the first and second d egrees. Still apparently, they did no t entirely change them. 2 & 3. - Belief in God and a Future Life. I these a re removed, then the object and pu rpose of masonry is destroyed, since it i s the \"quest of kno wle dge of, and un ion with, God. \" Again, the e limi nation o f the idea of a future life\" would d estroy the teac hing of one of the most im portant craft degrees. If these landmarks were removed, Freemasonry would either perish, o r else have to substitute a new ob ject, as the Grand Orient of France has don e. This having become atheistical, had to turn masonry into a secret politi cal society, with d isastrous results. Hence it i s that the Grand Lodge of England felt compelled to b reak o ff fr aternal relations with t hat bod y. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"4. - The Order of the Degrees. If these were reversed o r changed it would reduce the whole system t o non sense. The remainder of this address is fairly clear as it stands. It contains excellent teac hing, the meaning of which lies on the surface , a nd so we need spend no further space on it here. The first tracing board contains a great deal of useful instruction, bu t it i s s o seldom given in most lodges that we will pass it by, hop ing at some future date to give it t he a ttention it deserves. The p urpose of these tracing boards will be e xplained in the book d ealing with the second degree, and we ca n therefore take leave of the Entered Apprentice. There is no p retence that we have e xhausted the subject, much more c ould b e written, bu t in a small book like this the a uthor must restrict him self to giving an ou tline e xplanation, and suggestions for study, in the hop e that his readers will follow the hints given, and d iscover f urther meanings for themselves. CHA PTE R VIII THE CLOSING O F THE FIRST DEGREE . The first degree c losing is remarkably short, and its meaning is fairly clear. The ca ndidate has not yet advanced sufficiently far to b e a ble to appreciate a ny more e soteric teac hing. He is therefore given on e brief and tremendou s lesson. The Destructiv e side of the Deity is invok ed, and the same officer, it m ust be remembered, also represents the Soul. Thus, at t he very beginning of his s ymbolical career, the nov ice is warned o f the inevitable e nd. During the ce remony of his initiation the fact has bee n im pressed upon him t hat his s piritual advancement is by means of his s oul, i.e. when the S.W. invests him with h is apron. Now he is warned that the same soul which may help h im t o rise, may also cause his s piritual destruction. But even more this fact sh ould show him t hat, when he has learned all t hat li fe ca n teac h h im , the Soul acting on the instructions of God, calls him t o o ther fields of usefulness. It shou ld also b e noted that the S.W. closes in the name of the G.A., and b y comm and o f the W.M. , th us remi nding us of Alpha a nd Omega, the Beginning and the End. CON CLUSION . This then concludes our consideration o f the meaning of the first degree. The a uthor has not tried to b e e xhaustive , and would stress the point that usually he has only attempted to give one e soteric meaning, althou gh o ften there a re other inner meanings, eac h within the other. But he trusts he will have helped h is brethren to p erceive that there a re indeed deep and invaluable meanings hidden within ou r ritual, and that his reader s, h aving once"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"started on this line of study , will not rest content until t hey themselves have discovered further inner meanings.
