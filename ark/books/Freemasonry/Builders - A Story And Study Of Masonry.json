There was a little spread on the night of his raising, and, as is the custom, the candidate was asked to give his impressions of the Order. Among other thin gs, he made request to know if there"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"was any little book which would tell a young man th e things he would most like to know about Masonry--what it was, whence it came, what it teaches, and what it is trying to do in the world? No one knew of such a book at that ti me, nor has any been found to meet a need which many must have felt before and since. By an odd coincidence, it has fallen to the lot of the author to write the little book for which he made request fourteen years ago. This bit of reminiscence explains the purpose of th e present volume, and every book must be judged by its spirit and purpose, not less than by its style and contents. Written as a commission from the Grand Lodge of Iowa, and approv ed by that Grand body, a copy of this book is to be presented to every p. viii man upon whom the degree of Master Mason is conferr ed within this Grand Jurisdiction. Naturally this intention has determined the method and arrangement of the book, as well as the matter it contains; its aim being to tell a young man entering the order the antecedents of Masonry, its development, its philos ophy, its mission, and its ideal. Keeping this purpose always in mind, the effort has been to prepare a brief, simple, and vivid account of the origin, growth, and teaching o f the Order, so written as to provoke a deeper interest in and a more earnest study of its story and its service to mankind. No work of this kind has been undertaken, so far as is known, by any Grand Lodge in this country or abroad--at least, not since the old Pock et Companion, and other such works in the earlier times; and this is the more strange fro m the fact that the need of it is so obvious, and its possibilities so fruitful and impo rtant. Every one who has looked into the vast literature of Masonry must often have felt the need of a concise, compact, yet comprehensive survey to clear the path and light th e way. Especially must those feel such a need who are not accustomed to traverse long and involved periods of history, and more especially those who have neither the time nor the opportunity to sift ponderous volumes to find out the facts. Much of our literature--inde ed, p. ix by far the larger part of it--was written before th e methods of scientific study had arrived, and while it fascinates, it does not convince those who are used to the more critical habits of research. Consequently, without knowing it, some of our most earnest Masonic writers have made the Order a target for ridicule by their extravagant claims as to its antiquity. They did not make it clear in what sense it is anci ent, and not a little satire has been aimed at Masons for their gullibility in accepting as true the wildest and most absurd legends. Besides, no history of Masonry has been wr itten in recent years, and some important material has come to light in the world o f historical and archeological scholarship, making not a little that has hitherto been obscure more clear; and there is need that this new knowledge be related to what was already known. While modern research aims at accuracy, too often its results ar e dry pages of fact, devoid of literary beauty and spiritual appeal--a skeleton without the warm robe of flesh and blood. Striving for accuracy, the writer has sought to avoid making a dusty chronicle of facts and figures, which few would have the heart to follow, with what success the reader must decide."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Such a book is not easy to write, and for two reaso ns: it is the history of a secret Order, much of whose lore is not to be written, and it cov ers a bewildering p. x stretch of time, asking that the contents of innume rable volumes--many of them huge, disjointed, and difficult to digest--be compact wit hin a small space. Nevertheless, if it has required a prodigious labor, it is assuredly worth while in behalf of the young men who throng our temple gates, as well as for those who a re to cone after us. Every line of this book has been written in the conviction that the re al history of Masonry is great enough, and its simple teaching grand enough, without the e mbellishment of legend, much less of occultism. It proceeds from first to last upon the assurance that all that we need to do is to remove the scaffolding from the historic temple of Masonry and let it stand out in the sunlight, where all men can see its beauty and symm etry, and that it will command the respect of the most critical and searching intellec ts, as well as the homage of all who love mankind. By this faith the long study has been guid ed; in this confidence it has been completed. To this end the sources of Masonic scholarship, sto red in the library of the Grand Lodge of Iowa, have been explored, and the highest author ities have been cited wherever there is uncertainty--copious references serving not only to substantiate the statements made, but also, it is hoped, to guide the reader into further and more detailed research. Also, in p. xi respect of issues still open to debate and about wh ich differences of opinion obtain, both sides have been given a hearing, so far as space wo uld allow, that the student may weigh and decide the question for himself. Like all Mason ic students of recent times, the writer is richly indebted to the great Research Lodges of England--especially to the Quatuor Coronati Lodge, No. 2076--without whose proceedings this study would have been much harder to write, if indeed it could have been writt en at all. Such men as Gould, Hughan, Speth, Crawley, Thorp, to name but a few--not forge tting Pike, Parvin, Mackey, Fort, and others in this country--deserve the perpetual grati tude of the fraternity. If, at times, in seeking to escape from mere legend, some of them se emed to go too far toward another extreme--forgetting that there is much in Masonry t hat cannot be traced by name and date--it was but natural in their effort in behalf of authentic history and accurate scholarship. Alas, most of those named belong now t o a time that is gone and to the people who are no longer with us here, but they are recalled by an humble student who would pay them the honor belonging to great men and great Masons. This book is divided into three parts, as everythin g Masonic should be: Prophecy, History, and p. xii [paragraph continues] Interpretation. The first part has to do with the hints and foregleams of Masonry in the early history, tradition, mythology, and symbolism of the race--finding its"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"foundations in the nature and need of man, and show ing how the stones wrought out by time and struggle were brought from afar to the mak ing of Masonry as we know it. The second part is a story of the order of builders thr ough the centuries, from the building of the Temple of Solomon to the organization of the mo ther Grand Lodge of England, and the spread of the Order all over the civilized worl d. The third part is a statement and exposition of the faith of Masonry, its philosophy, its religious meaning, its genius, and its ministry to the individual, and through the ind ividual to society and the state. Such is a bare outline of the purpose, method, plan, and spir it of the work, and if these be kept in mind it is believed that it will tell its story and confide its message. When a man thinks of our mortal lot--its greatness and its pathos, how much has been wrought out in the past, and how binding is our obl igation to preserve and enrich the inheritance of humanity--there comes over him a str ange warming of the heart toward all his fellow workers; and especially toward the young , to whom we must soon entrust all that we hold sacred. All through these pages the p. xiii wish has been to make the young Mason feel in what a great and benign tradition he stands, that he may the more earnestly strive to be a Mason not merely in form, but in faith, in spirit, and still more, in character; and so help to realize somewhat of the beauty we all have dreamed--lifting into the light the lat ent powers and unguessed possibilities of this the greatest order of men upon the earth. E veryone can do a little, and if each does his part faithfully the sum of our labors will be v ery great, and we shall leave the world fairer than we found it, richer in faith, gentler i n justice, wiser in pity--for we pass this way but once, pilgrims seeking a country, even a Ci ty that hath foundations.

He everywhere finds himself encompassed with Symbols, recognized as such or not recognized: the Universe is but one vast Symbol of God; nay, if tho u wilt have it, what is man himself but a Symbol of God; is not all that he does symbolical ; a revelation to Sense of the mystic God-given force that is in him; a Gospel of Freedom , which he, the Messiah of -ature, preaches, as he can, by word and act? -ot a Hut he builds but is the visible embodiment of a Thought; but bears visible record of invisible things; but is, in the transcendental sense, symbolical as well as real . --THOMAS CARLYLE, Sartor Resartus p. 6 CHAPTER I The Foundations TWO arts have altered the face of the earth and giv en shape to the life and thought of man, Agriculture and Architecture. Of the two, it w ould be hard to know which has been the more intimately interwoven with the inner life of humanity; for man is not only a planter and a builder, but a mystic and a thinker. For such a being, especially in primitive times, any work was something more than itself; it was a truth found out. In becoming useful it attained some form, enshrining at once a thought and a mystery. Our present study has to do with the second of these arts, whic h has been called the matrix of civilization."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"When we inquire into origins and seek the initial f orce which carried art forward, we find two fundamental factors--physical necessity and spi ritual aspiration. Of course, the first great impulse of all architecture was need, honest response to the demand for shelter; but this demand included a Home for the Soul, not less than a roof over the head. p. 6 [paragraph continues] Even in this response to primary need there was so mething spiritual which carried it beyond provision for the body; as the me n of Egypt, for instance, wanted an indestructible resting-place, and so built the pyra mids. As Capart says, prehistoric art shows that this utilitarian purpose was in almost e very case blended with a religious, or at least a magical, purpose. 1 The spiritual instinct, in seeking to recreate typ es and to set up more sympathetic relations with the universe, led t o imitation, to ideas of proportion, to the passion for beauty, and to the effort after per fection. Man has been always a builder, and nowhere has he s hown himself more significantly than in the buildings he has erected. When we stand before them--whether it be a mud hut, the house of a cliff-dweller stuck like the ne st of a swallow on the side of a cañon, a Pyramid, a Parthenon, or a Pantheon--we seem to rea d into his soul. The builder may have gone, perhaps ages before, but here he has lef t something of himself, his hopes, his fears, his ideas, his dreams. Even in the remote re cesses of the Andes, amidst the riot of nature, and where man is now a mere savage, we come upon the remains of vast, vanished civilizations, where art and science and r eligion reached unknown heights. p. 7 [paragraph continues] Wherever humanity has lived and wrought, we find t he crumbling ruins of towers, temples, and tombs, monuments of its indust ry and its aspiration. Also, whatever else man may have been--cruel, tyrannous, vindictiv e--his buildings always have reference to religion. They bespeak a vivid sense o f the Unseen and his awareness of his relation to it. Of a truth, the story of the Tower of Babel is more than a myth. Man has ever been trying to build to heaven, embodying his prayer and his dream in brick and stone. For there are two sets of realities--material and s piritual--but they are so interwoven that all practical laws are exponents of moral laws. Suc h is the thesis which Ruskin expounds with so much insight and eloquence in his Seven Lamps of Architecture , in which he argues that the laws of architecture are moral laws , as applicable to the building of character as to the construction of cathedrals. He finds those laws to be Sacrifice, Truth, Power, Beauty, Life, Memory, and, as the crowning g race of all, that principle to which Polity owes its stability, Life its happiness, Fait h its acceptance, and Creation its continuance-- Obedience . He holds that there is no such thing as liberty, and never can be. The stars have it not; the earth has it not; the se a has it not. Man fancies that he has freedom, but if he p. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"would use the word Loyalty instead of Liberty, he w ould be nearer the truth, since it is by obedience to the laws of life and truth and beauty that he attains to what he calls liberty. Throughout that brilliant essay, Ruskin shows how t he violation of moral laws spoils the beauty of architecture, mars its usefulness, and ma kes it unstable. He points out, with all the variations of emphasis, illustration, and appea l, that beauty is what is imitated from natural forms, consciously or unconsciously, and th at what is not so derived, but depends for its dignity upon arrangement received from the human mind, expresses, while it reveals, the quality of the mind, whether it be nob le or ignoble. Thus: All building, therefore, shows man either as gather ing or governing; and the secrets of his success are his knowing what to gather, and how to rule. Th ese are the two great intellectual Lamps of Architecture; the one consisting in a just and humb le veneration of the works of God upon earth, and the other in an understanding of the dominion o ver those works which has been vested in man. 1 What our great prophet of art thus elaborated so el oquently, the early men forefelt by instinct, dimly it may be, but not less truly. If a rchitecture was born of need it soon showed its magic quality, and p. 9 all true building touched depths of feeling and ope ned gates of wonder. No doubt the men who first balanced one stone over two others must h ave looked with astonishment at the work of their hands, and have worshiped the stones they had set up. This element of mystical wonder and awe lasted long through the age s, and is still felt when work is done in the old way by keeping close to nature, necessit y, and faith. From the first, ideas of sacredness, of sacrifice, of ritual rightness, of m agic stability, of likeness to the universe, of perfection of form and proportion glowed in the heart of the builder, and guided his arm. Wren, philosopher as he was, decided that the delight of man in setting up columns was acquired through worshiping in the groves of th e forest; and modern research has come to much the same view, for Sir Arthur Evans sh ows that in the first European age columns were gods. All over Europe the early mornin g of architecture was spent in the worship of great stones. 1 If we go to old Egypt, where the art of building se ems first to have gathered power, and where its remains are best preserved, we may read t he ideas of the earliest artists. Long before the dynastic period a strong people inhabite d the land who developed many arts which they handed on to the p. 10 pyramid-builders. Although only semi-naked savages using flint instruments in a style much like the Bushmen, they were the root, so to sp eak, of a wonderful artistic stock. Of the Egyptians Herodotus said, \"They gather the frui ts of the earth with less labor than any other people.\" With agriculture and settled life ca me trade and stored-up energy which might essay to improve on caves and pits and other rude dwellings. By the Nile, perhaps,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"man first aimed to overpass the routine of the bare st need, and obey his soul. There he wrought out beautiful vases of fine marble, and inv ented square building. At any rate, the earliest known structure actually discovered, a prehistoric tomb found in the sands at Hieraconpolis, is already right-angled . As Lethaby reminds us, modern people take squareness very much for granted as bei ng a self-evident form, but the discovery of the square was a great step in geometr y. 1 It opened a new era in the story of the builders. Early inventions must have seemed lik e revelations, as indeed they were; and it is not strange that skilled craftsmen were l ooked upon as magicians. If man knows as much as he does, the discovery of the Square was a great event to the primitive mystics of the Nile. Very early it became p. 11 an emblem of truth, justice, and righteousness, and so it remains to this day though uncountable ages have passed. Simple, familiar, elo quent, it brings from afar a sense of the wonder of the dawn, and it still teaches a less on which we find it hard to learn. So also the cube, the compasses, and the keystone, eac h a great advance for those to whom architecture was indeed \"building touched with emot ion,\" as showing that its laws are the laws of the Eternal. Maspero tells us that the temples of Egypt, even fr om earliest times, were built in the image of the earth as the builders had imagined it. 1 For them the earth was a sort of flat slab more long than wide, and the sky was a ceiling or vault supported by four great pillars. The pavement represented the earth; the fo ur angles stood for the pillars; the ceiling, more often flat, though sometimes curved, corresponded to the sky. From the pavement grew vegetation, and water plants emerged from the water; while the ceiling, painted dark blue, was strewn with stars of five po ints. Sometimes, the sun and moon were seen floating on the heavenly ocean escorted b y the constellations, and the months and days. There was a far withdrawn holy place, sma ll and obscure, approached through a succession p. 12 of courts and columned halls, all so arranged on a central axis as to point to the sunrise. Before the outer gates were obelisks and avenues of statues. Such were the shrines of the old solar religion, so oriented that on one day in the year the beams of the rising sun, or of some bright star that hailed his coming, should stream down the nave and illumine the altar. 1 Clearly, one ideal of the early builders was that o f sacrifice, as seen in their use of the finest materials; and another was accuracy of workm anship. Indeed, not a little of the earliest work displayed an astonishing technical ab ility, and such work must point to some underlying idea which the workers sought to re alize. Above all things they sought permanence. In later inscriptions relating to build ings, phrases like these occur frequently: \"it is such as the heavens in all its q uarters;\" \"firm as the heavens.\" Evidently the basic idea was that, as the heavens were stable , not to be moved, so a building put"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"into proper relation with the universe would acquir e magical stability. It is recorded that when Ikhnaton founded his new city, four boundary s tones were accurately placed, that so it might be exactly square, and thus endure fore ver. Eternity was the ideal aimed at, everything else being sacrificed for that aspiratio n. p. 13 How well they realized their dream is shown us in t he Pyramids, of all monuments of mankind the oldest, the most technically perfect, t he largest, and the most mysterious. Ages come and go, empires rise and fall, philosophi es flourish and fail, and man seeks him out many inventions, but they stand silent unde r the bright Egyptian night, as fascinating as they are baffling. An obelisk is sim ply a pyramid, albeit the base has become a shaft, holding aloft the oldest emblems of solar faith--a Triangle mounted on a Square. When and why this figure became holy no one knows, save as we may conjecture that it was one of those sacred stones which gained its sanctity in times far back of all recollection and tradition, like the Ka’aba at Mecca. Whether it be an imitation of the triangle of zodiacal light, seen at certain times i n the eastern sky at sunrise and sunset, or a feat of masonry used as a symbol of Heaven, as th e Square was an emblem of Earth, no one may affirm. 1 In the Pyramid Texts the Sun-god, when he created all the other gods, is shown sitting on the apex of the sky in the form of a Phoenix--that p. 14 [paragraph continues] Supreme God to whom two architects, Suti and Hor, wrote so noble a hymn of praise. 1 White with the worship of ages, ineffably beautiful and pathetic, is the old light-religion of humanity--a sublime nature-mysticism in which Li ght was love and life, and Darkness evil and death. For the early man light was the mot her of beauty, the unveiler of color, the elusive and radiant mystery of the world, and his s peech about it was reverent and grateful. At the gates of the morning he stood with uplifted hands, and the sun sinking in the desert at eventide made him wistful in prayer, half fear and half hope, lest the beauty return no more. His religion, when he emerged from the night of animalism, was a worship of the Light--his temple hung with stars, h is altar a glowing flame, his ritual a woven hymn of night and day. No poet of our day, no t even Shelley, has written lovelier lyrics in praise of the Light than those hymns of I khnaton in the morning of the world. 2 Memories of this religion of the dawn linger with p. 15 us today in the faith that follows the Day-Star fro m on high, and the Sun of Righteousness--One who is the Light of the World in life, and the Lamp of Poor Souls in the night of death. Here, then, are the real foundations of Masonry, bo th material and moral: in the deep need and aspiration of man, and his creative impuls e; in his instinctive Faith, his quest of the Ideal, and his love of the Light. Underneath al l his building lay the feeling, prophetic"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"of his last and highest thought, that the earthly h ouse of his life should be in right relation with its heavenly prototype, the world-temple--imit ating on earth the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. If he erected a square temple, it was an image of the earth; if he built a pyramid, it was a picture of a beauty shown him in the sky; as, later, his cathedral was modelled after the mountain, and its dim and lofty arch a memory of the forest vista--its altar a fireside of the soul, its spire a prayer in stone. And as he wrought his faith and dream into reality, it was bu t natural that the tools of the builder should become emblems of the thoughts of the thinke r. Not only his tools, but, as we shall see, the very stones with which he worked bec ame sacred symbols--the temple itself a vision of that House of Doctrine, that Home of th e Soul, which, though unseen, he is building in the midst of the years.

Dr. Breasted puts his lyrics alongside the poems of Wordsworth a nd the great passage of Ruskin in Modern Painters , as celebrating the divinity of Light ( Religion and Thought in Egypt, lecture ix). Despite the revenge of his enemies, he stands out as a lonely, heroic, prophetic soul--\"the first individual in time.\" p. 18"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"It began to shape itself to my intellectual vision into something more imposing and majestic, solemnly mysterious and grand. It seemed to me like the Pyramids in their loneliness, in whose yet undiscovered chambers may be hidden, for the enlightenment of coming generations, the sacred books of the Egyptia ns, so long lost to the world; like the Sphynx half buried in the desert . In its symbolism, which and its spirit of brotherho od are its essence, Freemasonry is more ancient than any of the world's living religio ns. It has the symbols and doctrines which, older than himself, Zarathrustra inculcated; and it seemed to me a spectacle sublime, yet pitiful--the ancient Faith of our ance stors holding out to the world its symbols once so eloquent, and mutely and in vain as king for an interpreter . And so I came at last to see that the true greatnes s and majesty of Freemasonry consist in its proprietorship of these and its other symbols; and that its symbolism is its soul . --ALBERT PIKE, Letter to Gould p. 19 CHAPTER II The Working Tools NEVER were truer words than those of Goethe in the last lines of Faust, and they echo one of the oldest instincts of humanity: \"All thing s transitory but as symbols are sent.\" From the beginning man has divined that the things open to his senses are more than mere facts, having other and hidden meanings. The w hole world was close to him as an infinite parable, a mystical and prophetic scroll t he lexicon of which he set himself to find. Both he and his world were so made as to conv ey a sense of doubleness, of high truth hinted in humble, nearby things. No smallest thing but had its skyey aspect which, by his winged and quick-sighted fancy, he sought to surprise and grasp. Let us acknowledge that man was born a poet, his mi nd a chamber of imagery, his world a gallery of art. Despite his utmost efforts, he ca n in nowise strip his thought of the flowers and fruits that cling to it, withered thoug h they often are. As a fact, he has ever been a citizen of two worlds, using the p. 20 scenery of the visible to make vivid the realities of the world Unseen. What wonder, then, that trees grew in his fancy, flowers bloomed in hi s faith, and the victory of spring over winter gave him hope of life after death, while the march of the sun and the great stars invited him to \"thoughts that wander through eterni ty.\" Symbol was his native tongue, his first form of speech--as, indeed, it is his last--w hereby he was able to say what else he could not have uttered. Such is the fact, and even the language in which we state it is \"a dictionary of faded metaphors,\" the fossil poetry o f ages ago."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I That picturesque and variegated maze of the early s ymbolism of the race we cannot study in detail, tempting as it is. Indeed, so luxuriant was that old picture-language that we may easily miss our way and get lost in the labyrinth, unless we keep to the right path. 1 First of all, throughout p. 21 this study of prophecy let us keep ever in mind a v ery simple and obvious fact, albeit not less wonderful because obvious. Socrates made the d iscovery--perhaps the greatest ever made--that human nature is universal. By his search ing questions he found out that when men think round a problem, and think deeply, they d isclose a common nature and a common system of truth. So there dawned upon him, f rom this fact, the truth of the kinship of mankind and the unity of mind. His insig ht is confirmed many times over, whether we study the earliest gropings of the human mind or set the teachings of the sages side by side. Always we find, after compariso n, that the final conclusions of the wisest minds as to the meaning of life and the worl d are harmonious, if not identical. Here is the clue to the striking resemblances betwe en the faiths and philosophies of widely separated peoples, and it makes them intelli gible while adding to their picturesqueness and philosophic interest. By the sa me token, we begin to understand why the same signs, symbols, and emblems were used by a ll peoples to express their earliest aspiration and p. 22 thought. We need not infer that one people learned them from another, or that there existed a mystic, universal order which had them in keeping. They simply betray the unity of the human mind, and show how and why, at t he same stage of culture, races far removed from each other came to the same conclusion s and used much the same symbols to body forth their thought. Illustrations are innu merable, of which a few may be named as examples of this unity both of idea and of emble m, and also as confirming the insight of the great Greek that, however shallow minds may differ, in the end all seekers after truth follow a common path, comrades in one great q uest. An example in point, as ancient as it is eloquent, is the idea of the trinity and its emblem, the triangle. What the human thought of God is depe nds on what power of the mind or aspect of life man uses as a lens through which to look into the mystery of things. Conceived of as the will of the world, God is one, and we have the monotheism of Moses. Seen through instinct and the kaleidoscope o f the senses, God is multiple, and the result is polytheism and its gods without number. F or the reason, God is a dualism made up of matter and mind, as in the faith of Zoroaster and many other cults. But when the social life of man becomes the prism p. 23"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"of faith, God is a trinity of Father, Mother, Child . Almost as old as human thought, we find the idea of the trinity and its triangle emble m everywhere--Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma in India corresponding to Osiris, Isis, and Horus in Egypt. No doubt this idea underlay the old pyramid emblem, at each corner of which stood one of the gods. No missionary carried this profound truth over the ear th. It grew out of a natural and universal human experience, and is explained by the fact of the unity of the human mind and its vision of God through the family. Other emblems take us back into an antiquity so rem ote that we seem to be walking in the shadow of prehistoric time. Of these, the mysteriou s Swastika is perhaps the oldest, as it is certainly the most widely distributed over the e arth. As much a talisman as a symbol, it has been found on Chaldean bricks, among the ruins of the city of Troy, in Egypt, on vases of ancient Cyprus, on Hittite remains and the pottery of the Etruscans, in the cave temples of India, on Roman altars and Runic monumen ts in Britain, in Thibet, China, and Korea, in Mexico, Peru, and among the prehistoric b urial-grounds of North America. There have been many interpretations of it. Perhaps the meaning, most usually assigned to it is that of the Sanskrit p. 24 word having in its roots an intimation of the benef icence of life, to be and well . As such, it is a sign indicating \"that the maze of life may bewilder, but a path of light runs through it: It is well is the name of the path, and the key to life etern al is in the strange labyrinth for those whom God leadeth.\" 1 Others hold it to have been an emblem of the Pole Star whose stability in the sky, and the procession of t he Ursa Major around it, so impressed the ancient world. Men saw the sun journeying acros s the heavens every day in a slightly different track, then standing still, as it were, a t the solstice, and then returning on its way back. They saw the moon changing not only its orbit , but its size and shape and time of appearing. Only the Pole Star remained fixed and st able, and it became, not unnaturally, a light of assurance and the footstool of the Most Hi gh. 2 Whatever its meaning, the Swastika shows us the efforts of the early man to r ead the riddle of things, and his intuition of a love at the heart of life. Akin to the Swastika, if not an evolution from it, was the Cross, made forever holy by the highest p. 25 heroism of Love. When man climbed up out of the pri meval night, with his face to heaven upturned, he had a cross in his hand. Where he got it, why he held it, and what he meant by it, no one can conjecture much less affirm . 1 Itself a paradox, its arms pointing to the four quarters of the earth, it is found in a lmost every part of the world carved on coins, altars, and tombs, and furnishing a design f or temple architecture in Mexico and Peru, in the pagodas of India, not less than in the churches of Christ. Ages before our era, even from the remote time of the cliff-dweller, the Cross seems to have been a symbol of life, though for what reason no one knows. More oft en it was an emblem of eternal life, especially when inclosed within a Circle which ends not, nor begins--the type of Eternity."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Hence the Ank Cross or Crux Ansata of Egypt, scepte r of the Lord of the Dead that never die. There is less mystery about the Circle, which was an image of the disk of the Sun and a natural symbol of completeness, of eternity. With a point within the center it became, as naturally, the emblem of the Eye of the World--that All-seeing eye of the eternal Watcher of the human scene. Square, triangle, cross, circle--oldest symbols of humanity, all of them eloquent, each of them p. 26 pointing beyond itself, as symbols always do, while giving form to the invisible truth which they invoke and seek to embody. They are beau tiful if we have eyes to see, serving not merely as chance figures of fancy, but as forms of reality as it revealed itself to the mind of man. Sometimes we find them united, the Squ are within the Circle, and within that the Triangle, and at the center the Cross. Ear liest of emblems, they show us hints and foregleams of the highest faith and philosophy, bet raying not only the unity of the human mind but its kinship with the Eternal--the fact whi ch lies at the root of every religion, and is the basis of each. Upon this Faith man builded, finding a rock beneath, refusing to think of Death as the gigantic coffin-lid of a dull and mindless universe descending upon him at last. II From this brief outlook upon a wide field, we may p ass to a more specific and detailed study of the early prophecies of Masonry in the art of the builder. Always the symbolic must follow the actual, if it is to have reference and meaning, and the real is ever the basis of the ideal. By nature an Idealist, and livi ng in a world of radiant mystery, it was inevitable that man should attach moral and spiritu al meanings to the tools, laws, and materials p. 27 of building. Even so, in almost every land and in t he remotest ages we find great and beautiful truth hovering about the builder and clin ging to his tools. 1 Whether there were organized orders of builders in the early times no one can tell, though there may have been. No matter; man mixed thought and worship with his work, and as he cut his altar stones and fitted them together he thought out a fa ith by which to live. Not unnaturally, in times when the earth was though t to be a Square the Cube had emblematical meanings it could hardly have for us. From earliest ages it was a venerated symbol, and the oblong cube signified immensity of space from the base of earth to the zenith of the heavens. It was a sacred emblem of th e Lydian Kubele, known to the Romans in after ages as Ceres or Cybele--hence, as some p. 28"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"aver, the derivation of the word \"cube.\" At first r ough stones were most sacred, and an altar of hewn stones was forbidden. 1 With the advent of the cut cube, the temple became known as the House of the Hammer--its altar, always in the center, being in the form of a cube and regarded as \"an index or emblem of Truth, ever true to itself.\" 2 Indeed, the cube, as Plutarch points out in his essay On the Cessation of Oracles , \"is palpably the proper emblem of rest, on account of the security a nd firmness of the superficies.\" He further tells us that the pyramid is an image of th e triangular flame ascending from a square altar; and since no one knows, his guess is as good as any. At any rate, Mercury, Apollo, Neptune, and Hercules were worshiped under the form of a square stone, while a large black stone was the emblem of Buddha among th e Hindoos, of Manah Theus-Ceres in Arabia, and of Odin in Scandinavia. Everyone kno ws of the Stone of Memnon in Egypt, which was said to speak at sun-rise--as, in truth, all stones spoke to man in the sunrise of time. 3 More eloquent, if possible, was the Pillar uplifted , like the pillars of the gods upholding the heavens. Whatever may have been the origin of p illars, and p. 29 there is more than one theory, Evans has shown that they were everywhere worshiped as gods. 1 Indeed, the gods themselves were pillars of Light and Power, as in Egypt Horus and Sut were the twin-builders and supporters of he aven; and Bacchus among the Thebans. At the entrance of the temple of Amenta, a t the door of the house of Ptah--as, later, in the porch of the temple of Solomon--stood two pillars. Still further back, in the old solar myths, at the gateway of eternity stood t wo pillars--Strength and Wisdom. In India, and among the Mayas and Incas, there were th ree pillars at the portals of the earthly and skyey temple--Wisdom, Strength, and Bea uty. When man set up a pillar, he became a fellow-worker with Him whom the old sages of China used to call \"the first Builder.\" Also, pillars were set up to mark the hol y places of vision and Divine deliverance, as when Jacob erected a pillar at Beth el, Joshua at Gilgal, and Samuel at Mizpeh and Shen. Always they were symbols of stabil ity, of what the Egyptians described as \"the place of establishing forever,\"-- emblems of the faith \"that the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and He hath set the world upon them.\" 2 Long before our era we find the working tools of th e Mason used as emblems of the very truths which they teach today. In the oldest classi c of China, p. 30 [paragraph continues] The Book of History , dating back to the twentieth century before Chris t, we read the instruction: \"Ye officers of the Governmen t, apply the compasses.\" Even if we begin where The Book of History ends, we find many such allusions more than seven hundred years before the Christian era. For example , in the famous canonical work, called The Great Learning , which has been referred to the fifth century B. C ., we read, that a man should abstain from doing unto others wh at he would not they should do to him; \"and this,\" the writer adds, \"is called the pr inciple of acting on the square.\" So also Confucius and his great follower, Mencius. In the w ritings of Mencius it is taught that"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"men should apply the square and compasses morally t o their lives, and the level and the marking line besides, if they would walk in the str aight and even paths of wisdom, and keep themselves within the bounds of honor and virt ue. 1 In the sixth book of his philosophy we find these words: A Master Mason, in teaching apprentices, makes use of the compasses and the square. Ye who are engaged in the pursuit of wisdom must also make use of the compass and square. 2 There are even evidences, in the earliest historic p. 31 records of China, of the existence of a system of f aith expressed in allegoric form, and illustrated by the symbols of building. The secrets of this faith seem to have been orally transmitted, the leaders alone pretending to have f ull knowledge of them. Oddly enough, it seems to have gathered about a symbolical temple put up in the desert, that the various officers of the faith were distinguished by symboli c jewels, and that at its rites they wore leather aprons. 1 From such records as we have it is not possible to say whether the builders themselves used their tools as emblems, or whether it was the thinkers who first used them to teach moral truths. In any case, they were understood; and the point here is that, thus early, the tools of the builder were tea chers of wise and good and beautiful truth. Indeed, we need not go outside the Bible to find both the materials and working tools of the Mason so employed: 2 For every house is builded by some man; but the bui lder of all things is God . . . whose house we are. 3 p. 32 Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a tried ston e, a precious corner-stone, a sure foundation. 1 The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner. 2 Ye also, as living stones, are built up into a spir itual house. 3 When he established the heavens I was there, when h e set the compass upon the face of the deep, when he marked out the foundations of the earth: th en was I by him as a master workman. 4 The Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, wit h a plumbline in his hand. And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more. 5 Ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with t he possession of the city. 6 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth. 7 Him that overcometh I will make a pillar in the tem ple of my God; and I will write upon him my new name. 8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"For we know that when our earthly house of this tab ernacle is dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the h eavens. 9 p. 33 If further proof were needed, it has been preserved for us in the imperishable stones of Egypt. 1 The famous obelisk, known as Cleopatra's Needle, n ow in Central Park, New York, the gift to our nation from Ismail, Khedive o f Egypt in 1878, is a mute but eloquent witness of the antiquity of the simple symbols of t he Mason. Originally it stood as one of the forest of obelisks surrounding the great temple of the Sun-god at Heliopolis, so long a seat of Egyptian learning and religion, dating back , it is thought, to the fifteenth century before Christ. It was removed to Alexandria and re- erected by a Roman architect and engineer named Pontius, B. C. 22. When it was taken down in 1879 to be brought to America, all the emblems of the builders were found in the foundation. The rough Cube and the polished Cube in pure white limestone, the Square cut in syenite, an iron Trowel, a lead Plummet, the arc of a Circle, the serpent-sy mbols of Wisdom, a stone Trestle- board, a stone bearing the Master's Mark, and a hie roglyphic word meaning Temple --all so placed and preserved as to show, beyond doubt, t hat they had high symbolic meaning. p. 34 [paragraph continues] Whether they were in the original foundation, or w ere placed there when the obelisk was removed, no one can tell. Neverthel ess, they were there, concrete witnesses of the fact that the builders worked in t he light of a mystical faith, of which they were emblems. Much has been written of buildings, their origin, a ge, and architecture, but of the builders hardly a word--so quickly is the worker forgotten, save as he lives in his work. Though we have no records other than these emblems, it is an obvious inference that there were orders of builders even in those early ages, to who m these symbols were sacred; and this inference is the more plausible when we remember th e importance of the builder both to religion and the state. What though the builders ha ve fallen into dust, to which all things mortal decline, they still hold out their symbols f or us to read, speaking their thoughts in a language easy to understand. Across the piled-up debris of ages they whisper the old familiar truths, and it will be a part of this stud y to trace those symbols through the centuries, showing that they have always had the sa me high meanings. They bear witness not only to the unity of the human mind, but to the existence of a common system of truth veiled in allegory and taught in symbols. As such, they are prophecies of Masonry as p. 35 we know it, whose genius it is to take what is old, simple, and universal, and use it to bring men together and make them friends.

And the place is the Valley o f Peace . --ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE, The Secret Tradition . p. 39 CHAPTER III The Drama of Faith MAN does not live by bread alone; he lives by Faith , Hope, and Love, and the first of these was Faith. Nothing in the human story is more striking than the persistent, passionate, profound protest of man against death. Even in the earliest time we see him daring to stand erect at the gates of the grave, di sputing its verdict, refusing to let it have the last word, and making argument in behalf of his soul. For Emerson, as for Addison, that fact alone was proof enough of immortality, as revealing a universal intuition of eternal life. Others may not be so easily convinced , but no man who has the heart of a man can fail to be impressed by the ancient, heroic faith of his race. Nowhere has this faith ever been more vivid or vict orious than among the old Egyptians. 1 In the p. 40 ancient Book of the Dead --which is, indeed, a Book of Resurrection--occur t he words: \"The soul to heaven; the body to earth;\" and that f irst faith is our faith today. Of King Unas, who lived in the third millennium, it is writ ten: \"Behold, thou hast not gone as one dead, but as one living.\" Nor has any one in our da y set forth this faith with more simple eloquence than the Hymn to Osiris, in the Papyrus o f Hunefer. So in the Pyramid Texts the dead are spoken of as Those Who Ascend, the Imp erishable Ones who shine as stars, and the gods are invoked to witness the death of th e King \"Dawning as a Soul.\" There is deep prophecy, albeit touched with poignant pathos, in these broken exclamations written on the pyramid walls: Thou diest not! Have ye said that he would die? He diest not; this King Pepi lives forever! Live! Thou shalt not die! He has escaped his day of death ! Thou livest, thou livest, raise thee up! Thou diest not, stand up, raise thee up! Thou perishest not eternally! Thou diest not! 1 p. 41 Nevertheless, nor poetry nor chant nor solemn ritua l could make death other than death; and the pyramid Texts, while refusing to utter the fatal word, give wistful reminiscences of that blessed age \"before death came forth.\" Howe ver high the faith of man, the masterful negation and collapse of the body was a f act, and it was to keep that daring faith alive and aglow that The Mysteries were insti tuted. Beginning, it may be, in incantation, they rose to heights of influence and beauty, giving dramatic portrayal of the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"unconquerable faith of man. Watching the sun rise f rom the tomb of night, and the spring return in glory after the death of winter, man reas oned from analogy--justifying a faith that held him as truly as he held it--that the race , sinking into the grave, would rise triumphant over death. I There were many variations on this theme as the dra ma of faith evolved, and as it passed from land to land; but the Motif was ever the same, and they all were derived, directly or indirectly, from the old Osirian passion-play in Eg ypt. Against the back-ground of the ancient Solar religion, Osiris made his advent as L ord of the Nile and fecund Spirit of p. 42 vegetable life--son of Nut the sky-goddess and Geb the earth-god; and nothing in the story of the Nile-dwellers is more appealing than h is conquest of the hearts of the people against all odds. 1 Howbeit, that history need not detain us here, exc ept to say that by the time his passion had become the drama of national f aith, it had been bathed in all the tender hues of human life; though somewhat of its s olar radiance still lingered in it. Enough to say that of all the gods, called into bei ng by the hopes and fears of men who dwelt in times of yore on the banks of the Nile, Os iris was the most beloved. Osiris the benign father, Isis his sorrowful and faithful wife , and Horus whose filial piety and heroism shine like diamonds in a heap of stones--ab out this trinity were woven the ideals of Egyptian faith and family life. Hear now the sto ry of the oldest drama of the race, which for more than three thousand years held capti ve the hearts of men. 2 p. 43 Osiris was Ruler of Eternity, but by reason of his visible shape seemed nearly akin to man--revealing a divine humanity. His success was c hiefly due, however, to the gracious speech of Isis, his sister-wife, whose charm men co uld neither reckon nor resist. Together they labored for the good of man, teaching him to d iscern the plants fit for food, themselves pressing the grapes and drinking the fir st cup of wine. They made known the veins of metal running through the earth, of which man was ignorant, and taught him to make weapons. They initiated man into the intellect ual and moral life, taught him ethics and religion, how to read the starry sky, song and dance and the rhythm of music. Above all, they evoked in men a sense of immortality, of a destiny beyond the tomb. Nevertheless, they had enemies at once stupid and c unning, keen-witted but short- sighted--the dark force of evil which still weaves the fringe of crime on the borders of human life. Side by side with Osiris, lived the impious Set-Typ hon, as Evil ever haunts the Good. While Osiris was absent, Typhon--whose name means s erpent--filled with envy and malice, sought to usurp his throne; but his plot wa s frustrated by Isis. Whereupon he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did, having invite d him to a feast, by persuading him to enter a chest, offering, as if in jest, to pre-sent the richly carved chest to any one of his guests"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"p. 44 who, lying down inside it, found he was of the same size. When Osiris got in and stretched himself out, the conspirators closed the chest, and flung it into the Nile. 1 Thus far, the gods had not known death. They had grown o ld, with white hair and trembling limbs, but old age had not led to death. As soon as Isis heard of this infernal treachery, she cut her hair, clad herself in a garb of mournin g, ran thither and yon, a prey to the most cruel anguish, seeking the body. Weeping and distra cted, she never tarried, never tired in her sorrowful quest. Meanwhile, the waters carried the chest out to sea, as far as Byblos in Syria, the town of Adonis, where it lodged against a shrub of arica, o r tamarisk--like an acacia tree. 2 Owing to the virtue of p. 45 the body, the shrub, at its touch, shot up into a t ree, growing around it, and protecting it, until the king of that country cut the tree which h id the chest in its bosom, and made from it a column for his palace. At last Isis, led by a vision, came to Byblos, made herself known, and asked for the column. Hence the picture of her weeping over a broken column torn from the palace, while Horus, god of Ti me, stands behind her pouring ambrosia on her hair. She took the body back to Egy pt, to the city of Bouto; but Typhon, hunting by moonlight, found the chest, and having r ecognized the body of Osiris, mangled it and scattered it beyond recognition. Isi s, embodiment of the old world-sorrow for the dead, continued her pathetic quest, gatheri ng piece by piece the body of her dismembered husband, and giving him decent intermen t. Such was the life and death of Osiris, but as his career pictured the cycle of nat ure, it could not of course end here. Horus fought with Typhon, losing an eye in the batt le, but finally overthrew him and took him prisoner. There are several versions of his fat e, but he seems to have been tried, sentenced, and executed--\"cut in three pieces,\" as the Pyramid Texts relate. Thereupon the faithful son went in solemn procession to the g rave of his father, opened it, and called upon Osiris to rise: \"Stand up! Thou shalt p. 46 not end, thou shalt not perish!\" But death was deaf . Here the Pyramid Texts recite the mortuary ritual, with its hymns and chants; but in vain. At length Osiris awakes, weary and feeble, and by the aid of the strong grip of th e lion-god he gains control of his body, and is lifted from death to life. 1 Thereafter, by virtue of his victory over death, O siris becomes Lord of the Land of Death, his scepter an A nk Cross, his throne a Square. II Such, in brief, was the ancient allegory of eternal life, upon which there were many elaborations as the drama unfolded; but always, und er whatever variation of local color, of national accent or emphasis, its central theme r emained the same. Often perverted and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"abused, it was everywhere a dramatic expression of the great human aspiration for triumph over death and union with God, and the beli ef in the ultimate victory of Good over Evil. Not otherwise would this drama have held the hearts of men through long ages, and won the eulogiums of the most enlightened men o f antiquity--of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Euripides, Plutarch, Pindar, Isocr ates, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Writing to his wife after the loss of their little girl, p. 47 [paragraph continues] Plutarch commends to her the hope set forth in the mystic rites and symbols of this drama, as, elsewhere, he testifies that it kept him \"as far from superstition as from atheism,\" and helped him to approach the tr uth. For deeper minds this drama had a double meaning, teaching not only immortality aft er death, but the awakening of man upon earth from animalism to a life of purity, just ice, and honor. How nobly this practical aspect was taught, and with what fineness of spirit ual insight, may be seen in Secret Sermon on the Mountain in the Hermetic lore of Greece: 1 What may I say, my son? I can but tell thee this. W henever I see within myself the Simple Vision brought to birth out of God's mercy, I have passed through myself into a Body that can never die. Then I am not what I was before. . . They who are t hus born are children of a Divine race. This race, my son, is never taught; but when He willeth it, its memory is restored by God. It is the \"Way of Birth in God.\" . . Withdraw into thyself an d it will come. Will , and it comes to pass. Isis herself is said to have established the first temple of the Mysteries, the oldest being those practiced at Memphis. Of these there were two orders, the Lesser to which the many were eligible, and which consisted of dialogue and ritual, with certain signs, tokens, grips, passwords; and the Greater, p. 48 reserved for the few who approved themselves worthy of being entrusted with the highest secrets of science, philosophy, and religion. For t hese the candidate had to undergo trial, purification, danger, austere asceticism, and, at l ast, regeneration through dramatic death amid rejoicing. Such as endured the ordeal with val or were then taught, orally and by symbol, the highest wisdom to which man had attaine d, including geometry, astronomy, the fine arts, the laws of nature, as well as the t ruths of faith. Awful oaths of secrecy were exacted, and Plutarch describes a man kneeling, his hands bound, a cord round his body, and a knife at his throat--death being the penalty of violating the obligation. Even then, Pythagoras had to wait almost twenty years to learn the hidden wisdom of Egypt, so cautious were they of candidates, especially of for eigners. But he made noble use of it when, later, he founded a secret order of his own a t Crotona, in Greece, in which, among other things, he taught geometry, using numbers as symbols of spiritual truth. 1 From Egypt the Mysteries passed with little change to Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome, the p. 49"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"names of local gods being substituted for those of Osiris and Isis. The Grecian or Eleusinian Mysteries, established 1800 B. C., repre sented Demeter and Persephone, and depicted the death of Dionysius with stately ritual which led the neophyte from death into life and immortality. They taught the unity of God, the immutable necessity of morality, and a life after death, investing initiates with si gns and passwords by which they could know each other in the dark as well as in the light . The Mithraic or Persian Mysteries celebrated the eclipse of the Sun-god, using the si gns of the zodiac, the processions of the seasons, the death of nature, and the birth of spri ng. The Adoniac or Syrian cults were similar, Adonis being killed, but revived to point to life through death. In the Cabirie Mysteries on the island of Samothrace, Atys the Sun was killed by his brothers the Seasons, and at the vernal equinox was restored to life. So, also, the Druids, as far north as England, taught of one God the tragedy of winter and summer, and conducted the initiate through the valley of death to life everla sting. 1 p. 50 Shortly before the Christian era, when faith was fa iling and the world seemed reeling to its ruin, there was a great revival of the Mystery- religions. Imperial edict was powerless to stay it, much less stop it. From Egypt, from the far East, they came rushing in like a tide, Isis \"of the myriad names\" vying with Mithra, the patron saint of the soldier, for the homage of the multitude. If we ask the secret reaso n for this influx of mysticism, no single answer can be given to the question. What in fluence the reigning mystery-cults had upon the new, uprising Christianity is also hard to know, and the issue is still in debate. That they did influence the early Church is evident from the writings of the Fathers, and some go so far as to say that the Mysteries died at last only to live again in the ritual of the Church. St. Paul in his missionary journeys cam e in contact with the Mysteries, and even makes use of some of their technical terms in his epistles; 1 but he condemned them on the ground that what p. 51 they sought to teach in drama can be known only by spiritual experience--a sound insight, though surely drama may assist to that experience, else public worship might also come under ban. III Toward the end of their power, the Mysteries fell i nto the mire and became corrupt, as all things human are apt to do: even the Church itself being no exception. But that at their highest and best they were not only lofty and noble , but elevating and refining, there can be no doubt, and that they served a high purpose is equally clear. No one, who has read in the Metamorphoses of Apuleius the initiation of Lucius into the Myst eries of Isis, can doubt that the effect on the votary was profound an d purifying. He tells us that the ceremony of initiation \"is, as it were, to suffer d eath,\" and that he stood in the presence of the gods, \"ay, p. 52"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"stood near and worshiped.\" Far hence ye profane, and all who are polluted by s in , was the motto of the Mysteries, and Cicero testifies th at what a man learned in the house of the hidden place made him want to live nobly, and g ave him happy hopes for the hour of death. Indeed, the Mysteries, as Plato said, 1 were established by men of great genius who, in th e early ages, strove to teach purity, to ameliorate t he cruelty of the race, to refine its manners and morals, and to restrain society by stro nger bonds than those which human laws impose. No mystery any longer attaches to what they taught, but only as to the particular rites, dramas, and symbols used in their teaching. They taught faith in the unity and spirituality of God, the sovereign authority of the moral law, heroic purity of soul, austere discipline of character, and the hope of a life beyond the tomb. Thus in ages of darkness, of complexity, of conflicting peoples, to ngues, and faiths, these great orders toiled in behalf of friendship, bringing men togeth er under a banner of faith, and training them for a nobler moral life. Tender and tolerant o f all faiths, they formed an all- embracing moral and spiritual fellowship which rose above barriers of nation, race, and creed, satisfying the craving of men for p. 53 unity, while evoking in them a sense of that eterna l mysticism out of which all religions were born. Their ceremonies, so far as we know them , were stately dramas of the moral life and the fate of the soul. Mystery and secrecy added impressiveness, and fable and enigma disguised in imposing spectacle the laws of justice, piety, and the hope of immortality. Masonry stands in this tradition; and if we may not say that it is historically related to the great ancient orders, it is their spiritual descend ant, and renders much the same ministry to our age which the Mysteries rendered to the olde n world. It is, indeed, the same stream of sweetness and light flowing in our day--like the fabled river Alpheus which, gathering the waters of a hundred rills along the hillsides o f Arcadia, sank, lost to sight, in a chasm in the earth, only to reappear in the fountain of A rethusa. This at least is true: the Greater Ancient Mysteries were prophetic of Masonry whose d rama is an epitome of universal initiation, and whose simple symbols are the deposi taries of the noblest wisdom of mankind. As such, it brings men together at the alt ar of prayer, keeps alive the truths that make us men, seeking, by every resource of art, to make tangible the power of love, the worth of beauty, and the reality of the ideal. Footnotes 39:1 Of course, faith in immortality was in nowise pecu liar to Egypt, but was universal; as vivid in The Upanishads of India as in the Pyramid records. It rests upon the consensus of the insight, experience, and aspiration of the r ace. But the records of Egypt, like its monuments, are richer than those of other nations, if not p. 40 older.

After Troy was taken the Thracian, for the sake of the money, killed the you ng prince and privately buried him. Æneas, coming into that country, and accidentally p lucking up a shrub that was near him on the side of the hill, discovered the murdered bo dy of Polydorus.

She holds back her secrets until man i s fit to be entrusted with them, lest by rashness he destroy himself. Those who seek find, n ot because the truth is far off, but because the discipline of the quest makes them read y for the truth, and worthy to receive it. By a certain sure instinct the great teachers o f our race have regarded the highest truth less as a gift bestowed than as a trophy to be won. Everything must not be told to everybody. Truth is power, and when held by untrue hands it may become a plague. Even Jesus had His \"little flock\" to whom He confided mu ch which He kept from the world, or"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"else taught it in parables cryptic and veiled. 1 One of His sayings in explanation of His method is quoted by Clement of Alexandria in his Homilies : p. 58 It was not from grudgingness that our Lord gave the charge in a certain Gospel: \" My mystery is for Me and the sons of My house .\" 1 This more withdrawn teaching, hinted in the saying of the Master, with the arts of spiritual culture employed, has come to be known as the Secret Doctrine, or the Hidden Wisdom. A persistent tradition affirms that through out the ages, and in every land, behind the system of faith accepted by the masses an inner and deeper doctrine has been held and taught by those able to grasp it. This hidden faith has undergone many changes of outward expression, using now one set of symbols an d now another, but its central tenets have remained the same; and necessarily so, since t he ultimates of thought are ever immutable. By the same token, those who have eyes t o see have no difficulty in penetrating the varying veils of expression and ide ntifying the underlying truths; thus confirming in the arcana of faith what we found to be true in its earliest forms--the oneness of the human mind and the unity of truth. There are those who resent the suggestion that ther e is, or can be, secrecy in regard to spiritual truths which, if momentous at all, are of common moment to all. For this reason Demonax, in the Lucian play, would not be initiated , because, if the p. 59 [paragraph continues] Mysteries were bad, he would not keep silent as a warning; and if they were good, he would proclaim them as a duty. The ob jection is, however, unsound, as a little thought will reveal. Secrecy in such matters inheres in the nature of the truths themselves, not in any affected superiority of a fe w elect minds. Qualification for the knowledge of higher things is, and must always be, a matter of personal fitness. Other qualification there is none. For those who have tha t fitness the Secret Doctrine is as clear as sunlight, and for those who have it not the trut h would still be secret though shouted from the house-top. The Grecian Mysteries were cert ainly secret, yet the fact of their existence was a matter of common knowledge, and the re was no more secrecy about their sanctuaries than there is about a cathedral. Their presence testified to the public that a deeper than the popular faith did exist, but the ri ght to admission into them depended upon the whole-hearted wish of the aspirant, and hi s willingness to fit himself to know the truth. The old maxim applies here, that when th e pupil is ready the teacher is found waiting, and he passes on to know a truth hitherto hidden because he lacked either the aptitude or the desire. All is mystery as of course, but mystification is a nother thing, and the tendency to befog a theme which needs to be clarified, is to be regrett ed. Here p. 60"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"lies, perhaps, the real reason for the feeling of r esentment against the idea of a Secret Doctrine, and one must admit that it is not without justification. For example, we are told that behind the age-long struggle of man to know th e truth there exists a hidden fraternity of initiates, adepts in esoteric lore, known to the mselves but not to the world, who have had in their keeping, through the centuries, the hi gh truths which they permit to be dimly adumbrated in the popular faiths, but which the res t of the race are too obtuse, even yet, to grasp save in an imperfect and limited degree. T hese hidden sages, it would seem, look upon our eager aspiring humanity much like the pati ent masters of an idiot school, watching it go on forever seeking without finding, while they sit in seclusion keeping the keys of the occult. 1 All of which would be very wonderful, if true. It is, however, only one more of those fascinating fictions with which m ystery-mongers entertain themselves, and deceive others. Small wonder p. 61 that thinking men turn from such fanciful folly wit h mingled feelings of pity and disgust. Sages there have been in every land and time, and t heir lofty wisdom has the unity which inheres in all high human thought, but that there i s now, or has ever been, a conscious, much less a continuous, fellowship of superior soul s holding as secrets truths denied to their fellow-men, verges upon the absurd. Indeed, what is called the Secret Doctrine differs not one whit from what has been taught openly and earnestly, so far as such truth can be t aught in words or pictured in symbols, by the highest minds of almost every land and langu age. The difference lies less in what is taught than in the way in which it is taught; no t so much in matter as in method. Also, we must not forget that, with few exceptions, the m en who have led our race farthest along the way toward the Mount of Vision, have not been men who learned their lore from any coterie of esoteric experts, but, rather, men who told in song what they had been taught in sorrow--initiates into eternal truth, to be sure, but by the grace of God and the divine right of genius! 1 Seers, sages, p. 62 mystics, saints--these are they who, having sought in sincerity, found in reality, and the memory of them is a kind of religion. Some of them, like Pythagoras, were trained for their quest in the schools of the Secret Doctrine, but others went their way alone, though never unattended, and, led by \"the vision splendid, \" they came at last to the gate and passed into the City. Why, then, it may be asked, speak of such a thing a s the Secret Doctrine at all, since it were better named the Open Secret of the world? For two reasons, both of which have been intimated: first, in the olden times unwonted knowledge of any kind was a very dangerous possession, and the truths of science and philosophy, equally with religious ideas other than those in vogue among the multitude , had to seek the protection of obscurity. If this necessity gave designing priestc raft its opportunity, it nevertheless offered the security and silence needed by the thin ker and seeker after truth in dark"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"p. 63 times. Hence there arose in the ancient world, wher ever the human mind was alive and spiritual, systems of exoteric and esoteric instruc tion; that is, of truth taught openly and truth concealed. Disciples were advanced from the o utside to the inside of this divine philosophy, as we have seen, by degrees of initiati on. Whereas, by symbols, dark sayings, and dramatic ritual the novice received only hints of what was later made plain. Second, this hidden teaching may indeed be describe d as the open secret of the world, because it is open, yet understood only by those fi t to receive it. What kept it hidden was no arbitrary restriction, but only a lack of insigh t and fineness of mind to appreciate and assimilate it. Nor could it be otherwise; and this is as true today as ever it was in the days of the Mysteries, and so it will be until whatever is to be the end of mortal things. Fitness for the finer truths cannot be conferred; it must b e developed. Without it the teachings of the sages are enigmas that seem unintelligible, if not contradictory. In so far, then, as the discipline of initiation, and its use of art in dra ma and symbol, help toward purity of soul and spiritual awakening, by so much do they prepare men for the truth; by so much and no further. So that, the Secret Doctrine, whether a s taught by the ancient Mysteries or by modern Masonry, is less a doctrine than a p. 64 discipline; a method of organized spiritual culture , and as such has a place and a ministry among men. II Perhaps the greatest student in this field of esote ric teaching and method, certainly the greatest now living, is Arthur Edward Waite, to who m it is a pleasure to pay tribute. By nature a symbolist, if not a sacramentalist, he fou nd in such studies a task for which he was almost ideally fitted by temperament, training, and genius. Engaged in business, but not absorbed by it, years of quiet, leisurely toil have made him master of the vast literature and lore of his subject, to the study of which he brought a religious nature, the accuracy and skill of a scholar, a sureness and del icacy of insight at once sympathetic and critical, the soul of a poet, and a patience as unt iring as it is rewarding; qualities rare indeed, and still more rarely blended. Prolific but seldom prolix, he writes with grace, ease, and lucidity, albeit in a style often opulent , and touched at times with lights and jewels from old alchemists, antique liturgies, remo te and haunting romance, secret orders of initiation, and other recondite sources not easi ly traced. Much learning and many kinds of wisdom are in his pages, and withal an air of se renity, of tolerance; and if he is of those p. 65 who turn down another street when miracles are perf ormed in the neighborhood, it is because, having found the inner truth, he asks for no sign."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Always he writes in the conviction that all great s ubjects bring us back to the one subject which is alone great, and that scholarly criticisms , folk-lore, and deep philosophy are little less than useless if they fall short of dire cting us to our true end--the attainment of that living Truth which is about us everywhere. He conceives of our mortal life as one eternal Quest of that living Truth, taking many pha ses and forms, yet ever at heart the same aspiration, to trace which he has made it his labor and joy to essay. Through all his pages he is following out the tradition of this Que st, in its myriad aspects, especially since the Christian era, disfigured though it has b een at times by superstition, and distorted at others by bigotry, but still, in what guise soever, containing as its secret the meaning of the life of man from his birth to his re union with God who is his Goal. And the result is a series of volumes noble in form, un ited in aim, unique in wealth of revealing beauty, and of unequalled worth. 1 p. 66 Beginning as far back as 1886, Waite issued his stu dy of the Mysteries of Magic , a digest of the writings of Eliphas Levi, to whom Albert Pik e was more indebted than he let us know. Then followed the Real History of the Rosicrucians , which traces, as far as any mortal may trace, the thread of fact whereon is str ung the romance of a fraternity the very existence of which has been doubted and denied by t urns. Like all his work, it bears the impress of knowledge from the actual sources, betra ying his extraordinary learning and his exceptional experience in this kind of inquiry. Of the Quest in its distinctively Christian aspect, he has written in The Hidden Church of the Holy Graal ; a work of rare beauty, of bewildering richness, written in a style which, partaking of the quality of the story told, is not at all after the manner of these days. But the Graal Legend is only one aspect of the old-world sacred Quest, uniting the s ymbols of chivalry with Christian faith. Masonry is another; and no one may ever hope to wri te of The Secret Tradition in Masonry with more insight and charm, or a touch more sure and revealing, than this gracious student for whom Masonry perpetuates the i nstituted p. 67 [paragraph continues] Mysteries of antiquity, with much else derived fro m innumerable store- houses of treasure. His last work is a survey of The Secret Doctrine in Israel , being a study of the Zohar , 1 or Hebrew \"Book of Splendor,\" a feat for which no Hebrew scholar has had the heart. This Bible of Kabbalism is indee d so confused and confusing that only a \"golden dustman\" would have had the patience to s ift out its gems from the mountain of dross, and attempt to reduce its wide-weltering cha os to order. Even Waite, with all his gift of research and narration, finds little more t han gleams of dawn in a dim forest, brilliant vapors, and glints that tell by their ver y perversity and strangeness. Whether this age-old legend of the Quest be woven a bout the Cup of Christ, a Lost Word, or a design left unfinished by the death of a Maste r Builder, it has always these things in common: first, the memorials of a great loss which has befallen humanity by sin, making our race a pilgrim host ever in search; second, the intimation that what was lost still exists somewhere in time and the world, although"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"p. 68 deeply buried; third, the faith that it will ultima tely be found and the vanished glory restored; fourth, the substitution of something tem porary and less than the best, albeit never in a way to adjourn the quest; fifth, and mor e rarely, the felt presence of that which was lost under veils close to the hands of all. Wha t though it take many forms, from the pathetic pilgrimage of the Wandering Jew to the journey to fairyland in quest of The Blue Bird , it is ever and always the same. These are but so many symbols of the fact that men are made of one blood and born to one need; that th ey should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He is no t far from every one of us; for in Him we live and move and have our being. 1 What, then, is the Secret Doctrine, of which this s eer-like scholar has written with so many improvisations of eloquence and emphasis, and of which each of us is in quest? What, indeed, but that which all the world is seeki ng--knowledge of Him whom to know aright is the fulfillment of every human need: the kinship of the soul with God; the life of purity, honor, and piety demanded by that high here dity; the unity and fellowship of the race in duty and destiny; and the faith that the so ul is p. 69 deathless as God its Father is deathless! Now to ac cept this faith as a mere philosophy is one thing, but to realize it as an experience of th e innermost heart is another and a deeper thing. -o man knows the Secret Doctrine until it has becom e the secret of his soul, the reigning reality of his thought, the inspiration of his acts, the form and color and glory of his life . Happily, owing to the growth of the race in spiri tual intelligence and power, the highest truth is no longer held as a sacred secret. Still, if art has efficacy to surprise and reveal the elusive Spirit of Truth, when truth is d ramatically presented it is made vivid and impressive, strengthening the faith of the stro ngest and bringing a ray of heavenly light to many a baffled seeker. Ever the Quest goes on, though it is permitted some of us to believe that the Lost Word has been found, in the only way in which it can eve r be found--even in the life of Him who was \"the Word made flesh,\" who dwelt among us a nd whose grace and beauty we know. Of this Quest Masonry is an aspect, continuin g the high tradition of humanity, asking men to unite in the search for the thing mos t worth finding, that each may share the faith of all. Apart from its rites, there is no mystery in Masonry, save the mystery of all great and p. 70 simple things. So far from being hidden or occult, its glory lies in its openness, and its emphasis upon the realities which are to the human world what light and air are to nature. Its mystery is of so great a kind that it is easily overlooked; its secret almost too simple to be found out.

Some extend the term occultism to cover mysticism and the spiri tual life generally, but that is not a legitimate use of either word. Occultism seeks to g et; mysticism to give.

Even so charming a book as Jesus, the Last Great Initiate , by Schure--not to speak of The Great Work and Mystic Masonry --is clearly, though not intentionally, misleading. Of a piece wi th this is the effort, apparently deliberate and concerted, to rob the Hebrew race of all p. 62 spiritual originality, as witness so able a work as Our Own Religion in Persia , by Mills, to name no other. Our own religion? Assuredly, if by that is meant the one gr eat, universal religion of humanity. But the sundering difference between the Bible and any other book that speaks to mankind about God and Life and Death, sets the Hebrew race apart as supreme in its religious genius, as the Greeks were in philosophical acumen and artistic power, and the Romans in executive skill.

The Ionian societies . . . extended their moral views, in con-junction with the art of building, to many useful purposes, and to the practice of acts of benevolence. They had si gnificant words to distinguish their members; and for the same purpose they used emblems taken from the art of building . --JOSEPH DA COSTA, Dionysian Artificers . We need not then consider it improbable, if in the dark centuries when the Roman empire was dying out, and its glorious temples falling int o ruin; when the arts and sciences were falling into disuse or being enslaved; and when no place was safe from persecution and warfare, the guild of the Architects should fly for safety to almost the only free spot in Italy; and here, though they could no longer practi ce their craft, they preserved the legendary knowledge and precepts which, as history implies, came down to them through Vitruvius from older sources, some say from Solomon 's builders themselves . --LEADER SCOTT, The Cathedral Builders . p. 73 CHAPTER V The Collegia SO far in our study we have found that from earlies t time architecture was related to religion; that the working tools of the builder wer e emblems of moral truth; that there were great secret orders using the Drama of Faith a s a rite of initiation; and that a hidden doctrine was kept for those accounted worthy, after trial, to be entrusted with it. Secret societies, born of the nature and need of man, ther e have been almost since recorded history began; 1 but as yet we have come upon no separate and disti nct order of builders. For aught we know there may have been such in plent y, but we have no intimation, much less a record, of the fact. That is to say, history has a vague story to tell us of the earliest orders of the builders. However, it is more than a mere plausible inference that from the beginning architects were members of secret orders; for, as we have seen , not only the truths of religion and philosophy, but also the p. 74 facts of science and the laws of art, were held as secrets to be known only to the few. This was so, apparently without exception, among al l ancient peoples; so much so, indeed, that we may take it as certain that the bui lders of old time were initiates. Of necessity, then, the arts of the craft were secrets jealously guarded, and the architects themselves, while they may have employed and traine d ordinary workmen, were men of learning and influence. Such glimpses of early arch itects as we have con-firm this inference, as, for example, the noble hymn to the S un-god written by Suti and Hor, two"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"architects employed by Amenhotep III, of Egypt. 1 Just when the builders began to form orders of their own no one knows, but it was perhap s when the Mystery-cults began to journey abroad into other lands. What we have to ke ep in mind is that all the arts had their home in the temple, from which, as time passe d, they spread out fan-wise along all the paths of culture. Keeping in mind the secrecy of the laws of building , and the sanctity with which all science and art were regarded, we have a key whereb y to interpret p. 75 the legends woven about the building of the temple of Solomon. Few realize how high that temple on Mount Moriah towered in the history of the olden world, and how the story of its building haunted the legends and tradi tions of the times following. Of these legends there were many, some of them wildly improb able, but the persistence of the tradition, and its consistency withal, despite many variations, is a fact of no small moment . Nor is this tradition to be wondered at, since ti me has shown that the building of the temple at Jerusalem was an event of world-impor tance, not only to the Hebrews, but to other nations, more especially the Phoenicians. The histories of both peoples make much of the building of the Hebrew temple, of the f riendship of Solomon and Hiram I, of Tyre, and of the harmony between the two peoples; a nd Phoenician tradition has it that Solomon presented Hiram with a duplicate of the tem ple, which was erected in Tyre. 1 Clearly, the two nations were drawn closely togethe r, and this fact carried with it a mingling of religious influences and ideas, as was true between the Hebrews and other nations, especially Egypt and Phoenicia, during the reign of Solomon. Now p. 76 the religion of the Phoenicians at this time, as al l agree, was the Egyptian religion in a modified form, Dionysius having taken the role of O siris in the drama of faith in Greece, Syria, and Asia Minor. Thus we have the Mysteries o f Egypt, in which Moses was learned, brought to the very door of the temple of Solomon, and that, too, at a time favorable to their impress. The Hebrews were not ar chitects, and it is plain from the records that the temple--and, indeed, the palaces o f Solomon--were designed and erected by Phoenician builders, and for the most part by Ph oenician workmen and materials. Josephus adds that the architecture of the temple w as of the style called Grecian. So much would seem to be fact, whatever may be said of the legends flowing from it. If, then, the laws of building were secrets known o nly to initiates, there must have been a secret Order of architects who built the temple of Solomon. Who were they? They were almost certainly the Dionysian Artificers --not to be confused with the play-actors called by the same name later--an Order of builders who er ected temples, stadia, and theaters in Asia Minor, and who were at the same time an order of the Mysteries under the tutelage of Bacchus before that worship declined, as it did later in Athens and Rome, into mere revelry. 1 As"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"p. 77 such, they united the art of architecture with the old Egyptian drama of faith, representing in their ceremonies the murder of Dionysius by the Titans and his return to life. So that, blending the symbols of Astronomy with those of Arc hitecture, by a slight change made by a natural process, how easy for the master-artis t of the temple-builders to become the hero of the ancient drama of immortality. 1 p. 78 [paragraph continues] Whether or not this fact can be verified from hist ory, such is the form in which the tradition has come down to us, surviving through long ages and triumphing over all vicissitude. 1 Secret orders have few records and their story is hard to tell, but this account is perfectly in accord with the spirit and setting of the situation, and there is neither fact nor reason against it. While this does not establish it as true historically, it surely gives it validity as a prophecy, if nothing more. 2 p. 79 After all, then, the tradition that Masonry, not un like the Masonry we now know, had its origin while the temple of King Solomon was buildin g, and was given shape by the two royal friends, may not be so fantastic as certain s uperior folk seem to think it. How else can we explain the fact that when the Knights of th e Crusades went to the Holy Land they came back a secret, oath-bound fraternity? Also, wh y is it that, through the ages, we see bands of builders coming from the East calling them selves \"sons of Solomon,\" and using his interlaced triangle-seal as their emblem? Strab o, as we have seen, traced the Dionysiac builders eastward into Syria, Persia, and even India. They may also be traced westward. Traversing Asia Minor, they entered Europ e by way of Constantinople, and we follow them through Greece to Rome, where already s everal centuries before Christ we find them bound together in corporations called Col legia. These lodges flourished in all parts of the Roman Empire, traces of their existenc e having been discovered in England as early as the middle of the first century of our era. II Krause was the first to point out a prophecy of Mas onry in the old orders of builders, following p. 80 their footsteps--not connectedly, of course, for th ere are many gaps--through the Dionysiac fraternity of Tyre, through the Roman Col legia, to the architects and Masons of the Middle Ages. Since he wrote, however, much n ew material has come to light, but the date of the advent of the builders in Rome is s till uncertain. Some trace it to the very founding of the city, while others go no further ba ck than King Numa, the friend of Pythagoras. 1 By any account, they were of great antiquity, and their influence in Roman history was far-reaching. They followed the Roman l egions to remote places, building cities, bridges, and temples, and it was but natura l that Mithra, the patron god of soldiers,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"should have influenced their orders. Of this an exa mple may be seen in the remains of the ancient Roman villa at Morton, on the Isle of Wight . 2 As Rome grew in power and became a vast, all-embrac ing empire, the individual man felt, more p. 81 and more, his littleness and loneliness. This feeli ng, together with the increasing specialization of industry, begat a passion for ass ociation, and Collegia of many sorts were organized. Even a casual glance at the inscrip tions, under the heading Artes et Opificia , will show the enormous development of skilled han dicrafts, and how minute was their specialization. Every trade soon had its secret order, or union, and so powerful did they become that the emperors found it necessar y to abolish the right of free association. Yet even such edicts, though effective for a little time, were helpless as against the universal craving for combination. Ways were easily found whereby to evade the law, which had exempted from its restrictions o rders consecrated by their antiquity or their religious character. Most of the Collegia bec ame funerary and charitable in their labors, humble folk seeking to escape the dim, hope less obscurity of plebeian life, and the still more hopeless obscurity of death. Pathetic be yond words are some of the inscriptions telling of the horror and loneliness of the grave, of the day when no kindly eye would read the forgotten name, and no hand bring offering s of flowers. Each collegium held memorial services, and marked the tomb of its dead with the emblems of its trade: if a baker, with a loaf of bread; if a builder, with a s quare, compasses, and the level. p. 82 From the first the Colleges of Architects seem to h ave enjoyed special privileges and exemptions, owing to the value of their service to the state, and while we do not find them called Free-masons they were such in law and f act long before they wore the name. They were permitted to have their own constitutions and regulations, both secular and religious. In form, in officers, in emblems a Roman Collegium resembled very much a modern Masonic Lodge. For one thing, no College cou ld consist of less than three persons, and so rigid was this rule that the saying , \"three make a college,\" became a maxim of law. Each College was presided over by a M agister, or Master, with two decuriones , or wardens, each of whom extended the commands of the Master to \"the brethren of his column.\" There were a secretary, a treasurer, and a keeper of archives, and, as the colleges were in part religious and usu ally met near some temple, there was a sacerdos , or, as we would say, a priest, or chaplain. The m embers were of three orders, not unlike apprentices, fellows, and masters, or co lleagues. What ceremonies of initiation were used we do not know, but that they were of a r eligious nature seems certain, as each College adopted a patron deity from among the many then worshiped. Also, as the Mysteries of Isis and Mithra ruled the Roman p. 83 world by turns, the ancient drama of eternal life w as never far away."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Of the emblems of the Collegia, it is enough to say that here again we find the simple tools of the builder used as teachers of truth for life and hope in death. Upon a number of sarcophagi, still extant, we find carved the square , the compasses, the cube, the plummet, the circle, and always the level. There is, besides , the famous Collegium uncovered at the excavation of Pompeii in 1878, having been buried u nder the ashes and lava of Mount Vesuvius since the year 79 A. D. It stood near the Tragic Theater, not far from the Temple of Isis, and by its arrangement, with two co lumns in front and interlaced triangles on the walls, was identified as an ancient lodge ro om. Upon a pedestal in the room was found a rare bit of art, unique in design and exqui site in execution, now in the National Museum at Naples. It is described by S. R. Forbes, in his Rambles in -aples , as follows: It is a mosaic table of square shape, fixed in a st rong wooden frame. The ground is of grey green stone, in the middle of which is a human skull, mad e of white, grey, and black colors. In appearance the skull is quite natural. The eyes, no strils, teeth, ears, and coronal are all well executed. Above the skull is a level of colored woo d, the points being of brass; and from the top to the point, by a white thread, is suspended a plumb- line. Below p. 84 the skull is a wheel of six spokes, and on the upper rim of the wheel there is a butterfly with wings of red, edged with yellow; its eyes blue. . . On the left is an uprigh t spear, resting on the ground; from this there hangs, attached to a golden cord, a garment of scar let, also a purple robe; whilst the upper part of the spear is surrounded by a white braid of diamond pattern. To the right is a gnarled thorn stick, from which hangs a coarse, shaggy piece of cloth in yellow, grey, and brown colors, tied with a ribbon; and above it is a leather knapsack. . . Evi dently this work of art, by its composition, is mystical and symbolical. No doubt; and for those who know the meaning of the se emblems there is a feeling of kinship with those men, long since fallen into dust , who gathered about such an altar. They wrought out in this work of art their vision o f the old-worn pilgrim way of life, with its vicissitude and care, the level of mortality to which all are brought at last by death, and the winged, fluttering hope of man. Always a jo urney with its horny staff and wallet, life is sometimes a battle needing a spear, but for him who walks uprightly by the plumb- line of rectitude, there is a true and victorious h ope at the end. Of wounds and sore defeat I made my battle stay, Winged sandals for my feet I wove of my delay. p. 85 Of weariness and fear I made a shouting spear, Of loss and doubt and dread And swift on-coming doom I made a helmet for my head, And a waving plume. III Christianity, whose Founder was a Carpenter, made a mighty appeal to the working classes of Rome. As Deissmann and Harnack have show n, the secret of its expansion in the early years was that it came down to the man in the street with its message of hope and joy. Its appeal was hardly heard in high places , but it was welcomed by the men who were weary and heavy ladened. Among the Collegia it made rapid progress, its Saints"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"taking the place of pagan deities as patrons, and i ts spirit of love welding men into closer, truer union. When Diocletian determined to destroy Christianity, he was strangely lenient and patient with the Collegia, so many of whose mem bers were of that faith. Not until they refused to make a statue of Æsculapius did he vow vengeance and turn on them, venting his fury. In the persecution that followed four Master Masons and one humble apprentice suffered cruel torture and death, but th ey became the p. 86 [paragraph continues] Four Crowned Martyrs, the story of whose heroic fi delity unto death haunted the legends of later times. 1 They were the patron saints alike of Lombard and Tuscan builders, and, later, of the working Masons of the Middle Ages, as witness the poem in their praise in the oldest record of the Cr aft, the Regius MS . With the breaking up of the College of Architects a nd their expulsion from Rome, we come upon a period in which it is hard to follow th eir path. Happily the task has been made less baffling by recent research, and if we ar e unable to trace them all the way much light has been let into the darkness. Hitherto there has been a hiatus also in the history of architecture between the classic art of Rome, which is said to have died when the Empire fell to p. 87 pieces, and the rise of Gothic art. Just so, in the story of the builders one finds a gap of like length, between the Collegia of Rome and the c athedral artists. While the gap cannot, as yet, be perfectly bridged, much has been done to that end by Leader Scott in The Cathedral Builders: The Story of a Great Masonic Gu ild --a book itself a work of art as well as of fine scholarship. Her thesis is that the missing link is to be found in the Magistri Comacini, a guild of architects who, on th e break-up of the Roman Empire, fled to Comacina, a fortified island in Lake Como, and t here kept alive the traditions of classic art during the Dark Ages; that from them we re developed in direct descent the various styles of Italian architecture; and that, f inally, they carried the knowledge and practice of architecture and sculpture into France, Spain, Germany, and England. Such a thesis is difficult, and, from its nature, not susc eptible of absolute proof, but the writer makes it as certain as anything can well be. While she does not positively affirm that the Comac ine Masters were the veritable stock from which the Freemasonry of the present day spran g, \"we may admit,\" she says, \"that they were the link between the classic Collegia and all other art and trade Guilds of the Middle Ages. They were Free-masons because they were builders of a privileged p. 88 class, absolved from taxes and servitude, and free to travel about in times of feudal bondage .\" The name Free-mason-- Libera muratori --may not actually have been used thus early, but the Comacines were in fact free builders long before the name was employed --free to travel from place to place, as we see fro m their migrations; free to fix"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"their own prices, while other workmen were bound to feudal lords, or by the Statutes of Wages. The author quotes in the original Latin an E dict of the Lombard King Rotharis, dated November 22, 643, in which certain privileges are confirmed to the Magistri Comacini and their colligantes . From this Edict it is clear that it is no new ord er that is alluded to, but an old and powerful body of Masters capable of acting as architects, with men who executed work under them. For the Comacines were not ordinary workmen, but artists, including architects, sculptors, painters, and decorators, and if affinities of style left in stone be adequate evidence, to them were du e the changing forms of architecture in Europe during the cathedral-building period. Everyw here they left their distinctive impress in a way so unmistakable as to leave no dou bt. Under Charlemagne the Comacines began their many mi grations, and we find them following the missionaries of the church into remot e places, from p. 89 [paragraph continues] Sicily to Britain, building churches. When Augusti ne went to convert the British, the Comacines followed to provide shrines, and Bede, as early as 674, in mentioning that builders were sent for from Gaul to build the church at Wearmouth, uses phrases and words found in the Edict of King Rothar is. For a long time the changes in style of architecture, appearing simultaneously eve rywhere over Europe, from Italy to England, puzzled students. 1 Further knowledge of this powerful and widespread order explains it. It also accounts for the fact that no individual architect can be named as the designer of any of the great cathedrals. Those cath edrals were the work, not of individual artists, but of an order who planned, built, and ad orned them. In 1355 the painters of Siena seceded, as the German Masons did later, and the names of individual artists who worked for fame and glory begin to appear; but up t o that time the Order was supreme. Artists from Greece and Asia Minor, driven from the ir homes, took refuge with the Comacines, and Leader Scott finds in this order a p ossible link, by tradition at least, with the temple of Solomon. At any rate, all through the Dark Ages the name and fame of the Hebrew king lived in the minds of the builders. An inscribed stone, dating from 712, shows that p. 90 the Comacine Guild was organized as Magistri and Discipuli , under a Gastaldo , or Grand Master, the very same terms as were kept in the lod ges later. Moreover, they called their meeting places loggia, a long list of which the aut hor recites from the records of various cities, giving names of officers, and, often, of me mbers. They, too, had their masters and wardens, their oaths, tokens, grips, and passwords which formed a bond of union stronger than legal ties. They wore white aprons and gloves, and revered the Four Crowned Martyrs of the Order. Square, compasses, level, plu mb-line, and arch appear among their emblems. \"King Solomon's Knot\" was one of their sym bols, and the endless, interwoven cord, symbol of Eternity which has neither beginnin g nor end, was another. Later, however, the Lion's Paw seems to have become their chief emblem. From illustrations"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"given by the author they are shown in their regalia , with apron and emblems, clad as the keepers of a great art and teaching of which they w ere masters. Here, of a truth, is something more than prophecy, and those who have any regard for facts will not again speak lightly of an order havi ng such ancestors as the great Comacine Masters. Had Fergusson known their story, he would not have paused in his History of Architecture to belittle the Free-masons p. 91 as incapable of designing a cathedral, while puzzli ng the while as to who did draw the plans for those dreams of beauty and prayer. Hereaf ter, if any one asks to know who uplifted those massive piles in which was portrayed the great drama of mediaeval worship, he need not remain uncertain. With the dec line of Gothic architecture the order of Free-masons also suffered decline, as we shall s ee, but did not cease to exist-- continuing its symbolic tradition amidst varying, a nd often sad, vicissitude until 1717, when it became a fraternity teaching spiritual fait h by allegory and moral science by symbols.

They were a secret society having signs and words to distinguish their members (Robertson's Greece ), and used emblems taken from the art of building (Eusebius, de Prep. Evang . iii, c. 12). They entered Asia Minor and Phoenici a fifty years before the temple of Solomon was built, and Strabo traces them on into Syria, Persia, and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"India. Surely here are facts not to be swept aside as romance because, forsooth, they do not fit certain theories. Moreover, they explain ma ny things, as we shall see. 77:1 Rabbinic legend has it that all the workmen on the temple were killed, so that they should not build another temple devoted to idolatry ( Jewish Encyclopedia , article \"Freemasonry\"). Other legends equally absurd cluste r about the temple and its building, none of which is to be taken literally. As a fact, Hiram the architect, or rather artificer in metals, did not lose his life, but, as Josephus tel ls us, lived to good age and died at Tyre. What the legend is trying to tell us, however, is t hat at the building of the temple the Mysteries mingled with Hebrew faith, each .mutually influencing the other. 78:1 Strangely enough, there is a sect or tribe called the Druses, now inhabiting the Lebanon district, who claim to be not only the desc endants of the Phoenicians, but the builders of King Solomon's temple . So persistent and important among them is this tradition that their religion is built about it--if indeed it be not something more than a legend. They have Khalwehs, or temples, built after the fashion of lodges, with three degrees of initiation, and, though an agricultural folk, they use signs and tools of building as emblems of moral truth. They have signs, grips, and passwords for recognition. In the words of their lawgiver, Hamze, their creed reads: \"The belief in the Truth of One God shall take the place of Prayer; the exercise of bro therly love shall take the place of Fasting; and the daily practice of acts of Charity shall take the place of Alms-giving.\" Why such a people, having such a tradition? Where d id they get it? What may this fact set in the fixed and changeless East mean? (See the essay of Hackett Smith on \"The Druses and Their Relation to Freemasonry,\" and the discussion following, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum , iv. 7-19.) 78:2 Rawlinson, in his History of Phoenicia , says the people \"had for ages possessed the mason's art, it having been brought in very early d ays from Egypt.\" Sir C.

Later their bodies were brought from Rome to Toulou se where they were placed in a chapel erected in their honor in the church of St. Sernin ( Martyrology , by Du Saussay).

In a fresco on the walls of the church of St. Lawrence at Rotterdam, partially preserved, they are painted with compasses and trow el in hand.

The fresco dates from 1641, and was painted by F. Wounters ( A. Q. C. , xii, 202). Even so, those humble workmen, faithfu l to their faith, became saints of the church, and re ign with Solomon!

I do. not wish to pry into the mysteries of the craft; but it would be interesting to know more of their history during the period when they were literally architects. They ar e charged by an act of Parliament with fixing the price of their labor in their annual cha pters, contrary to the statute of laborers, and such chapters were consequently prohibited. Thi s is their first persecution; they have since undergone others, and are perhaps reserved fo r still more. It is remarkable, that Masons were never legally incorporated, like other traders; their bond of union being stronger than any charter . --HENRY HALLAM, The Middle Ages . p. 97 CHAPTER I Free-Masons I FROM the foregoing pages it must be evident that Ma sonry, as we find it in the Middle Ages, was not a novelty. Already, if we accept its own records, it was hoary with age, having come down from a far past, bringing with it a remarkable deposit of legendary lore. Also, it had in its keeping the same simple, eloquent emblems which, as we have seen, are older than the oldest living religion, wh ich it received as an inheritance and has transmitted as a treasure. Whatever we may think of the legends of Masonry, as recited in its oldest documents, its symbols, older than the o rder itself, link it with the earliest thought and faith of the race. No doubt those emble ms lost some of their luster in the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"troublous time of transition we are about to traver se, but their beauty never wholly faded, and they had only to be touched to shine. If not the actual successors of the Roman College o f Architects, the great order of Comacine Masters was founded upon its ruins, and co ntinued its tradition p. 98 both of symbolism and of art. Returning to Rome after the death of D iocletian, we find them busy there under Constantine and Theodosius; a nd from remains recently brought to knowledge it is plain that their style of building at that time was very like that of the churches built at Hexham and York in England, and t hose of the Ravenna, also nearly contemporary. They may not have been actually calle d Free-masons as early as Leader Scott insists they were, 1 but they were free in fact, traveling far and near where there was work to do, following the missionaries of the Churc h as far as England. When there was need for the name Free-masons, it was easily sugges ted by the fact that the cathedral- builders were quite distinct from the Guild-masons, the one being a universal order whereas the other was local and restricted. Older t han Guild-masonry, the order of the cathedral-builders was more powerful, more artistic , and, it may be added, more religious; and it is from this order that the Mason ry of today is descended. Since the story of the Comacine Masters has come to light, no doubt any longer remains that during the building period the order of Masons was at the height of its influence and power. At that time the building art stood above al l other arts, and made the other arts bow to it, commanding the services of the p. 99 most brilliant intellects and of the greatest artis ts of the age. Moreover, its symbols were wrought into stone long before they were written on parchment, if indeed they were ever recorded at all. Efforts have been made to rob thos e old masters of their honor as the designers of the cathedrals, but it is in vain. 1 Their monuments are enduring and still tell the story of their genius and art. High upon the ca thedrals they left cartoons in stone, of which Findel gives a list, 2 portraying with searching p. 100 satire abuses current in the Church. Such figures a nd devices would not have been tolerated but for the strength of the order, and no t even then had the Church known what they meant to the adepts. History, like a mirage, lifts only a part of the pa st into view, leaving much that we should like to know in oblivion. At this distance the Midd le Ages wear an aspect of smooth uniformity of faith and opinion, but that is only o ne of the many illusions of time by which we are deceived. What looks like uniformity w as only conformity, and underneath its surface there was almost as much variety of tho ught as there is today, albeit not so freely expressed. Science itself, as well as religi ous ideas deemed heretical, sought"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"seclusion; but the human mind was alive and active none the less, and a great secret Order like Masonry, enjoying the protection of the Church, yet independent of it, invited freedom of thought and faith. 1 The Masons, by the very nature of their art, came into contact with all classes of men, and they had oppor tunities to know the defects p. 101 of the Church. Far ahead of the masses and most of the clergy in education, in their travels to and fro, not only in Europe, but often e xtending to the far East, they became familiar with widely-differing religious views. The y had learned to practice toleration, and their Lodges became a sure refuge for those who were persecuted for the sake of opinion by bigoted fanaticism. While, as an order, the Comacine Masters served the Church as builders, the creed required for admission to their fraternity was neve r narrow, and, as we shall see, it became every year broader. Unless this fact be kept in mind, the influence of the Church upon Masonry, which no one seeks to minify, may eas ily be exaggerated. Not until cathedral building began to decline by reason of th e impoverishment of the nations by long wars, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the advent of Puritanism, did the Church greatly influence the order; and not even th en to the extent of diverting it from its original and unique mission. Other influences were at work betimes, such as the persecution of the Knights Templars and the tragic martyrdom of De Molai, making themselves felt, 1 and Masonry began to be suspected of harboring her esy. So tangled were the p. 102 tendencies of that period that they are not easily followed, but the fact emerges that Masonry rapidly broadened until its final break wit h the Church. Hardly more than a veneer, by the time of the German Reformation almos t every vestige of the impress of the Church had vanished never to return. Critics of the order have been at pains to trace this tendency, not knowing, apparently, that by so doing they only make more emphatic the chief glory of Masonry. II Unfortunately, as so often happens, no records of o ld Craft-masonry, save those wrought into stone, were made until the movement had begun to decline; and for that reason such documents as have come down to us do not show it at its best. Nevertheless, they range over a period of more than four centuries, and are justly held to be the title deeds of the Order. Turning to these Old Charges p. 103 and Constitutions , 1 as they are called, we find a body of quaint and c urious writing, both in poetry and prose, describing the Masonry of the late cathedral-building period, with glimpses at least of greater days of old. Of these, there are more than half a hundred--"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"seventy-eight, to be exact--most of which have come to light since 1860, and all of them, it would seem, copies of documents still older. Nat urally they have suffered at the hands of unskilled or unlearned copyists, as is evident f rom errors, embellishments, and interpolations. They were called Old Charges because they contained certain rules as to conduct and duties which, in a bygone time, were re ad or recited to a newly admitted member of the craft. While they differ somewhat in details, they relate substantially the same legend as to the origin of the order, its earl y history, its laws and regulations, usually beginning with an invocation and ending wit h an Amen. p. 104 Only a brief account need here be given of the date s and characteristics of these documents, of the two oldest especially, with a dig est of what they have to tell us, first, of the Legend of the order; second, its early History; and third, its Moral teaching, its workings, and the duties of its members. The first and oldest of the records is known as the Regius MS which, owing to an error of David Casley who in hi s catalogue of the MSS in the King's Library marked it A Poem of Moral Duties , was overlooked until James Halliwell discovered its real nature in 1839. Altho ugh not a Mason, Halliwell was attracted by the MS and read an essay on its conten ts before the Society of Antiquarians, after which he issued two editions bearing date of 1840 and 1844. Experts give it date back to 1390, that is to say, fifteen years after t he first recorded use of the name Free - mason in the history of the Company of Masons of th e City of London, in 1375. 1 More poetical in spirit than in form, the old manus cript begins by telling of the number of unemployed in early days and the necessity of findi ng p. 105 work, \"that they myght gete there lyvyngs therby.\" Euclid was consulted, and recommended the \"onest craft of good masonry,\" and the origin of the order is found \"yn Egypte lande.\" Then, by a quick shift, we are lande d in England \"yn tyme of good Kinge Adelstonus day,\" who is said to have called an asse mbly of Masons, when fifteen articles and as many points were agreed upon as rules of the craft, each point being duly described. The rules resemble the Ten Commandments in an extended form, closing with the legend of the Four Crowned Martyrs, as an incen tive to fidelity. Then the writer takes up again the question of origins, going back this t ime to the days of Noah and the Flood, mentioning the tower of Babylon and the great skill of Euclid, who is said to have commenced \"the syens seven.\" The seven sciences are then named, to-wit, Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Music, Astronomy, Arithmetic, Geom etry, and each explained. Rich reward is held out to those who use the seven scien ces aright, and the MS proper closes with the benediction: Amen! Amen! so mote it be! So say we all for Charity.

T hese lines were in great part extracted from Instructions for Parish Priests, by Mirk, a ma nual in use at the time. The whole poem, if so it may be called, is imbued with the sp irit of freedom, of gladness, of social good will; so much so, that both Gould and Albert P ike think it points to the existence of symbolic Masonry at the date from which it speaks, and may have been recited or sung by some club commemorating the science, but not pra cticing the art, of Masonry. They would find intimation of the independent existence of speculative Masonry thus early, in a society from whom all but the memory or tradition of its ancient craft had departed. One hesitates to differ with writers so able and di stinguished, yet this inference seems far-fetched, if not forced. Of the existence of sym bolic Masonry at that time there is no doubt, but of its independent existence it is not e asy to find even a hint in this old poem. Nor would the poem be suitable for a mere social, o r even a symbolic guild, whereas the spirit of genial, joyous comradeship which breathes through it is of the very essence of Masonry, and has ever been present when Masons meet . Next in order of age is the Cooke MS , dating from the early part of the fifteenth centu ry, and first published in 1861. If we apply the laws o f higher-criticism p. 107 to this old document a number of things appear, as obvious as they are interesting. Not only is it a copy of an older record, like all the MSS we have, but it is either an effort to join two documents together, or else the first part must be regarded as a long preamble to the manuscript which forms the second part. For the two are quite unlike in method and style, the first being diffuse, with copious quotat ions and references to authorities, 1 while the second is simple, direct, unadorned, and does n ot even allude to the Bible. Also, it is evident that the compiler, himself a Mason, is tryi ng to harmonize two traditions as to the origin of the order, one tracing it through Egypt a nd the other through the Hebrews; and it is hard to tell which tradition he favors most. Hen ce a duplication of the traditional history, and an odd mixture of names and dates, oft en, indeed, absurd, as when he makes Euclid a pupil of Abraham. What is clear is that, h aving found an old Constitution of the Craft, he thought to write a kind of commentary upo n it, adding proofs and illustrations of his own, though he did not manage his materials very successfully. p. 108 After his invocation, 1 the writer begins with a list of the Seven Science s, giving quaint definitions of each, but in a different order from that recited in the Regius Poem ; and he exalts Geometry above all the rest as \"the first ca use and foundation of all crafts and sciences.\" Then follows a brief sketch of the sons of Lamech, much as we find it in the book of Genesis which, like the old MS we are here studying, was compiled from two"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"older records: the one tracing the descent from Cai n, and the other from Seth. Jabal and Jubal, we are told, inscribed their knowledge of sc ience and handicraft on two pillars, one of marble, the other of lateres; and after the floo d one of the pillars was found by Hermes, and the other by Pythagoras, who taught the science s they found written thereon. Other MSS give Euclid the part here assigned to Hermes. S urely this is all fantastic enough, but the blending of the names of Hermes, the \"father of Wisdom,\" who is so supreme a figure in the Egyptian Mysteries, and Pythagoras who used numbers as spiritual emblems, with old Hebrew history, is significant. At p. 109 any rate, by this route the record reaches Egypt wh ere, like the Regius Poem , it locates the origin of Masonry. In thus ascribing the origin of Geometry to the Egyptians the writer was but following a tradition that the Egypt ians were compelled to invent it in order to restore the landmarks effaced by the inund ations of the Nile; a tradition confirmed by modern research. Proceeding , the compiler tells us that during their sojourn i n Egypt the Hebrews learned the art and secrets of Masonry, which they took wit h them to the promised land. Long years are rapidly sketched, and we come to the days of David, who is said to have loved Masons well, and to have given them \"wages nearly a s they are now.\" There is but a meager reference to the building of the Temple of S olomon, to which is added: \"In other chronicles and old books of Masonry, it is said tha t Solomon confirmed the charges that David had given to Masons; and that Solomon taught them their usages differing but slightly from the customs now in use.\" While allusi on is made to the master-artist of the temple, his name is not mentioned, except in disguise . Not one of the Old Charges of the order ever makes use of his name, but always employ s some device whereby to conceal it. 1 Why so, when the p. 110 name was well known, written in the Bible which lay upon the altar for all to read? Why such reluctance, if it be not that the name and the legend linked with it had an esoteric meaning, as it most certainly did have long before it was wrought into a drama? At this point the writer drops the old legend and traces th e Masons into France and England, after the manner of the Regius MS , but with more detail. Having noted these items, h e returns to Euclid and brings that phase of the trad ition up to the advent of the order into England, adding, in conclusion, the articles of Mas onic law agreed upon at an early assembly, of which he names nine, instead of the fi fteen recited in the Regius Poem . What shall we say of this Legend, with its recurrin g and insistent emphasis upon the antiquity of the order, and its linking of Egypt wi th Israel? For one thing, it explodes the fancy that the idea of the symbolical significance of the building of the Temple of Solomon originated with, or was suggested by, Bacon 's -ew Atlantis . Here is a body of tradition uniting the Egyptian Mysteries with the H ebrew history of the Temple in a manner unmistakable. Wherefore such names as Hermes , Pythagoras,"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"p. 111 and Euclid, and how did they come into the old craf t records if not through the Comacine artists and scholars? With the story of that great order before us, much that has hitherto been obscure becomes plain, and we recognize in the se Old Charges the inaccurate and perhaps faded tradition of a lofty symbolism, an au thentic scholarship, and an actual history. As Leader Scott observes, after reciting t he old legend in its crudest form: The significant point is that all these names and M asonic emblems point to something real which existed in some long-past time, and, as regards the organization and nomenclature, we find the whole thing in its vital and actual working form in the Comacine Guild . 1 Of interest here, as a kind of bridge between old l egend and the early history of the order in England, and also as a different version of the legend itself, is another document dating far back. There was a MS discovered in the Bodleian Library at Oxford about 1696, supposed to have been written in the year 1436, whi ch purports to be an examination of a Mason by King Henry VI, and is allowed by all to be genuine. Its title runs as follows: \" Certain questions with answers to the same concerni ng the mystery of masonry written by King Henry the Sixth and faithfully copied by me , John p. 112 [paragraph continues] Laylande, antiquarian, by command of his highness .\" Written in quaint old English, it would doubtless be unintelligible to al l but antiquarians, but it reads after this fashion: What mote it be?--It is the knowledge of nature, an d the power of its various operations; particularly the skill of reckoning, of weights and measures, of constructing buildings and dwellings of all kinds, and the true manner of form ing all things for the use of man. Where did it begin?--It began with the first men of the East, who were before the first men of the West, and coming with it, it hath brought all comfo rts to the wild and comfortless. Who brought it to the West?--The Phoenicians who, b eing great merchants, came first from the East into Phoenicia, for the convenience of commerc e, both East and West by the Red and Mediterranean Seas. How came it into England?--Pythagoras, a Grecian, t raveled to acquire knowledge in Egypt and Syria, and in every other land where the Phoenician s had planted Masonry; and gaining admittance into all lodges of Masons, he learned mu ch, and returned and dwelt in Grecia Magna, growing and becoming mighty wise and greatly renown ed. Here he formed a great lodge at Crotona, and made many Masons, some of whom travele d into France, and there made many more, from whence, in process of time, the art pass ed into England. III With the conquest of Britain by the Romans, the Collegia , without which no Roman society was complete, p. 113"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"made their advent into the island, traces of their work remaining even to this day. Under the direction of the mother College at Rome, the Br itons are said to have attained to high degree of excellence as builders, so that when the cities of Gaul and the fortresses along the Rhine were destroyed, Chlorus, A. D. 298, sent to Britain for architects to repair or rebuild them. Whether the Collegia existed in Britain after the Romans left, as some affirm, or were suppressed, as we know they were on the Continent when the barbarians overran it, is not clear. Probably they were destro yed, or nearly so, for with the revival of Christianity in 598 A. D., we find Bishop Wilfred o f York joining with the Abbott of Wearmouth in sending to France and Italy to induce Masons to return and build in stone, as he put it, \"after the Roman manner.\" This confir ms the Italian chroniclists who relate that Pope Gregory sent several of the fraternity of Liberi muratori with St. Augustine, as, later, they followed St. Boniface into Germany. Again, in 604, Augustine sent the monk Pietro back to Rome with a letter to the same Pontiff, begging him to send more architects and wo rkmen, which he did. As the Liberi muratori were none other than the Comacine Masters, it seem s certain that they were at work in England long before the period with which the OLD CHARGES begin their p. 114 story of English Masonry . 1 Among those sent by Gregory was Paulinus, and it i s a curious fact that he is spoken of under the title o f Magister , by which is meant, no doubt, that he was a member of the Comacine order, for the y so described their members; and we know that many monks were enrolled in their lodg es, having studied the art of building under their instruction. St. Hugh of Linco ln was not the only Bishop who could plan a church, instruct the workman, or handle a ho d. Only, it must be kept in mind that these ecclesiastics who became skilled in architect ure were taught by the Masons , and that it was not the monks, as some seem to imagine, who taught the Masons their art. Speaking of this early and troublous time, Giuseppe Merzaria says that only one lamp remained alight, making a bright spark in the darkn ess that extended over Europe: It was from the Magistri Comacini . Their respective names are unknown, their individ ual works unspecialized, but the breadth of their spirit migh t be felt all through those centuries, and their name collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all the works of art between p. 115 A. D. 800 and 1000, the greater and better part are due to th at brotherhood--always faithful and often secret-- of the Magistri Comacini . The authority and judgment of learned men justify the assertion. 1 Among the learned men who agree with this judgment are Kugler of Germany, Ramee of France, and Selvatico of Italy, as well as Quatrema l de Quincy, in his Dictionary of Architecture , who, in the article on the Comacine, remarks that \"to these men, who were both designers and executors, architects, sculptors , and mosaicists, may be attributed the renaissance of art, and its propagation in the sout hern countries, where it marched with Christianity. Certain it is that we owe it to them, that the heritage of antique ages was not entirely lost, and it is only by their tradition an d imitation that the art of building was kept alive, producing works which we still admire, and w hich become surprising when we think of the utter ignorance of all science in thos e dark ages.\" The English writer, Hope, goes further and credits the Comacine order with be ing the cradle of the associations of Free-masons, who were, he adds, \"the first after Ro man times to enrich architecture with"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"a complete and well-ordinated system, which dominat ed wherever the Latin Church extended its influence.\" 2 So p. 116 then, even if the early records of old Craft-masonr y in England are confused, and often confusing, we are not left to grope our way from on e dim tradition to another, having the history and monuments of this great order which spans the whole period , and links the fraternity of Free-masons with one of the noblest c hapters in the annals of art. Almost without exception the Old Charges begin their account of Masonry in England at the time of Athelstan, the grandson of Alfred the G reat; that is, between 925 and 940. Of this prince, or knight, they record that he was a w ise and pacific ruler; that \"he brought the land to rest and peace, and built many great bu ildings of castles and abbeys, for he loved Masons well.\" He is also said to have called an assembly of Masons at which laws, rules, and charges were adopted for the regulation of the craft. Despite these specific details, the story of Athelstan and St. Alban is ha rdly more than a legend, albeit dating at no very remote epoch, and well within the reasonabl e limits of tradition. Still, so many difficulties beset it that it has baffled the acute st critics, most of whom throw it aside. 1 That p. 117 is, however, too summary a way of disposing of it, since the record, though badly blurred, is obviously trying to preserve a fact of importanc e to the order. Usually the assembly in question is located at York , in the year 926, of which, however, no slightest record remains. Whether at York or els ewhere, some such assembly must have been convoked, either as a civil function, or as a regular meeting of Masons authorized by legal power for upholding the honor o f the craft; and its articles became the laws of the order. It was probably a civil assembly , a part of whose legislation was a revised and approved code for the regulation of Mas ons, and not unnaturally, by reason of its importance to the order, it became known as a Masonic assembly. Moreover, the Charge agreed upon was evidently no ordinary charge , for it is spoken of as \" the Charge,\" called by one MS \"a deep charge for the observation of such articles as belong to Masonry,\" and by another MS \"a rule to be kept fore ver.\" p. 118 [paragraph continues] Other assemblies were held afterwards, either annu ally or semi-annually, until the time of Inigo Jones who, in 1607, became superintendent general of royal buildings and at the same time head of the Masonic order in England; and he it was who instituted quarterly gatherings instead of the old annual assemblies. Writers not familiar with the facts often speak of Freemasonry as an evolution from Guild-masonry, but that is to err. They were never at any time united or the same, though working almost side by side through several centuri es. Free-masons existed in large"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"numbers long before any city guild of Masons was fo rmed, and even after the Guilds became powerful the two were entirely distinct. The Guilds, as Hallam says, 1 \"were Fraternities by voluntary compact, to relieve each other in poverty, and to protect each other from injury. Two essential p. 119 characteristics belonged to them: the common banque t, and the common purse. They had also, in many instances, a religious and sometimes a secret ceremonial to knit more firmly the bond of fidelity. They readily became co nnected with the exercises of trades, with training of apprentices, and the traditional r ules of art.\" Guild-masons, it may be added, had many privileges, one of which was that t hey were allowed to frame their own laws, and to enforce obedience thereto. Each Guild had a monopoly of the building in its city or town, except ecclesiastical buildings, but with this went serious restrictions and limitations. No member of a local Guild could under take work outside his town, but had to hold himself in readiness to repair the castle o r town walls, whereas Free-masons journeyed the length and breadth of the land wherev er their labor called them. Often the Free-masons, when at work in a town, employed Guild -masons, but only for rough work, and as such called them \"rough-masons.\" No Guild-ma son was admitted to the order of Free-masons unless he displayed unusual aptitude bo th as a workman and as a man of intellect. Such as adhered only to the manual craft p. 120 and cared nothing for intellectual aims, were permi tted to go back to the Guilds. For the Free-masons, be it once more noted, were not only a rtists doing a more difficult and finished kind of work, but an intellectual order, h aving a great tradition of science and symbolism which they guarded. Following the Norman Conquest, which began in 1066, England was invaded by an army of ecclesiastics, and churches, monasteries, cathed rals, and abbeys were commenced in every part of the country. Naturally the Free-mason s were much in demand, and some of them received rich reward for their skill as archit ects--Robertus Cementarius, a Master Mason employed at St. Albans in 1077, receiving a g rant of land and a house in the town. 1 In the reign of Henry II no less than one hundred and fifty-seven religious buildings were founded in England, and it is at thi s period that we begin to see evidence of a new style of architecture--the Gothic. Most of the great cathedrals of Europe date from the eleventh century--the piety of the world h aving been wrought to a pitch of intense excitement by the expected end of all thing s, unaccountably fixed by popular belief to take place in the p. 121 year one thousand. When the fatal year--and the fol lowing one, which some held to be the real date for the sounding of the last trumpet- -passed without the arrival of the dreaded catastrophe, the sense of general relief fo und expression in raising magnificent temples to the glory of God who had mercifully abst ained from delivering all things to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"destruction. And it was the order of Free-masons wh o made it possible for men to \"sing their souls in stone,\" leaving for the admiration o f after times what Goethe called the \"frozen music\" of the Middle Ages--monuments of the faith and gratitude of the race which adorn and consecrate the earth. Little need be added to the story of Freemasonry du ring the cathedral-building period; its monuments are its best history, alike of its genius , its faith, and its symbols--as witness the triangle and the circle which form the keystone of the ornamental tracery of every Gothic temple. Masonry was then at the zenith of it s power, in its full splendor, the Lion of the tribe of Judah its symbol, strength, wisdom, and beauty its ideals; its motto to be faithful to God and the Government; its mission to lend itself to the public good and fraternal charity. Keeper of an ancient and high tr adition, it was a refuge for the oppressed, and a teacher of art and morality to man kind. In 1270, we find p. 122 [paragraph continues] Pope Nicholas III confirming all the rights previo usly granted to the Free- masons, and bestowing on them further privileges. I ndeed, all the Popes up to Benedict XII appear to have conceded marked favors to the or der, even to the length of exempting its members from the necessity of observance of the statutes, from municipal regulations, and from obedience to royal edicts. What wonder, then, that the Free-masons, ere long, took Liberty for their motto, and by so doing aroused the animosity of those in authorit y, as well as the Church which they had so nobly served. Already forces were astir whic h ultimately issued in the Reformation, and it is not surprising that a great secret order was suspected of harboring men and fostering influences sympathetic with the i mpending change felt to be near at hand. As men of the most diverse views, political a nd religious, were in the lodges, the order began first to be accused of refusing to obey the law, and then to be persecuted. In England a statute was enacted against the Free-maso ns in 1356, prohibiting their assemblies under severe penalties, but the law seem s never to have been rigidly enforced; though the order suffered greatly in the civil comm otions of the period. However, with the return of peace after the long War of the Roses , Freemasonry revived p. 123 for a time, and regained much of its prestige, addi ng to its fame in the rebuilding of London after the fire, and in particular of St. Pau l's Cathedral. 1 When cathedral-building ceased, and the demand for highly skilled architects decreased, the order fell into decline, but never at any time lost its identity, its organization, and its ancient emblems. The Masons' Company of London, tho ugh its extant records date only from 1620, is considered by its historian, Conder, to have been established in 1220, if not earlier, at which time there was great activity in building, owing to the building of London Bridge, begun in 1176, and of Westminster Ab bey in 1221; thus reaching back into the cathedral period. At one time the Free-mas ons seem to have been stronger in Scotland than in England, or at all events to have left behind more records--for the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"minutes of the Lodge of Edinburgh go back to 1599, and the Schaw Statutes to an earlier date. p. 124 [paragraph continues] Nevertheless, as the art of architecture declined Masonry declined with it, not a few of its members identifying themselves wit h the Guilds of ordinary \"rough- masons,\" whom they formerly held in contempt; while others, losing sight of high aims, turned its lodges into social clubs. Always, howeve r, despite defection and decline, there were those, as we shall see, who were faithful to t he ideals of the order, devoting themselves more and more to its moral and spiritual teaching until what has come to be known as \"the revival of 1717.\" Footnotes 98:1 The Cathedral Builders , chap. i. 99:1 \"The honor due to the original founders of these e difices is almost invariably transferred to the ecclesiastics under whose patron age they rose, rather than to the skill and design of the Master Mason, or professional arc hitect, because the only historians were monks. . .

In the St. Sebaldus Church, Nuremburg, is a carvi ng in stone showing a nun in the embrace of a monk. In Strassbu rg a hog and a goat may be seen carrying a sleeping fox as a sacred relic, in advan ce a bear with a cross and a wolf with a taper. An ass is reading mass at an altar. In Wurzb urg Cathedral are the pillars of Boaz and Jachin, and in the altar of the Church of Dober an, in Mecklenburg, placed as Masons use them, and a most significant scene in which pri ests are turning a mill grinding out dogmatic doctrines; and at the bottom the Lord's Su pper in which the Apostles are shown in well-known Masonic attitudes. In the Cathedral o f Brandenburg a fox in priestly robes is preaching to a flock of geese; and in the Minste r at Berne the Pope is placed among those who are lost in perdition. These were bold st rokes which even heretics hardly dared to indulge in. 100:1 History of Masonry , by Steinbrenner, chap. iv. There were, Indeed, ma ny secret societies in the Middle Ages, such as the Catharist s, Albigenses, Waldenses, and others, whose initiates and adherents traveled through all Europe, forming new communities and making proselytes not only among the masses, but al so among nobles, and even among the monks, abbots, and bishops. Occultists, Alchemi sts, Kabbalists, all wrought in secrecy, keeping their flame aglow under the crust of conformity."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"101:1 Realities of Masonry , by Blake (chap. ii). While the theory of the desc ent of Masonry from the Order of the Temple is untenable, a connection between the two societies, in the sense in which p. 102 an artist may be said to be connected with his employer, is more than probable; and a similarity m ay be traced between the ritual of reception in the Order of the Temple and that used by Masons, but that of the Temple was probably derived from, or suggested by, that of the Masons; or both may have come from an original source further back. That the Order of the Temple, as such, did not actually coalesce with the Masons seems clear, but many of i ts members sought refuge under the Masonic apron ( History of Free-masonry and Concordant Orders , by Hughan and Stillson). 103:1 Every elaborate History of Masonry--as, for exampl e, that of Gould--reproduces these old documents in full or in digest, with exha ustive analyses of and commentaries upon them. Such a task obviously does not come with in the scope of the present study. One of the best brief comparative studies of the Old Charges is an essay by W. H. Upton, \"The True Text of the Book of Constitutions ,\" in that it applies approved methods of historical criticism to all of them ( A. Q. C. , vii, 119).

Also exhaustive essays by Conder and Speth, A. Q. C. , ix, 29; x, 10. Too much, it seems to me, has been made of both the name and the date, since the fact was olde r than either. Findel finds the name Free -mason as early as 1212, and Leader Scott goes stil l further back; but the fact may be traced back to the Roman Collegia. 107:1 He refers to Herodotus as the Master of History; q uotes from the Polychronicon , written by a Benedictine monk who died in 1360; fro m De Imagine Mundi , Isodorus, and frequently from the Bible. Of more than ordinary le arning for his day and station, he did not escape a certain air of pedantry in his use of authorities. 108:1 These invocations vary in their phraseology, some bearing more visibly than others the mark of the Church. Toulmin Smith, in his Engli sh Guilds, notes the fact that the form of the invocations of the Masons \"differs stri kingly from that of most other Guilds. In almost every other case, God the Father Almighty would seem to have been forgotten.\" But Masons never forgot the corner-ston e upon which their order and its teachings rest; not for a day. 109:1 Such names as Aynone, Aymon, Ajuon, Dynon, Amon, A non, Annon, and Benaim are used, deliberately, it would seem, and of p. 110 set design.

For the other side see a \"Critical Examination of the Alban and Athelstan Legends,\" by C. C. Howard ( A. Q. C. , vii, 73). Meanwhile, Upton p. 117 points out that St. Alban was the name of a town, not of a man, and sho ws how the error may have crept into the record ( A. Q. C. , vii, 119-131). The nature of the tradition, its d etails, its motive, and the absence of any reason for fiction, should d eter us from rejecting it. See two able articles, pro and con, by Begemann and Speth, entit led \"The Assembly\" ( A. Q. C. , vii). Older Masonic writers, like Oliver and Mackey, acce pted the York assembly as a fact established ( American Quarterly Review of Freemasonry , vol. i, 546; ii, 245). 118:1 History of the English Constitution . Of course the Guild was indigenous to almost every age and land, from China to ancient Rome ( The Guilds of China , by H. B. Morse), and they survive in the trade and labor unions of o ur day. The story of English Guilds has been told by Toulmin Smith, and in the histories of particular companies by Herbert and Hazlitt, leaving little for any one to add. No doub t the Guilds were influenced by the Free-masons in respect of officers and emblems, and we know that some of them, like the German Steinmetzen, attached moral meanings to thei r working tools, and that others, like the French Companionage, even held the legend of Hiram; but these did not make them Free-masons. English writers like Speth go too far when they deny to p. 119 the Steinmetzen any esoteric lore, and German scholars like Krause and Findel are equally at fault in insisting that they were Free-masons.

Such a study is at once easy and difficult by turns, owing to the mass of material, and to the further fact that in the nature of thing s much of the work of a secret order is not, and has never been, matter for record. By this necessity, not a little must remain obscure, but it is hoped that even those not of the order may derive a definite notion of the principles and practices of the old Craft-mason ry, from which the Masonry of today is descended. At least, such a sketch will show that, from times of old, the order of Masons has been a teacher of morality, charity, and truth, unique in its genius, noble in its spirit, and benign in its influence. Taking its ethical teaching first, we have only to turn to the Old Charges or Constitutions of the p. 128"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"order, with their quaint blending of high truth and homely craft-law, to find the moral basis of universal Masonry. These old documents wer e a part of the earliest ritual of the order, and were recited or read to every young man at the time of his initiation as an Entered Apprentice. As such, they rehearsed the leg ends, laws, and ethics of the craft for his information, and, as we have seen, they insiste d upon the antiquity of the order, as well as its service to mankind--a fact peculiar to Masonry, for no other order has ever claimed such a legendary or traditional history . Having studied that legendary record and its value as history, it remains to examine the mor al code laid before the candidate who, having taken a solemn oath of loyalty and secrecy, was instructed in his duties as an Apprentice and his conduct as a man. What that old code lacked in subtlety is more than made up in simplicity, and it might all be stated i n the words of the Prophet: \"To do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before Go d,\"--the old eternal moral law, founded in faith, tried by time, and approved as va lid for men of every clime, creed, and condition. Turning to the Regius MS , we find fifteen \"points\" or rules set forth for t he guidance of Fellowcrafts, and as many for the rule of Master Ma sons. 1 Later the number was reduced to nine, p. 129 but so far from being an abridgment, it was in fact an elaboration of the original code; and by the time we reach the Roberts and Watson MSS a similar set of requirements for Apprentices had been adopted--or rather recorded, f or they had been in use long before. It will make for clearness if we reverse the order and take the Apprentice charge first, as it shows what manner of men were admitted to the order . No man was made a Mason save by his own free choice, and he had to prove himself a freeman of lawful age, of legitimate birth, of sound body, of clean habits, a nd of good repute, else he was not eligible. Also, he had to bind himself by solemn oa th to serve under rigid rules for a period of seven years, vowing absolute obedience--f or the old-time Lodge was a school in which young p. 130 men studied, not only the art of building and its s ymbolism, but the seven sciences as well. At first the Apprentice was little more than a servant, doing the most menial work, his period of endenture being at once a test of his character and a training for his work. If he proved himself trustworthy and proficient, his w ages were increased, albeit his rules of conduct were never relaxed. How austere the discipl ine was may be seen from a summary of its rules: Confessing faith in God, an Apprentice vowed to hon or the Church, the State, and the Master under whom he served, agreeing not to absent himself from the service of the order, by day or night, save with the license of th e Master. He must be honest, truthful, upright, faithful in keeping the secrets of the cra ft, or the confidence of the Master, or of any Free-mason, when communicated to him as such. A bove all he must be chaste, never committing adultery or fornication, and he must not marry, or contract himself to any"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"woman, during his apprenticeship. He must be obedie nt to the Master without argument or murmuring, respectful to all Free-masons, courte ous, avoiding obscene or uncivil speech, free from slander, dissension, or dispute. He must not haunt or frequent any tavern or ale-house, or so much as go into them exc ept it be upon p. 131 an errand of the Master or with his consent, using neither cards, dice, nor any unlawful game, \"Christmas time excepted.\" He must not steal anything even to the value of a penny, or suffer it to be done, or shield anyone gu ilty of theft, but report the fact to the Master with all speed. After seven long years the Apprentice brought his m asterpiece to the Lodge--or, in earlier times, to the annual Assembly 1 --and on strict trial and due examination was decla red a Master. Thereupon he ceased to be a pupil and serva nt, passed into the yanks of F'ellowcrafts, and became a free man capable, for t he first time in his life, of earning his living and choosing his own employer. Having select ed a Mark 2 by which his work could be identified, p. 132 he could then take his kit of tools and travel as a Master of his art, receiving the wages of a Master--not, however, without first reaffirming h is vows of honesty, truthfulness, fidelity, temperance, and chastity, and assuming ad ded obligations to uphold the honor of the order. Again he was sworn not to lay bare, nor to tell to any man what he heard or saw done in the Lodge, and to keep the secrets of a fellow Mason as inviolably as his own--unless such a secret imperiled the good name o f the craft. He furthermore promised to act as mediator between his Master and his Fello ws, and to deal justly with both parties. If he saw a Fellow hewing a stone which he was in a fair way to spoil, he must help him without loss of time, if able to do so, th at the whole work be not ruined. Or if he met a fellow Mason in distress, or sorrow, he must aid him so far as lay within his power. In short, he must live in justice and honor with al l men, especially with the members of the order, \"that the bond of mutual charity and lov e may augment and continue.\" Still more binding, if possible, were the vows of a Fellowcraft when he was elevated to the dignity of Master of the Lodge or of the Work. Once p. 133 more he took solemn oath to keep the secrets of the order unprofaned, and more than one old MS quotes the Golden Rule as the law of the Mas ter's office. He must be steadfast, trusty, and true; pay his Fellows truly; take no br ibe; and as a judge stand upright. He must attend the annual Assembly, unless disabled by illness, if within fifty miles--the distance varying, however, in different MSS. He mus t be careful in admitting Apprentices, taking only such as are fit both physi cally and morally, and keeping none without assurance that he would stay seven years in order to learn his craft. He must be patient with his pupils, instruct them diligently, encourage them with increased pay, and"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"not permit them to work at night, \"unless in the pu rsuit of knowledge, which shall be a sufficient excuse.\" He must be wise and discreet, a nd undertake no work he cannot both perform and complete equally to the profit of his e mployer and the craft. Should a Fellow be overtaken by error, he must be gentle, skilful, and forgiving, seeking rather to help than to hurt, abjuring scandal and bitter words. He must not attempt to supplant a Master of the Lodge or of the Work, or belittle his work, but recommend it and assist him in improving it. He must be liberal in charity to thos e in need, helping a Fellow who has fallen upon evil lot, giving him work and p. 134 wages for at least a fortnight, or if he has no wor k, \"relieve him with money to defray his reasonable charges to the next Lodge.\" For the rest , he must in all ways act in a manner befitting the nobility of his office and his order. Such were some of the laws of the moral life by whi ch the old Craft-masonry sought to train its members, not only to be good workmen, but to be good and true men, serving their Fellows; to which, as the Rawlinson MS tells us, \"divers new articles have been added by the free choice and good consent and best advice of the Perfect and True Masons, Masters, and Brethren.\" If, as an ethic of life, these laws seem simple and rudimentary, they are none the less fundamental, an d they remain to this day the only gate and way by which those must enter who would go up to the House of the Lord. As such they are great and saving things to lay to hea rt and act upon, and if Masonry taught nothing else its title to the respect of mankind wo uld be clear. They have a double aspect: first, the building of a spiritual man upon immutab le moral foundations; and second, the great and simple religious faith in the Fatherhood of God, the Brotherhood of man, and the Life Eternal, taught by Masonry from its earlie st history to this good day. Morality and theistic religion--upon these two rocks Masonry p. 135 has always stood, and they are the only basis upon which man may ever hope to rear the spiritual edifice of his life, even to the capstone thereof. II Imagine, now, a band of these builders, bound toget her by solemn vows and mutual interests, journeying over the most abominable road s toward the site selected for an abbey or cathedral. Traveling was attended with man y dangers, and the company was therefore always well armed, the disturbed state of the country rendering such a precaution necessary. Tools and provisions belongin g to the party were carried on pack- horses or mules, placed in the center of the convoy , in charge of keepers. The company consisted of a Master Mason directing the work, Fel lows of the craft, and Apprentices serving their time. Besides these we find subordina te laborers, not of the Lodge though in it, termed layers, setters, tilers, and so forth. M asters and Fellows wore a distinctive costume, which remained almost unchanged in its fas hion for no less than three centuries. 1 Withal, it was a serious"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"p. 136 company, but in nowise solemn, and the tedium of th e journey was no doubt beguiled by song, story, and the humor incident to travel. \"Wherever they came,\" writes Mr. Hope in his Essay on Architecture , \"in the suite of missionaries, or were called by the natives, or arr ived of their own accord, to seek employment, they appeared headed by a chief surveyo r, who governed the whole troop, and named one man out of every ten, under the name of warden, to overlook the other nine, set themselves to building temporary huts for their habitation around the spot where the work was to be carried on, regularly organized their different departments, fell to work, sent for fresh supplies of their brethren as the object demanded, and, when all was finished, again they raised their encampment, and w ent elsewhere to undertake other work.\" Here we have a glimpse of the methods of the Free-m asons, of their organization, almost military in its order and dispatch, and of their mi gratory life; although they had a more settled life than this ungainly sentence allows, fo r long time was required p. 137 for the building of a great cathedral. Sometimes, i t would seem, they made special contracts with the inhabitants of a town where they were to erect a church, containing such stipulations as, that a Lodge covered with til es should be built for their accommodation, and that every laborer should be pro vided with a white apron of a peculiar kind of leather and gloves to shield the h ands from stone and slime. 1 At all events, the picture we have is that of a little com munity or village of workmen, living in rude dwellings, with a Lodge room at the center adj oining a slowly rising cathedral--the Master busy with his plans and the care of his craf t; Fellows shaping stones for walls, arches, or spires; Apprentices fetching tools or mo rtar, and when necessary, tending the sick, and performing p. 138 all offices of a similar nature. Always the Lodge w as the center of interest and activity, a place of labor, of study, of devotion, as well as t he common room for the social life of the order. Every morning, as we learn from the Fabric R olls of York Minster, began with devotion, followed by the directions of the Master for the work of the day, which no doubt included study of the laws of the art, plans of construction, and the mystical meaning of ornaments and emblems. Only Masons were in attendance at such times, the Lodge being closed to all others, and guarded by a Tiler 1 against \"the approach of cowans 2 and eavesdroppers.\" Thus the p. 139 work of each day was begun, moving forward amidst t he din and litter of the hours, until the craft was called from labor to rest and refresh ment; and thus a cathedral was uplifted as a monument to the Order, albeit the names of the builders are faded and lost."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Employed for years on the same building, and living together in the Lodge, it is not strange that Free-masons came to know and love one another, and to have a feeling of loyalty to their craft, unique, peculiar, and endur ing. Traditions of fun and frolic, of song and feast and gala-day, have floated down to us, te lling of a comradeship as joyous as it was genuine. If their life had hardship and vicissi tude, it had also its grace and charm of friendship, of sympathy, service, and community of interest, and the joy that comes of devotion to a high and noble art. When a Mason wished to leave one Lodge and go elsew here to work, as he was free to do when he desired, he had no difficulty in making him self known p. 140 to the men of his craft by certain signs, grips, an d words. 1 Such tokens of recognition were necessary to men who traveled afar in those un certain days, especially when references or other means of identification were of ttimes impossible. All that many people knew about the order was that its members ha d a code of secret signs, and that no Mason need be friendless or alone when other Masons were within sight or hearing; so that the very name of the craft came to stand for a ny mode of hidden recognition. Steele, in the Tatler , speaks of a class of people who have \"their signs and tokens like Free- masons.\" p. 141 [paragraph continues] There were more than one of these signs and tokens , as we are more than once told in the Harleian MS , for example, which speaks of \"words and signs.\" W hat they were may not be here discussed, but it is safe to say that a Master Mason of the Middle Ages, were he to return from the land of sha dows, could perhaps make himself known as such in a Fellowcraft Lodge of today. No d oubt some things would puzzle him at first, but he would recognize the officers of th e Lodge, its form, its emblems, its great altar Light, and its moral truth taught in symbols. Besides, he could tell us, if so minded, much that we should like to learn about the craft i n the olden times, its hidden mysteries, the details of its rites, and the meaning of its sy mbols when the poetry of building was yet alive. III This brings us to one of the most hotly debated que stions in Masonic history--the question as to the number and nature of the degrees made use of in the old craft lodges. Hardly any other subject has so deeply engaged the veteran archaeologists of the order, and while it ill becomes any one glibly to decide s uch an issue, it is at least permitted us, after studying all of value that has been written o n both sides, to sum up what seems to be the truth arrived p. 142"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"at. 1 While such a thing as a written record of an ancie nt degree--aside from the Old Charges , which formed a part of the earliest rituals--is u nthinkable, we are not left altogether to the mercy of conjecture in a matter s o important. Cesare Cantu tells us that the Comacine Masters \"were called together in the L oggie by a grand-master to treat of affairs common to the order, to receive novices, an d confer superior degrees on others .\" 2 Evidence of a sort similar is abundant, but not a l ittle confusion will be avoided if the following considerations be kept in mind: First, that during its purely operative period the ritual of Masonry was naturally less formal and ornate than it afterwards became, from t he fact that its very life was a kind of ritual and its symbols were always visibly present in its labor. By the same token, as it ceased to be purely operative, and others not actua lly architects were admitted to its fellowship, of necessity its rites became more p. 143 formal--\" very formall ,\" as Dugdale said in 1686, 1 --portraying in ceremony what had long been present in its symbolism and practice. Second, that with the decline of the old religious art of building--for such it was in very truth--some of its symbolism lost its luster, its f orm surviving but its meaning obscured, if not entirely faded. Who knows, for example--even wi th the Klein essay on The Great Symbol 2 in hand--what Pythagoras meant by his lesser and g reater Tetractys? That they were more than mathematical theorems is plain, yet even Plutarch missed their meaning. In the same way, some of the emblems in our Lodges are veiled, or else wear meanings invented after the fact, in lieu of deeper meanings hidden, or but dimly discerned. Albeit, the great emblems still speak in truths simple and eloquent, and remain to refine, instruct, and exalt. Third, that when Masonry finally became a purely sp eculative or symbolical fraternity, no longer an order of practical builders, its cerem onial inevitably became more elaborate and imposing--its old habit and custom, as well as its symbols and teachings, being enshrined in its ritual. More than this, knowing ho w \"Time the white god makes all things p. 144 holy, and what is old becomes religion,\" it is no w onder that its tradition became every year more authoritative; so that the tendency was n ot, as many have imagined, to add to its teaching, but to preserve and develop its rich deposit of symbolism, and to avoid any break with what had come down from the past. Keeping in mind this order of evolution in the hist ory of Masonry, we may now state the facts, so far as they are known, as to its early de grees; dividing it into two periods, the Operative and the Speculative. 1 An Apprentice in the olden days was \"entered\" as a novice of the craft, first, as a purely business pr oceeding, not unlike our modern indentures, or articles. Then, or shortly afterward s--probably"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"p. 145 at the annual Assembly--there was a ceremony of ini tiation making him a Mason-- including an oath, the recital of the craft legend as re-corded in the Old Charges , instruction in moral conduct and deportment as a Ma son, and the imparting of certain secrets. At first this degree, although comprising secrets, does not seem to have been mystic at all, but a simple ceremony intended to im press upon the mind of the youth the high moral life required of him. Even Guild-masonry had such a rite of initiation, as Hallam remarks, and if we may trust the Findel vers ion of the ceremony used among the German Stone-masons, it was very like the first deg ree as we now have it--though one has always the feeling that it was embellished in t he light of later time. 1 So far there is no dispute, but the question is whe ther any other degree was known in the early lodges. Both the probabilities of the case, t ogether with such facts as we have, indicate that there was another and higher degree. For, if all the secrets of the order were divulged to an Apprentice, he could, after working four years, and just when he was becoming valuable, run away, give himself out as a Fellow, and receive work and wages as such. If there was only one set of secrets, this deception p. 146 might be practiced to his own profit and the injury of the craft--unless, indeed, we revise all our ideas held hitherto, and say that his initi ation did not take place until he was out of his articles. This, however, would land us in worse difficulties later on. Knowing the fondness of the men of the Middle Ages for ceremony , it is hardly conceivable that the day of all days when an Apprentice, having worked f or seven long years, acquired the status of a Fellow, was allowed to go unmarked, lea st of all in an order of men to whom building was at once an art and an allegory. So tha t, not only the exigencies of his occupation, but the importance of the day to a youn g man, and the spirit of the order, justify such a conclusion. Have we any evidence tending to confirm this infere nce? Most certainly; so much so that it is not easy to interpret the hints given in the Old Charges upon any other theory. For one thing, in nearly all the MSS, from the Regius Poem down, we are told of two rooms or resorts, the Chamber and the Lodge--sometimes ca lled the Bower and the Hall--and the Mason was charged to keep the \"counsells\" prope r to each place. This would seem to imply that an Apprentice had access to the Chamber or Bower, but not to the Lodge itself--at least not at all times. It may be argued that the \"other counsells\" p. 147 referred to were merely technical secrets, but that is to give the case away, since they were secrets held and communicated as such. By natu ral process, as the order declined and actual building ceased, its technical secrets became ritual secrets , though they must always have had symbolical meanings. Further, while we have record of only one oath-- which does not mean that there was only one--signs, tokens, and words are nearly alwa ys spoken of in the plural; and if the secrets of a Fe llowcraft were purely technical--which"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"some of us do not believe--they were at least accom panied and protected by certain signs, tokens, and passwords. From this it is clear that t he advent of an Apprentice into the ranks of a Fellow was in fact a degree, or containe d the essentials of a degree, including a separate set. of signs and secrets. When we pass to the second period, and men of wealt h and learning who were not actual architects began to enter the order--whether as pat rons of the art or as students and mystics attracted by its symbolism--other evidences of change appear. They, of course, were not required to serve a seven year apprentices hip, and they would naturally be Fellows, not Masters, because they were in no sense masters of the craft. Were these Fellows made acquainted with the secrets of an Appr entice? If p. 148 so, then the two degrees were either conferred in o ne evening, or else--what seems to have been the fact--they were welded into one; sinc e we hear of men being made Masons in a single evening. 1 Customs differed, no doubt, in different Lodges, s ome of which were chiefly operative, or made up of men who had b een working Masons, with only a sprinkling of men not workmen who had been admitted ; while others were purely symbolical Lodges as far back as 1645. Naturally in Lodges of the first kind the two degrees were kept separate, and in the second they were merged--the one degree becoming all the while more elaborate. Gradually th e men who had been Operative Masons became fewer in the Lodges--chiefly those of higher position, such as master builders, architects, and so on--until the order be came a purely speculative fraternity, having no longer any trade object in view. Not only so, but throughout this period of transiti on, and even earlier, we hear intimations of \"the Master's Part,\" and those hints increase in number as the office of Master of the Work lost its practical aspect after the cathedral- building period. What was the Master's Part? Unfortunately, while the number of degrees ma y be indicated, their nature and details cannot be discussed without grave indiscret ion; p. 149 but nothing is plainer than that we need not go outside Masonry itself to find the m aterials out of which all three degrees, as they now exist, were developed . 1 Even the French Companionage, or Sons of Solomon, had the legend of the Third Degree long before 1717, when some imagine it to have been invented. I f little or no mention of it is found among English Masons before that date, that is no r eason for thinking that it was unknown. -ot until 1841 was it known to have been a secret o f the Companionage in Prance, so deeply and carefully was it hidden . 2 Where so much is dim one may not be dogmatic, but what seems to have taken place in 171 7 was, not the addition of a third degree p. 150 made out of whole cloth, but the conversion of two degrees into three."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"That is to say, Masonry is too great an institution to have been made in a day, much less by a few men, but was a slow evolution through long time, unfolding its beauty as it grew. Indeed, it was like one of its own cathedrals upon which one generation of builders wrought and vanished, and another followed, until, amidst vicissitudes of time and change, of decline and revival, the order itself be came a temple of Freedom and Fraternity--its history a disclosure of its innermo st soul in the natural process of its transition from actual architecture to its \"more no ble and glorious purpose.\" For, since what was evolved from Masonry must always have been involved in it--not something alien added to it from extraneous sources, as some never tire of trying to show--we need not go outside the order itself to learn what Mason ry is, certainly not to discover its motif and its genius; its later and more elaborate form b eing only an expansion and exposition of its inherent nature and teaching. Upon this fact the present study insists with all emphasis, as over against those who go hunting in e very odd nook and corner to find whence Masonry came, and where it got its symbols a nd degrees. Footnotes 128:1 Our present craft nomenclature is all wrong; the o ld order was first Apprentice, then Master, then Fellowcraft--mastership being, p. 129 not a degree conferred, but a reward of skill as a workman and of merit as a man. The confusion today is due, no doubt, to the custom of the German Guilds, where a Fellowcraft had to serve an additional two years as a journeyman before becomin g a Master. No such restriction was known in England. Indeed, the reverse was true, and it was not the Fellowcraft but the Apprentice who prepared his masterpiece, and if it was accepted, he became a Master. Having won his mastership, he was entitled to becom e a Fellowcraft--that is, a peer and fellow of the fraternity which hitherto he had only served. Also, we must distinguish between a Master and the Master of the Work, now re presented by the Master of the Lodge. Between a Master and the Master of the Work there was no difference, of course, except an accidental one; they were both Masters an d Fellows. Any Master (or Fellow) could become a Master of the Work at any time, prov ided he was of sufficient skill and had the luck to be chosen as such either by the emp loyer, or the Lodge, or both. 131:1 The older MSS indicate that initiations took place , for the most part, at the annual Assemblies, which were bodies not unlike the Grand Lodges of today, presided over by a President--a Grand Master in fact, though not in na me. Democratic in government, as Masonry has always been, they received Apprentices, examined candidates for mastership, tried cases, adjusted disputes, and reg ulated the craft; but they were also occasions of festival and social good will. At a la ter time they declined, and the functions of initiation more and more reverted to the Lodges. 131:2 The subject of Mason's Marks is most interesting, particularly with reference to the origin and growth of Gothic architecture, but too i ntricate to be entered upon here. As for example, an essay entitled \"Scottish Mason's Marks Compared with Those of Other Countries,\" by Prof. T. H. Lewis, British Archaeological Association , 1888, and the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"theory there advanced that some great unknown archi tect introduced Gothic architecture from the East, as shown by the p. 132 difference in Mason's Marks as compared with those of the Norman period.

It consisted of a short black tunic --in summer made of linen, in winter of wool--open at the sides , with a gorget to which a hood was attached; round the waist was a leathern girdle, fr om which depended a sword and a satchel. Over the tunic was a black scapulary, simi lar to the habit of a priest, tucked under the girdle when they were working, but on holydays allowed to hang down. No doubt this garment also served as a coverlet at night, as was the custom of the Middle Ages, sheets and blankets being luxuries enjoyed only by the ric h and titled ( History of Agriculture and Prices in England, T. Rogers). On their heads they wore l arge felt or straw hats, and tight leather breeches and long boots completed the garb. 137:1 Gloves were more widely used in the olden times th an now, and the practice of giving them as presents was common in mediaeval tim es. Often, when the harvest was over, gloves were distributed to the laborers who g athered it ( History of Prices in England , Rogers), and richly embroidered gloves formed an offering gladly accepted by princes. Indeed, the bare hand was regarded as a sy mbol of hostility, and the gloved hand a token of peace and goodwill. For Masons, however, the white gloves and apron had meanings hardly guessed by others, and their symbol ism remains to this day with its simple and eloquent appeal. (See chapter on \"Masoni c Clothing and Regalia,\" in Things a Freemason Should Know , by J. W. Crowe, an interesting article by Rylands , A. Q. C. , vol. v, and the delightful essay on \"Gloves,\" by Dr . Mackey, in his Symbolism of Freemasonry .) Not only the tools of the builder, but his cloth ing, had moral meaning. 138:1 Tiler --like the word cable-tow --is a word peculiar to the language of Masonry, an d means one who guards the Lodge to see that only Mas ons are within ear-shot. It probably derives from the Middle Ages when the makers of til es for roofing were also of migratory habits ( History of Prices in England , Rogers), and accompanied the Free-masons to perform their share of the work of covering buildin gs. Some tiler was appointed to act as sentinel to keep off intruders, and hence, in cours e of time, the name of Tiler came to be applied to any Mason who guarded the Lodge. 138:2 Much has been written of the derivation and meanin g of the word cowan , some finding its origin in a Greek term meaning \"dog.\" ( See \"An Inquiry Concerning Cowans,\" by D. Ramsay, Review of Freemasonry, vol. i.) But i ts origin is still to seek, unless we accept it as an old Scotch word of contempt ( Dictionary of Scottish Language , Jamieson). Sir Walter Scott uses it as such in Rob Roy, \"she d oesna’ value a Cawmil mair as a cowan\" (chap. xxix). Masons used the word to descri be a \"dry-diker, one who built without cement,\" or a Mason without the word. Unfor tunately, we still have cowans in this sense--men who try to be Masons p. 139 without using the cement of brotherly love. If only they could be kept out! Blackstone describes an eavesdropper as \"a common nuisance punishable by fine.\" Legend says that the old-time Masons punished such prying persons, who sought to learn their signs and secrets, by holding them under the eaves until the water ran in at the neck and out at the heels. What penalty was inflicted in"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"dry weather, we are not informed. At any rate, they had contempt for a man who tried to make use of the signs of the craft without knowing its art and ethics. 140:1 This subject is most fascinating. Even in primitiv e ages there seems to have been a kind of universal sign-language employed, at times, by all peoples. Among widely separated tribes the signs were very similar, owing , perhaps, to the fact that they were natural gestures of greeting, of warning, or of dis tress. There is intimation of this in the Bible, when the life of Ben-Hadad was saved by a si gn given (I Kings, 20:30-35). Even among the North American Indians a sign-code of lik e sort was known ( Indian Masonry , R. C. Wright, chap iii). \"Mr. Ellis, by means of hi s knowledge as a Master Mason, actually passed himself into the sacred part or ady tum of one of the temples of India\" ( Anacalypsis , G. Higgins, vol. i, 767). See also the experience of Haskett Smith among the Druses, already referred to ( A. Q. C. , iv, 11). Kipling has a rollicking story with the Masonic sign-code for a theme, entitled The Man Who Would be King , and his imagination is positively uncanny. If not a little of the old sign-language of the race lives to this day in Masonic Lodges, it is due not only t o the exigencies of the craft, but also to the instinct of the order for the old, the universa l, the human ; its genius for making use of all the ways and means whereby men may be brought t o know and love and help one another. 142:1 Once more it is a pleasure to refer to the transac tions of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge of Research, whose essays and discussions of this issue, as of so many others, are the best survey of the whole question from all side s. The paper by J. W. Hughan arguing in behalf of only one degree in the old time lodges , and a like paper by G. W. Speth in behalf of two degrees, with the materials for the t hird, cover the field quite thoroughly and in full light of all the facts ( A. Q. C. , vol. x, 127; vol. xi, 47). As for the Third Degree, that will be considered further along. 142:2 Storia di Como , vol. i, 440. 143:1 -atural History of Wiltshire , by John Aubrey, written, but not published, in 16 86. 143:2 A.

Addison, writing in the Spectator , March 1, 1711, draws the following distinction between a speculative and an operative member of a trade or profession: \"I live in the world rather as a spectator of mankind, than as one of the species, by which means I have made myself a speculative statesman, soldier, merch ant, and artisan , without ever meddling with any practical part of life.\" By a Spe culative Mason, then, is meant a man who, though not an actual architect, sought and obt ained membership among Free- masons. Such men, scholars and students, began to e nter the order as early as 1600, if not earlier. If by Operative Mason is meant one who att ached no moral meaning to his tools, there were none such in the olden time--all Masons, even those in the Guilds, using their tools as moral emblems in a way quite unknown to bu ilders of our day. ’Tis a pity that this light of poetry has faded from our toil, and w ith it the joy of work."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"145:1 History of Masonry , p. 66. 148:1 For a single example, the Diary of Elias Ashmole, under date of 1646. 149:1 Time out of mind it has been the habit of writers, both within the order and without, to treat Masonry as though it were a kind of agglomeration of archaic remains and platitudinous moralizings, made up of the heel- taps of Operative legend and the fag- ends of Occult lore. Far from it! If this were the fact the present writer would be the first to admit it, but it is not the fact. Instead, the i dea that an order so noble, so heroic in its history, so rich in symbolism, so skilfully adjuste d, and with so many traces of remote antiquity, was the creation of pious fraud, or else of an ingenious conviviality, passes the bounds of credulity and enters the domain of the ab surd.

And t herefore, as the Bust of an OLD Hero is of great Value among the Curious, tho’ it has lo st an Eye, the -ose or the Right Hand; so Masonry with all its Blemishes and Misfortunes, instead of appearing ridiculous, ought to be receiv’d with some Candor and Esteem, f rom a Veneration of its A-TIQUITY . -- Defence of Masonry , 1730 p. 153 CHAPTER III Accepted Masons I"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"WHATEVER may be dim in the history of Freemasonry, and in the nature of things much must remain hidden, its symbolism may be trace d in unbroken succession through the centuries; and its symbolism is its soul. So mu ch is this true, that it may almost be said that had the order ceased to exist in the peri od when it was at its height, its symbolism would have survived and developed, so dee ply was it wrought into the mind of mankind. When, at last, the craft finished its l abors and laid down its tools, its symbols, having served the faith of the worker, bec ame a language for the thoughts of the thinker. Few realize the service of the science of numbers t o the faith of man in the morning of the world, when he sought to find some kind of key to the mighty maze of things. Living amidst change and seeming chance, he found in the l aws of numbers a path by which to escape the awful sense of life as a series of accid ents in the hands of a capricious p. 154 [paragraph continues] Power; and, when we think of it, his insight was n ot invalid. \"All things are in numbers,\" said the wise Pythagoras; \"the world i s a living arithmetic in its development--a realized geometry in its repose.\" Na ture is a realm of numbers; crystals are solid geometry. Music, of all arts the most div ine and exalting, moves with measured step, using geometrical figures, and cannot free it self from numbers without dying away into discord. Surely it is not strange that a scien ce whereby men obtained such glimpses of the unity and order of the world should be hallo wed among them, imparting its form to their faith. 1 Having revealed so much, mathematics came to wear mystical meanings in a way quite alien to our prosaic habit of thinking--f aith in our day having betaken itself to other symbols. Equally so was it with the art of building--a livin g allegory in which man imitated in miniature p. 155 the world-temple, and sought by every device to dis cover the secret of its stability. Already we have shown how, from earliest times, the simple symbols of the builder became a part of the very life of humanity, giving shape to its thought, its faith, its dream. Hardly a language but bears their impress, as when we speak of a Rude or Polished mind, of an Upright man who is a Pillar of society, of th e Level of equality, or the Golden Rule by which we would Square our actions. They are so n atural, so inevitable, and so eloquent withal, that we use them without knowing i t. Sages have always been called Builders, and it was no idle fancy when Plato and P ythagoras used imagery drawn from the art of building to utter their highest thought. Everywhere in literature, philosophy, and life it is so, and naturally so. Shakespeare speaks of \"square-men,\" and when Spenser would build in stately lines the Castle of Temperan ce, he makes use of the Square, Circle, and Triangle: 1 The frame thereof seem’d partly circulaire And part triangular: O work divine!"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Those two the first and last proportions are; The one imperfect, mortal, feminine. The other immortal, perfect, masculine, And twixt them both a quadrate was the base, p. 156 Proportion’d equally by seven and nine; Nine was the circle set in heaven's place All which compacted made a goodly diapase. During the Middle Ages, as we know, men revelled in symbolism, often of the most recondite kind, and the emblems of Masonry are to b e found all through the literature, art, and thought of that time. Not only on cathedrals, t ombs, and monuments, where we should expect to come upon them, but in the designs and decorations of dwellings, on vases, pottery, and trinkets, in the water-marks us ed by paper-makers and printers, and even as initial letters in books--everywhere one fi nds the old, familiar emblems. 1 Square, Rule, Plumb-line, the perfect Ashlar, the two Pilla rs, the Circle within the parallel lines, the Point within the Circle, the Compasses, the Win ding Staircase, the numbers Three, Five, Seven, Nine, the double Triangle--these and o ther such symbols were used alike by Hebrew Kabbalists and Rosicrucian Mystics. Indeed, so abundant is the evidence--if the matter were in dispute and needed proof--especially after the revival of symbolism under Albertus Magnus in 1249, p. 157 that a whole book might be filled with it. Typical are the lines left by a poet who, writing in 1623, sings of God as the great Logician whom th e conclusion never fails, and whose counsel rules without command: 1 Therefore can none foresee his end Unless on God is built his hope. And if we here below would learn By Compass, Needle, Square, and Plumb, We never must o’erlook the mete Wherewith our God hath measur’d us. For all that, there are those who never weary of tr ying to find where, in the misty mid- region of conjecture, the Masons got their immemori al emblems. One would think, after reading their endless essays, that the symbols of M asonry were loved and preserved by all the world-- except by the Masons themselves . Often these writers imply, if they do not actually assert, that our order begged, borrowed, o r cribbed its emblems from Kabbalists or Rosicrucians, whereas the truth is exactly the o ther way round--those impalpable fraternities, whose vague, fantastic thought was al ways seeking a local habitation and a body, making use of the symbols of Masonry the bett er to reach the minds of men. Why p. 158 all this unnecessary mystery--not to say mystificat ion--when the facts are so plain, written in records and carved in stone?

Some of our Masonic writers 1 --more than one likes to admit--have erred by confu sing Freemasonry with Guild-masonry, to the discredit of the p. 159 former. Even Oliver once concluded that the secrets of the working Masons of the Middle Ages were none other than the laws of Geometry--hen ce the letter G ; forgetting, it would seem, that Geometry had mystical meanings for them long since lost to us. As well say that the philosophy of Pythagoras was repeating the Multiplication Table! Albert Pike held that we are \"not warranted in assuming that, a mong Masons generally--in the body of Masonry--the symbolism of Freemasonry is of earl ier date then 1717.\" 1 Surely that is to err. If we had only the Mason's Marks that have come down to us, nothing else would be needed to prove it an error. Of course, for deep er minds all emblems have deeper meanings, and there may have been many Masons who d id not fathom the symbolism of the order. No more do we; but the symbolism itself, of hoar antiquity, was certainly the common inheritance and treasure of the working Maso ns of the Lodges in England and Scotland before, indeed centuries before, the year 1717. p. 160 II Therefore it is not strange that men of note and le arning, attracted by the wealth of symbolism in Masonry, as well as by its spirit of f raternity--perhaps, also, by its secrecy-- began at an early date to ask to be accepted as mem bers of the order: hence Accepted Masons . 1 How far back the custom of admitting such men to t he Lodges goes is not clear, but hints of it are discernible in the oldes t documents of the order; and this whether or no we accept as historical the membership of Pri nce Edwin in the tenth century, of whom the Regius Poem says, Of speculatyfe he was a master. [paragraph continues] This may only mean that he was amply skilled in th e knowledge, as well as the practice, of the art, although, as Gould points out, the Regius MS contains intimations of thoughts above the heads of many to whom it was read. 2 Similar traces of Accepted Masons are found in the Cooke MS , compiled in 1400 or earlier. Hope suggests 3 that the p. 161 earliest members of this class were ecclesiastics w ho wished to study to be architects and designers, so as to direct the erection of their ow n churches; the more so, since the order"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"had \"so high and sacred a destination, was so entir ely exempt from all local, civil jurisdiction,\" and enjoyed the sanction and protect ion of the Church. Later, when the order was in disfavor with the Church, men of anoth er sort--scholars, mystics, and lovers of liberty--sought its degrees. At any rate, the custom began early and continued t hrough the years, until Accepted Masons were in the majority. Noblemen, gentlemen, a nd scholars entered the order as Speculative Masons, and held office as such in the old Lodges, the first name recorded in actual minutes being John Boswell, who was present as a member of the Lodge of Edinburgh in 1600. Of the forty-nine names on the r oll of the Lodge of Aberdeen in 1670, thirty-nine were Accepted Masons not in any w ay connected with the building trade. In England the earliest reference to the ini tiation of a Speculative Mason, in Lodge minutes, is of the year 1641. On the 10th of May th at year, Robert Moray, \"General Quartermaster of the Armie off Scottland,\" as the r ecord runs, was initiated at Newcastle by members of the \"Lodge of Edinburgh,\" who were wi th the Scottish p. 162 [paragraph continues] Army. A still more famous example was that of Ashm ole, whereof we read in the Memoirs of the Life of that Learned Antiquary, Elia s Ashmole, Drawn up by Himself by Way of Diary , published in 1717, which contains two entries as follows, the first dated in 1646: Octob 16.4 Hor . 30 Minutes post merid . I was made a Freemason at Warrington in Lancashire, with Colonel Henry Wainwaring of Kartichain in Cheshire ; the names of those that were there at the Lodge, Mr. Richard Panket Warden , Mr. James Collier , Mr. Richard Sankey , Henry Littler , John Ellani , Richard Ellani and Hugh Brewer . Such is the record, italics and all; and it has bee n shown, by hunting up the wills of the men present, that the members of the Warrington Lod ge in 1646 were, nearly all of them- -every one in fact, so far as is known--Accepted Ma sons. Thirty-five years pass before we discover the only other Masonic entries in the Diary , dated March, 1682, which read as follows: About 5 p. m. I received a Summons to appear at a L odge to be held the next day, at Masons Hall, London. Accordingly I went, and about Noone were ad mitted into the Fellowship of Free Masons, Sir. William Wilson, Knight, Capt. Richard Borthwic k, Mr. Will. Woodman, Mr. Wm. Grey, M.

Space is given to those entries, not because they a re very important, but because Ragon and others have actually held that Ashmole made Mas onry--as if any one man made Masonry! ’Tis surely strange, if this be true, that only two entries in his Diary refer to the order; but that does not disconcert the theorists w ho are so wedded to their idols as to have scant regard for facts. No, the circumstance t hat Ashmole was a Rosicrucian, an"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Alchemist, a delver into occult lore, is enough, th e absence of any allusion to him thereafter only serving to confirm the fancy--the t heory being that a few adepts, seeing Masonry about to crumble and decay, seized it, intr oduced their symbols into it, making it the mouthpiece of their high, albeit hidden, tea ching. How fascinating! and yet how baseless in fact! There is no evidence that a Rosic rucian fraternity existed--save on paper, having been woven of a series of romances written a s early as 1616, and ascribed to Andrea--until a later time; and even when it did ta ke form, it was quite distinct from p. 164 [paragraph continues] Masonry. Occultism, to be sure, is elusive, coming we know not whence, and hovering like a mist trailing over the hills. S till, we ought to be able to find in Masonry some trace of Rosicrucian influence, some hint of the l ofty wisdom it is said to have added to the order; but no one has yet done so . Did all that high, Hermetic mysticism evaporate entirely, leaving not a wraith behind, going as mysteriously as it came to that far place which no mortal may explore? 1 Howbeit, the fact to be noted is that, thus early--and earlier, for the Lodge had been in existence some time when Ashmole was initiated--the Warrington Lodge was made up of Accepted Masons. Of the ten men present in the Lond on Lodge, mentioned p. 165 in the second entry in the Diary , Ashmole was the senior, but he was not a member o f the Masons' Company, though the other nine were, and al so two of the neophytes. No doubt this is the Lodge which Conder, the historian of th e Company, has traced back to 1620, \"and were the books of the Company prior to that da te in existence, we should no doubt be able to trace the custom of receiving accepted m embers back to pre-reformation times.\" 1 From an entry in the books of the Company, dated 1 665, it appears that There was hanging up in the Hall a list of the Accepted Masons enclosed in a \"faire frame, with a lock and key.\" Why was this? No doubt the Accepted Masons, or those who were initiated into the esoteric aspect of the Company, did not include the whole Company, and this was a list of the \"enlightened ones,\" whose names were thus honored a nd kept on record, probably long after their decease. . . This we cannot say for certain, but we can say that as early as 1620, and inferentially very much earlier, there were certain members of th e Masons' Company and others who met from time to time to form a Lodge for the purpose of Spe culative Masonry. 2 Conder also mentions a copy of the Old Charges , or Gothic Constitutions, in the chest of the London Masons' Company, known as The Book of the Constitutions p. 166 of the Accepted Masons ; and this he identifies with the Regius MS . Another witness during this period is Randle Holme, of Chester, who se references to the Craft in his Acadamie Armory , 1688, are of great value, for that he writes \"as a member of that society called Free-masons.\" The Harleian MS is in his handwriting, and on the next leaf there is a remarkable list of twenty-six names, inc luding his own. It is the only list of the kind known in England, and a careful examination of all the sources of information"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"relative to the Chester men shows that nearly all o f them were Accepted Masons. Later on we come to the -atural History of Staffordshire , by Dr. Plott, 1686, in which, though in an unfriendly manner, we are told many things ab out Craft usages and regulations of that day. Lodges had to be formed of at least five members to make a quorum, gloves were presented to candidates, and a banquet followi ng initiations was a custom. He states that there were several signs and passwords by whic h the members were able \"to be known to one another all over the nation,\" his fait h in their effectiveness surpassing that of the most credulous in our day. Still another striking record is found in The -atural History of Wiltshire , by John Aubrey, the MS of which in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, is p. 167 dated 1686; and on the reverse side of folio 72 of this MS is the following note by Aubrey: \"This day [May 18, 1681 ] is a great conven tion at St. Pauls Church of the fraternity, of the free [then he crossed out the wo rd Free and inserted Accepted] Masons; where Sir Christopher Wren is to be adopted a Broth er: and Sir Henry Goodric of ye Tower and divers others.\" 1 From which we may infer that there were Assemblies before 1717, and that they were of sufficient importance t o be known to a non-Mason. Other evidence might be adduced, but this is enough to sh ow that Speculative Masonry, so far from being a novelty, was very old at the time when many suppose it was invented. With the great fire p. 168 of London, in 1666, there came a renewed interest i n Masonry, many who had abandoned it flocking to the capital to rebuild the city and especially the Cathedral of St. Paul. Old Lodges were revived, new ones were formed, and an e ffort was made to renew the old annual, or quarterly, Assemblies, while at the same time Accepted Masons increased both in numbers and in zeal. Now the crux of the whole matter as regards Accepte d Masons lies in the answer to such questions as these: Why did soldiers, scholars, ant iquarians, clergymen, lawyers, and even members of the nobility ask to be accepted as members of the order of Free- masons? Wherefore their interest in the Order at al l? What attracted them to it as far back as 1600, and earlier? What held them with increasin g power and an ever-deepening interest? Why did they continue to enter the Lodges until they had the rule of them? There must have been something more in their motive than a simple desire for association, for they had their clubs, societies, a nd learned fellowships. Still less could a mere curiosity to learn certain signs and passwords have held such men for long, even in an age of quaint conceits in the matter of associat ion and when architecture was affected as a fad.

Plutarch reports Plato as sayin g, \"God is always geometrizing\" ( Diog. Laert. , iv, 2). Elsewhere Plato remarks that \"Geometry ri ghtly treated is the knowledge of the Eternal\" ( Republic , 527b), and over the porch of his Academy at Athen s he wrote the words, \"Let no one who is ignorant of Geometry ente r my doors.\" So Aristotle and all the ancient thinkers, whether in Egypt or India. Pythag oras, Proclus tells us, was concerned only with number and magnitude: number absolute, in arithmetic; number applied, in music; and so forth--whereof we read in the Old Charges (see \"The Great Symbol,\" by Klein, A.

Andreae, Ehreneich Hohenfelder von Aister Haimb . A verbatim translation of the second line quoted would read, \"Unless in God h e has his building.\" 158:1 When, for example, Albert Pike, in his letter, \"To uching Masonic Symbolism,\" speaks of the \"poor, rude, unlettered, uncultivated working Stone-masons,\" who attended the Assemblies, he is obviously confounding Free-ma sons with the rough Stone-masons of the Guilds. Over against these words, read a bri lliant article in the Contemporary Review , October, 1913, by L. M. Phillips, entitled, \"The Two Ways of Building,\" showing how the Free-masons, instead of working und er architects outside the order, chose the finer minds among them as leaders and cre ated the different styles of architecture in Europe. \"Such,\" he adds, \"was the h igh limit of talent and intelligence which the creative spirit fostered among workmen. . .

As late as April 24, 1786, two brothers were proposed as members of Doma tic Lodge, No. 177, London, and were rejected because they were not Operative Mason s ( History Lion and Lamb Lodge , 192, London, by Abbott). 160:2 \"On the Antiquity of Masonic Symbolism,\" A.

Better still is the Real History of the Rosicrucians , by Waite (chap. xv), and for a complete and final explosion of all such fancies we have the great chapter in Gould's History of Masonry (vol. ii, chap. xiii). It seems a pity that so muc h time and labor and learning had to be expended on theories so fragile, but it was necessary; and no man was better fitted for the study than Gould. Perhaps the present writer is unkind, or at least impatient; if so he humbly begs forgiveness; but af ter reading tomes of conjecture about the alleged Rosicrucian origin of Masonry, he is we ary of the wide-eyed wonder of mystery-mongers about things that never were, and w hich would be of no value if they had been.

Ashmole, if we may trust his f riend, Dr. Knipe, had planned to write a History of Masonry refuting the theory of Wren that Freemasonry took its rise from a Bull granted by the Pope, in the reign of Henry III , to some Italian architects, holding, and rightly so, that the Bull \"was confirmatory onl y, and did not by any means create our fraternity, or even establish it in this kingdom\" ( Life of Ashmole , by Campbell).

Finally the re burst upon him the full import of the allocution--that he himself was to be the corne r-stone of a renewed and purified Church.

I From every point of view, the organization of the G rand Lodge of England, in 1717, was a significant and far-reaching event. Not only did it divide the story of Masonry into before and after, giving a new date from which to r eckon, but it was a way-mark in the intellectual and spiritual history of mankind. One has only to study that first Grand Lodge, the influences surrounding it, the men who c omposed it, the Constitutions adopted, and its spirit and purpose, to see that it was the beginning of a movement of profound meaning. When we see it in the setting of its age--as revealed, for example, p. 175 in the Journals of Fox and Wesley, which from being religious time-tables broadened into detailed panoramic pictures of the period before, a nd that following, the Grand Lodge-- the Assembly on 1717 becomes the more remarkable. A gainst such a background, when religion and morals seemed to reach the nadir of de predation, the men of that Assembly stand out as prophets of liberty of faith and right eousness of life. 1 Some imagination is needed to realize the moral dec lension of that time, as it is portrayed--to use a single example--in the sermon b y the Bishop of Litchfield before the Society for the Reformation of Manners, in 1724. Le wdness, drunkenness, and degeneracy, he said, were well nigh universal, no c lass being free from the infection. Murders were common and foul, wanton and obscene bo oks found so good a market as to encourage the publishing of them. Immorality of eve ry kind was so hardened as to be defended, yes, justified on principle. The p. 176 rich were debauched and indifferent; the poor were as miserable in their labor as they were coarse and cruel in their sport. Writing in 17 13, Bishop Burnet said that those who came to be ordained as clergymen were \"ignorant to a degree not to be comprehended by those who are not obliged to know it.\" Religion see med dying or dead, and to mention the word provoked a laugh. Wesley, then only a lad, had not yet come with his magnificent and cleansing evangel. Empty formalism on one side, a dead polemical dogmatism on the other, bigotry, bitterness, intolerance, and interm inable feud everywhere, no wonder Bishop Butler sat oppressed in his castle with hard ly a hope surviving. As for Masonry, it had fallen far and fallen low be times, but with the revival following the great fire of London, in 1666, it had taken on new life and a bolder spirit, and was passing through a transition--or, rather, a transfi guration! For, when we compare the Masonry of, say, 1688 with that of 1723, we discove r that much more than a revival had come to pass. Set the instructions of the Old Charges --not all of them, however, for even in earliest times some of them escaped the stamp of the Church 1 --in respect of religion alongside the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"p. 177 same article in the Constitutions of 1723, and the contrast is amazing. The old char ge read: \"The first charge is this, that you be true t o God and Holy Church and use no error or heresy.\" Hear now the charge in 1723: A Mason is obliged by his Tenure, to obey the moral law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious L ibertine. But though in ancient times Masons were charged in every country to be of the religion of that country or nation, whatever it was, yet it is now thought more expedient only to oblige the m to that religion in which all men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves: th at is, to be Good men and True, or Men of Honor and Honesty, by whatever Denomination or Pers uasion they may be distinguished; whereby Masonry becomes the Centre of Union and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among persons that must have remained at a perpetua l distance . If that statement had been written yesterday, it wo uld be remarkable enough. But when we consider that it was set forth in 1723, amidst b itter sectarian rancor and intolerance unimaginable, it rises up as forever memorable in t he history of men! The man who wrote that document, did we know his p. 178 name, is entitled to be held till the end of time i n the grateful and venerative memory of his race. The temper of the times was all for relen tless partisanship, both in religion and in politics. The alternative offered in religion wa s an ecclesiastical tyranny, allowing a certain liberty of belief, or a doctrinal tyranny, allowing a slight liberty of worship; a sad choice in truth. It is, then, to the everlasting ho nor of the century, that, in the midst of its clashing extremes, the Masons appeared with heads u nbowed, abjuring both tyrannies and championing both liberties. 1 Ecclesiastically and doctrinally they stood in the open, while Romanist and Protestant, Anglican and Puritan , Calvinist and Arminian waged bitter war, filling the air with angry maledictions . These men of latitude in a cramped age felt pent up alike by narrowness of ritual and by n arrowness of creed, and they cried out for room and air, for liberty and charity! Though differences of creed played no part in Mason ry, nevertheless it held religion in high esteem, p. 179 and was then, as now, the steadfast upholder of the only two articles of faith that never were invented by man--the existence of God and the immortality of the soul! Accordingly, every Lodge was opened and closed with prayer to the \"Almighty Architect of the universe;\" and when a Lodge of mourning met in memory of a brother fallen asleep, the formula was: \"He has passed over into t he eternal East,\"--to that region whence cometh light and hope. Unsectarian in religi on, the Masons were also non- partisan in politics: one principle being common to them all--love of country, respect for law and order, and the desire for human welfare. 1 Upon that basis the first Grand p. 180"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"[paragraph continues] Lodge was founded, and upon that basis Masonry res ts today--holding that a unity of spirit is better than a uniformity of op inion, and that beyond the great and simple \"religion in which all men agree\" no dogma i s worth a breach of charity. II With honorable pride in this tradition of spiritual faith and intellectual freedom, we are all the more eager to recite such facts as are known ab out the organization of the first Grand Lodge. How many Lodges of Masons existed in London at that time is a matter of conjecture, but there must have been a number. What bond, if any, united them, other than their esoteric secrets and customs, is equally unknown. Nor is there any record to tell us whether all the Lodges in and about London were invited to join in the movement. Unfortunately the minutes of the Grand Lodge only c ommence on June 24, 1723, and our only history of the events is that found in The -ew Book of Constitutions , by Dr. James Anderson, in 1738. However, if not an actor in the scene, he was in a position to know the facts from eye-witnesses, and his book p. 181 was approved by the Grand Lodge itself. His account is so brief that it may be given as it stands: King George I enter’d London most magnificently on 20 Sept. 1714. And after the Rebellion was over A. D. 1716, the few Lodges at London finding themselves neglected by Sir Christopher Wren , thought fit to cement under a Grand Master as the Centre of Union and Harmony, viz. , the Lodges that met, 1. At the Goose and Gridiron Ale house in St. Paul's Church-Yard . 2. At the Crown Ale-house in Parker's Lane near Drury Lane . 3. At the Apple-Tree Tavern in Charles-street , Covent-Garden . 4. At the Rummer and Grape Tavern in Channel-Row , Westminster . They and some other old Brothers met at the said Apple-Tree , and having put into the chair the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a Lodge ) they constituted themselves a Grand Lodge pro Tempore in Due Form , and forthwith revived the Quarterly Communication of the Officers of Lodges (call’d the GRAND LODGE) resolv’d to hold th e Annual Assembly and Feast , and then to chuse a Grand Master from among themselves, till they should have the Honor of a Noble Brother at their Head. Accordingly, on St. John's Baptist's Day , in the 3d year of King George I, A. D. 1717, the ASSEMBLY and Feast of the Free and Accepted Masons was held at the foresaid Goose and Gridiron Ale-house. p. 182 Before Dinner, the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a Lodge ) in the Chair, proposed a List of proper Candidates; and the Brethren by a majorit y of Hands elected Mr. Anthony Sayer, Gentleman , Grand Master of Masons (Mr. Jacob Lamball , Carpenter, Capt. Joseph Elliot , Grand"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Wardens) who being forthwith invested with the Badg es of Office and Power by the said oldest Master , and install’d, was duly congratulated by the Asse mbly who paid him the Homage. Sayer, Grand Master , commanded the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to meet the Grand Officers every Quarter in Communication , at the Place that he should appoint in the Summon s sent by the Tyler . So reads the only record that has come down to us o f the founding of the Grand Lodge of England. Preston and others have had no other autho rity than this passage for their descriptions of the scene, albeit when Preston wrot e, such facts as he added may have been learned from men still living. Who were presen t, beyond the three officers named, has so far eluded all research, and the only variat ion in the accounts is found in a rare old book called Multa Paucis , which asserts that six Lodges, not four, were rep resented. Looking at this record in the light of what we know of the Masonry of that period, a number of things are suggested: First, so far from being a revolution, the organiza tion of the Grand Lodge was a revival of the old quarterly and annual Assembly, born, doubtl ess, of a felt need of community of action for the welfare p. 183 of the Craft. There was no idea of innovation, but, as Anderson states in a note, \"it should meet Quarterly according to ancient Usage ,\" tradition having by this time become authoritative in such matters. Hints of what the ol d usages were are given in the observance of St. John's Day 1 as a feast, in the democracy of the order and its manner of voting by a show of hands, in its deference to the oldest Master Mason, its use of badges of office, 2 its ceremony of installation, all in a lodge duly tyled. p. 184 Second, it is clear that, instead of being a delibe rately planned effort to organize Masonry in general, the Grand Lodge was intended at first t o affect only London and Westminster; 1 the desire being to weld a link of closer fellowsh ip and coöperation between the Lodges. While we do not know the names of the moving spirits--unless we may infer that the men elected to office were such- -nothing is clearer than that the initiative came from the heart of the order itself, and was in no sense imposed upon it from without; and so great was the necessity for it that, when once started, link after link was added until it \"put a girdle around the earth.\" Third, of the four Lodges 2 known to have taken part, only one--that meeting a t the Rummer and Grape Tavern--had a majority of Accepted Masons p. 185 in its membership; the other three being Operative Lodges, or largely so. Obviously, then, the movement was predominantly a movement of Operat ive Masons--or of men who had been Operative Masons--and not, as has been so ofte n implied, the design of men who"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"simply made use of the remnants of operative Masonr y the better to exploit some hidden philosophy. Yet it is worthy of note that the leadi ng men of the craft in those early years were, nearly all of them, Accepted Masons and membe rs of the Rummer and Grape Lodge. Besides Dr. Anderson, the historian, both Ge orge Payne and Dr. Desaguliers, the second and third Grand Masters, were of that Lodge. In 1721 the Duke of Montagu was elected to the chair, and thereafter members of the nobility sat in the East until it became the custom for the Prince of Wales to be Grand Mast er of Masons in England. 1 Fourth, why did Masonry alone of all trades and pro fessions live after its work was done, preserving not only its identity of organization, b ut its old emblems and usages, and transforming them into instruments of religion and righteousness? The cathedrals had long been finished or left incomplete; the spirit o f Gothic architecture was dead and the style treated almost with contempt. The occupation p. 186 of the Master Mason was gone, his place having been taken by the architect who, like Wren and Inigo Jones, was no longer a child of the Lodges as in the old days, but a man trained in books and by foreign travel. Why did not Freemasonry die, along with the Guilds, or else revert to some kind of trades-union ? Surely here is the best possible proof that it had never been simply an order of architect s building churches, but a moral and spiritual fellowship--the keeper of great symbols a nd a teacher of truths that never die. So and only so may anyone ever hope to explain the sto ry of Masonry, and those who do not see this fact have no clue to its history, much les s an understanding of its genius. Of course these pages cannot recite in detail the h istory and growth of the Grand Lodge, but a few of the more salient events may be noted. As early as 1719 the Old Charges , or Gothic Constitutions, began to be collected and col lated, a number having already been burned by scrupulous Masons to prevent their fallin g into strange hands. In 1721, Grand Master Montagu found fault with the Old Charges as being inadequate, and ordered Dr. Anderson to make a digest of them with a view to fo rmulating a better set of regulations for the rule of the Lodges. Anderson obeyed--he see ms to have been engaged in such a work already, and may p. 187 have suggested the idea to the Grand Master--and a committee of fourteen \"learned brethren\" was appointed to examine the MS and make report. They suggested a few amendments, and the book was ordered published by t he Grand Master, appearing in the latter part of 1723. This first issue, however, did not contain the account of the organization of the Grand Lodge, which does not see m to have been added until the edition of 1738. How much Past Grand Master Payne h ad to do with this work is not certain, but the chief credit is due to Dr. Anderso n, who deserves the perpetual gratitude of the order--the more so if he it was who wrote th e article, already quoted, setting forth the religious attitude of the order. That article, by whomsoever written, is one of the great documents of mankind, and it would be an added joy to know that it was penned by a minister. 1 The Book of Constitutions , which"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"p. 188 is still the groundwork of Masonry, has been printe d in many editions, and is accessible to every one. Another event in the story of the Grand Lodge, neve r to be forgotten, was a plan started in 1724 of raising funds of General Charity for dis tressed Masons. Proposed by the Earl of Dalkeith, it at once met with enthusiastic suppo rt, and it is a curious coincidence that one of the first to petition for relief was Anthony Sayer, first Grand Master. The minutes do not state whether he was relieved at that time, but we know that sums of money were voted to him in 1730, and again in 1741. This Board of Benevolence, as it came to be called, became very important, it being unanimously agreed in 1733 that all such business as could not be conveniently despatched by the Quar terly Communication should be referred to it. Also, that all Masters of Regular L odges, together with all present, former, and future Grand Officers should be members of the Board. Later this Board was still further empowered to hear complaints and to report thereon to the Grand Lodge. Let it also be noted that in actual practice the Board of Charity gave free play to p. 189 one of the most admirable principles of Masonry--he lping the needy and unfortunate, whether within the order or without. III Once more we come to a much debated question, about which not a little has been written, and most of it wide of the mark--the quest ion of the origin of the Third Degree. Here again students have gone hither and yon huntin g in every cranny for the motif of this degree, and it would seem that their failure t o find it would by this time have turned them back to the only place where they may ever hop e to discover it--in Masonry itself. But no; they are bound to bring mystics, occultists , alchemists, Culdees or Cabalists-- even the Vehmgerichte of Germany--into the making of Masonry somewhere, if only for the sake of glamor, and this is the last opportunit y to do it. 1 Willing to give due credit p. 190 to Cabalists and Rosicrucians, the present writer r ejects all such theories on the ground that there is no reason for thinking that they help ed to make Masonry, much less any fact to prove it . Hear now a review of the facts in the case. No one denies that the Temple of Solomon was much in the minds of men at the time of the org anization of the Grand Lodge, and long before--as in the Bacon romance of the -ew Atlantis in 1597. 1 p. 191 [paragraph continues] Broughton, Selden, Lightfoot, Walton, Lee, Prideau x, and other English writers were deeply interested in the Hebrew Temple , not, however, so much in its"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"symbolical suggestion as in its form and constructi on--a model of which was brought to London by Judah Templo in the reign of Charles II. 1 It was much the same on the Continent, but so far from being a new topic of stu dy and discussion, we may trace this interest in the Temple all through the Middle Ages. Nor was it peculiar to the Cabalists, at least not to such a degree that they must needs be brought in to account for the Biblical imagery and symbolism in Masonry. Indeed, it might with more reason be argued that Masonry explains the interest in the Temple than ot herwise. For, as James Fergusson remarks--and there is no higher authority than the historian of architecture: \"There is perhaps no building of the ancient world which has excited so much attention since the time of its destruction, as the Temple of Solomon b uilt in Jerusalem, and its successor as built by Herod. Throughout the Middle Ages it influenced to a consi derable degree the forms of Christian churches, and its peculiarities were the watchwords and rallying points of associations of builders .\" 2 Clearly, the notion that interest in the Temple wa s new, and p. 192 that its symbolical meaning was imposed upon Masonr y as something novel, falls flat. But we are told that there is no hint of the Hirami c legend, still less any intimation of a tragedy associated with the building of the Temple. No Hiramic legend! No hint of tragedy! Why, both were almost as old as the Temple itself, rabbinic legend affirming that \" all the workmen were killed that they should not bu ild another Temple devoted to idolatry, Hiram himself being translated to heaven like Enoch .\" 1 The Talmud has many variations of this legend. Where would one expect t he legends of the Temple to be kept alive and be made use of in ceremonial, if not in a religious order of builders like the Masons? Is it surprising that we find so few refere nces in later literature to what was thus held as a sacred secret? As we have seen, the legen d of Hiram was kept as a profound secret until 1841 by the French Companionage, who a lmost certainly learned it from the Free-masons. Naturally it was never made a matter o f record, 2 but was p. 193 transmitted by oral tradition within the order; and it was also natural, if not inevitable, that the legend of the master-artist of the Temple should be \"the Master's Part\" among Masons who were temple-builders. How else explain t he veiled allusions to the name in the Old Charges as read to Entered Apprentices, if it was not a se cret reserved for a higher rank of Mason? Why any disguise at all if it had no hidden meaning? Manifestly the motif of the Third Degree was purely Masonic, a nd we need not go outside the traditions of the order to account for it. Not content to trace the evolution of Masonry, even so able a man as Albert Pike will have it that to a few men of intelligence who belon ged to one of the four old lodges in 1717 \"is to be ascribed the authorship of the Third Degree, and the introduction of Hermetic and other symbols into Masonry; that they framed the three degrees for the purpose of communicating their doctrines, veiled by their symbols, to those fitted to"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"receive them, and gave to others trite moral explan ations they could comprehend.\" 1 How gracious of them to vouchsafe even trite explanatio ns, but why frame a set of degrees p. 194 to conceal what they wished to hide? This is the sa me idea of something alien imposed upon Masonry from without, with the added suggestio n, novel indeed, that Masonry was organized to hide the truth, rather than to teach i t. But did Masonry have to go outside its own history and tradition to learn Hermetic truths and symbols? Who was Hermes? Whether man or myth no one knows, but he was a grea t figure in the Egyptian Mysteries, and was called the Father of Wisdom. 1 What was his wisdom? From such fragments of his lore as have floated down to us, impaired, it m ay be, but always vivid, we discover that his wisdom was only a high spiritual faith and morality taught in visions and rhapsodies, and using numbers as symbols. Was such wisdom new to Masonry? Had not Hermes himself been a hero of the order from the fi rst, of whom we read in the Old Charges , in which he has a place of honor alongside Euclid and Pythagoras? Wherefore go elsewhere than to Masonry itself to trace the pure stream of Hermetic faith through the ages? Certainly the men of the Grand Lodge were ade pts, but they were Masonic adepts seeking to bring the buried temple of Masonry to li ght and reveal it in a setting befitting its beauty , not cultists making use of it to exploit a privat e scheme of the universe. p. 195 Who were those \"men of intelligence\" to whom Pike a scribed the making of the Third Degree of Masonry? Tradition has fixed upon Desagul iers as the ritualist of the Grand Lodge, and Lyon speaks of him as \"the pioneer and c o-fabricator of symbolical Masonry.\" 1 This, however, is an exaggeration, albeit Desaguli ers was worthy of high eulogy, as were Anderson and Payne, who are said to have been his collaborators. 2 But the fact is that p. 196 the Third Degree was not made; it grew--like the gr eat cathedrals, no one of which can be ascribed to a single artist, but to an order of men working in unity of enterprise and aspiration. The process by which the old ritual, de scribed in the Sloane MS , was divided and developed into three degrees between 1717 and 1 730 was so gradual, so imperceptible, that no exact date can be set; still less can it be attributed to any one or two men. From the minutes of the Musical Society we lea rn that the Lodge at the Queen's Head in Hollis Street was using three distinct degr ees in 1724. As early as 1727 we come upon the custom of setting apart a separate night f or the Master's Degree, the drama having evidently become more elaborate. Further than this the Degree may not be discussed, except to say that the Masons, tiring of the endless quarrels of sects, turned for relief to the Ancient Mysteries as handed down in their traditions--the old, high, heroic faith in God, and in the soul of man as the one unconquerable thing upon this earth. If, as Aristot le said, it be the mission of tragedy to"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"cleanse and exalt us, leaving us subdued with a sen se of pity and hope and fortified against ill fortune, it is permitted us to add that in p. 197 simplicity, depth, and power, in its grasp of the r ealities of the life of man, its portrayal of the stupidity of evil and the splendor of virtue, i ts revelation of that in our humanity which leads it to defy death, giving up everything, even to life itself, rather than defame, defile, or betray its moral integrity, and in its p rophecy of the victory of light over shadow, there is not another drama known among men like the Third Degree of Masonry. Edwin Booth, a loyal Mason, and no mean judge of th e essence of tragedy, left these words: In all my research and study, in all my close analy sis of the masterpieces of Shakespeare, in my earnest determination to make those plays appear re al on the mimic stage, I have never, and nowhere, met tragedy so real, so sublime, so magnif icent as the legend of Hiram. It is substance without shadow--the manifest destiny of life which requires no picture and scarcely a word to make a lasting impression upon all who can understa nd. To be a Worshipful Master, and to throw my whole soul into that work, with the candidate fo r my audience and the Lodge for my stage, would be a greater personal distinction than to rec eive the plaudits of people in the theaters of the world. Footnotes 175:1 We should not forget that noble dynasty of large a nd liberal souls in the seventeenth century--John Hales, Chillingsworth, Wh ich-cote, John Smith, Henry More, Jeremy Taylor--whose Liberty of Prophesying set the principle of toleration to stately strains of eloquence--Sir Thomas Browne, and Richar d Baxter; saints, every one of them, finely-poised, sweet-tempered, repelled from all ex tremes alike, and walking the middle path of wisdom and charity. Milton, too, taught tol erance in a bigoted and bitter age (see Seventeenth Century Men of Latitude , E. A. George). 176:1 For instance the Cooke MS , next to the oldest of all, as well as the W. Watson and York -o. 4 MSS . It is rather surprising, in view of the supremacy of the Church in those times, to find such p. 177 evidence of what Dr. Mackey called the chief missi on of primitive Masonry--the preservation of belief in th e unity of God. These MSS did not succumb to the theology of the Church, and their in vocations remind us more of the God of Isaiah than of the decrees of the Council of Nic æa. 178:1 It was, perhaps, a picture of the Masonic Lodges o f that era that Toland drew in his Socratic Society , published in 1720, which, however, he clothed in a vesture quite un- Grecian. At least, the symposia or brotherly feasts of his society, their give-and-take of questions and answers, their aversion to the rule o f mere physical force, to compulsory religious belief, and to creed hatred, as well as t heir mild and tolerant disposition and"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"their brotherly regard for one another, remind one of the spirit and habits of the Masons of that day. 179:1 Now is as good a time as another to name certain c urious theories which have been put forth to account for the origin of Masonry in g eneral, and of the organization of the Grand Lodge in particular. They are as follows: Fir st, that it was all due to an imaginary Temple of Solomon described by Lord Bacon in a utop ian romance called the -ew Atlantis ; and this despite the fact that the temple in the Bacon story was not a house at all, but the name of an ideal state. Second, that the ob ject of Freemasonry and the origin of the Third Degree was the restoration of Charles II to the throne of England; the idea being that the Masons, who called themselves \"Sons of the Widow,\" meant thereby to express their allegiance to the Queen. Third, that Freemasonry was founded by Oliver Cromwell--he of all men!--to defeat the royalists. Fourth, that Free-masons were derived from the order of the Knights Templars. Even Lessin g once held this theory, but seems later to have given it up. Which one of these theor ies surpasses the others in absurdity, it would be hard to say. De Quincey explodes them one by one with some detail in his \"Inquiry into the p. 180 Origin of the Free-masons,\" to which he might also have added his own pet notion of the Rosicrucian origin of the ord er--it being only a little less fantastic than the rest (De Quincey's Works, vol. xvi). 183:1 Of the Masonic feasts of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist much has been written, and to little account. In pre-Christi an times, as we have seen, the Roman Collegia were wont to adopt pagan deities as patron s. When Christianity came, the names of its saints--some of them martyrs of the order of builders--were substituted for the old pagan gods. Why the two Saints John were chosen by Masons--rather than St. Thomas, who was the patron saint of architecture--has never been made clear. At any rate, these two feasts, coming at the time of the summer and wi nter solstices, are in reality older than Christianity, being reminiscences of the old Light Religion in which Masonry had its origin. 183:2 The badge of office was a huge white apron, such a s we see in Hogarth's picture of the -ight . The collar was of much the same shape as that at present in use, only shorter. When the color was changed to blue, and why, is unc ertain, but probably not until 1813, when we begin to see both apron and collar edged wi th blue. (See chapter on \"Clothing and Regalia,\" in Things a Freemason Ought to Know , by J. W. Crowe.) In 1727 the officers of all private--or as we would say, subord inate--Lodges were ordered to wear \"the jewels of Masonry hanging to a white apron.\" I n 1731 we find the Grand Master wearing gold or gilt jewels pendant to blue ribbons about the neck, and a white leather apron lined with blue silk. 184:1 This is clear from the book of Constitutions of 1723, which is said to be \"for the use of Lodges in London.\" Then follow the names of the Masters and Wardens of twenty Lodges, all in London. There was no thought at the time of imposing the authority of the Grand Lodge upon the country in general, much less upon the world. Its growth we shall sketch later.

Apparently the Goose and Gridiron Lodge--No. 1--is the only one of the four now in ex istence. After various changes of name it is now the Lodge of Antiquity, No. 2. 185:1 Royal Masons , by G. W. Speth. 187:1 From a meager sketch of Dr. Anderson in the Gentle men's Magazine, 1783, we learn that he was a native of Scotland--the place o f his birth is not given--and that for many years he was minister of the Scots Presbyteria n Church in Swallow Street, Piccadilly, and well known to the folk of that fait h in London--called \"Bishop\" Anderson by his friends. He married the widow of an army off icer, who bore him a son and a daughter. Although a learned man--compiler of a boo k of Royal Genealogies , which seems to have been his hobby--he was somewhat impru dent in business, having lost most of his property in 1720. Whether he was a Mason bef ore coming to London is unknown, but he took a great part in the work of the Grand L odge, entering it, apparently, in p. 188 1721. Toward the close of his life he suffered many misfortunes, but of what description we are not told. He died in 1739. Perhaps his learn ing was exaggerated by his Masonic eulogists, but he was a noble man and manifestly a useful one (Gould's History of Masonry , vol. iii). 189:1 Having emphasized this point so repeatedly, the wr iter feels it just to himself to state his own position, lest he be thought a kind o f materialist, or at least an enemy of mysticism. Not so. Instead, he has long been an hum ble student of the great mystics; they are his best friends--as witness his two little boo ks, The Eternal Christ , and What Have the Saints to Teach Us ? But mysticism is one thing, and mystification is another, and the former may be stated in this way: First, by mysticism--only another word for spiritua lity--is meant our sense of an Unseen World, of our citizenship in it, of God and the sou l, and of all the forms of life and beauty as symbols p. 190 of things higher than themselves. That is to say, if a man has any religion at all that is not mere theory or form, he is a mys tic; the difference between him and Plato or St. Francis being only a matter of genius and sp iritual culture--between a boy whistling a tune and Beethoven writing music. Second, since mysticism is native to the soul of ma n and the common experience of all who rise above the animal, it is not an exclusive p ossession of any set of adepts to be held as a secret. Any man who bows in prayer, or lifts h is thought heavenward, is an initiate into the eternal mysticism which is the strength an d solace of human life. Third, the old time Masons were religious men, and as such sharers in this great human experience of divine things, and did not need to go to Hidden Teachers to learn mysticism. They lived and worked in the light of it . It shone in their symbols, as it does in"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"all symbols that have any meaning or beauty. It is, indeed, the soul of symbolism, every emblem being an effort to express a reality too gre at for words. So, then, Masonry is mystical as music is mystical- -like poetry, and love, and faith, and prayer, and all else that makes it worth our time t o live; but its mysticism is sweet, sane, and natural, far from fantastic, and in nowise eeri e, unreal, or unbalanced. Of course these words fail to describe it, as all words must, and it is therefore that Masonry uses parables, pictures, and symbols. 190:1 Seventeenth Century Descriptions of Solomon's Templ e , by Prof. S.

Had he done so, would it ha ve met with such instant and universal acceptance by old Masons who stood for th e ancient usages of the order? 193:1 Letter to Gould \"Touching Masonic Symbolism.\" 194:1 Hermes and Plato , Edouard Schure. 195:1 History of the Lodge of Edinburgh . 195:2 Steinbrenner, following Findel, speaks of the Thir d Degree as if it were a pure invention, quoting a passage from Ahiman Rezon , by Lawrence Dermott, to prove it. He further states that Anderson and Desaguliers were \" publicly accused of manufacturing the degree, which they never denied \" ( History of Masonry , chap. vii). But inasmuch as they were not accused of it until they had been many yea rs in their graves, their silence is hardly to be wondered at. Dr. Mackey styles Desagul iers \"the Father of Modern Speculative Masonry,\" and attributes to him, more t han to any other one man, the present existence of the order as a living institution ( Encyclopedia of Freemasonry ). Surely that is going too far, much as Desaguliers deserves to b e honored by the order. Dr. J. T. Desaguliers was a French Protestant clergyman, whos e family came to England following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was gradu ated from Christ Church College, Oxford, in 1710, succeeding Neill as lecturer in Ex perimental Philosophy.

Howbeit, one generation of men, as Hume re-marks, d oes not go off the stage at once, and another succeed, like silkworms and butterflies . No more did this metamorphosis of Masonry, so to name it, take place suddenly or radi cally, as it has become the fashion to think. It was a slow process, and like every such p eriod the Epoch of Transition was attended by many problems, uncertainties, and diffi culties. Some of the Lodges, as we have noted, would never agree to admit Accepted Mas ons, so jealous were they of the ancient landmarks of the Craft. Even the Grand Lodg e, albeit a revival of the old Assembly, was looked upon with suspicion by not a f ew, as tending toward undue centralization; and not without cause. From the fir st the Grand Master was given more power than was ever granted to the President of an ancient Assembly; of necessity so, perhaps, but it led to misunderstanding. Other infl uences added to the confusion, and at the same time emphasized the need of welding the or der into a more coherent unity for its wider service to humanity. p. 203 There are hints to the effect that the new Masonry, if so it may be called, made very slow progress in the public favor at first, owing to the conditions just stated; and this despite the remark of Anderson in June, 1719: \"Now several old Brothers that had neglected the Craft, visited the Lodges; some Noblemen were also made Brothers, and more new Lodges were constituted.\" Stuckely, the antiquarian , tells us in his Diary under date of January, 1721--at which time he was initiated--that he was the first person made a Mason in London for years, and that it was not easy to fi nd men enough to perform the ceremony. Incidentally, he confides to us that he e ntered the order in search of the long hidden secrets of \"the Ancient Mysteries.\" No doubt he exaggerated in the matter of numbers, though it is possible that initiations wer e comparatively few at the time, the Lodges being recruited, for the most part, by the a dhesion of old Masons, both Operative and Speculative; and among his friends he may have had some difficulty in finding men with an adequate knowledge of the ritual. But that there was any real difficulty in gathering together seven Masons in London is, on th e face of it, absurd. Immediately thereafter, Stuckely records, Masonry \"took a run, and ran itself out of breath through the folly of its members,\" but he does not tell us what the folly was. The \"run\" referred to was almost p. 204 certainly due to the acceptance by the Duke of Mont agu of the Grand Mastership, which gave the order a prestige it had never had before; and it was also in the same year, 1721, that the old Constitutions of the Craft were revise d. Twelve Lodges attended the June quarterly communica tion of the Grand Lodge in 1721, sixteen in September, twenty in December, and by Ap ril, 1723, the number had grown to thirty. All these Lodges, be it noted, were in Lond on, a fact amply justifying the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"optimism of Anderson in the last paragraph of the Book of Constitutions , issued in that year. So far the Grand Lodge had not extended its j urisdiction beyond London and Westminster, but the very next year, 1724, there we re already nine Lodges in the provinces acknowledging its obedience, the first be ing the Lodge at the Queen's Head, City of Bath. Within a few years Masonry extended i ts labors abroad, both on British and on foreign soil. The first Lodge on foreign soil wa s founded by the Duke of Wharton at Madrid, in 1728, and regularized the following year , by which time a Lodge had been established at the East India Arms, Bengal, and als o at Gibraltar. It was not long before Lodges arose in many lands, founded by English Maso ns or by men who had received initiation in England; these Lodges, when sufficien tly numerous, uniting under Grand Lodges--the old Lodge at York, that p. 205 ancient Mecca of Masonry, had called itself a Grand Lodge as early as 1725. The Grand Lodge of Ireland was created in 1729, those of Scot land 1 and France in 1736; a Lodge at Hamburg in 1737, 2 though it was not patented until 1740; the Unity L odge at Frankfort- on-the-Main in 1742, another at Vienna the same yea r; the Grand Lodge of the Three World-spheres at Berlin in 1744; and so on, until t he order made its advent in Sweden, Switzer-land, Russia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. Following the footsteps of Masonry from land to lan d is almost as difficult as tracing its early history, owing to the secrecy in which it enw rapped p. 206 its movements. For example, in 1680 there came to S outh Carolina one John Moore, a native of England, who before the close of the cent ury removed to Philadelphia, where, in 1703, he was Collector of the Port. In a letter wri tten by him in 1715, he mentions having \"spent a few evenings in festivity with my Masonic brethren.\" 1 This is the first vestige of Masonry in America, unless we accept as authentic a curious document in the early history of Rhode Island, as follows: \"This ye [day and month obliterated] 1656, Wee mett att y House off Mordicai Campanell and after synago g gave Abram Moses the degrees of Maconrie.\" 2 On June 5, 1730, the first authority for the assem bling of Free-masons in America was issued by the Duke of Norfolk, to Danie l Coxe, of New Jersey, appointing him Provincial Grand Master of New York, New Jersey , and Pennsylvania; and three years later Henry Price, of Boston, was appointed t o the same office for New England. But Masons had evidently been coming to the New Wor ld for years, for the p. 207 two cases just cited date back of the Grand Lodge o f 1717. How soon Coxe acted on the authority given him is n ot certain, but the Pennsylvania Gazette , published by Benjamin Franklin, contains many ref erences to Masonic affairs as early as July, 1730. Just when Franklin himself bec ame interested in Masonry is not of record--he was initiated in 1730-31 1 --but he was a leader, at that day, of everything t hat"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"would advance his adopted city; and the \"Junto,\" fo rmed in 1725, often inaccurately called the Leathern-Apron Club, owed its origin to him. In a Masonic item in the Gazette of December 3, 1730, he refers to \"several Lodges o f Free-masons\" in the Province, and on June 9, 1732, notes the organization of the Gran d Lodge of Pennsylvania, of which he was appointed a Warden, at the Sun Tavern, in Water Street. Two years later Franklin was elected Grand Master, and the same year publish ed an edition of the Book of Constitutions --the first Masonic book issued in America. p. 208 [paragraph continues] Thus Masonry made an early advent into the new wor ld, in which it has labored so nobly, helping to lay the foundations an d building its own basic principles into the organic law of the greatest of all republics. II Returning to the Grand Lodge of England, we have no w to make record of ridicule and opposition from without, and, alas, of disloyalty a nd discord within the order itself. With the publication of the Book of Constitutions , by Anderson, in 1723, the platform and principles of Masonry became matters of common know ledge, and its enemies were alert and vigilant. None are so blind as those who will n ot see, and not a few, unacquainted with the spirit of Masonry, or unable to grasp its principle of liberality and tolerance, affected to detect in its secrecy some dark politic al design; and this despite the noble charge in the Book of Constitutions enjoining politics from entering the lodge--a char ge hardly less memorable than the article defining its attitude toward differing religious creeds, and which it behooves Masons to keep always in mind as both true and wise, especially in our day when effort is being made to inject the religious issue into politics: In order to preserve peace and harmony no private p iques or quarrels must be brought within the door of p. 209 the Lodge, far less any quarrel about Religions or Nations or State-Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholic Religion above men tioned (the religion in which all men agree); we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds and L anguages, and are resolved against all Politics as what never yet conduced to the welfare of the Lo dge, nor ever will. This charge has always been actively enjoined and observed; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain or the dissent and secession of these Nations from the com munion of Rome. No sooner had these noble words been printed, 1 than there came to light a secret society calling itself the \"truly Ancient Noble Order of th e Gormogons,\" alleged to have been instituted by Chin-Quaw Ky-Po, the first Emperor of China, many thousand years before Adam. Notice of a meeting of the order appeared in the Daily Post , September 3, 1723, in which it was stated, among other high-sounding decl arations, that \"no Mason will be received as a Member till he has renounced his nobl e order and been properly degraded.\" Obviously, from this notice and others of like kind --all hinting at the secrets of the Lodges--the order was p. 210"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"aping Masonry by way of parody with intent to destr oy it, if possible, by ridicule. For all that, if we may believe the Saturday Post of Octobe r following, \"many eminent Freemasons\" had by that time \"degraded themselves\" and gone over to the Gormogons. Not \"many\" perhaps, but, alas, one eminent Mason at least, none other than a Past Grand Master, the Duke of Wharton, who, piqued at an act of the Grand Lodge, had turned against it. Erratic of mind, unstable of morals, ha ving an inordinate lust for praise, and pilloried as a \"fool\" by Pope in his Moral Essays, he betrayed his fraternity--as, later, he turned traitor to his faith, his flag, and his nati ve land! Simultaneously with the announcement that many emin ent Masons had \"degraded themselves\"--words most fitly chosen--and gone over to the Gormogons, there appeared a book called the Grand Mystery of Freemasons Discovered , and the cat was out of the bag. Everything was plain to the Masons, and if it had not been clear, the way in which the writer emphasized his hatred of the Jesuits wou ld have told it all. It was a Jesuit 1 plot hatched p. 211 in Rome to expose the secrets of Masonry, and makin g use of the dissolute and degenerate Mason for that purpose--tactics often en ough used in the name of Jesus! Curiously enough, this was further made evident by the fact that the order ceased to exist in 1738, the year in which Clement XII published hi s Bull against the Masons. Thereupon the \"ancient order of Gormogons\" swallowed itself, and so disappeared--not, however, without one last, futile effort to achieve its ends . 1 Naturally this episode stirred the Masons deeply. It was denounced in burning words on the floor of the Grand Lodge, which took new caution to guard its rites from trea chery and vandalism, in which respects it had not exercised due care, admitting men to the order who were unworthy of the honor. p. 212 There were those who thought that the power of Maso nry lay in its secrecy; some think so still, not knowing that its real power lies in the sanctity of its truth, the simpl icity of its faith, the sweetness of its spirit, and its service to mankind, and that if all its rites were made public today it would still hold the hearts of men. 1 Nevertheless, of alleged exposures there were many between 1724 and 1730, bo th anonymous and signed, and they made much ado, especially among men who were n ot Masons. It will be enough to name the most famous, as well as the most elaborate , of them all, Masonry Dissected , by Samuel Prichard, which ran through three editions i n one month, October, 1730, and called out a noble Defence of Masonry , written, it is thought, by Anderson, but the present writer believes by Desaguliers. Others came later, such as Jachin and Boaz , the Three Distinct Knocks , and so forth. They had their day and ceased to be , having now only an antiquarian interest to those who would kno w the manners and customs of a far- off time. Instead of injuring the order, they reall y helped it, as such things usually do, by showing that there must be something p. 213"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"to expose since so many were trying to do it. But M asonry went marching on, leaving them behind in the rubbish of things forgotten, as it does all its back-stair spies and heel- snapping critics. More serious by far was the series of schisms withi n the order which began in 1725, and ran on even into the next century. For the student they make the period very complex, calculated to bewilder the beginner; for when we re ad of four Grand Lodges in England, and for some years all of them running at once, and each one claiming to be the Grand Lodge of England, the confusion seems not a little confounded. Also, one Grand Lodge of a very limited territory, and few adherents, ado pted the title of Grand Lodge of all England, while another which commenced in the middl e of the century assumed the title of \"The Ancients,\" and dubbed the older and parent Grand Lodge \"The Moderns.\" Besides, there are traces of an unrecorded Grand bo dy calling itself \"The Supreme Grand Lodge,\" 1 as if each were trying to make up in name what was lacking in numbers. Strict search and due inquiry into the causes of these div isions would seem to show the following results: p. 214 First, there was a fear, not unjustified by facts, that the ancient democracy of the order had been infringed upon by certain acts of the Gran d Lodge of 1717--as, for example, giving to the Grand Master power to appoint the War dens. 1 Second, there was a tendency, due to the influence of some clergymen ac tive in the order, to give a distinctively Christian tinge to Masonry, first in their interpretations of its symbols, and later to the ritual itself. This fact has not been enough emphasized by our historians, for it explains much. Third, there was the further fact th at Masonry in Scotland differed from Masonry in England, in details at least, and the tw o did not all at once harmonize, each being rather tenacious of its usage and tradition, Fourth, in one instance, if no more, pride of locality and historic memories led to independen t organization. Fifth, there was the ever-present element of personal ambition with whic h all human societies, of whatever kind, must reckon at all times and places this side p. 215 of heaven. Altogether, the situation was amply cond ucive to division, if not to explosion, and the wonder is that the schisms were so few. III Time out of mind the ancient city of York had been a seat of the Masonic Craft, tradition tracing it back to the days of Athelstan, in 926 A. D. Be that as it may, the Lodge minutes of York are the oldest in the country, and the reli cs of the Craft now preserved in that city entitle it to be called the Mecca of Masonry. Wheth er the old society was a Private or a Grand Lodge is not plain; but in 1725 it assumed th e title of the \"Grand Lodge of All England,\"--feeling, it would seem, that its inheren t right by virtue of antiquity had in some way been usurped by the Grand Lodge of London. After ten or fifteen years the minutes cease, but the records of other grand bodie s speak of it as still working. In 1761"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"six of its surviving members revived the Grand Lodg e, which continued with varying success until its final extinction in 1791, having only a few subordinate Lodges, chiefly in Yorkshire. Never antagonistic, it chose to remain i ndependent, and its history is a noble tradition. York Masonry was acknowledged by all par ties to be both ancient and orthodox, and even to this day, in England and over p. 216 the seas, a certain mellow, magic charm clings to t he city which was for so long a meeting place of Masons. 1 Far more formidable was the schism of 1753, which h ad its origin, as is now thought, in a group of Irish Masons in London who were not recogn ized by the premier Grand Lodge. 2 Whereupon they denounced the Grand Lodge, averring that it had adopted \"new plans\" and departed from the old landmarks, reverte d, as they alleged, to the old forms, and set themselves up as Ancient Masons--bestowing upon their rivals the odious nam e of Moderns . Later the two were further distinguished from eac h other by the names of their respective Grand Masters, one called Prince of Wale s' Masons, the other the Atholl Masons. 3 The great figure in the Atholl Grand body was Lawr ence Dermott, to whose keen pen and indefatigable industry as its secretar y for more than thirty years was due, in large measure, its success. In 1756 he published it s first book of laws, entitled Ahiman Rezon, Or Help to a Brother , much of which was taken from the p. 217 [paragraph continues] Irish Constitutions of 1751, by Pratt, and the rest from the Book of Constitutions , by Anderson--whom he did not fail to criticize wi th stinging satire, of which he was a master. Among other things, the offi ce of Deacon seems to have had its origin with this body. Atholl Masons were presided over by the Masters of affiliated Lodges until 1756, when Lord Blessington, their fir st titled Grand Master, was induced to accept the honor--their warrants having been left b lank betimes, awaiting the coming of a Nobleman to that office. Later the fourth Duke of A tholl was Grand Master at the same time of Scotland and of the Atholl Grand Lodge, the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland being represented at his installation in Lo ndon. Still another schism, not serious but significant, came in 1778, led by William Preston, 1 who afterwards became a shining light in the order. On St. John's Day, December 27, 1777, the Antiquity p. 218 [paragraph continues] Lodge of London, of which Preston was Master--one of the four original Lodges forming the Grand Lodge--attended church in a body, to hear a sermon by its Chaplain. They robed in the vestry, and then marche d into the church, but after the service they walked back to the Hall wearing their Masonic clothing. Difference of opinion arose as to the regularity of the act, Pres ton holding it to be valid, if for no other reason, by virtue of the inherent right of Antiquit y Lodge itself. Three members objected"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"to his ruling and appealed to the Grand Lodge, he f oolishly striking their names off the Lodge roll for so doing. Eventually the Grand Lodge took the matter up, decided against Preston, and ordered the reinstatement of the three protesting members. At its next meeting the Antiquity Lodge voted not to comply wit h the order of the Grand Lodge, and, instead, to withdraw from that body and form a n alliance with the \"Old Grand Lodge of All England at York City,\" as they called it. Th ey were received by the York Grand Lodge, and soon thereafter obtained a constitution for a \"Grand Lodge of England South of the Trent.\" Although much vitality was shown at the outset, this body only constituted two subordinate Lodges, and ceased to exist. Having failed, in 1789 Preston and his friends recanted their folly, apologized to the Gra nd Lodge, reunited with the men whom they had expelled, and were p. 219 received back into the fold; and so the matter ende d. These divisions, while they were in some ways unhap py, really made for the good of the order in the sequel--the activity of contending Gra nd Lodges, often keen, and at times bitter, promoting the spread of its principles to w hich all were alike loyal, and to the enrichment of its Ritual 1 to which each contributed. Dermott, an able execut ive and audacious antagonist, had left no stone unturned to advance the interests of Atholl Masonry, inducing its Grand Lodge to grant warrants to army Lodges, which bore fruit in making Masons in every part of the world where the English army went. 2 Howbeit, p. 220 when that resourceful secretary and uncompromising fighter had gone to his long rest, a better mood began to make itself felt, and a desire to heal the feud and unite all the Grand Lodges--the way having been cleared, meanwhile, by the demise of the old York Grand Lodge and the \"Grand Lodge South of the Trent.\" Ove rtures to that end were made in 1802 without avail, but by 1809 committees were mee ting and reporting on the \"propriety and practicability of union.\" Fraternal letters wer e exchanged, and at last a joint committee met, canvassed all differences, and found a way to heal the schism. 1 p. 221 Union came at length, in a great Lodge of Reconcili ation held in Freemason's Hall, London, on St. John's Day, December 27, 1813. It wa s a memorable and inspiring scene as the two Grand Lodges, so long estranged, filed i nto the Hall--delegates of 641 Modern and 359 Ancient or Atholl Lodges--so mixed as to be indistinguishable the one from the other. Both Grand Masters had seats of honor in the East. The hour was fraternal, each side willing to sacrifice prejudice in behalf of pr inciples held by all in common, and all equally anxious to preserve the ancient landmarks o f the Craft--a most significant fact being that the Atholl Masons had insisted that Maso nry erase such distinctively Christian color as had crept into it, and return to its first platform. 1 Once united, free of feud, cleansed of p. 222"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"rancor, and holding high its unsectarian, non-parti san flag, Masonry moved forward to her great ministry. If we would learn the lesson of those long dead schisms, we must be vigilant, correcting our judgments, improving our r egulations, and cultivating that spirit of Love which is the fountain whence issue all our voluntary efforts for what is right and true: union in essential matters, liberty in everyt hing unimportant and doubtful; Love always--one bond, one universal law, one fellowship in spirit and in truth! IV Remains now to give a glimpse--and, alas, only a gl impse--of the growth and influence of Masonry in America; and a great story it is, needin g many volumes to tell it aright. As we have seen, it came early to the shores of the New W orld, long before the name of our great republic had been uttered, and with its gospe l of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity it helped to shape the institutions of this Continent. Down the Atlantic Coast, along the Great Lakes, into the wilderness of the Middle West and the forests of the far South-- westward it p. 223 marched as \"the star of empire\" led, setting up its altar on .remote frontiers, a symbol of civilization, of loyalty to law and order, of frien dship with school-house and church. If history recorded the unseen influences which go to the making of a nation, those forces for good which never stop, never tarry, never tire, and of which our social order is the outward and visible sign, then might the real story of Masonry in America be told. Instead of a dry chronicle, 1 let us make effort to capture and portray the spir it of Masonry in American history, if so that all may see how this great order actually presided over the birth of the republic, with whose growth i t has had so much to do. For example, no one need be told what patriotic memories cluster about the old Green Dragon Tavern, p. 224 in Boston, which Webster, speaking at Andover in 18 23, called \" the headquarters of the Revolution .\" Even so, but it was also a Masonic Hall , in the \"Long Room\" of which the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts--an off-shoot of St. A ndrew's Lodge--was organized on St. John's Day, 1767, with Joseph Warren, who after wards fell at Bunker Hill, as Grand Master. There Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, Warren, Ha ncock, Otis and others met and passed resolutions, and then laid schemes to make t hem come true. There the Boston Tea Party was planned, and executed by Masons disguised as Mohawk Indians--not by the Lodge as such, but by a club formed within the Lodg e, calling itself the Caucus Pro Bono Publico , of which Warren was the leading spirit, and in wh ich, says Elliott, \"the plans of the Sons of Liberty were matured.\" As Henry Purkett used to say, he was present at the famous Tea Party as a spectator, and in disobedienc e to the order of the Master of the Lodge, who was actively present. 1 As in Massachusetts, so throughout the Colonies--th e Masons were everywhere active in behalf of a nation \"conceived in liberty and dedica ted to the proposition that all men are"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"created equal.\" Of the men who signed the Declarati on of Independence, the following are known to have been p. 225 members of the order: William Hooper, Benjamin Fran klin, Matthew Thornton, William Whipple, John Hancock, Philip Livingston, Thomas Ne lson; and no doubt others, if we had the Masonic records destroyed during the war. I ndeed, it has been said that, with four men out of the room, the assembly could have been o pened in form as a Masonic Lodge, on the Third Degree. Not only Washington, 1 but nearly all of his generals, were Masons; such at least as Greene, Lee, Marion, Sullivan, Ruf us and Israel Putnam, Edwards, Jackson, Gist, Baron Steuben, Baron De Kalb, and th e Marquis de Lafayette who was made a Mason in one of the many military Lodges hel d in the Continental Army. 2 If the history of those old camp-lodges could be written, what a story it would tell. Not only did they initiate such men as Alexander Hamilton and Jo hn Marshall, the immortal Chief Justice, but they made the spirit of Masonry felt i n \"times that try men's souls\" 3 --a spirit passing through picket-lines, eluding sentinels, an d softening the horrors of war. p. 226 Laying aside their swords, these Masons helped to l ay wide and deep the foundations of that liberty under the law which has made this nati on, of a truth, \"the last great hope of man.\" Nor was it an accident, but a scene in accord with the fitness of things, that George Washington was sworn into office as the first Presi dent of the Republic by the Grand Master of New York, taking his oath on a Masonic Bi ble. It was a parable of the whole period. If the Magna Charta demanded rights which g overnment can grant, Masonry from the first asserted those inalienable rights which m an derives from God the rather of men. Never did this truth find sweeter voice than in the tones of the old Scotch fiddle on which Robert Burns, a Master Mason, sang, in lyric glee, of the sacredness of the soul, and the native dignity of humanity as the only basis of soc iety and the state. That music went marching on, striding over continents and seas, unt il it found embodiment in the Constitution and laws of this nation, where today m ore than a million Masons are citizens. How strange, then, that Masonry should have been ma de the victim of the most bitter and baseless persecution, for it was nothing else, in t he annals p. 227 of the Republic. Yet so it came to pass between 182 6 and 1845, in connection with the Morgan 1 affair, of which so much has been written, and so little truth told. Alas, it was an evil hour when, as Galsworthy would say, \"men ju st feel something big and religious, and go blind to justice, fact, and reason.\" Althoug h Lodges everywhere repudiated and denounced the crime, if crime it was, and the Gover nor of New York, himself a Mason, made every effort to detect and punish those involv ed, the fanaticism p. 228"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"would not be stayed: the mob-mood ruled. An Anti-Ma sonic political party 1 was formed, fed on frenzy, and the land was stirred from end to end. Even such a man as John Quincy Adams, of great credulity and strong prejudice, was drawn into the fray, and in a series of letters flayed Masonry as an enemy of society and a free state--forgetting that Washington, Franklin, Marshall, and Warren were mem bers of the order! Meanwhile-- and, verily, it was a mean while--Weed, Seward, Tha ddeus Stevens, and others of their ilk, rode into power on the strength of it, as they had planned to do, defeating Henry Clay for President, because he was a Mason--and, inciden tally, electing Andrew Jackson, another Mason! Let it be said that, if the Masons f ound it hard to keep within the Compass, they at least acted on the Square. Finally the fury spent itself, leaving the order purged of feeble men who were Masons only in form, and a revival of Masonry followed, slowly at first, and then with great rapidity. No sooner had Masonry recovered from this or-deal t han the dark clouds of Civil War covered the land like a pall--the saddest of all wa rs, dividing a nation one in arts and arms and historic memories, p. 229 and leaving an entail of blood and fire and tears. Let it be forever remembered that, while churches were severed and states were seceding, the Masonic order remained unbroken in that wild and fateful hour. An effort was made t o involve Masonry in the strife, but the wise counsel of its leaders, North and South, preve nted the mixing of Masonry with politics; and while it could not avert the tragedy, it did much to mitigate the woe of it-- building rainbow bridges of mercy and goodwill from army to army. Though passion may have strained, it could not break the tie of Ma sonic love, which found a ministry on red fields, among the sick, the wounded, and those in prison; and many a man in gray planted a Sprig of Acacia on the grave of a man who wore the blue. Some day the writer hopes to tell that story, or a part of it, and then men will under-stand what Masonry is, what it means, and what it can do to heal the hurts of humanity. 1 p. 230 Even so it has been, all through our national histo ry, and today Masonry is worth more for the sanctity and safety of this republic than b oth its army and its navy. At every turn of events, when the rights of man have been threate ned by enemies obvious or insidious, it has stood guard--its altar lights like signal fi res along the heights of liberty, keeping watch. Not only in our own land, but everywhere ove r the broad earth, when men have thrown off the yoke of tyranny, whether political o r spiritual, and demanded the rights that belong to manhood, they have found a friend in the Masonic order--as did Mazzini and Garibaldi in Italy. Nor must we be less alert a nd vigilant today when, free of danger of foes from without, our republic is imperiled by the negligence of indifference, the seduction of luxury, the machinations of politician s, and the shadow of a passion- clouded, impatient discontent, whose end is madness and folly; lest the most hallowed of all liberties be lost."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Love thou thy land, with love far-brought From out the storied past, and used p. 231 Within the present, but transfused Through future time by power of thought.

Forming one vast society of free men, hel d together by voluntary obligations, it covers the whole globe from Egypt to India, from Italy to England, from America to Australia, and the isles of the sea; from London to Sidney, from Chicago to Calcutta. In all civilized lands, and among folk of every creed worthy of the name, Masonry is found- -and everywhere it upholds all the redeeming ideals of humanity, making all good things better by its presence, like a stream underflowing a meadow. 1 Also, wherever Masonry flourishes and is allowed to build freely after its divine design, liberty, justice, education, and true religion flourish; and where it is hindere d, they suffer. Indeed, he who would reckon the spiritual possessions of the race, and e stimate the forces that make for social beauty, national greatness, and human welfare, must take account of the genius of p. 232 [paragraph continues] Masonry and its ministry to the higher life of the race. Small wonder that such an order has won to its fell owship men of the first order of intellect, men of thought and action in many lands, and every walk and work of life: soldiers like Wellington, Blucher, and Garibaldi; p hilosophers like Krause, Fichte, and John Locke; patriots like Washington and Mazzini; w riters like Walter Scott, Voltaire, Steele, Lessing, Tolstoi; poets like Goethe, Burns, Byron, Kipling, Pike; musicians like Haydn and Mozart--whose opera, The Magic Flute , has a Masonic motif; masters of drama like Forrest and Edwin Booth; editors such as Bowles, Prentice, Childs, Grady; ministers of many communions, from Bishop Potter to Robert Collyer; statesmen, philanthropists, educators, jurists, men of science --Masons many, 1 whose names shine like stars in the great world's crown of intellectu al p. 233 and spiritual glory. What other order has ever brou ght together men of such diverse type, temper, training, interest, and achievement, unitin g them at an altar of prayer in the worship of God and the service of man? For the rest, if by some art one could trace those invisible influences which move to and fro like shuttles in a loom, weaving the network of laws, reverences, sanctities which make the warp and woof of society--giving to statut es their dignity and power, to the gospel its opportunity, to the home its canopy of p eace and beauty, to the young an enshrinement of inspiration, and to the old a mantl e of protection; if one had such art, then he might tell the true story of Masonry.

Indeed, it still exists in some form, and an interesting account of its forms, degrees, symbols, usages, and traditions may be found in an article on \"Operative Masonry,\" by C. F. Stretton ( Transactions Leicester Lodge of Research , 1909-10, 1911- 12). The second of these volumes also contains an e ssay on \"Operative Free-masons,\" by Thomas Carr, with a list of lodges, and a study of their history, customs, and emblems-- especially the Swastika. Speculative Masons are now said to be joining these Operative Lodges, seeking more light on what are called the L ost Symbols of Masonry. 205:1 The Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland, it may b e added, were self-constituted, without assistance or intervention from England in any form. 205:2 A deputation of the Hamburg Lodge initiated Freder ick--afterwards Frederick the Great of Prussia--into the order of Masons at Bruns wick, August 14, 1738 ( Frederick and his Times , by Campbell, History of Frederick , by Carlyle, Findel's History of Masonry ). Other noblemen followed his example, and their zeal for the order gave a new date to the history of Masonry in Germany. When Frederick ascen ded the throne, in 1740, the Craft was honored, and it flourished in his kingdom. As t o the interest of Frederick in the order in his later years, the facts are not clear, but th at he remained its friend seems certain (Mackey, Encyclopedia ). However, the Craft underwent many vicissitudes i n Germany, a detailed account of which Findel recites ( History of Masonry ).

F. Sachse. Oddly enough, there is no mention of Masonry by Franklin in his Autobiography , or in any of his letters, with but two exceptions, so far as known; which is the more remarkable when we look at his Masonic career in France during the later years of his life, where he was actively and intimately associated with the order, even advancin g to the higher degrees. Never for a day did he abate by one jot his interest in the ord er, or his love for it. 209:1 This injunction was made doubly strong in the edit ion of the Book of Constitutions , in 1738. For example: \"no quarrels about nations, f amilies, religion or politics must by any means or under any color or pretense whatever b e brought within the door of the Lodge . . . Masons being of all nations upon the sq uare, level and plumb; and like our predecessors in all ages, we are resolved against p olitical disputes,\" etc. 210:1 Masons have sometimes been absurdly called \"Protes tant Jesuits,\" but the two orders are exactly opposite in spirit, principle, p urpose, and method. All that they have in common is that they are both secret societies, whic h makes it plain that the opposition of the Latin church to Masonry is not on the ground of its being a secret p. 211 order, else why sanction the Jesuits, to name no other? The differe nce has been stated in this way: \"Opposite poles these two societies are, for each p ossesses precisely those qualities which the other lacks. The Jesuits are strongly centraliz ed, the Freemasons only con-federated. Jesuits are controlled by one man's will, Freemason s are under majority rule. Jesuits bottom morality in expediency, Freemasons in regard for the well-being of mankind. Jesuits recognize only one creed, Freemasons hold i n respect all honest convictions.

In 1735 it was resolved in the G rand Lodge \"that in the future all Grand Officers (except Grand Master) shall be selec ted out of that body\"--meaning the past Grand Stewards. This act was amazing. Already the Craft had let go its power to elect the Wardens, and now the choice of the Grand Master was narrowed to the ranks of an oligarchy in its worst form--a queer outcome of Masonic equality. Three months later the Grand Stewards presented a memorial asking that they \"might form themselves into a special lodge,\" with special jewels, etc. Naturally this bred discontent and apprehension, and justly so. 216:1 Often we speak of \"the York Rite,\" as though it we re the oldest and truest form of Masonry, but, while it serves to distinguish one br anch of Masonry from another, it is not accurate; for, strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a York Rite. The name is more a tribute of reverence than a description of fact. 216:2 Masonic Facts and Fictions , by Henry Sadler. 216:3 Atholl Lodges , by R. F. Gould. 217:1 William Preston was born in Edinburgh in 1742, and came as a journeyman printer to London in 1760, where he made himself conversant with the history, laws, and rites of the Craft, being much in demand as a lecturer. He w as a good speaker, and frequently addressed the Lodges of the city. After his blunder of seceding had been forgiven, he was honored with many offices, especially the Grand Sec retaryship, which gave him time to pursue his studies. Later he wrote the Freemason's Callender , an appendix to the Book of Constitutions , a History of Masonry , and, most famous of all, Illustrations of Masonry , which passed through a score of editions. Besides, he had much to do with the development of the Ritual. 219:1 The history of the Ritual is most interesting, and should be written in more detail ( History of Masonry , by Steinbrenner, chap. vii, \"The Ritual\"). An art icle giving a brief story of it appeared in the Masonic Monthly , of Boston, November, 1863 (reprinted in the -ew England Craftsman , vol. vii, and still later in the Bulletin of Iowa Masonic Library , vol. xv, April, 1914). This article is valuable as showing the growth of the Ritual--as much by subtraction as by addition--and especially the introduction into it of Christian imagery and interpretation, first by Martin Clare i n 1732, and by Duckerley and Hutchinson later. One need only turn to The Spirit of Masonry , by Hutchinson (1802), to see how far this tendency had gone when at last che cked in 1813. At that time a committee made a careful comparative study of all r ituals in use among Masons, and the ultimate result was the Preston-Webb lectures now g enerally in use in this country. (See a"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"valuable article by Dr. Mackey on \"The Lectures of Freemasonry,\" American Quarterly Review of Freemasonry , vol. ii, p. 297.) What a pity that this Review died of too much excellence! 219:2 Military Lodges , by Gould; also Kipling's poem, The Mother Lodge . 220:1 Among the articles of union, it was agreed that Fr eemasonry should consist of the three symbolic degrees, \" including the Holy Royal Arch .\" The present study does not contemplate a detailed study of Capitular Masonry, which has its own history and historians ( Origin of the English Rite , Hughan), except to say that it seems to have begu n about 1738-40, the consensus of opinion differing as to whether it began in Eng land or on the Continent (\"Royal Arch Masonry,\" by C. P. Noar, Manchester Lodge of Research , vol. iii, 1911-12). Lawrence Dermott, always alert, had it adopted by the Atholl Grand Lodge about thirty years before the Grand Lodge of England took it up in 1770-76, when Thomas Duckerley was appointed to arrange and intro duce it. Dermott held it to be \"the very essence of Masonry,\" and he was not slow in us ing it as a club with which to belabor the Moderns; but he did not originate it, as some i magine, having received the degrees before he came to London, perhaps in an unsystemize d form. Duckerley was accused of shifting the original Grand Masonic word from the T hird Degree to the Royal Arch, and of substituting another in its stead. Enough to say that Royal Arch Masonry is p. 221 authentic Masonry, being a further elaboration in d rama, following the Third Degree, of the spirit and motif of old Craft Masonry ( History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders , by Hughan and Stillson). 221:1 It is interesting to note that the writer of the a rticle on \"Masonry\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia --an article admirable in many ways, and for the mo st part fair--makes much of this point, and rightly so, albeit his inte rpretation of it is altogether wrong. He imagines that the objection to Christian imagery in the ritual was due to enmity to Christianity. Not so. Masonry was not then, and has never at any time been, opposed to Christianity, or to any other religion. Far from it . But Christianity in those days--as, alas, too often now--was another name for a petty and big oted sectarianism; and Masonry by its very genius was, and is, unsectarian. Many Maso ns then were devout Christians, as they are p. 222 now--not a few clergymen--but the order itself is open to men of all faiths, Catholic and Protestant, Hebrew and Hindu, who conf ess faith in God; and so it will always remain if it is true to its principles and h istory. 223:1 As for the chronicle, the one indispensable book t o the student of American Masonry is the History of Freemasonry and Concordant Orders , by W.

Few men have ever been more unjustly and cruelly maligned than this great patriot, who was the first to utter the name \"United States,\" and who, instead p. 226 of being a sceptic, believed in \"the religion in w hich all men agree\"--that is, in God, Duty, and the immortality of the soul. 227:1 William Morgan was a dissolute, nondescript printe r in Batavia, New York, who, having failed in everything else, thought to make m oney by betraying the secrets of an order which his presence polluted. Foolishly misled , a few Masons had him arrested on a petty charge, got him out of the country, and appar ently paid him to stay out. Had no attention been paid to his alleged exposure it woul d have fallen still-born from the press, like many another before it. Rumors of abduction st arted, then Morgan was said to have been thrown into Niagara River, whereas there is no proof that he was ever killed, much less murdered by Masons. Thurlow Weed and a pack of unscrupulous politicians took it up, and the rest was easy. One year later a body wa s found on the shore of Lake Ontario which Weed and the wife of Morgan identified--a year afterward !--she, no doubt, having been paid to do so; albeit the wife of a fisherman named Munroe identified the same body as that of her husband drowned a week or so before. No matter; as Weed said, \" It's good enough Morgan until after the election \"--a characteristic remark, if we may judge by his own portrait as drawn in his Autobiography . Politically, he was capable of anything, if he could make it win, and here he saw a chance of stir ring up every vile and slimy thing in human nature for sake of office. (See a splendid re view of the whole matter in History of Masonry , by Hughan and Stillson, also by Could in vol. iv of his History .) 228:1 Cyclopedia of Fraternities , by Stevens, article, \"Anti-Masonry,\" gives detail ed account with many interesting facts. 229:1 Following the first day of the battle of Gettysbur g, there was a Lodge meeting in town, and \"Yanks\" and \"Johnny Rebs\" met and mingled as friends under the Square and Compass. Where else could they have done so? ( Tennessee Mason ). When the Union army attacked Little Rock, Ark., the commanding off icer, Thomas H.

But for the kindness of a brother Maso n, who saved the life of a young soldier of the South, who was a prisoner of war at Rock Island, Ill., the present writer would never have been born, much less have written this book. That young soldier was my father! Volumes of such facts might be gathered in proof of the gracious ministry of Masonry in those awful years. 231:1 Cyclopedia of Fraternities , by Stevens (last edition), article, \"Free Masonry ,\" pictures the extent of the order, with maps and dia grams showing its world-wide influence. 232:1 Space does not permit a survey of the literature o f Masonry, still less of Masonry in literature. (Findel has two fine chapters on the li terature of the order, but he wrote, in 1865, History of Masonry .) For traces of Masonry in literature, there is th e famous chapter in War and Peace , by Tolstoi; Mon Oncle Sosthenes , by Maupassant; -athan the Wise , and Ernest and Falk , by Lessing; the Masonic poems of Goethe, and many hints in Wilhelm Meister ; the writings of Herder ( Classic Period of German Letters , Findel), The Lost Word , by Henry Van Dyke; and, of course, the poetry of Burns. Masonic phrases and allusions--often almost too rev ealing--are found all through the poems and stories of Kipling.

KENNEDY, The Servant in the House . p. 239 CHAPTER I What is Masonry I WHAT, then, is Masonry, and what is it trying to do in the world? According to one of the Old Charges , Masonry is declared to be an \"ancient and honorab le institution: ancient no doubt it is, as having subsisted from time immem orial; and honorable it must be acknowledged to be, as by natural tendency it condu ces to make those so who are obedient to its precepts. To so high an eminence ha s its credit been advanced that in every age Monarchs themselves have been promoters o f the art, have not thought it derogatory from their dignity to exchange the scept er for the trowel, have patronized our mysteries and joined in our Assemblies.\" While that eulogy is more than justified by sober f acts, it does not tell us what Masonry is, much less its mission and ministry to mankind. If now we turn to the old, oft-quoted definition, we learn that Masonry is \"a system of m orality veiled in allegory p. 240 and illustrated by symbols.\" That is, in so far, tr ue enough, but it is obviously inadequate, the more so when it uses the word \"peculiar\" as des cribing the morality of Masonry; and it gives no hint of a world-encircling fellowship a nd its far-ramifying influence. Another definition has it that Masonry is \"a science which is engaged in the search after divine truth;\" 1 but that is vague, indefinite, and unsatisfactory, lacking any sense of the uniqueness of the Order, and as applicable to one s cience as to another. For surely all science, of whatever kind, is a search after divine truth, and a physical fact, as Agassiz said, is as sacred as a moral truth--every fact bei ng the presence of God."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Still another writer defines Masonry as \"Friendship , Love, and Integrity--Friendship which rises superior to the fictitious distinctions of society, the prejudices of religion, and the pecuniary conditions of life; Love which knows no limit, nor inequality, nor decay; Integrity which binds man to the eternal law of dut y.\" 2 Such is indeed the very essence and spirit of Masonry, but Masonry has no monopoly of p. 241 that spirit, and its uniqueness consists, rather, i n the form in which it seeks to embody and express the gracious and benign spirit which is the genius of all the higher life of humanity. Masonry is not everything; it is a thing as distinctly featured as a statue by Phidias or a painting by Angelo. Definitions, like delays, may be dangerous, but perhaps we can do no better than to adopt the words of the German Handbuch 1 as the best description of it so far given: Masonry is the activity of closely united men who, employing symbolical forms borrowed principally from the mason's trade and from archite cture, work for the welfare of mankind, striving morally to ennoble themselves and others, and thereby to bring about a universal league of mankind, which they aspire to exhibit even now o n a small scale . Civilization could hardly begin until man had learn ed to fashion for himself a settled habitation, and thus the earliest of all human arts and crafts, and perhaps also the noblest, is that of the builder. Religion took outward shape when men first reared an altar for their offerings, and surrounded it with a sanctuary of fa ith and awe, of pity and consolation, and piled a cairn to mark the graves where their de ad lay asleep. History is no older than architecture. How fitting, then, that the idea and art of p. 242 building should be made the basis of a great order of men which has no other aim than the upbuilding of humanity in Faith, Freedom, and F riendship. Seeking to ennoble and beautify life, it finds in the common task and cons tant labor of man its sense of human unity, its vision of life as a temple \"building and built upon,\" and its emblems of those truths which make for purity of character and the s tability of society. Thus Masonry labors, linked with the constructive genius of mank ind, and so long as it remains true to its Ideal no weapon formed against it can prosper. One of the most impressive and touching things in h uman history is that certain ideal interests have been set apart as especially venerat ed among all peoples. Guilds have arisen to cultivate the interests embodied in art, science, philosophy, fraternity, and religion; to conserve the precious, hard-won inheri tances of humanity; to train men in their service; to bring their power to bear upon th e common life of mortals, and send through that common life the light and glory of the Ideal--as the sun shoots its transfiguring rays through a great dull cloud, evok ing beauty from the brown earth. Such is Masonry, which unites all these high interests a nd brings to their service a vast, world- wide fraternity of free and devout men, built upon a foundation of p. 243"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"spiritual faith and moral idealism, whose mission i t is to make men friends, to refine and exalt their lives, to deepen their faith and purify their dream, to turn them from the semblance of life to homage for truth, beauty, righ teousness, and character. More than an institution, more than a tradition, more than a soc iety, Masonry is one of the forms of the Divine Life upon earth. No one may ever hope to def ine a spirit so gracious, an order so benign, an influence so prophetic of the present an d future up-building of the race. There is a common notion that Masonry is a secret s ociety, and this idea is based on the secret rites used in its initiations, and the signs and grips by which its members recognize each other. Thus it has come to pass that the main aims of the Order are assumed to be a secret policy or teaching, 1 whereas p. 244 its one great secret is that it has no secret . Its principles are published abroad in its writings; its purposes and laws are known, and the times and places of its meetings. Having come down from dark days of persecution, whe n all the finer things sought the protection of seclusion, if it still adheres to sec ret rites, it is not in order to hide the truth, but the better to teach it more impressively, to tr ain men in its pure service, and to promote union and amity upon earth. Its signs and g rips serve as a kind of universal language, and still more as a gracious cover for th e practice of sweet charity--making it easier to help a fellow man in dire plight without hurting his self-respect. If a few are attracted to it by curiosity, all remain to pray, f inding themselves members of a great historic fellowship of the seekers and finders of G od. 1 It is old because it is true; had it been false it would have perished long ago. When al l men practice its simple precepts, the innocent secrets of Masonry will be laid bare, its mission accomplished, and its labor done. II Recalling the emphasis of the foregoing pages, it n eed hardly be added that Masonry is in no sense a p. 245 political party, still less a society organized for social agitation. Indeed, because Masonry stands apart from partisan feud and particular plan s of social reform, she has been held up to ridicule equally by the unthinking, the ambitiou s, and the impatient. Her critics on this side are of two kinds. There are those who hold tha t the humanitarian ideal is an error, maintaining that human nature has no moral aptitude , and can be saved only by submission to a definite system of dogma. Then ther e are those who look for salvation solely in political action and social agitation, wh o live in the delusion that man can be made better by passing laws and counting votes, and to whom Masonry has nothing to offer because in its ranks it permits no politics, much less party rancor. Advocates of the first view have fought Masonry from the beginning w ith the sharpest weapons, while those who hold the second view regard it with conte mpt, as a thing useless and not worth fighting. 1"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Neither adversary understands Masonry and its cult of the creative love for humanity, and of each man for his fellow, without which no dogma is of any worth; lacking which, the best laid plans of social seers \"gang aft aglee.\" L et us look at things as they are. That we must press forward towards p. 246 righteousness--that we must hunger and thirst after a social life that is true and pure, just and merciful--all will agree; but they are blind wh o do not see that the way is long and the process slow. What is it that so tragically del ays the march of man to-ward the better and wiser social order whereof our prophets dream? Our age, like the ages gone before, is full of schemes of every kind for the reform and be tterment of mankind. Why do they not succeed? Some fail, perhaps, because they are impru dent and ill-considered, in that they expect too much of human nature and do not take int o account the stubborn facts of life. But why does not the wisest and noblest plan do mor e than half what its advocates hope and pray and labor so heroically to bring about? Be cause there are not enough men fine enough of soul, large enough of sympathy, sweet eno ugh of spirit, and noble enough of nature to make the dream come true! There are no valid arguments against a great-spirit ed social justice but this--that men will not. Indolence, impurity, greed, injustice, meannes s of spirit, the aggressiveness of authority, and above all jealousy--these are the re al obstacles that thwart the nobler social aspiration of humanity. There are too many men like The Master-Builder who tried to build higher than any one else, without regard to p. 247 others, all for his own selfish glory. Ibsen has sh own us how The Pillars of Society , resting on rotten foundations, came crashing down, wounding the innocent in their wreck. Long ago it was said that \"through wisdom is an hou se builded, and by under-standing it is established; and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with pleasant and precious riches.\" 1 Time has shown that the House of Wisdom must be fo unded upon righteousness, justice, purity, character, faith in God and love of man, else it will fall when the floods descend and the winds beat upon it. What we need to make our social dreams come true is not more laws, not more dogmas, not less liberty, but better men, cleaner minded, more faithful, with loftier ideals and more heroic integrity; men who love the right, honor the truth, worship purity, an d prize liberty--upright men who meet all horizontals at a perfect angle, assuring the vi rtue and stability of the social order. Therefore, when Masonry, instead of identifying its elf with particular schemes of reform, and thus becoming involved in endless turmoil and d ispute, estranging men whom she seeks to bless, devotes all her benign energy and i nfluence to ennobling the souls of men , she is doing fundamental work in behalf of all high enterprises. By as much as she succeeds, p. 248"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"every noble cause succeeds; by as much as she fails , everything fails! By its ministry to the individual man--drawing him into the circle of a great friendship, exalting his faith, refining his ideals, enlarging his sympathies, and setting his feet in the long white path-- Masonry best serves society and the state. 1 While it is not a reformatory, it is a center of moral and spiritual power, and its power is used, n ot only to protect the widow and orphan, but also, and still more important, to remo ve the cause of their woe and need by making men just, gentle, and generous to all their fellow mortals. Who can measure such a silent, persistent, unresting labor; who can desc ribe its worth in a world of feud, of bitterness, of sorrow! No one needs to be told that we are on the eve, if not in the midst, of a most stupendous and bewildering revolution of social and industrial life. It shakes England today. It makes France tremble tomorrow. It alarms America next wee k. Men want p. 249 shorter hours, higher wages, and better homes--of c ourse they do--but they need, more than these things, to know and love each other; for the questions in dispute can never be settled in an air of hostility. If they are ever se ttled at all, and settled right, it must be in an atmosphere of mutual recognition and respect, su ch as Masonry seeks to create and make prevail. Whether it be a conflict of nations, or a clash of class with class, appeal must be made to intelligence and the moral sense, a s befits the dignity of man. Amidst bitterness and strife Masonry brings men of every r ank and walk of life together as men, and nothing else, at an altar where they can talk a nd not fight, discuss and not dispute, and each may learn the point of view of his fellow. Other hope there is none save in this spirit of friendship and fairness, of democracy and the fellowship of man with man. Once this spirit has its way with mankind, it will bring those brave, large reconstructions, those profitable abnegations and brotherly feats of gener osity that will yet turn human life into a glad, beautiful, and triumphant coöperation all r ound this sunlit world. Surely the way of Masonry is wise. Instead of becom ing only one more factor in a world of factional feud, it seeks to remove all hostility which may arise from social, national, or religious differences.

Often it has been objec ted that some men leave the Church and enter the Masonic Lodge, finding there a religious home. Even so, but that may be the fault, not of Masonry, but of the Church so long de famed by bigotry and distracted by sectarian feud, and which has too often made accept ance of abstract dogmas a test of its fellowship. 1 Naturally many fine minds have been estranged from the Church, not because they were irreligious, but because they wer e required to believe what it was impossible for them to believe; and, rather than sa crifice their integrity of soul, they . have turned away from the last place from which a m an should ever turn away. No part of the ministry of Masonry is more beautiful and wise than its appeal, not for tolerance, but for fraternity; not for uniformity, but for unity o f spirit amidst varieties p. 252 of outlook and opinion. Instead of criticizing Maso nry, let us thank God for one altar where no man is asked to surrender his liberty of t hought and become an indistinguishable atom in a mass of sectarian agglo meration. What a witness to the worth of an Order that it brings together men of all cree ds in behalf of those truths which are greater than all sects, deeper than all doctrines-- the glory and the hope of man! While Masonry is not a church, it has religiously p reserved some things of highest importance to the Church--among them the right of e ach individual soul to its own religious faith. Holding aloof from separate sects and creeds, it has taught all of them p. 253 how to respect and tolerate each other; asserting a principle broader than any of them--the sanctity of the soul and the duty of every man to r evere, or at least to regard with charity, what is sacred to his fellows. It is like the crypt s underneath the old cathedrals--a place where men of every creed who long for something dee per and truer, older and newer than they have hitherto known, meet and unite.

Indeed, it holds that truth which is com mon to all elevating and benign religions, and is the basis of p. 254 each; that faith which underlies all sects and over -arches all creeds, like the sky above and the river bed below the flow of mortal years. I t does not under-take to explain or dogmatically to settle those questions or solve tho se dark mysteries which out-top human knowledge. Beyond the facts of faith it does not go . With the subtleties of speculation concerning those truths, and the unworldly envies g rowing out of them, it has not to do. There divisions begin, and Masonry was not made to divide men, but to unite them, leaving each man free to think his own thought and fashion his own system of ultimate truth. All its emphasis rests upon two extremely si mple and profound principles--love of God and love of man. Therefore, all through the age s it has been, and is today, a meeting place of differing minds, and a prophecy of the fin al union of all reverent and devout souls. Time was when one man framed a dogma and declared i t to be the eternal truth. Another man did the same thing, with a different dogma; the n the two began to hate each other with an unholy hatred, each seeking to impose his d ogma upon the other--and that is an epitome of some of the blackest pages of history. A gainst those old sectarians who substituted intolerance for charity, persecution fo r friendship, and did not love God because they hated p. 255 their neighbors, Masonry made eloquent protest, put ting their bigotry to shame by its simple insight, and the dignity of its golden voice . A vast change of heart is now taking place in the religious world, by reason of an excha nge of thought and courtesy, and a closer personal touch, and the various sects, so lo ng estranged, are learning to unite upon the things most worth while and the least open to d ebate. That is to say, they are moving toward the Masonic position, and when they arrive M asonry will witness a scene which she has prophesied for ages. At last, in the not distant future, the old feuds o f the sects will come to an end, forgotten in the discovery that the just, the brave, the true -hearted are everywhere of one religion, and that when the masks of misunderstanding are tak en off they know and love one another. Our little dogmas will have their day and cease to be, lost in the vision of a truth so great that all men are one in their littleness; one also in their assurance of the divinity of the soul and \"the kindness of the veiled Father of men.\" Then men of every name will ask, when they meet: Not what is your creed?

Dr. Mackey said that old Craft -masonry was sectarian ( Symbolism of Masonry ); but it was not more so than Dr. Mackey himself, who held the curious theory that the religion of the Hebrews was genuine and th at of the Egyptians spurious. Nor is there any evidence that Craft-masonry was sectarian , but much to the contrary, as has been shown in reference to the invocations in the Old Charges . At any rate, if it was ever sectarian, it ceased to be so with the organization of the Grand Lodge of England. Later, some of the chaplains of the order sought to identi fy Masonry with Christianity, as Hutchinson did--and even Arnold in his chapter on \" Christianity and Freemasonry\" ( History and Philosophy of Masonry ). All this confusion results from a p. 252 misunderstanding of what religion is. Religions are many; religion is one--perhaps we may say one thing, but that one thing includes ever ything--the life of God in the soul of man, which finds expression in all the forms which life and love and duty take. This conception of religion shakes the poison out of all our wild flowers, and shows us that it is the inspiration of all scientific inquiry, all s triving for liberty, all virtue and charity; the spirit of all thought, the motif of all great music , the soul of all sublime literature. The church has no monopoly of religion, nor did the Bib le create it. Instead, it was religion-- the natural and simple trust of the soul in a Power above and within it, and its quest of a right relation to that Power--that created the Bibl e and the Church, and, indeed, all our higher human life. The soul of man is greater than all books, deeper than all dogmas, and more enduring than all institutions. Masonry seeks to free men from a limiting conception of religion, and thus to remove one of the chief ca uses of sectarianism. It is itself one of the forms of beauty wrought by the human soul under the inspiration of the Eternal Beauty, and as such is religious. 253:1 Chips from a German Workshop , by Max Müller. p. 258 Masonry directs us to divest ourselves of confined and bigoted notions, and teaches us, that Humanity is the soul of Religion. We never suf fer any religious disputes in our Lodges, and, as Masons, we only pursue the universa l religion, the Religion, of -ature. Worshipers of the God of Mercy, we believe that in every nation, he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is accepted of Him. All Mason s, therefore, whether Christians, Jews, or Mahomedans, who violate not the rule of ri ght, written by the Almighty upon the tables of the heart, who Do fear Him, and WORK righ teousness, we are to acknowledge as brethren; and, though we take different roads, w e are not to be angry with, or persecute each other on that account.

HUTCHINSON, The Spirit of Masonry ."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" p. 259 CHAPTER II The Masonic Philosophy HAST any philosophy in thee, Shepherd?\" 1 was the question of Touchstone in the Shakespeare play; and that is the question we must always ask ourselves. Long ago Kant said that it is the mission of philosophy, not to d iscover truth, but to set it in order, to seek out the rhythm of things and their reason for being . Beginning in wonder, it sees the familiar as if it were strange, and its mind is ful l of the air that plays round every subject. Spacious, humane, eloquent, it is \"a blend of scien ce, p. 260 poetry, religion and logic\" 1 --a softening, enlarging, ennobling influence, givi ng us a wider and clearer outlook, more air, more room, mor e light, and more background. When we look at Masonry in this large and mellow li ght, it is like a stately old cathedral, gray with age, rich in associations, its steps worn by innumerable feet of the living and the dead--not piteous, but strong and enduring. Ent ering its doors, we wonder at its lofty spaces, its windows with the dimness and glory of t he Infinite behind them, the spring of its pillars, the leap of its arches, and its roof i nlaid with stars. Inevitably we ask, whence came this temple of faith and friendship, and what does it mean--rising lightly as a lyric, uplifted by the hunger for truth and the love for b eauty, and exempt from the shock of years and the ravages of decay? What faith builded this home of the soul, what philosophy underlies and upholds it? Truly did Long fellow sing of The Builders : In the elder years of art, Builders wrought with greatest care Each minute and hidden part, For the gods see everywhere. I If we examine the foundations of Masonry, we find t hat it rests upon the most fundamental of all p. 261 truths, the first truth and the last, the sovereign and supreme Reality. Upon the threshold of its Lodges every man, whether prince or peasant, is asked to confess his faith in God the Father Almighty, the Architect and Master-Build er of the Universe. 1 That is not a mere form of words, but the deepest and most solemn affirmation that human lips can p. 262"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"make. To be indifferent to God is to be indifferent to the greatest of all realities, that upon which the aspiration of humanity rests for its upri sing passion of desire. No institution that is dumb concerning the meaning of life and the character of the universe, can last. It is a house built upon the sand, doomed to fall when the winds blow and floods beat upon it, lacking a sure foundation. No human fraternity that has not its inspiration in the Fatherhood of God, confessed or unconfessed, can lo ng endure; it is a rope of sand, weak as water, and its fine sentiment quickly evaporates . Life leads, if we follow its meanings and think in the drift of its deeper conclusions, t o one God as the ground of the world, and upon that ground Masonry lays her corner-stone. Therefore, it endures and grows, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it! While Masonry is theocratic in its faith and philos ophy, 1 it does not limit its conception of the Divine, much less insist upon any one name f or \"the Nameless One of a hundred names.\" Indeed, no feature of Masonry is more fasci nating that its age-long quest of the Lost Word, 2 the Ineffable Name; a quest that never tires, neve r tarries, knowing the p. 263 while that every name is inadequate, and all words are but symbols of a Truth too great for words--every letter of the alphabet, in fact, h aving been evolved from some primeval sign or signal of the faith and hope of humanity. T hus Masonry, so far from limiting the thought of God, is evermore in search of a more sat isfying and revealing vision of the meaning of the universe, now luminous and lovely, n ow dark and terrible; and it invites all men to unite in the quest-- One in the freedom of the Truth, One in the joy of paths untrod, One in the soul's perennial Youth, One in the larger thought of God. [paragraph continues] Truly the human consciousness of fellowship with t he Eternal, under whatever name, may well hush all words, still more hush argument and anathema. Possession, not recognition, is the only thing impo rtant; and if it is not recognized, the fault must surely be, in large part, our own. Given the one great experience, and before long kindred spirits will join in the Universal Prayer of Alexander Pope, himself a Mason: Father of all! in every age, In every clime adored, By Saint, by Savage, and by Sage, Jehovah, Jove, or Lord!

Of this there is no doubt; and science has come at last to vindicate this wise insight, by unveiling the unity of the universe with overwhelming emphasi s. Unquestionably the universe is an inexhaustible wonder. Still, it is a wonder, not a contradiction, and we can never find its rhythm save in the truth of the unity of all things p. 265 in God. Other clue there is none. Down to this deep foundation Masonry digs for a basis of its temple, and builds securely. If this be fals e or unstable, then is The pillar’d firmament rottenness, And earth's base built on stubble. Upon the altar of Masonry lies the open Bible which , despite the changes and advances of the ages, remains the greatest Modern Book--the mor al manual of civilization. 1 All through its pages, through the smoke of Sinai, thro ugh \"the forest of the Psalms,\" through proverbs and parables, along the dreamy ways of pro phecy, in gospels and epistles is heard the everlasting truth of one God who is love, and who requires of men that they love one another, do justly, be merciful, keep them selves unspotted by evil, and walk humbly before Him in whose great hand they stand. T here we read of the Man of Galilee who taught that, in the far distances of the divine Fatherhood, all men were conceived in love, and so are akin--united in origin, duty, and destiny. Therefore we are to relieve the distressed, put the wanderer into his way, and divi de our bread with the hungry, which is but the way of doing good p. 266 to ourselves; for we are all members of one great f amily, and the hurt of one means the injury of all. This profound and reverent faith from which, as fro m a never-failing spring, flow heroic devotedness, moral self-respect, authentic sentimen ts of fraternity, inflexible fidelity in life and effectual consolation in death, Masonry ha s at all times religiously taught. Perseveringly it has propagated it through the cent uries, and never more zealously than in our age. Scarcely a Masonic discourse is pronounced , or a Masonic lesson read, by the highest officer or the humblest lecturer, that does not earnestly teach this one true religion which is the very soul of Masonry, its basis and ap ex, its light and power. Upon that faith it rests; in that faith it lives and labors; and by that faith it will conquer at last, when the noises and confusions of today have followed the ta ngled feet that made them. II Out of this simple faith grows, by inevitable logic , the philosophy which Masonry teaches in signs and symbols, in pictures and parab les. Stated briefly, stated vividly, it is"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"that behind the pageant of nature, in it and over i t, there is a Supreme Mind which initiates, impels, and controls all. That behind th e life of man and its pathetic story in history, p. 267 in it and over it, there is a righteous Will, the i ntelligent Conscience of the Most High. In short, that the first and last thing in the univers e is mind, that the highest and deepest thing is conscience, and that the final reality is the absoluteness of love. Higher than that faith cannot fly; deeper than that thought cannot d ig. No deep is deep enough to show The springs whence being starts to flow. No fastness of the soul reveals Life's subtlest impulse and appeals. We seem to come, we seem to go; But whence or whither who can know? Unemptiable, unfillable, It's all in that one syllable-- God! Only God. God first, God last. God, infinitesimally vast; God who is love, love which is God, The rootless, everflowering rod! There is but one real alternative to this philosoph y. It is not atheism--which is seldom more than a revulsion from superstition--because th e adherents of absolute atheism are so few, if any, and its intellectual position is too p recarious ever to be a menace. An atheist, if such there be, is an orphan, a waif wandering th e midnight streets of time, homeless and alone. Nor is the alternative agnosticism, whic h in the nature of things can be p. 268 only a passing mood of thought, when, indeed, it is not a confession of intellectual bankruptcy, or a labor-saving device to escape the toil and fatigue of high thinking. It trembles in perpetual hesitation, like a donkey equ i-distant between two bundles of hay, starving to death but unable to make up its mind. N o; the real alternative is materialism, which played so large a part in philosophy fifty ye ars ago, and which, defeated there, has betaken itself to the field of practical affairs. T his is the dread alternative of a denial of the great faith of humanity, a blight which would a pply a sponge to all the high aspirations and ideals of the race. According to th is dogma, the first and last things in the universe are atoms, their number, dance, combinatio ns, and growth. All mind, all will, all emotion, all character, all love is incidental, tra nsitory, vain. The sovereign fact is mud, the final reality is dirt, and the decree of destin y is \"dust unto dust!\" Against this ultimate horror, it need hardly be sai d that in every age Masonry has stood as a witness for the life of the spirit. In the war of the soul against dust, in the choice between dirt and Deity, it has allied itself on the side of the great idealisms and optimisms of humanity. It takes the spiritual view of life and the world as being most in accord with the facts of experience, the promptings"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"p. 269 of right reason, and the voice of conscience. In ot her words, it dares to read the meaning of the universe through what is highest in man, not through what is lower, asserting that the soul is akin to the Eternal Spirit, and that by a life of righteousness its eternal quality is revealed. 1 Upon this philosophy Masonry rests, and finds a ro ck beneath: On Him, this corner-stone we build, On Him, this edifice erect; And still, until this work's fulfilled, May He the workman's ways direct. Now, consider! All our human thinking, whether it b e in science, philosophy, or religion, rests for its validity upon faith in the kinship of man with p. 270 [paragraph continues] God. If that faith be false, the temple of human t hought falls to wreck, and behold! we know not anything and have no way of lea rning. But the fact that the universe is intelligible, that we can follow its forces, tra ce its laws, and make a map of it, finding the infinite even in the infinitesimal, shows that the mind of man is akin to the Mind that made it. Also, there are two aspects of the nature of man which lift him above the brute and bespeak his divine heredity. They are reason an d conscience, both of which are of more than sense and time, having their source, sati sfaction, and authority in an unseen, eternal world. That is to say, man is a being who, if not actually immortal, is called by the very law and necessity of his being to live as if h e were immortal. Unless life be utterly abortive, having neither rhyme nor reason, the soul of man is itself the one sure proof and prophet of its own high faith. Consider, too, what it means to say that this might y soul of man is akin to the Eternal Soul of all things. It means that we are not shapes of mud placed here by chance, but sons of the Most High, citizens of eternity, deathless a s God our Father is deathless; and that there is laid upon us an abiding obligation to live in a manner befitting the dignity of the soul. It means that what a man thinks, the parity o f his feeling, the character of his activity p. 271 and career are of vital and ceaseless concern to th e Eternal. Here is a philosophy which lights up the universe like a sunrise, confirming t he dim, dumb certainties of the soul, evolving meaning out of mystery, and hope out of wh at would else be despair. It brings out the colors of human life, investing our fleetin g mortal years--brief at their longest, broken at its best--with enduring significance and beauty. It gives to each of us, however humble and obscure, a place and a part in the stupe ndous historical enterprise; makes us fellow workers with the Eternal in His redemptive m aking of humanity, and binds us to do His will upon earth as it is done in heaven. It subdues the intellect; it softens the heart; it begets in the will that sense of self-respect wi thout which high and heroic living cannot be. Such is the philosophy upon which Masonry build s; and from it flow, as from the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"rock smitten in the wilderness, those bright stream s that wander through and water this human world of ours. III Because this is so; because the human soul is akin to God, and is endowed with powers to which no one may set a limit, it is and of right ou ght to be free. Thus, by the logic of its philosophy, not less than the inspiration of its fa ith, Masonry has been p. 272 impelled to make its historic demand for liberty of conscience, for the freedom of the intellect, and for the right of all men to stand er ect, unfettered, and unafraid, equal before God and the law, each respecting the rights of his fellows. What we have to remember is, that before this truth was advocated by any order, or embodied in any political constitution, it was embedded in the will of God an d the constitution of the human soul. Nor will Masonry ever swerve one jot or tittle from its ancient and eloquent demand till all men, everywhere, are free in body, mind, and so ul. As it is, Lowell was right when he wrote: We are not free: Freedom doth not consist In musing with our faces toward the Past While petty cares and crawling interests twist Their spider threads about us, which at last Grow strong as iron chains and cramp and bind In formal narrowness heart, soul, and mind. Freedom is recreated year by year, In hearts wide open on the Godward side, In souls calm-cadenced as the whirling sphere, In minds that sway the future like a tide. No broadest creeds can hold her, and no codes; She chooses men for her august abodes, Building them fair and fronting to the dawn. Some day, when the cloud of prejudice has been disp elled by the searchlight of truth, the world will p. 273 honor Masonry for its service to freedom of thought and the liberty of faith. No part of its history has been more noble, no principle of its te aching has been more precious than its age-long demand for the right and duty of every sou l to seek that light by which no man was ever injured, and that truth which makes man fr ee. Down through the centuries-- often in times when the highest crime was not murde r, but thinking, and the human conscience was a captive dragged at the wheel of th e ecclesiastical chariot--always and everywhere Masonry has stood for the right of the s oul to know the truth, and to look up unhindered from the lap of earth into the face of G od. Not freedom from faith, but freedom of faith, has been its watchword, on the gr ound that as despotism is the mother of anarchy, so bigoted dogmatism is the prolific so urce of scepticism--knowing, also, that"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"our race has made its most rapid advance in those f ields where it has been free the longest. Against those who would fetter thought in order to perpetuate an effete authority, who would give the skinny hand of the past a scepter to rule the aspiring and prophetic present, and seal the lips of living scholars with the dicta of dead scholastics, Masonry will never ground arms! Her plea is for government without tyranny and religion without p. 274 superstition, and as surely as suns rise and set he r fight will be crowned with victory. Defeat is impossible, the more so because she fight s not with force, still less with intrigue, but with the power of truth, the persuasi ons of reason, and the might of gentleness, seeking not to destroy her enemies, but to win them to the liberty of the truth and the fellowship of love. Not only does Masonry plead for that liberty of fai th which permits a man to hold what seems to him true, but also, and with equal emphasi s, for the liberty which faith gives to the soul, emancipating it from the despotism of dou bt and the fetters of fear. Therefore, by every art of spiritual culture, it seeks to keep alive in the hearts of men a great and simple trust in the goodness of God, in the worth o f life, and the divinity of the soul--a trust so apt to be crushed by the tramp of heavy ye ars. Help a man to a firm faith in an Infinite Pity at the heart of this dark world, and from how many fears is he free! Once a temple of terror, haunted by shadows, his heart bec omes \"a cathedral of serenity and gladness,\" and his life is enlarged and unfolded in to richness of character and service. Nor is there any tyranny like the tyranny of time. Give a man a day to live, and he is like a bird in a cage beating against its bars. Give him a year in which to move to and p. 275 fro with his thoughts and plans, his purposes and h opes, and you have liberated him from the despot-ism of a day. Enlarge the scope of his l ife to fifty years, and he has a moral dignity of attitude and a sweep of power impossible hitherto. But give him a sense of Eternity; let him know that he plans and works in a n ageless time; that above his blunders and sins there hovers and waits the infinite--then he is free! Nevertheless, if life on earth be worthless, so is immortality. The real question, after all, is not as to the quantity of life, but its quality- -its depth, its purity, its fortitude, its fineness of spirit and gesture of soul. Hence the i nsistent emphasis of Masonry upon the building of character and the practice of righteous ness; upon that moral culture without which man is rudimentary, and that spiritual vision without which intellect is the slave of greed or passion. What makes a man great and freed of soul, here or anywhither, is loyalty to the laws of right, of truth, of purity, of love, and the lofty will of God. How to live is the one matter; and the oldest man in his r ipe age has yet to seek a wiser way than to build, year by year, upon a foundation of faith in God, using the Square of justice, the Plumb-line of rectitude, the Compass to restrain th e passions, and the Rule by which to divide our time into labor, rest,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"p. 276 and service to our fellows.

IV Bede the Venerable, in giving an account of the del iberations of the King of Northumberland and his counsellors, as to whether t hey should allow the Christian missionaries to teach a new faith to the people, re cites this incident. After much debate, a gray-haired chief recalled the feeling which came o ver him on seeing a little bird pass through, on fluttering wing, the warm bright hall o f feasting, while winter winds raged without. The moment of its flight was full of sweet ness and light for the bird, but it was brief. Out of the darkness it flew, looked upon the bright scene, and vanished into the darkness again, none knowing whence it came nor whi ther it went. \"Like this,\" said the veteran chief, \"is human life . We come, our wise men cannot tell whence. We go, and they cannot tell whither. Our fl ight is brief.

It shows us the black trage dy of life in its darkest hour; the forces of evil, so cunning yet so stupid, which come up ag ainst the soul, tempting it to treachery, and even to the degradation of saving life by giving up all that makes life wo rth living; a tragedy which, in its simplicity and power, makes t he heart ache and stand still. Then, out of the thick darkness there rises, like a beautiful white star, that in man which is most akin to God, his love of truth, his loyalty to the highest, and his willingness to go down into the night of death, if only virtue may live an d shine like a pulse of fire in the evening sky.

Shakespeare makes no reference to any secret society, but some of his allusions suggest that he knew more than he wrote. He describes \"The singing Masons building roofs of gold\" ( Henry V , act i, scene ii), and compares them to a swarm of bees at work. Did he know what t he bee hive means in the symbolism of Masonry? (Read an interesting article on \"Shakes peare and Freemasonry,\" American Freemason , January, 1912.) It reminds one of the passage in the Complete Angler , by Isaak Walton, in which the gentle fisherman talks a bout the meaning of Pillars in language very like that used in the Old Charges . But Hawkins in his edition of the Angler recalls that Walton was a friend of Elias Ashmole, and may have learned of Masonry from him. ( A Short Masonic History , by F.

The writer of the a rticle on \"Masonry\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia recalls this fact with emphasis; but h e is much fairer to the Grand Orient than many Masonic writers have been. He understands that this does not mean that the Masons of France are atheistic, as that word is ord inarily used, but that they do not believe that there exist Atheists in the absolute s ense of the word ; and he quotes the words of Albert Pike: \"A man who has a higher conception of God than those about him, and who denies that their conception is God, is very li kely to be called an Atheist by men who are really far less believers in God than he\" ( Morals and Dogma , p. 643). Thus, as Pike goes on to say, the early Christians, who said the heathen idols were no Gods, were accounted Atheists, and accordingly put to death. W e need not hold a brief for the Grand Orient, but it behooves us to understand its positi on and point of view, lest we be found guilty of a petty bigotry in regard to a word when the reality is a common treasure. First, it was felt that France needed the aid of every man who was an enemy of Latin ecclesiasticism, in order to bring about a separati on of Church and State; hence the attitude of the Grand Orient. Second, the Masons of France agree with Plutarch that no conception of God at all is better than a dark, dis torted superstition which wraps men in terror; and they erased a word which, for many, was associated with an unworthy faith-- the better to seek a unity of effort in behalf of l iberty of thought and a loftier faith.

As too often interpreted, it is little more than a crude tri-theism, but at its bes t it is not so. \"God thrice, not three Gods,\" was the word of St. Augustine ( Essay on the Trinity ), meaning three aspects of God--not the 'mathematics of His nature, but its manifoldnes s, its variety in unity. The late W. N. Clarke--who put more common sense into theology tha n any other man of his day-- pointed out that, in our time, the old debate about the trinity is as dead as Caesar; the truth of God as a Father having taken up into itself the warmth, color, and tenderness of the truth of the trinity--which, as said on an earlier page, was a vision of God through the family ( Christian Doctrine of God ). 265:1 The Bible, the Great Source of Masonic Secrets and Observances , by Dr. Oliver. No Mason need be told what a large place the Bible has in the symbolism, ritual, and teaching of the Order, and it has an equally large place in its literature. 269:1 Read the great argument of Plato in The Republic (book vi). The present writer does not wish to impose upon Masonry any dogma of t echnical Idealism, subjective, objective, or otherwise. No more than others does h e hold to a static universe which unrolls in time a plan made out before, but to a wo rld of wonders where life has the risk and zest of adventure. He rejoices in the New Ideal ism of Rudolf Eucken, with its gospel of \"an independent spiritual life\"--independent, th at is, of vicissitude--and its insistence upon the fact that the meaning of life depends upon our \"building up within ourselves a life that is not of time\" ( Life's Basis and Life's Ideal ). But the intent of these pages is, rather, to emphasize the spiritual view of life and the world as the philosophy underlying Masonry, and upon which it builds--the reality of t he ideal, its sovereignty over our fragile human life, and the immutable necessity of loyalty to it, if we are to build for eternity. After all, as Plotinus said, philosophy \" serves to point the way and guide the traveller; the vision is for him who will see it.\" But the direction means much to those who are seeking the truth to know it. p. 282 The crest and crowning of all good, Life's final star, is Brotherhood; For it will bring again to Earth Her long-lost Poesy and Mirth; Will send new light on every face, A kingly power upon the race.

Gentle, gracious, and w ise, its mission is to form mankind into a great redemptive brotherhood, a league of no ble and free men enlisted in the radiant enterprise of working out in time the love and will of the Eternal. Who is sufficient to describe a spirit so benign? With wha t words may one ever hope to capture and detain that which belongs of right to the geniu s of poetry and song, by whose magic those elusive and impalpable realities find embodim ent and voice? With picture, parable, and stately drama, Masonry a ppeals to lovers of beauty, bringing poetry and symbol to the aid of philosophy, and art to the service of character. Broad and tolerant in its teaching, it appeals to men of inte llect, equally by the depth of its faith and its plea for liberty of p. 284 thought--helping them to think things through to a more satisfying and hopeful vision of the meaning of life and the mystery of the world. B ut its profoundest appeal, more eloquent than all others, is to the deep heart of m an, out of which are the issues of life and destiny. When all is said, it is as a man thinketh in his heart whether life be worth while or not, and whether he is a help or a curse to his race. Here lies the tragedy of our race: Not that men are poor; All men know something of poverty. Not that men are wicked; Who can claim to be good? Not that men are ignorant; Who can boast that he is wise? But that men are strangers! Masonry is Friendship--friendship, first, with the great Companion, of whom our own hearts tell us, who is always nearer to us than we are to our-selves, and whose inspiration and help is the greatest fact of human experience. To be in harmony with His purposes, to"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"be open to His suggestions, to be conscious of fell owship with Him--this is Masonry on its Godward side. Then, turning man-ward, friendshi p sums it all up. To be friends with all men, however they may differ from us in creed, color, or condition; to fill every human relation with the spirit of friendship; is th ere anything more or p. 285 better than this that the wisest and best of men ca n hope to do? 1 Such is the spirit of Masonry; such is its ideal, and if to realize it al l at once is denied us, surely it means much to see it, love it, and labor to make it come true. Nor is this Spirit of Friendship a mere sentiment h eld by a sympathetic, and therefore unstable, fraternity, which would dissolve the conc rete features of humanity into a vague blur of misty emotion. No; it has its roots in a pr ofound philosophy which sees that the universe is friendly, and that men must learn to be friends if they would live as befits the world in which they live, as well as their own orig in and destiny. For, since God is the life of all that was, is, and is to be; and since w e are all born into p. 286 the world by one high wisdom and one vast love, we are brothers to the last man of us, forever! For better for worse, for richer for poore r, in sickness and in health, and even after death us do part, all men are held together b y ties of spiritual kinship, sons of one eternal Friend. Upon this fact human fraternity res ts, and it is the basis of the plea of Masonry, not only for freedom, but for friendship a mong men. Thus friendship, so far from being a mush of conces sions, is in fact the constructive genius of the universe. Love is ever the Builder, a nd those who have done most to establish the City of God on earth have been the me n who loved their fellow men. Once let this spirit prevail, and the wrangling sects wi ll be lost in a great league of those who love in the service of those who suffer. No man wil l then revile the faith in which his neighbor finds help for today and hope for the morr ow; pity will smite him mute, and love will teach him that God is found in many ways, by those who seek him with honest hearts. Once let this spirit rule in the realm of t rade, and the law of the jungle will cease, and men will strive to build a social order in whic h all men may have opportunity \"to live, and to live well,\" as Aristotle defined the p urpose of society. Here is the basis of that magical stability aimed at by the earliest artists when they p. 287 sought to build for eternity, by imitating on earth the House of God. II Our human history, saturated with blood and blister ed with tears, is the story of man making friends with man.

So there were war, strife, and bloodshed. Slowly there came to the savage a gleam of the truth that it is better to he lp than to hurt, and he organized clans and tribes. But tribes were divided by rivers and mount ains, and the men on one side of the river felt that the men on the other side were thei r enemies. Again there were war, pillage, and sorrow. Great empires arose and met in the shoc k of conflict, leaving trails of skeletons across the earth. Then came the great roa ds, reaching out with their stony clutch and bringing the ends of the earth together. Men me t, mingled, passed and repassed, and learned that human nature is much the same everywhe re, with p. 288 hopes and fears in common. Still there were many th ings to divide and estrange men from each other, and the earth was full of bitterness. N ot satisfied with natural barriers, men erected high walls of sect and caste, to exclude th eir fellows, and the men of one sect were sure that the men of all other sects were wron g--and doomed to be lost. Thus, when real mountains no longer separated man from man, mo untains were made out of molehills--mountains of immemorial misunderstanding not yet moved into the sea! Barriers of race, of creed, of caste, of habit, of training and interest separate men today, as if some malign genius were bent on keeping man f rom his fellows, begetting suspicion, uncharitableness, and hate. Still there are war, waste, and woe! Yet all the while men have been unfriendly, and, therefore, unj ust and cruel, only because they are unacquainted. Amidst feud, faction, and folly, Maso nry, the oldest and most widely spread order, toils in behalf of friendship, unitin g men upon the only basis upon which they can ever meet with dignity. Each lodge is an o asis of equality and goodwill in a desert of strife, working to weld mankind into a gr eat league of sympathy and service, which, by the terms of our definition, it seeks to exhibit even now on a small scale. At its altar men meet as man to man, p. 289 without vanity and without pretense, without fear a nd without reproach, as tourists crossing the Alps tie themselves together, so that if one slip all may hold him up. No tongue can tell the meaning of such a ministry, no pen can trace its influence in melting the hardness of the world into pity and gladness. The Spirit of Masonry! He who would describe that s pirit must be a poet, a musician, and a seer--a master of melodies, echoes, and long, far -sounding cadences. Now, as always, it toils to make man better, to refine his thought and purify his sympathy, to broaden his outlook, to lift his altitude, to establish in ampl itude and resoluteness his life in all its relations. All its great history, its vast accumula tions of tradition, its simple faith and its solemn rites, its freedom and its friendship are de dicated to a high moral ideal, seeking to tame the tiger in man, and bring his wild passions into obedience to the will of God. It has no other mission than to exalt and ennoble huma nity, to bring light out of darkness,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"beauty out of angularity; to make every hard-won in heritance more secure, every sanctuary more sacred, every hope more radiant! 1 p. 290 The Spirit of Masonry!

Evil, injustice, bigotry, greed, and every vile and slimy thing that defiles and defames humanity will skulk into the dark, unable to bear t he light of a juster, wiser, more merciful order. Industry will be upright, education prophetic, and religion not a shadow, but a Real Presence, when man has become acquainted with man and has learned to worship God by serving his fellows. When Masonry is victorious every tyranny will fall, every bastile crumble, and man will be not only unf ettered in mind and hand, but free of heart to walk erect in the light and liberty of the truth. Toward a great friendship, long foreseen by Masonic p. 291 faith, the world is slowly moving, amid difficultie s and delays, reactions and reconstructions. Though long deferred, of that day, which will surely arrive, when nations will be reverent in the use of freedom, just in the exercise of power, humane in the practice of wisdom; when no man will ride over the rights of his fellows; when no woman will be made forlorn, no little child wretche d by bigotry or greed, Masonry has ever been a prophet. Nor will she ever be content u ntil all the threads of human fellowship are woven into one mystic cord of friend ship, encircling the earth and holding the race in unity of spirit and the bonds of peace, as in the will of God it is one in the origin and end.

What a ministry to a young man who enters its temple in the morning of l ife, when the dew of heaven is upon his days and the birds are singing in his heart! 1 From the wise lore of the East Max Müller translate d a parable which tells how the gods, having stolen from man his divinity, met in council to discuss where they should hide it. One suggested that it be carried to the other side of the earth and buried; but it was pointed out that man is a great wanderer, and that he might find the lost treasure on the other side of the earth. Another proposed p. 293 that it be dropped into the depths of the sea; but the same fear was expressed--that man, in his insatiable curiosity, might dive deep enough to find it even there. Finally, after a space of silence, the oldest and wisest of the gods said: \"Hide it in man himself, as that is the last place he will ever think to look for it!\" And it was so agreed, all seeing at once the subtle and wise strategy. Man did wander over t he earth, for ages, seeking in all places high and low, far and near, before he though t to look within himself for the divinity he sought. At last, slowly, dimly, he bega n to realize that what he thought was far off, hidden in \"the pathos of distance,\" is nearer than the breath he breathes, even in his own heart. Here lies the great secret of Masonry--that it make s a man aware of that divinity within him, wherefrom his whole life takes its beauty and meaning, and inspires him to follow and obey it. Once a man learns this deep secret, li fe is new, and the old world is a valley all dewy to the dawn with a lark-song over it. Ther e never was a truer saying than that the religion of a man is the chief fact concerning him. 1 By religion is meant not the creed to which a man will subscribe, or otherwise give his a ssent; not that necessarily; often not that at all--since p. 294 we see men of all degrees of worth and worthlessnes s signing all kinds of creeds. No; the religion of a man is that which he practically beli eves, lays to heart, acts upon, and thereby knows concerning this mysterious universe a nd his duty and destiny in it. That is in all cases the primary thing in him, and creative ly determines all the rest; that is his religion. It is, then, of vital importance what fai th, what vision, what conception of life a man lays to heart, and acts upon. At bottom, a man is what his thinking is, thoughts being the artists who give color to our days. Optimists and pessimists live in the same wor ld, walk under the same sky, and observe the same facts. Sceptics and believers look up at the same great stars--the stars that shone in Eden and will flash again in Paradise . Clearly the difference between them is a difference not of fact, but of faith--of insig ht, outlook, and point of view--a difference"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"of inner attitude and habit of thought with regard to the worth and use of life. By the same token, any influence which reaches and alters that inner habit and bias of mind, and changes it from doubt to faith, from fear to courag e, from despair to sun-burst hope, has wrought the most benign ministry which a mortal may enjoy. Every man has a train of thought on which he rides when he is alone; and p. 295 the worth of his life to himself and others, as wel l as its happiness, depend upon the direction in which that train is going, the baggage it carries, and the country through which it travels. If, then, Masonry can put that in ner train of thought on the right track, freight it with precious treasure, and start it on the way to the City of God, what other or higher ministry can it render to a man? And that is what it does for any man who will listen to it, love it, and lay its truth to heart. High, fine, ineffably rich and beautiful are the fa ith and vision which Masonry gives to those who foregather at its altar, bringing to them in picture, parable, and symbol the lofty and pure truth wrought out through ages of ex perience, tested by time, and found to be valid for the conduct of life. By such teaching, if they have the heart to heed it, men become wise, learning how to be both brave and gent le, faithful and free; how to renounce superstition and yet retain faith; how to keep a fine poise of reason between the falsehood of extremes; how to accept the joys of li fe with glee, and endure its ills with patient valor; how to look upon the folly of man an d not forget his nobility--in short, how to live cleanly, kindly, calmly, open-eyed and unaf raid in a sane world, sweet of heart and full of hope.

Happy the young man who in the morning of his years makes it his guide, philosopher, and friend. 1 Such is the ideal of Masonry, and fidelity to all t hat is holy demands that we give ourselves to it, trusting the power of truth, the r eality of love, and the sovereign worth of character. For only as we incarnate that ideal in a ctual life and activity does it become real, tangible, and effective. God works for man th rough man and seldom, if at all, in any other way.

Walt Whitman found the basis of all philosophy, all religion, in \"the dear love of man for his comrade, the attraction of friend to friend\" ( The Base of all Metaphysics ). As for Masonic literature, it is one perpetual p aean in praise of the practice of friendship, from earliest time to our own day. T ake, for example, the Illustrations of Masonry , by Preston (first book, sect. i-x); and Arnold, a s we have seen, defined Masonry as Friendship, as did Hutchinson ( The Spirit of Masonry , lectures xi, xii).

If the judgments of the young are austere and need to be softened by charity, the middle years of life need still more the reënforcement of spiritual influence and the inspiration of a holy atmosphere. Also, Albert Pike used to urge upon old men the study of Masonry, the better to help them gather up the scattered thoughts about life and build them into a firm faith; and because Masonry offers to every man a great hop e and consolation.
