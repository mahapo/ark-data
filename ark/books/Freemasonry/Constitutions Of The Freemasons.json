An Online Electronic Edition. This is an online electronic edition of the the first Masonic book printed in America, which was produced in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin in 1734, and was a reprint of a work by James Anderson (who is identified as the author in an appendix) printed in London in 1723. This is the seminal work of American Masonry, edited and pub- lished by one of the founding fathers, and of great importance to the development of colonial society and the formation of the Republic. The work contains a 40-page history of Masonry: from Adam to the reign of King George I, including, among others, Noah, Abra- ham, Moses, Solomon, Hiram Abif, Nebuchadnezzar, Augustus Cae- sar, Vitruvius, King Athelstan the Saxon, Inigo Jones, and James I of England. There are extended descriptions of the Seven Wonders of the World, viz. 1) the Great Pyramid, 2) Solomon’s Temple, 3) the City and Hanging-Gardens of Babylon, 4) the Mausoleum or Tomb of Mausolus, King of Caria, 5) the Lighthouse of Pharos at Alexandria, 6) Phidias’s statue of Jupiter Olympius in Achaia, and 7) the Colossus at Rhodes (although some maintain the 5th is the Obelisk of Semira- mis). It is a celebration of the science of Geometry and the Royal Art of Architecture, as practiced from ancient times until the then-current revival of the Roman or Augustan Style. “The Charges of a Free- Mason” and the “General Regulations” concern rules of conduct for individuals and of governance for Lodges and their officers. The work also includes five songs to be sung at meetings, one of which—“A New Song”—appears in print for the first time and may have been com- posed by Franklin. The document suggests that Masonry, in its modern Anglo-Ameri- can form, was rooted in Old Testament exegesis (“So that the Isra- elites , at their leaving Egypt , were a whole Kingdom of Masons , ... under the Conduct of their GR A N D M A S T ER MOSE S”) and in contemporary Protestant ideals of morality, merit, and political equality."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Title page of the 1734 Philadelphia edition, which measures approximately 5 3 / 4 x 8 inches THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE FREE - MASONS.

No doubt Adam taught his Sons Geometry , and the use of it, in the several Arts and Crafts convenient, at least for those early Times ; for C A I N , we find, built a City, which he call’d CONSECRATED, or DEDICATED, after the Name of his eldest Son E NO C H ; and becoming the Prince of the one Half of Mankind, his Posterity would imi- tate his royal Example in improving both the noble Science and the useful Art.* Nor can we suppose that S E T H was less instructed, who being the Prince of the other Half of Mankind, and also the prime Cultivator of Astronomy , would take equal care to teach Geometry and Masonry to his Offspring, who had also the mighty Advantage of Adam’s living among them.† But without regarding uncertain Accounts, we may safely conclude the old World , that lasted 1656 Years, could not be ignorant of Masonry ; and that both the Families of Seth and Cain erected many curious Works, until at length NOA H , the ninth from Seth, was commanded and directed of God to build the great Ark , which, tho’ of Wood, was certainly fab- ricated by Geometry , and according to the Rules of Masonry . NOA H , and his three Sons, JA PH E T , S H E M , and HAM, all Masons true , brought with them over the Flood the Tra ditions and Arts of the Ante-deluvians, and amply com municated them to their growing Offspring ; for about 101 Years after the Flood we find a vast Number of ’em, if not the whole Race of Noah , in the Vale of Shinar , employ’d in building a City and large To w e r , in order to make to them selves a Name, and to prevent their Dispersion. And tho’ they carry’d on the Work to a monstrous Height, and by their Vanity provok’d God to confound their Devices, by confounding their Speech, which occasion’d their Dis- persion ; yet their Skill in Masonry is not the less to be cele- brated, having spent above 53 Years in that prodigious Work, and upon their Dispersion carry’d the mighty Know ledge with them into distant Parts, where they found the good Use of it in the Settlement of their Kingdoms, Com mon wealths, and Dynasties . And tho’ afterwards it was lost in most Parts of the Earth, it was especially preserv’d in Shinar and As- syria, where N I M ROD ,* the Founder of that Monarchy, after the Dispersion, built many splendid Cities, as Ereck , Accad , and Calneh , in S H I NA R ; from whence afterwards he went forth into A S S Y R I A , and built Nineveh , Rehoboth , Caleh , and Rhesin . * As other Arts were also improved by them, viz. working in Metal by T U B A L C A I N , Music by J U B A L , Pastorage and Te n t - Making by JA BA L, which last is good Architecture. † For by some V estiges of Antiquity we find one of ‘em, godly ENOCH (who dy’d not, but was translated alive to Heaven) prophe- cying of the final Conflagration at the Day of Judgment ( as St. Jude tells us) and likewise of the General Deluge for the Punishment of the World : Upon which he erected his two large Pillars, (tho’ some ascribe them to Seth) the one of Stone, and the other of Brick, whereon were engraven the Liberal Sciences, &c. And that the Stone Pillar remain’d in Syria until the Days of Ve s p a sia n the Emperor . * N I MROD, which signifies a Rebel, was the Name given him by the holy Family, and by Moses ; but among his Friends in Chaldea , his proper Name was BELUS , which signifies LORD , and afterwards was worshipped as a God by many Nations, under the Name of Bel or Baal , and became the Bacchus of the Ancients, or Bar Chus , the Son of CHUS.

But it is not expedient to speak more plain of the Premises, except in a formed Lodge . From hence, therefore, the Science and Art were both transmitted to latter Ages and distant Climes, not with- standing the Confusion of Languages or Dialects, which tho’ it might help to give Rise to the Masons Faculty and an- cient universal Practice of conversing without speaking, and of knowing each other at a Distance, yet hinder’d not the Improvement of Masonry in each Colony and their Com mun- ication in their distinct National Dialect. And, no doubt, the Royal Art was brought down to Egypt by M I T Z R A I M, the second Son of Ham , about six Years after the Confusion at Babel , and after the Flood 160 Years, when he led thither his Colony ; (for Egypt is Mitzraim in Hebrew ) because we find the River Nile ’s overflowing its Banks, soon caus’d an Improvement in Geometry , which consequently brought Masonry much in request : For the an- cient noble Cities, with the other magnificent Edifices of that Country, and particularly the famous PYRAMIDS, de mon strate the early Taste and Genius of that ancient King- dom. Nay, one of those Egyptian PY R A M IDS* is reck on’d the First of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Account of which, by Historians and Travellers, is almost incredible. The Sacred Records inform us well that the eleven great Sons of CANAAN (the youngest Son of Ham ) soon forti- fied themselves in strong Holds, and stately walled Cities, and erected most beautiful Temples and Mansions ; for when the Israelites, under the great Joshua, invaded their Coun try, they found it so regularly fenc’d, that without the im me diate Intervention of God in behalf of his peculiar People, the Ca- naanites were impregnable and invincible. Nor can we sup- pose less of the other Sons of Ham , viz. Cush , his eld est, in South Arabia , and Phut , or Phuts , (now called Fez ) in We s t Africa . And surely the fair and gallant Posterity of JA PH E T, (the eldest Son of Noah ) even such as travell’d into the Isles of the Gentiles , must have been equally skill’d in Geometry and Masonry ; tho’ we know little of their Transactions and mighty Works, until their original Knowledge was almost lost by the Havock of War, and by not maintaining a due Correspondence with the polite and learned Nations ; for when that Correspondence was open’d in After-Ages, we find they began to be most curious Architects. The Posterity of SH E M had also equal Opportunities of cultivating the useful Art , even those of ’em that planted their Colonies in the South and East of Asia ; much more those of ’em, that in the great Assyrian Empire, liv’d in a separate State, or were blended with other Families : Nay, that holy Branch of SHEM (of whom, as concerning the Flesh, CHR IS T came) could not be unskilful in the learned Arts of Assyria ; for A BR A M, after the Confusion at Babel about 268 Years, was called out of Ur of the Chaldees , where he learned Geometry , and the Arts that are perform’d by it, which he would carefully transmit to Ishmael , to Isaac , and * The Marble Stones, brought a vast way from the Quarries of Arabia , were most of ’em 30 Foot long ; and its Foundation cover’d the Ground 700 Foot on each Side, or 2800 Foot in Com- pass, and 481 in perpendicular Height. And in perfecting it were employed every Day, for 20 whole Years, 360,000 Men, by some ancient Egyptian King long before the Israelites were a People, for the Honour of his Empire, and at last to become his To m b .

Indeed, the select Family long used Military Architecture only, as they were Sojourners among Strangers ; but before the 430 Years of their Peregrination were expired, even about 86 Years before their Exodus , the Kings of Egypt forc’d most of them to lay down their Sheperds Instru ments, and Warlike Accoutrements, and train’d them to another sort of Architecture in Stone and Brick , as holy Writ, and other Histories, acquaint us ; which God did wise ly over-rule, in order to make them good Masons before they possess’d the promis’d Land, then famous for most curious Masonry . And while marching to Canaan thro’ Arabia , under Moses , God was pleased to inspire BE Z A L E E L, of the Tribe of Judah , and A HOL I A B, of the Tribe of Dan , with Wisdom of Heart for erecting that most glorious Tent, or Ta b e r n a - cle , wherein the SHECHINAH resided ; which, tho’ not of Stone or Brick, was framed, by Geometry , a most beauti- ful Piece of Architecture, (and prov’d afterwards the Model of Solomon ’s Temple) according to the Pattern that God had shewn to MOSE S in the Mount ; who therefore became the GEN ER A L M A S T ER-M A SON, as well as King of Jessurun , being well skill’d in all the Egyptian Learn- ing, and divinely inspir’d with more sublime Knowledge in Masonry , So that the Israelites , at their leaving Egypt , were a whole Kingdom of Masons , well instructed, under the Conduct of their GR A N D M A S T ER MOSE S, who often mar shall’d them into a regular and general Lodge , while in the Wil- derness, and gave them wise Charges, Orders, &c . had they been well observ’d ! But no more of the Premises must be mention’d. And after they were possess’d of Canaan , the Israelites came not short of the old Inhabitants in Masonry , but rather vastly improv’d it, by the special Direction of Heaven ; they fortify’d better, and improv’d their City-Houses and the Palaces of their Chiefs, and only fell short in sacred Archi- tecture while the Ta b e r n a c l e stood, but no longer ; for the finest sacred Building of the Canaanites was the Te m p l e of Dagon in Gaza of the Philistines , very magnificent, and ca- pacious enough to receive 5000 People under its Roof, that was artfully supportcd by two main Columns * ; and was a wonderful Discovery of their mighty Skill in true Masonry, as must he own’d. But Dagon ’s Temple, and the finest Structures of Ty r e and Sidon , could not be compared with the E T ER NA L God’s Temple at Jerusalem, begun and finish’d, to the Amazement of all the World, in the short space of seven Ye a r s and six Months , by that wisest Man and most glorious King of Israel , the Prince of Peace and Architecture , SOL- OMON (the Son of David , who was refused that Honour for being a Man of Blood) by divine Direction, without the Noise of Work-mens Tools, though there were employ’d about it no less than 3600 Princes ,† or Master-Masons , to * By which the glorious SAMPSON pull’d it down upon the Lords of the Philistines , and was also intangled in the same Death which he drew upon his Enemies for putting out his Eyes, after he had reveal’d his Secrets to his Wife, that betray’d him into their Hands ; for which Weakness he never had the Honour to be number’d among Masons : But it is not convenient to write more of this. † In 1 Kings v. 16. they are call’d Harodim, Rulers or Provosts assisting King Solomon, who were set over the Work, and their Number there is only 3,300 : But 2 Chron. ii. 18. they are called Menatzchim, Overseers and Com forters of the People in Working, and in Number 3,600 ; be cause either 300 might be more curious Artists, A.

Nor do we read of any thing in Canaan so large, the Wall that inclos’d it being 7700 Foot in Compass ; far less any holy Structure fit to be nam’d with it, for exactly pro- portion’d and beautiful Dimensions, from the magni ficent Porch on the East , to the glorious and reverend Sanctum Sanctorum on the We s t , with most lovely and con venient Apartments for the Kings and Princes , Priests and Levites , Israelites , and Gentiles also ; it being an House of Prayer for all Nations, and capable of receiving in the Te m ple proper , and in all its Courts and Apartments to gether, no less than 300,000 People, by a modest Cal culation, allowing a square Cubit to each Person. and the Over seers of the said 3,300 ; or rather, not so excellent, and only Deputy-Masters, to supply their Places in case of Death or Absence, that so there might be always 3,300 acting Masters compleat ; or else they might be the Over seers of the 70,000 Ish Sabbal, Men of Burden or La bourers, who were not Masons but served the 80,000 Ish Chotzeb, Men of Hewing , called also Ghiblim, Stone Cutters and Sculpturers ; and also Bonai, Builders in Stone, part of which belong’d to Solomon, and part to Hiram, King of Tyre, 1 Kings v. 18. * We r e a d (2 Chron. ii. 13.) H IR A M King of Ty re ( called there Huram) in his Letter to King SOLOMON, says , I have sent a cun- ning Man, le Huram Abhi, not to be translated according to the vul- gar Greek and Latin, Huram my Father, as if this Architect was King HIRAM’ s Father ; for his Description, ver. 14. refutes it, and the Original plainly imports, Huram of my Father’ s , viz. the Chief Master-Mason of my Father, King A B I B A L U S ; (who enlarg’d and beautify’d the city of Tyre, as ancient Histories inform us, whereby the Ty ria ns at this time were most expert in Masonry) tho’ some think HIRAM the King might call Hiram the Architect Father, as learned and skilful Men were wont to be call’d of old Times, or as Joseph was call’d the Fat her of Pharaoh ; and as the same Hiram is call’d Solo- mon’s FAT H ER, (2 Chron. iv. 16.) where ‘tis said Shelomoh lammelech Abhif Churam ghnasah, Did Huram , his Father, make to King Solomon . But the Difficulty is over at once, by allowing the Word Abif to be the Surname of Hiram the Mason, called also (chap. ii. 13.) Hiram Abi, as here Hiram Abif ; for being so amply describ’d, (chap. ii. 14.) we may easily suppose his Surname would not be conceal’d : And this Reading makes the Sense plain and compleat, viz. that HIRAM, King of Ty r e , sent to King Solomon , his Namesake H IR A M A BIF, the Prince of Architects, describ’d (1 Kings vii. 14.) to be a Widow’s Son of the Tribe of Naphthali ; and in 1 Chron. ii. 14. the said King of Ty re calls him the Son of a Woman of the Daughters of Dan ; and in both Places, that his Father was a Man of Tyre ; which Difficulty is remov’d by supposing his Mother was either of the Tribe of Dan , or of the Daughters of the City called Dan in the Tribe of Naphtha li , and his deceased Father had been a Naphtha lite , whence his Mother was called a Widow of Naphthali ; for his Father is not called a Ty ria n by }"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"[ 16 ] [ 17 ] And if we consider the 1453 Columns of Parian Marble, with twice as many Pillasters , both having glorious Capitals of several Orders, and about 2246 Windows , besides those in the Pavement , with the unspeakable and costly Decor a tions of it within ; (and much more might be said ) we must conclude its Prospect to transcend our Imagination; and that it was justly esteem’d by far the finest Piece of Masonry upon Earth before or since, and the chief Wo n d e r of the World ; and was dedicated, or consecrated, in the most so lemn manner, by King SOLOMON. But leaving what must not, and indeed cannot, be communicated by Writing, we may warrantably affirm that however ambitious the Heathen were in cultivating of the Royal Art , it was never perfected, until God condescended to instruct his peculiar People in rearing the above-men tion’d stately Te n t , and in building at length this gorgeous House , fit for the special Refulgence of his Glory , where he dwelt between the Cherubims on the Mercy-Seat , and from thence gave them frequent oraculous Responses. This most sumptuous, splendid, beautiful and glorious Edifice, attracted soon the inquisitive Artists of all Nations to spend some time at Jerusalem , and survey its peculiar Ex- cellencies, as much as was allow’d to the Gentiles ; where- by they soon discover’d, that all the World, with their joint Skill, came far short of the Israelites , in the Wisdom and Dexterity of Architecture , when the wise King SOLO MON was GR A N D M A S T ER of the Lodge at Jerusalem , and the learned King H IR A M was GR A N D M A S T ER of the Lodge at Ty r e , and the inspired HIRAM ABIF was Mas- ter of Work , and Masonry was under the immediate Care and Direction of Heaven, when the Noble and the Wise thought it their Honour to be assisting to the ingenious Masters and Craftsmen , and when the Te m p l e of the TRU E G OD be- came the Wonder of all Travellers, by which, as by the most perfect Pattern, they corrected the Architecture of their own Country upon their Return. So that after the Erection of Solomon’s Temple, Masonry was improv’d in all the neighbouring Nations ; for the many Artists employed about it, under Hiram Abif , after it was finish’d, dispers’d themselves into Syria, Mesopotamia, As- syria, Chaldea, Babylonia, Media, Persia, Arabia, Africa, Lesser Asia, Greece and other Parts of Europe , where they taught this liberal Art to the free born Sons of eminent Per- sons, by whose Dexterity the Kings, Princes, and Poten- tates, built many glorious Piles, and became the GR A N D M A S T ER S, each in his own Territory, and were emulous of excelling in this Royal Art ; nay, even in I N DI A, where the Cor respondence was open, we may conclude the same : Descent, but a Man of Tyre by Habitation ; as Obed Edom the Levite is call’d a Gittite by living among the Gittites , and the Apostle Paul a Man of Ta r s u s . But supposing a Mistake in Transcribers, and that his Father was really a Ty ria n by Blood, and his Mother only of the Tribe either of Dan or of Naphtha li , that can be no Bar against allowing of his vast Capacity ; for as his Father was a Worker in Brass , so he himself was filled with Wisdom and Understanding, and Cunning to work all Works in Brass : And as King SOLOMON sent for him, so King HIRAM , in his Letter to Solomon , says, And now I have sent a cunning Man, endued with Understanding, skilful to work in Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, Stone, Timber, Purple, Blue, fine Linnen and Crimson, also to grave any manner of Graving, and to find out every Device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning Men, and with the cunning Men of my Lord David thy Fat her . This divinely inspired Workman maintain’d this Character in erecting the Temple, and in working the Utensils thereof, far beyond the Performances of Aholiab and Bezaleel , being also universally capable of all sorts of Masonry .

And in the Rooms of the Grand Tower, with arched Roofs, supported by Pillars 75 Foot high, the idolatrous Worship of their God BELUS was perform’d, till now, that this mighty Mason and Monarch erected round this ancient Pile a Temple of two Furlongs on every Side, or a Mile in compass ; where he lodg’d the sacred Trophies of SOLOMON’s Temple , and the golden Image 90 Foot high, that he had consecrated in the Plains of Dura , as were formerly in the Tower lodg’d many other golden Images, and many precious things, that were afterwards all seiz’d by XERXES , and amounted to above 21 Millions Sterling.

Yet the great Care that the SC OT S took of true Ma- sonry, prov’d afterwards very useful to ENGL A N D ; for the learned and magnanimous Queen E L I Z A BE T H, who encourag’d other Arts, discourag’d this ; because, being a Wo m a n , she could not be made a Mason , tho’ as other great Women, she might have much employ’d Masons, like Semir- amis and Artemisia .* But upon her Demise, King JA M E S VI. of SC OT- L A N D succeeding to the Crown of ENGL A N D, being a Mason King, reviv’d the English Lodges ; and as he was the First King of GREAT BRITAIN, he was also the First Prince in the World that recover’d the Roman Architecture from the Ruins of Gothic Ignorance : For after many dark or illiterate Ages, as soon as all Parts of Learning reviv’d, and Geometry recover’d its Ground, the polite Nations be- gan to discover the Confusion and Impropriety of the Goth- ick Buildings ; and in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centu- ries the AUG US TA N S T IL E was rais’d from its Rubbish in Italy , by BRAMANTE, BARBARO, SANSOVINO, SANGALLO, MICHAEL ANGELO, RAPHAEL URBIN, JULIO ROMANO, SERGLIO, LABACO, SCA MOZI, V IGNOL A, and many other bright Archi- that Minority, and soon influenc’d the Parliament-Men to lay hold of such supposed Agreements of the working Masons, for making an Act that might seem to reflect Dishonour upon even the whole worshipful Fraternity, in whose Favour several Acts had been both before and af- ter that Period made. *ELIZABETH being jealous of any Assemblies of her Subjects, whose Business she was not duly appriz’d of, attempted to break up the annual Communication of Masons , as dangerous to her Govern- ment : But, as old Masons have transmitted it by Tradition, when the noble Persons her Majesty had comissioned, and brought a sufficient Posse with them at Yo r k on St . John’s Day, were once admitted into the Lodge , they made no use of Arms, and return’d the Queen a most honourable Account of the ancient Fraternity, whereby her political Fears and Doubts were dispell’d, and she let them alone, as a People much respected by the Noble and the Wise of all the polite Nations, but neglected the Art all her Reign. 1640. 1707."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"[ 36 ] [ 37 ] tects : but above all, by the Great PA L L A DIO, who has not yet been duly imitated in Italy , though justly rival’d in Eng- land by our great Master-Mason , INIGO JONES.

That King founded also his royal Palace at GR EEN W ICH, according to Mr. Inig o Jones’ s Design (which he drew before he dy’d) conducted by his Son-in-Law Mr. W E B : It is now turn’d into an Hospi- tal for Seamen.

In Presence of Strangers not Masons. 5. At Home, and in the Neighbourhood. 6. Towards a strange Brother. I. Concerning GOD and RELIGION. A Mason is oblig’d by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law ; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stu- pid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine . But though in an- cient Times Masons were charg’d in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet ’tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves ; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may be distinguish’d ; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must else have remain’d at a perpetual Distance. II. Of the CIVIL MAGISTRATE supreme and subordinate. A Mason is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wher- ever he resides or works, and is never to be concern’d in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutiful to inferior Mag- istrates ; for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dispos’d to encourage the Craftsmen, be- cause of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer’d the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourish’d in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanc’d in his Rebel- lion, however he may be pitied as an unhappy Man ; and if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Um- brage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being ; they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible. III. Of LODGES. A LOD GE is a place where Masons assemble and work : Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz’d Society of Masons, is call’d a LODGE, and every Brother ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its By-Laws and the GEN ER A L REGULATIONS. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regula- tions of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annex’d. In ancient Times no Master or Fellow could be absent from it, especially when warn’d to appear at it, without incurring a severe Censure, until it appear to the Master and Wa r d e n s , that pure Necessity hinder’d him. The Persons admitted Members of a Lodge must be good and true Men, free-born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good Report. IV. Of MASTERS, WA R D E N S , Fellows, and Apprentices . All Preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Worth and personal Merit only ; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to Shame, nor the Royal"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Craft despis’d : Therefore no Master or Wa r d e n is chosen by Seniority, but for his Merit. It is impossible to describe these things in writing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a way peculiar to this Fraternity : Only Candidates may know, that no Master should take an Apprentice, unless he has sufficient Imployment for him, and unless he be a perfect Youth, having no Maim or De- fect in his Body, that may render him uncapable of learning the Art, of serving his Master’ s LORD , and of being made a Brother, and then a Fellow-Craft in due time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of the Coun- try directs ; and that he should be descended of honest Par- ents ; that so, when otherwise qualify’d, he may arrive to the Honour of being the WA R DEN, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the GR A N D- M A S T ER of all the Lodges, according to his Merit. No Brother can be a WA R DEN until he has pass’d the part of a Fellow-Craft ; nor a M A S T ER until he has acted as a Wa r d e n , nor GR A N D-WA R DEN until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor GR AND MASTER unless he has been a Fellow-Craft before his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of honest Parents, and who is of singular great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. And for the better, and easier, and more honourable Discharge of his Office, the Grand-Master has a Power to chuse his own DEPU T Y GR A N D-M A S T ER, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge , and has the Privilege of acting whatever the GR A N D M A S T ER, his Principal, should act, unless the said Principal be present, or interpose his Authority by a Letter. These Rulers and Governors, supreme and subordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obey’d in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulations, with all Humility, Reverence, Love, and Alacrity. V. Of the Management of the CRAF T in working. All Masons shall work honestly on working Days, that they may live creditably on holy Days ; and the time appoint- ed by the Law of the Land, or confirm’d by Custom, shall be observ’d. The most expert of the Fellow-Craftsmen shall be chosen or appointed the Master, or Overseer of the Lord’s Wo r k ; who is to be call’d MASTER by those that work under him. The Craftsmen are to avoid all ill Language, and to call each other by no disobliging Name, but Brother or Fellow ; and to behave themselves courteously within and without the Lodge. The Master, knowing himself to be able of Cunning, shall undertake the Lord’ s Work as reasonably as possible, and truly dispend his Goods as if they were his own ; nor to give more Wages to any Brother or Apprentice than he re- ally may deserve. Both the MASTER and the Masons receiving their Wages justly, shall be faithful to the Lord, and honestly fin- ish their Work, whether Ta s k or Journey. Nor put the Work to Ta s k that hath been accustomed to Journey. None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him or put him out of his Work, if he be capable to finish the same ; for no Man can finish another’s Work so much to the Lord’s Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquaint- ed with the Design and Draughts of him that began it."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"[ 52 ] [ 53 ] When a Fellow-Craftsman is chosen Wa r d e n of the Work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fel- lows, shall carefully oversee the Work in the Master’ s Ab- sence to the Lord’ s Profit ; and his Brethren shall obey him. All Masons employ’d, shall meekly receive their Wages without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Work is finish’d. A younger Brother shall be instructed in working, to pre- vent spoiling the Materials for want of Judgment, and for encreasing and continuing of Brotherly Love. All the Tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge. No Labourer shall be employ’d in the proper Work of Masonry ; nor shall Free-Masons work with those that are not free, without an urgent Necessity ; nor shall they teach Labourers and unaccepted Masons, as they should teach a Brother or Fellow. VI. Of BEHAVIOUR, viz. 1. In the LODGE while CONSTUTUTED . You are not to hold private Committees, or separate Con- versation, without Leave from the Master, nor to talk of any thing impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wa r d e n s , or any Brother speaking to the Master : Nor be- have yourself ludicrously or jestingly while the Lodge is en- gaged in what is serious and solemn ; nor use any unbecom- ing Language upon any Pretence whatsoever ; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows, and put them to worship. If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent Judges of all such Controver- sies, (unless you carry it by Appeal to the GRAND LODGE) and to whom they ought to be referr’d, unless a Lord’s Wo r k b e hinder’d the mean while, in which Case a particular Reference may be made ; but you must never go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute Necessity apparent to the Lodge. 2. BEHAVIOUR after the LODGE is over and the B R ET H R E N not gone. You may enjoy yourself with innocent Mirth, treating one an- other according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying any- thing offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purpos- es. Therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought with- in the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, or State-Policy, we being only, as Masons, of the Catholick Religion above-mention’d ; we are also of all Nations, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languages, and are resolv’d against all Politicks , as what never yet conduc’d to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This Charge has been always strictly enjoin’d and observ’d ; but es- pecially ever since the Reformation in BR I TA I N, or the Dissent and Secession of these Nations from the Communion of ROM E . 3. BEHAVIOUR when Brethren meet without Strangers, but not in a LODGE form’d . You are to salute one another in a courteous Manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual In- struction as shall be thought expedient, without being overseen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogat-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"[ 54 ] [ 55 ] ing from that Respect which is due to any Brother, were he not a Mason : For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a Man that he had before ; nay rather it adds to his Honour, espe- cially if he has deserv’d well of the Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid ill Manners. 4. BEHAVIOUR in the Presence of STRANGERS not MASONS . You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, that the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated ; and some- times you shall divert a Discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of the worshipful Fraternity. 5. BEHAVIOUR at HOME, and in your NEIGHBOURHOOD. You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man ; partic- ularly, not to let your Family, Friends, and Neighbors know the Concerns of the Lodge, &c. but wisely to consult your own Honour, and that of the ancient Brotherhood, for Rea- sons not to be mention’d here. You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from home, after Lodge Hours are past ; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Families be not ne- glected or injured, nor you disabled from working. 6. BEHAVIOUR towards a strange Brother. You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be impos’d upon by an ignorant false Pretender , whom you are to reject with Contempt and Derision, and beware of giving him any Hints of Knowledge. But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly ; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be reliev’d : You must employ him some Days, or else recommend him to be employ’d. But you are not charged to do beyond your Ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true, before any other poor People in the same Circumstances. FINALLY, All these CHARGES you are to observe, and also those that shall be communicated to you in another way ; cultivating BROT H ER LY-LOV E, the Founda- tion and Cape-stone, the Cement and Glory of this ancient Fraternity, avoiding all Wrangling and Quarrelling, all Slander and Backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his Character, and do- ing him all good Offices, as far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no farther. And if any of them do you Injury, you must apply to your own or his Lodge and from thence you may appeal to the GR A N D LOD GE at the Quarterly Communication, and from thence to the an- nual GR A N D LOD GE, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct of our Fore-fathers in every Nation ; never taking a legal Course but when the Case cannot be otherwise decid- ed, and patiently listning to the honest and friendly Advice of Master and Fellows, when they would prevent your going to Law with Strangers, or would excite you to put a speedy Period to a l l Law-Suits, that so you may mind the Affair of M A SONRY with the more Alacrity and Success ; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at Law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their Mediation, which ought"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"[ 56 ] [ 57 ] to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren ; and if that Submission is impracticable, they must however carry on their Process or Law-Suit without Wrath and Ran- cor (not in the common way) saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good Offices to be renew’d and continu’d ; that all may see the benign Influence of M A - SONRY, as all true Masons have done from the Beginning of the Wo r l d , and will do to the End of Time. AMEN SO MOTE IT BE. POSTSCRIPT . A Wo r t h y BROTHER, learned in the Law , has com- municated to the Author (while this Sheet was print- ing) the Opinion of the Great Judge COKE upon the Act against Masons , 3 Hen . VI. Chap. I. which is Printed in this Book, Page 31, and which Quotation the Author has compar’d with the Original, viz . COKE’s In stitutes , third Part , Fol . 99. The CAUSE wherefore this Offence was made Felony, is, for that the good Course and Effect of the Statutes of La- bourers were thereby violated and broken. Now ( says my Lord C OK E ) all the Statutes concerning Labourers, before this Act, and whereunto this Act doth refer, are repeal’d by the Statute of 5 Eliz. Chap. 4. whereby the Cause and End of the making of this Act is taken away ; and consequently this Act is become of no Force or Effect ; for, cessante ratione Legis, ces- sat ipsa Lex : And the Indictment of Felony upon this Statute must contain, that those Chapters and Congregations were to the violating and breaking of the good Course and Effect of the Statutes of Labourers ; which now cannot be so alledg’d, because these Statutes be repeal’d. Therefore this would be put out of the Charge of Justices of Peace, written by Master LAMBERT, pag . 227. This Quotation confirms the Tradition of old Masons , that this most learned JUDGE really belong’d to the an- cient Lodge , and was a faithful Brother ."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"[ 59 ] z B X z B X z B X z B X z B X z B X GENERAL REGULATIONS, Compiled first by Mr. G E O R G E P A Y N E , Anno 1720, when he was GR AND-MASTER , and ap- prov’d by the GRAND-LODGE on St. John Bap- tist’ s Day, Anno 1721 ; at Stationer’s-Hall , LON - DON; when the most noble PRINCE John Duke of MON TAG U was unanimously chosen our GR AND-MASTER for the Year ensuing ; who chose JOH N B E A L , M.D., his Deputy Grand-Master ; and Mr. Josiah Villeneau were chosen by the Lodge Mr. Tho. Morris, jun . GRAND-WARDENS. And now, by the Command of our said Right Wor- shipful GR AND-MASTER MONTAGU, the Author of this Book has compar’d them with, and reduc’d them to the ancient Records and immemo- rial Usage, of the Fraternity, and digested them into this new Method, with several proper Explications, for the Use of the Lodges in and about London and We s t m i n s t e r . I. HE GR AND-MASTER, or his DE P U - T Y , hath Authority and Right, not only to be present in any true Lodge , but also to preside where-ever he is, with the Master of the Lodge on his Left-Hand, and to order his Grand-War- dens to attend him, who are not to act in particular Lodges { }"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"[ 60 ] [ 61 ] as Wa r d e n s , but in his Presence, and at his Command ; be- cause there the GR A N D-M A S T ER may command the Wa r d e n s of that Lodge , or any other Brethren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his Wardens pro tempore . II. The M A S T ER of a particular Lodge , has the Right and Authority of congregating the Members of his Lodge into a Chapter at pleasure, upon any Emergency or Occur- rence, as well as to appoint the time and place of their usual forming : And in case of Sickness, Death, or necessary Ab- sence of the Master, the senior Wa r d e n shall act as Master pro tempore , if no Brother is present who has been Master of that Lodge before ; for in that Case the absent Master ’s Authority reverts to the last Master then present ; though he cannot act until the said senior Warden has once congre- gated the Lodge, or in his Absence the junior Warden . III. The Master of each particular Lodge , or one of the Wa r d e n s , or some other Brother by his Order, shall keep a Book containing their By-Laws , the Names of their Mem- bers, with a List of all the Lodges in Town, and the usual Times and Places of their forming, and all their Transac- tions that are proper to be written. IV. No Lodge shall make more than F I V E new Brethren at one Time, nor any Man under the Age of Twenty-five, who must be also his own Master ; unless by a Dispensation from the Grand-Master or his Deputy . V. No man can be made or admitted a Member of a par- ticular Lodge , without previous Notice one Month before given to the said Lodge , in order to make due Enquiry into the Reputation and Capacity of the Candidate ; unless by the Dispensation aforesaid. VI. But no man can be enter’d a Brother in any particu- lar Lodge , or admitted to be a Member thereof, without the unanimous Consent of all the Members of that Lodge then present when the Candidate is propos’d, and their Consent is formally ask’d by the Master ; and they are to signify their Consent or Dissent in their own prudent Way, either virtu- ally or in form, but with Unanimity: Nor is this inherent Privilege subject to a Dispensation ; because the Members of a particular Lodge are the best Judges of it ; and if a frac- tious Member should be impos’d on them, it might spoil their Harmony, or hinder their Freedom ; or even break and disperse the Lodge , which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren. VII. Every new Brother at his making is decently to cloath the Lodge , that is, all the Brethren present, and to deposite something for the Relief of indigent and decay’d Brethren, as the Candidate shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small Allowance stated by the By-Laws of that particular Lodge ; which Charity shall be lodg’d with the Master or Wa r d e n s , or the Cashier , if the Members think fit to chuse one. And the Candidate shall also solemnly promise to sub- mit to the Constitutions , the Charges, and Regulations , and to such other good Usages as shall be intimated to them in Time and Place convenient. VIII. No Set or Number of Brethren shall withdraw or separate themselves from the Lodge in which they were made Brethren , or were afterwards admitted Members, unless the Lodge becomes too numerous ; nor even then, without a Dis- pensation from the Grand-Master or his Deputy : And when they are thus separated, they must either immediately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the unanimous Consent of that other Lodge to which they"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"[ 62 ] [ 63 ] go (as above regulated ) or else they must obtain the Grand- Master’s Warrant to join in forming a new Lodge. If any Set or Number of Masons shall take upon them- selves to form a Lodge without the Grand-Master’s Warrant, the regular Lodges are not to countenance them, or own them as fair Brethren and duly form’d, nor approve of their Acts and Deeds ; but must treat them as Rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand-Master shall in his Pru- dence direct, and until he approve of them by his Wa r r a n t , which must be signify’d to the other Lodges, as the Custom is when a new Lodge is to be register’d in the List of Lodges . IX. But if any Brother so far misbehave himself as to ren- der his Lodge uneasy, he shall be twice duly admonish’d by the Master or Wa r d e n s in a form’d Lodge ; and if he will not refrain his Imprudence, and obediently submit to the Ad- vice of the Brethren, and reform what gives them Offence, he shall be dealt with according to the By-Laws of that particular Lodge , or else in such a manner as the Quarterly Communication shall in their great Prudence think fit ; for which a new Regulation may be afterwards made. X. The Majority of every particular Lodge , when congre- gated, shall have the Privilege of giving In st ruction s to their Master and Wa r d e n s , before the assembling of the Grand Chapter, or Lodge at the three Quarterly Communications hereafter mention’d, and of the Annual Grand Lodge too ; because their Master and Wa r d e n s are their Representatives, and are supposed to speak their Mind. XI. All particular Lodges are to observe the same Usages as much as possible ; in order to which, and for cultivating a good Understanding among Free-Masons, some members out of every Lodge shall be deputed to visit the other Lodges as often as shall be thought convenient. XII. The GR A N D-Lodge consists of, and is form’d by the Masters and Wa r d e n s of all the regular particular Lodges upon Record, with the GR A N D-M A S T ER at their Head, and his Deputy on his Left-hand, and the Grand-Wardens in their proper Places ; and must have a QUARTER LY COMMU NICATION about Michaelmas , Christmas, and Lady-Day , in some convenient Place, as the Grand-Master shall appoint, where no Brother shall be present, who is not at that time a Member thereof, without a Dispensation ; and while he stays, he shall not be allow’d to vote, nor even give his Opinion, without Leave of the Grand-Lodge ask’d and given, or unless it be duly ask’d by the said Lodge. All Matters are to be determin’d in the Grand-Lodge by a Majority of Votes, each Member having one Vote, and the Grand-Master having two Votes, unless the said Lodge leave any particular thing to the Determination of the Grand- Master, for the sake of Expedition. XIII. At the said Quarterly Communication, all Matters that concern the Fraternity in general, or particular Lodges , or single Brethren, are quietly, sedately, and maturely to be discours’d of and transacted : Apprentices must be admitted Masters and Fellow-Craft only here, unless by a Dispensa- tion. Here also all Differences, that cannot be made up and accommodated privately, nor by a particular Lodge , are to be seriously considered and decided : And if any Brother thinks himself aggrieved by the Decision of this Board, he may appeal to the annual Grand-Lodge next ensuing, and leave his Appeal in Writing, with the Grand-Master , or his Deputy , or the Grand-Wardens . Here also the Master or the Wa r d e n s of each particular Lodge shall bring and produce a List of such Members as have been made, or even admitted in their particular Lodges since the last Communication of the Grand-Lodge : And there"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"[ 64 ] [ 65 ] shall be a Book kept by the Grand-Master , or his Deputy , or rather by some Brother whom the Grand-Lodge shall ap- point for SECR ETARY, wherein shall be recorded all the Lodges , with their usual Times and Places of forming, and the Names of all the Members of each Lodge ; and all the Affairs of the Grand-Lodge that are proper to be written. They shall also consider of the most prudent and effec- tual Methods of collecting and disposing of what Money shall be given to, or lodged with them in Charity , towards the Relief only of any true Brother fallen into Poverty or Decay, but of none else : But every particular Lodge shall dispose of their own Charity for poor Brethren, according to their own By-Laws , until it be agreed by all the Lodges (in a new Regulation) to carry in the Charity collection by them to the GR AND-LODGE, at the Quarterly or Annual Communication , in order to make a common Stock of it, for the more handsome Relief of poor Brethren . They shall also appoint a Tr e a s u r e r , a Brother of good worldly Substance, who shall be a Member of the Grand- Lodge by virtue of his Office, and shall be always present, and have Power to move to the Grand-Lodge any thing, es- pecially what concerns his Office. To him shall be commit- ted all Money rais’d for Charity , or for any other Use of the Grand-Lodge , which he shall write down in a Book, with the respective Ends and Uses for which the several Sums are in- tended ; and shall expend or disburse the same by such a cer- tain Order sign’d, as the Grand-Lodge shall afterwards agree to in a new Regulation : But he shall not vote in chusing a Grand-Master or Wa r d e n s , though in every other Transac- tion. As in like manner the Secretary shall be a Member of the Grand-Lodge by virtue of his Office, and vote in every thing except in chusing a Grand-Master or Wardens. The Tr e a s u r e r and Secretary shall have each a Clerk , who must be a Brother and Fellow-Craft , but never must be a Member of the Grand-Lodge , nor speak without being allow’d or desir’d. The Grand-Master, or his Deputy , shall always command the Tr e a s u r e r and Secretary , with their Clerks and Books, in order to see how Matters go on, and to know what is expedi- ent to be done upon any emergent Occasion. Another Brother (who must be a Fellow-Craft ) should be appointed to look after the Door of the Grand-Lodge ; but shall be no Member of it. But these Offices may be farther explain’d by a new Reg- ulation , when the Necessity and Expediency of them may more appear than at present to the Fraternity . XIV. If at any GR A N D-LOD GE, stated or occa- sional, quarterly or annual, the GR AND-MASTER and his Deputy should be both absent, then the present Master of a Lodge , that has been the longest a Free-Mason , shall take the Chair, and preside as Grand-Master pro tempore ; and shall be vested with all his Power and Honour for the time ; provided there is no Brother present that has been Grand-Master formerly, or Deputy Grand-Master ; for the last Grand-Master present, or else the last Deputy present, should always of right take place in the Absence of the pres- ent Grand-Master and his Deputy . XV. In the GR AND-LODGE none can act as Wa r d e n s but the Grand-Wardens themselves, if present ; and if ab- sent, the Grand-Master, or the Person who presides in his Place, shall order private Wardens to act as Grand-Wardens pro tempore , whose Places are to be supply’d by two Fellow- Craft of the same Lodge , call’d forth to act, or sent thither"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"[ 66 ] [ 67 ] by the particular Master thereof ; or if by him omitted, then they shall be call’d by the Grand-Master , that so the Grand- Lodge may be always compleat. XVI. The GR AND-WAR DENS, or any others, are first to advise with the Deputy about the Affairs of the Lodge or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the Grand-Master without the Knowledge of the Deputy , unless he refuse his Concurrence in any certain necessary Affair ; in which Case, or in case of any Difference between the Deputy, and the Grand-Wardens, or other Brethren, both Parties are to go by Concert to the Grand-Master , who can easily decide the Controversy and make up the Difference by virtue of his great Authority. The Grand-Master should receive no Intimation of Busi- ness concerning Masonry , but from his Deputy first, except in such certain Cases as his Worship can well judge of ; for if the Application to the Grand-Master be irregular, he can easily order the Grand-Wardens, or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his Deputy , who is to prepare the Business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his Wo r s h i p . XVII. No GR AND-MASTER , Deputy Grand-Mas- ter, Grand-Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary, or whoever acts for them, or in their stead pro tempore , can at the same time be the Master or Wa r d e n of a particular Lodge ; but as soon as any of them has honourably discharg’d his Grand Office , he returns to that Post or Station in his particular Lodge , from which he was call’d to officiate above. XVIII. If the DEPU T Y GR A N D-M A S T ER be sick, or necessarily absent, the Grand-Master may chuse any Fellow-Craft he pleases to be his Deputy pro tempore : But he that is chosen Deputy at the Grand-Lodge , and the Grand-Wardens too, cannot be discharg’d without the Cause fairly appear to the Majority of the Grand-Lodge ; and the GR AND-MASTER , if he is uneasy, may call a GR A N D- LODGE on purpose to lay the Cause before them, and to have their Advice and Concurrence : In which case, the Majority of the Grand-Lodge , if they cannot reconcile the MASTER and his Deputy or his Wa r d e n s , are to concur in allowing the MASTER to discharge his said Deputy or his said Wa r d e n s , and to chuse another Deputy immediately ; and the said Grand-Lodge shall chuse other Wa r d e n s in that Case, that Harmony and Peace may be preserv’d. XIX. If the GR AND-MASTER should abuse his Power, and render himself unworthy of the Obedience and Subjection of the Lodges , he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a new Regulation ; because hitherto the ancient Fraternity have had no occasion for it, their former GR A N D - M A S T E R S having all behaved themselves worthy of that honourable Office. XX. The GR AND-MASTER , with his Deputy and Wa r d e n s , shall (at least once) go round and visit all the Lodges about Town during his Mastership . XXI. If the GR AND-MASTER die during his Master- ship , or by Sickness, or by being beyond Sea, or any other way should be render’d uncapable of discharging his Office, the DEPU T Y, or in his Absence, the Senior GR AND- WAR DEN, or in his Absence the Junior , or in his Absence any three present Masters of Lodges , shall join to congregate the GR A N D - LOD GE immediately, to advise together upon that Emergency, and to send two of their Number to invite the last GR AND-MASTER to resume his Office, which now in course reverts to him ; or if he refuse, then the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"[ 68 ] [ 69 ] next last , and so backward : But if no former Grand-Master can be found, then the Deputy shall act as Principal until another is chosen ; or if there be no Deputy , then the oldest Master . XXII. The BRETHREN of all the Lodges in and about London and We s t m i n s t e r , shall meet at an ANNUAL COMMUNICATION and Fea st , in some convenient Place, on St . JOHN Baptist ’s Day, or else on St. JOHN Evangelist ’s Day, as the Grand-Lodge shall think fit by a new Regulation, having of late Years met on St. John Bap- tist’ s Day : Provided, The Majority of the Masters and Wa r d e n s , with the Grand- Master , his Deputy and Wa r d e n s , agree at their Quarterly Communication , three Months before, that there shall be a Fea st , and a General Communication of all the Brethren : For if either the Grand-Master , or the Majority of the particular Masters , are against it, it must be dropt for that Time. But whether there shall be a Fea st for all the Brethren , or not, yet the GR AND-LODGE must meet in some conve- nient Place annually on St . JOHN’s Day ; or if it be Sun- day , then on the next Day, in order to chuse every Year a new GRAND-MASTER, Deputy, and Wa r d e n s . XXIII. If it be thought expedient, and the GR A N D- M A S T ER, with the Majority of the Masters and Wa r d e n s , agree to hold a GR A N D F E A S T, according to the an- cient laudable Custom of Masons , then the GR AND-WAR- DENS shall have the Care of preparing the Tickets , seal’d with the Grand-Master’s Seal, of disposing of the Tickets, of receiving the Money for the Tickets, of buying the Ma- terials of the Fea st , of finding out a proper and convenient Place to feast in ; and of every other Thing that concerns the Entertainment. But that the Work may not be too burthensome to the two Grand-Wardens, and that all Matters may be expeditiously and safely managed, the Grand-Master , or his Deputy, shall have Power to nominate and appoint a certain Number of Stewards, as his Worship shall think fit, to act in Concert with the two Grand-Wardens ; all Things relating to the Feast being decided amongst them by a Majority of Voices ; except the Grand-Master or his Deputy interpose by a par- ticular Direction of Appointment. XXIV. The Wardens and Stewards shall, in due time, wait upon the Grand-Master, or his Deputy, for Directions and Orders about the Premisses ; but if his Wo r s h i p and his Deputy are sick, or necessarily absent, they shall call to- gether the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to meet on pur- pose for their Advice and Orders ; or else they may take the Matter wholly upon themselves, and do the best they can. The Grand Wardens and the Stewards are to account for all the Money they receive, or expend, to the Grand-Lodge , after Dinner, or when the Grand-Lodge shall think fit to receive their Accounts. If the Grand-Master pleases, he may in due time summon all the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to consult with them about ordering the Grand-Feast, and about any Emergency or accidental Thing relating thereunto, that may require Advice ; or else to take it upon himself altogether. XXV. The Masters of Lodges shall each appoint one experienc’d and discreet Fellow-Craft of his Lodge, to com- pose a Committee , consisting of one from every Lodge, who shall meet to receive, in a convenient Apartment, every Per- son that brings a Ticket, and shall have Power to discourse him, if they think fit, in order to admit him, or debar him, as they shall see cause : Provided they send no Man away"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"[ 70 ] [ 71 ] before they have acquainted all the Brethren within Doors with the Reasons thereof, to avoid Mistakes ; that so no true Brother may be debarr’d, nor a false Brother or meer Pre- tender, admitted. This Committee must meet very early on St. John’s Day, at the Place, even before any Persons come with Tickets. XXVI. The Grand-Master shall appoint two or more trusty Brethren to be Porters, or Door-keepers, who are also to be early at the Place for some good Reasons ; and who are to be at the Command of the Committee. XXVII. The Grand-Wardens, or the Stewards, shall ap- point before-hand such a Number of Brethren to serve at Table as they think fit and proper for that Work ; and they may advise with the Masters and Wardens of Lodges about the most proper Persons, if they please, or may take in such by their Recommendation ; for none are to serve that Day ; but free and accepted Masons , that the Communication may be free and harmonious. XXVIII. All the Members of the Grand-Lodge must be at the Place long before Dinner, with the Grand-Master, or his Deputy at their Head, who shall retire, and form them- selves. And this is done in order, 1. To receive any Appeals duly lodg’d, as above regulated, that the Appellant may be heard, and the Affair may be ami- cably decided before Dinner, if possible ; but if it cannot, it must be delay’d till after the new Grand-Master is elected ; and if it cannot be decided after Dinner, it may be delay’d, and referr’d to a particular Committee , that shall quietly ad- just it, and make Report to the next Quarterly Communica- tion , that Brotherly-Love may be preserv’d. 2. To prevent any Difference or Disgust which may be fear’d to arise that Day ; that no Interruption may be given to the Harmony and Pleasure of the GR AND FE AST. 3. To consult about whatever concerns the Decency and Decorum of the Grand-Assembly , and to prevent all Inde- cency and ill Manners, the Assembly being promiscuous. 4. To receive and consider of any good Motion or any mo- mentous and important Affair, that shall be brought from the particular Lodges , by their Representatives, the several Masters and Wa r d e n s . XXIX. After these things are discuss’d, the GR AND- MASTER and his Deputy , the Grand-Wardens , or the Stewards , the Secretary , the Tr e a s u r e r , the Clerks , and every other Person, shall withdraw, and leave the Masters and Wa r d e n s of the particular Lodges alone, in order to consult amicably about electing a NEW GRAND-MASTER, or continuing the present , if they have not done it the Day be- fore ; and if they are unanimous for continuing the present Grand-Master, his Wo r s h i p shall be call’d in, and humbly desir’d to do the Fraternity the Honour of ruling them for the Year ensuing : And after Dinner it will be known whether he accepts of it or not ; For it should not be discover’d but by the Election it self. XXX. Then the Master and Wardens, and all the Breth- ren, may converse promiscuously, or as they please to sort together, until the Dinner is coming in, when every Brother takes his Seat at Table. XXXI. Some time after Dinner the GR AND-LODGE is form’d, not in Retirement, but in the Presence of all the Brethren, who yet are not Members of it, and must not therefore speak until they are desired and allow’d. XXXII. If the GR AND-MASTER of last Year has consented with the Masters and Wa r d e n s in private, before Dinner, to continue for the Year ensuing ; then one of the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"[ 72 ] [ 73 ] Grand-Lodge, deputed for that purpose, shall represent to all the Brethren his Wo r s h i p ’s good Government, &c. And turn- ing to him, shall, in the name of the Grand Lodge , humbly request him to do the FR ATERNIT Y the great Honour (if nobly born, if not, the great Kindness ) of continuing to be their Grand Master for the Year ensuing. And his Wo r s h i p declaring his Consent by a Bow or a Speech, as he pleases, the said deputed Member of the Grand-Lodge shall pro- claim him GR AND-MASTER, and all the Members of the Lodge shall salute him in due Form. And all the Breth- ren shall for a few Minutes have leave to declare their Satis- faction, Pleasure and Congratulation. XXXIII. But if either the Master and Wardens have not in private, this Day before Dinner, nor the Day before, desir’d the last Grand-Master to continue in the Master- ship another Year ; or if he, when desir’d, has not consented: Then, The last Grand-Master shall nominate his Successor for the Year ensuing, who if unanimously approv’d by the Grand-Lodge, and if there present, shall be proclaim’d, sa- luted, and congratulated the New Grand Master as above hinted, and immediately install’d by the last Grand-Master, according to Usage. XXXIV. But if that Nomination is not unanimously approv’d, the new Grand-Master shall be chosen immedi- ately by Ballot , every Master and Warden writing his Man’s Name, and the last Grand-Master writing his Man’s Name too ; and the Man, whose Name the last Grand Master shall first take out, casually or by chance, shall be GR AND- MASTER for the Year ensuing ; and if present, he shall be proclaimed, saluted, and congratulated, as above hinted, and forthwith install’d by the last Grand-Master according to Usage. XXXV. The last Grand-Master thus continued, or the new Grand-Master thus install’d, shall next nominate and appoint his Deputy Grand-Master, either the last or a new one, who shall be also declar’d, saluted and congratulated, as above hinted. The GR AND-MASTER shall also nominate the new GR AND-WARDENS , and if unanimously approv’d by the Grand-Lodge , shall be declar’d, saluted, and congratu- lated as above hinted ; but if not, they shall be chosen by Ballot , in the same way as the Grand-Master : As the Wa r - dens of private Lodges are also to be chosen by Ballot in each Lodge , if the Members thereof do not agree to their Master’ s Nomination. XXXVI. But if the BROTHER, whom the present Grand-Master shall nominate for his Successor , or whom the Majority of the Grand-Lodge shall happen to chuse by Ballot, is, by Sickness or other necessary Occasion, absent from the Grand-Feast , he cannot be proclaim’d the NEW GR AND-MASTER, unless the old Grand-Master , or some of the Masters and Wa r d e n s of the GR AND-LODGE can vouch, upon the Honour of a Brother , that the said Person, so nominated or chosen, will readily accept of the said Of- fice ; in which case the old GR AN D-M ASTER shall act as Proxy, and shall nominate the Deputy and Wa r d e n s in his Name, and in his Name also receive the usual Honours, Homage, and Congratulation. XXXVII. Then the GR AND-MASTER shall allow any Brother , Fellow-Craft , or Apprentice to speak, directing his Discourse to his Wo r s h i p ; or to make any Motion for the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"[ 74 ] [ 75 ] good of the Fraternity, which shall be either immediately consider’d and finish’d, or else referr’d to the Consideration of the GR AND-LODGE at their next Communication , stated or occasional. When that is over, XXXVIII. The GR AND-MASTER or his Deputy , or some Brother appointed by him, shall harangue all the Brethren, and give them good Advice : And lastly, after some other Transactions, that cannot be written in any Language, the Brethren may go away or stay longer, as they please. XXXIX. Every Annual GRAND-LODGE has an in- herent Power and Authority to make new Regulations , or to alter these, for the real Benefit of this ancient Fraternity : Provided always that the old LANDMARKS be carefully preser v’d , and that such Alterations and new Regulations be proposed and agreed to at the third Quarterly Communica- tion preceding the Annual Grand Feast ; and that they be of- fered also to the Perusal of all the Brethren before Dinner, in writing, even of the youngest Apprentice ; the Approba- tion and Consent of the Majority of all the Brethren present being absolutely necessary to make the same binding and obligatory ; which must, after Dinner, and after the new GR AND-MASTER is install’d, be solemnly desir’d ; as it was desir’d and obtain’d for these R EGUL ATIONS, when propos’d by the GR AND-LODGE, to about 150 Brethren, on St. John Baptist’s Day , 1721. POSTSCRIPT . Here follows the Manner of constituting a NEW LODGE, as practis’d by his Grace the D U K E of W H A R T ON , the present Right Worshipful GR A N D - M A S T E R , according to the ancient Usages of M A S O N S . A NEW LODGE , for avoiding many irregularities, should be solemnly constituted by the Grand-Master , with his Deputy and Wa r d e n s ; or in the Grand-Master ’s Ab- sence, the Deputy shall act for his Wo r s h i p , and shall chuse some Master of a Lodge to assist him ; or in case the Deputy is absent, the Grand-Master shall call forth some Master of a Lodge to act as Deputy pro tempore .

And the Deputy answering in the affirmative, he shall (by the Grand - Master’s Order) take the Candidate from among his Fellows, and present him to the Grand - Mas- ter ; saying, Right worshipful Grand-Master, the Brethren here desire to be form’d into a new Lodge ; and I present this my worthy Brother to be their Master, whom I know to be of good Morals and great Skill, true and trusty, and a Lover of the whole Fraternity, wheresoever dispers’d over the Face of the Earth."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"[ 76 ] [ 77 ] Then the GR AND-MASTER, placing the Candidate on his left Hand, having ask’d and obtain’d the unanimous Consent of all the Brethren, shall say, I constitute and form these good Brethren into a new Lodge, and appoint you the Master of it, not doubting of your Capacity and Care to preserve the Cement of the Lodge, &c. with some other Expressions that are proper and usual on that Occasion, but not proper to be written. Upon this the Deputy shall rehearse the Charges of a Master , and the GR AND-MASTER shall ask the Candi- date , saying, Do you submit to these Charges as Masters have done in all Ages ? And the Candidate signifying his cordial Submission thereunto, the Grand-Master shall, by certain significant Ceremonies and ancient Usages, install him, and present him with the Constitutions , the Lodge-Book , and the In st rument s of his Office, not all together, but one after another ; and after each of them, the Grand-Master or his Deputy , shall rehearse the short and pithy Charge that is suitable to the Thing presented. After this, the Members of this new Lodge , bowing all together to the Grand-Master , shall return his Wo r s h i p Thanks, and immediately do their Homage to their new Master , and signify their Promise of Subjection and Obedi- ence to him by the usual Congratulation . The Deputy and the Grand-Wardens , and any other Brethren present, that are not Members of this new Lodge, shall next congratulate the new Master ; and he shall re- turn his becoming Acknowledgements to the Grand-Master first, and to the rest in their Order. Then the Grand-Master desires the new Master to enter immediately upon the Exercise of his Office, in chusing his Wa r d e n s : And the new Master , calling forth two Fellow- Craft , presents them to the Grand-Master for his Approba- tion, and to the new Lodge for their Consent.

Upon which the new Master , presenting them with the In st rument s of their Office, shall in due Form, install them in their proper Places ; and the Brethren of that new Lodge shall signify their Obedience to the new Wa r d e n s by the usual Congratulation .

W H E R E A S by the Confusions occasioned in the Saxon, Danish, and Norman Wars, the Records of Masons have been much vitiated, the Free-Masons of Eng- land twice thought it necessary to correct their Constitu- tions , Charges , and Regulations ; first in the Reign of King Athelstan the Saxon, and long after in the Reign of King Edward IV. the Norman : and whereas the old Constitu- tions in England have been much interpolated, mangled, and miserably corrupted, not only with false Spelling, but even with many false Facts and gross Errors in History and Chronology, through Length of Time, and the Ignorance of Transcribers, in the dark illiterate Ages, before the Re- vival of Geometry and ancient Architecture, to the great Offence of all the learned and judicious Brethren, whereby also the Ignorant have been deceiv’d. And our late worthy Grand-Master, his Grace the Duke of MON TAGU, having order’d the Author to peruse, cor- rect, and digest into a new and better Method, the History, Charges, and Regulations of the ancient Fraternity ; He has accordingly examin’d several Copies from Italy and Scot- land, and sundry Parts of England, and from thence, (tho’ on many things erroneous) and from several other ancient Records of Masons, he has drawn forth the above-writ- ten new Constitutions , with the Charges and General Reg- ulations. And the Author having submitted the whole to the Perusal and Corrections of the late and present Dep- uty Grand-Masters, and of other learned Brethren ; and also of the Masters and Wardens of particular Lodges at their Quarterly Communication ; he did regularly deliver them to the late Grand-Master himself, the said DUK E of MON TAGU, for his Examination, Correction, and Appro- bation ; and his Grace, by the Advice of several Brethren, order’d the same to be handsomely printed for the use of the Lodges, tho’ they were not quite ready for the Press during his Mastership.

Our Father NOAH next appear’d A Mason too divinely taught ; And by divine Command uprear’d The ARK , that held a goodly Fraught: ’Twas built by true Geometry , A Piece of Architecture fine ; Helpt by his Sons, in number THREE , Concurring in the grand Design . IV. So from the gen’ral Deluge none Were sav’d, but Masons and their Wives ; And all Mankind from them alone Descending, Architecture thrives ; For they, when multiply’d amain, Fit to disperse and fill the Earth, In SHINAR ’s large & lovely Plain To MASONRY gave second Birth.

For most of Mankind were employ’d, To build the City and the To w ’ r ; The Gen’ral Lodge was overjoy’d, In such Effects of Masons Pow’r ; ’Till vain Ambition did provoke Their Maker to confound their Plot ; Yet tho’ with Tongues confus’d they spoke, The learned Art they ne’er forgot.

II. Nor JAPHET , and his gallant Breed, Did less in Masonry prevail ; Nor SHEM , and those that did succeed To promis’d Blessings by Entail ; For Father ABRAM brought from UR Geometry , the Science good ; Which he reveal’d, without demur, To all descending from his Blood.

W e sing of MASONS ancient Fame When fourscore Thousand Crafts- men stood, Under the MASTERS of great Name Three Thousand and six Hundred good, Employ’d by SOLOMON the Sire And Gen’ral MASTER-MASON too ; As HIRAM was in stately Tyre, Like Salem built by Masons true . II. The Royal Art was then divine, The Craftsmen counsell’d from above, The Te m p l e did all Works outshine, The wond’ring World did all approve, Ingenious Men, from every Place, Came to survey the glorious Pile ; And when return’d, began to trace, And imitate its lofty Style . III. At length the GRECIANS came to know Geometry , and learnt the Art, Which great PYTHAGORAS did show, And Glorious EUCLID did impart ; Th’ amazing ARCHIMEDES too, And many other Scholars good ; ’Till ancient ROMANS did review The Art , and Science understood. IV. But when proud ASIA they had quell’d, And GREECE and EGYPT overcome, In Architecture they excell’d, And brought the Learning all to ROME ; Where wise VITRUVIUS , Master prime Of Architects , the Art improv’d, In Great AUGUST US’ peaceful Time, When Arts and Artists were belov’d. V. They brought the Knowledge from the East ; And as they made the Nations yield, They spread it thro’ the North and We s t , And taught the World the Art to build, Witness their Citadels and To w ’ r s .

O H ! glorious Days for Masons wise, O’er all the Roman Empire when Their Fa m e , resounding to the Skies, Proclaim’d them good and useful Men; For many Ages thus employ’d, Until the Goths with warlike Rage, And brutal Ignorance, destroy’d The Toil of many a learned Age. II. But when the conqu’ring Goths were brought T’embrace the Christian Fa it h , they found The Folly that their Fathers wrought, In loss of Architecture sound. At length their Zeal for stately Fane s , And wealthy Grandeur, when at Peace, Made them exert their utmost Pains, Their Gothic Buildings to up-raise. III. Thus many a sumptuous lofty Pile Was rais’d in every Christian Land, Tho’ not conform to Roman Style, Yet which did Reverence command : The King and Craft agreeing still, In well form’d Lodges to supply The mournful Want of Roman Skill With their new sort of Masonry . IV. For many Ages this prevails, Their Work is Architecture deem’d ; In England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, The Craftsmen highly are esteem’d, By Kings , as Masters of the Lodge , By many a wealthy noble Peer, By Lord and Laird, by Priest and Judge, By all the People every where. V. So Masons ancient Records tell, King Athelstan , of Saxon Blood, Gave them a Charter free to dwell In Lofty Lodge , with Orders good, Drawn from old Writings by his Son, Prince Edwin , General Master bright, Who met at Yo r k the Brethren soon, And to that Lodge did all recite. VI.

II. King Charles the first, a Mason too, With several Peers and wealthy Men, Employ’d him & his Craftsmen true, ’Till wretched Civil Wars began. But after Peace and Crown restor’d, Tho’ London was in Ashes laid, By Masons Art and good Accord, A finer London rear’d its Head. III. King Charles the second raised then The finest Column upon Earth, Founded St. Paul’s , that stately Fane , And Royal Change, with Joy and Mirth: But afterwards the Lodges fail’d ; Till great Nassau the Tast reviv’d, Whose bright Example so prevail’d That ever since the Art has thriv’d. IV. Let other Nations boast at will, Great Britain now will yield to none, For true Geometry and Skill, In building Timber, Brick, and Stone; For Architecture of each sort, For curious Lodges , where we find The Noble and the Wise resort, And drink with Craftsmen true and kind.

To fill up this Page, it is thought not amiss to insert here a Paragraph from an old Record of Masons, viz. The Company of Masons, being otherwise termed Free Masons, of auncient Staunding and good Reckoning, by means of affable and kind Meetings diverse Tymes, and as a loving Brotherhood should use to doe, did frequent this mutual Assembly in the Tyme of King Henry V. the 12th Year of his most gracious Reign. And the said Record describing a Coat of Arms , much the same with That of the LON DON COMPANY of Free - men Masons, it is generally believ’d that the said Company is descended of the ancient Fraternity ; and that in former Times no Man was made Free of that Company until he was install’d in some Lodge of Free and Accepted Ma- sons , as a necessary Qualification. But that laudable Practice seems to have been long in Dissuetude. The Brethren in foreign Parts have also discover’d that several noble and ancient Societies and Orders of Men have derived their Charges and Regulations from the Free - Masons , (which are now the most an- cient Order upon Earth) and perhaps were originally all Members too of the said ancient and worshipful Fraternity . But this will more fully appear in due Time. I. H AIL Masonry ! thou Craft divine ! Glory of Earth, from Heav’n reveal’d; Which dost with Jewels precious shine, From all but Masons Eyes conceal’d.

PHILIP DUKE of WHARTON, Grand-Master . J. T. DESAGULIERS, Deputy Grand-Master . FINIS . [ 92 ] Editorial Note James A nderson (c.1679–1739) was born and edu- cated in Aberdeen, Scotland. He was ordained a minister in the Church of Scotland in 1707, and moved to London, where he ministered to the Glass House Street congregation until 1710, and to the Presbyterian church in Swallow Street until 1734, and at Lisle Street Chapel until his death. He is reported to have lost a large sum of money in the South Sea Company crash of 1720. Anderson was a Master of a Masonic lodge and a Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge. He was commissioned to write this history of the Free-Ma- sons by the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster in September of 1721, and it was published in 1723. A second edition, much expanded, appeared in 1738. The work was translated into many languages, including Dutch (1736), German (1741), and French (1745). His other published works include Royal Genealogies (1732), A Defence of Ma- sonry (1738?), News from Elysium (1739) , and A Genealogi- cal History of the House of Yvery (1742). His authorship of the present work is declared on page 80. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) came to Phila- delphia from Boston in 1723, and opened his own printing business in 1728, in partnership with Hugh Meredith, who left in 1730. He began to publish the Pennsylvania Gazette in October of 1729 and became the official printer for the colony of Pennsylvania in 1731. Franklin was admitted to the St. John’s Lodge of Free-Masons in January of 1731, be- came a junior grand warden of the lodge in June of 1732, and Grand Master of Masons of Pennsylvania in June of 1734."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"He advertised his edition of The Constitutions of the Free-Ma- sons as “just published” in the Pennsylvania Gazette for May 16, 1734 (at a price of 2 s .6 d., or bound at 4 s.). Fr a n k l in’s connections with Masonry were very important for his pro- fessional, intellectual, and political careers, and he main- tained them throughout his life, not only in America, but in England and France, as well. The edition of The Constitutions of the Free-Masons that Franklin produced in Philadelphia in 1734 is a fairly faith- ful reprinting of the London original of eleven years ear- lier. It omits only the musical scores for some of the songs, the engraved frontispiece and coat of arms of the Duke of Montagu, and the Hebrew type occurring in the note to page 15 in this edition. In general, it is not as ornate or as typographically complex as the London edition, although clearly the effort was made to produce an attractive and fully ornamented book. It consisted of 96 pages, with the last two blank, on imported Genoese paper, with the pages measuring 8 inches high by 5.7 inches wide. In August of 1734, Franklin sent 70 copies to the Masonic Lodge in Bos- ton and, at some point, another 25 copies to Charleston. Seventeen copies of the edition are known to survive. Fac- simile editions have appeared in New York in 1905 and in Washington, D.C., in 1924. (See C. William Miller, Benja- min Franklin’s Philadelphia Printing, 1728-1766: A Descrip- tive Bibliography , [Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1974], pp. 39-40.) One of the five songs (“A New Song,” page 91) in the book appeared in print for the first time in the 1734 edi- tion. It is not known if Franklin composed this song, but it is known that he composed another (“Fair Venus Calls”) around 1741 that continued to be sung at Masonic meetings into the nineteenth century. (See J. A. Leo Lemay, Benja- min Franklin: A Documentary History http://www.english. udel.edu/lemay/franklin/ , and Leonard W. Labaree, ed., The Papers of Benjamin Franklin , v. 1, pp. 373-76.) The text of this edition was transcribed from digi- tal page images of the 1734 edition accessed online in the Early American Imprints, Series I: Evans, 1639-1800, no. 3744, which is derived from microfilm of the copy held in the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, Cali- fornia. The London edition of 1723 is available online as digital page images—in the Eighteenth Century Collec- tions Online series—and it has been used for reference and comparison. The design and layout of this edition are based on the Philadelphia edition of 1734. The text typeface is IM Fell DW Pica, originally cut by Peter de Walpergen, and dig- itized and furnished by Igino Marini ( http://iginomarini. com/fell.html ). Larger type in the titles and text of the “Dedication” is IM Fell Double Pica, from the same source. Some accomodations have been made in the composition: in deference to modern readers, the long “s” and its ligatures have not been used, nor have the ligatures for “ª”, “¤ ”, “¥”, “{”, “¦”, “}”, and “¬”—in order to allow for eas- ier and more accurate searching and excerpting. Paragraph- long quotations have been rendered in the modern style, rather than beginning each line with quotation marks. One curious feature deserves special note: in the list of “Mas- ters and Wardens of Particular Lodges” in the “Approba- tion” section, the typesetter apparently ran out of brack- ets and used double-daggers to indicate the last ten pairs of Wardens; this feature is preserved in this edition. The or- naments reproduced in this electronic version are reproduc- tions or reconstructions of those found in the printed Phila- delphia edition. 94 95"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"This edition retains the spelling, capitalization, italics, and punctuation of the 1734 Philadelphia edition.

In all other cases, other than the correction of typographical errors, the Philadelphia edition has been followed.
