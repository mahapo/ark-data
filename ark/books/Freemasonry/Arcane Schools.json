[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"ARCANE SC HOO LS by John Yarker This book p rovides a background necessary to understand elements of the Golden Dawn and O.T.O. initiations, particularly in matters like the inclusion of the Samothraian deities in the form er and the details of the lower and middle degrees for the latter. The Western Occult Revival is documented in it's origins. Yarker's thesis is to demonstrate universal and indigenous initiation in symbol and legend throughout t he history and p laces of the world; and, by relating the meanings and p ractices of ancient and modern Masonry (through the 19th century), to disclose the universal content of the rites and mysteries. The author is more skeptical than most, and there is a distinct flavor of Frazier in the style of presentation. Many Christian traditions are presented in great detail and multiple e xample to be ignorant glosses of the ancient mysteries. Theories of lost continents are briefly propounded with open mind, some dated b y limits of scholarship of the period: e.g. Ya rker did not know that Polynesians traveled thousands of miles by ship, that mid oceanic s ea floors spread, etc. Theosophical legends are used with more restraint than was c omm on in the period. \"Aryan\" is used for an imaginary race, comm on in the per iod b ut not as later. \"Learned\" racist stereotypes of the period are perpetuated, but with considerable more restraint t han in other contemporaries. At t he time of writing, race and culture were muddled concepts. Since universal \"Masonry\" is the subject of this work, \"Aryan\" is better understood in most instances as \"possessed of the secrets of illumination\" or some such concept. There is occasional and excessive dependence on philology for evidence, also comm on in the period of authorship. In the last chapters of the book, Yarker defends v ariant Masonry on the grounds of the United Grand Lodge of England b eing ignorant of many traditions and indifferent to o lder charters. \"York\" masonry is upheld as being more traditional. The Arian and Cabiri c races taken for granted in this book are fictional, though based on far m ore limited actual ancient cultures. At the period in which this work was written, a racist theory of world civilization was c urrent. This theory culminated in anti - Semitism and u ltimate atrocity in the second quarter of the 20th century. Caution should b e e xercised b y the reader to distinguish the later excesses of Arianism from the altitude of Yarker's book. European scholars of the time were themselves a development of history , as such remain today. These racist theories of world history stem, in part, from the e arlier r eligious belief in the age of the world as roughly 5,000 years. For so short a span, a universal and simplistic v iew of history is a natural concept. With th e modern discovery of several millions of years for human tenure alone, a more diverse genesis of history is appropriate. For \"Arian\", take e mpire - building conquerors and invaders. For \"Cabiric\", take indigenous pagans or settled p eople of the soil. The latter is s ometimes associated with \"natural"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"religion\" by Yarker. The various theories and d ates must be further adjusted in light of modern archaeology and ethn ology. Scholars and students of European literature will find unusual value in the work. How else may we understand stray references like: \"We should look like the two sons of Aymon, who had lost their brother.\" -- from Chapter XX VIII of \"The Three Musketeers\" of Alexandre Dumas?

IN the following pages I have sought to satisfy a request, often made to me, to give a short but comprehensive view of the whole fabric of the Arcane mysteries, and affinity with the Masonic System; and I here take the opportunity of recording my protest against t he sceptical tendencies of the present generation of the Moderns who are Masons, and against the e fforts that are made, in season and out of season, to underrate the indubitable antiquity of the Masonic c eremonies. These e fforts, which tend to lower the prestige of our ancient Craft, are not altogether without good results, as they have led to a more careful examination of our Masonic legends and of ancient documents, and I have therefore added, to a general Hi story of the Arcane Schools, a view, sufficiently explicit, of the ancient rites of the Masons, leaving the intelligent Freemason of our day to trace the relative bearing of these. It is no compliment to the Masons who founded the Grand Lo dge of England in 1717 , and who, however ill i nform ed they may have been in London, yet, as is amply proved, accepted old customs of the Guilds with discrimination, to suppose that they unanimously undertook to impose upon the public, a system as ancient w hich they themselves were e ngaged in concocting. Nor is it any compliment to the intelligence of their imagined victims. Whether or not I succeed in convincing the candid reader of the great antiquity of the Institution must be left to time; those of my readers who are pledged to the views of these Moderns will no doubt adhere {v} through life to the ideas in which they have indoctrinated themselves, but enquiry is progressing and there is s till a very large substratum of the Craft whose belief is yet str ong in the good - faith of their predecessors, whether, in what was last century, term ed Ancients or Moderns, and it is to such that I more particularly address myself. The best reward for my labours would b e to find that the study of our Craft and analogou s s ocieties was making progress, and that others are supplying new facts from old b ooks, that may aid in bridging over any chasms that may be noticed in the following pages. My endeavour has been to print well authenticated matter only, in order that the inform ation supplied may be reliable. Every paragraph is a fact or deduction from facts, and however m uch condensed nothing of moment,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"known to the present time and having a bearing upon Freemasonry, has been omitted. The works of the learned Brother Geo rge Oli ver, D.D., lack critical cohesion, and have consequently fallen into undeserved neglect, but sufficient will be found in these pages to show that his theories are not devoid of method, and will admit of an authentic c onstruction being put upon those claims which he advances for the antiquity of the Masonic Institution. Those who o bstinately deny the e xistence of anything which is outside their own comprehension are fully as c redulous as those who accept everything without discrimination. There ar e certain intellects which lack intuition and the ability to take in and assimilate abstruse truths, just as much as there are people who are colour - blind, or deaf to the more delicate notes of music; this was well known to the ancient theologians and myst ics, and the reasons which they assigned for the mental incapacity will appear in the following pages. I cann ot allow the opportunity to pass, in closing my labours, without thanking my publisher for his invariable kindness, courtesy, and general care; and the reader is also much indebted to him for the compilation of the Index.

WEST DIDSBURY, MANC HESTER , \"17t h April, 1909 .\" {vii}  INTROD UCTION. THE object of the following chapters is to give a broad b ut condensed view of the various traces which are to be found amongst t he ancients, in their religion, in their Art, and in their buildings -- civil, sacred, and military -- of a speculative system, such as is now professed under the designation of Freemasonry. The work is necessarily a compilation of suitable inform ation gathered from books upon h istory, mystery, mysticism, a nd Freemasonry; but it embraces the most recent views upon these subjects which h ave been evolved b y a close critical examination, and generally accepted b y the learned. In the \"first and second chapters\" will be found the proofs of a system of most anc ient sacerdotal grades and mysteries which in the e arliest or proto - Aryan, civilisation added to their ceremonies those e mblems of geometry and art which have been transmitted b y Freemasonry. In the \"third and fourth chapters\" we see more clearly the a dvance which the Aryan civilisation introduced into the primitive association; the development of a caste organisation, and the reduction of the more ancient civilisation, by invasions, to a subject state, which in time created an independent system of Art - Mysteries, combined with n atural religion, or what we now term Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" In the \"fifth and sixth chapters\" we have attempted the e lucidation of the doctrine and symbolism of the Ancient Mysteries and their r elationship with the minor schools {x} of Philosophy which sprang from them, as for instance the Pythagorean and P latonic sc hools, proving that all these possessed much in comm on -- in doctrine, rites, and symbols, not only with each other but with Free Masonry of our own days, without the disting uishing features of the latter as an operative art; whilst, side by side, the Arcane schools of Philosophy passed onwards through the centuries of Christianity, in n umerous branches, with the old rites and symbols. In the \"seventh and eighth chapters\" we have, f or convenience, a recapitulation of proofs of the e xistence and transmission of Art Mysteries and symbols from the most ancient t imes to o ur own days, with details of the Constitutions of a Fraternity, speculative in its teaching and operative in its application, f or the conservation of Arts and Sciences in their tripartite application to houses, churches, and fortications, and which entering this country in British and Roman times from Egypt was modified b y Culdee monks and learned clerics, and s o continued as Folc - motes or Guilds in the time of the Anglo - Saxons. In the \"ninth and tenth chapters\" some space is devoted to an enquiry as to the origin of the Semitic legends of Free Masonry which entering this c ountry in Anglo - Norm an times, with an Eastern system of work, of marks, and symbols, were e ngrafted upon the older Constitutions; together with some account of the e soteric marks, emblems, and rites of the organised Building - brotherhood who erected our noble Gothic edices, and references are made to many of these e difices in illustration of Free Masonry. We see the e nd of the Gothic and revival of the Classic Arcanum. The remaining \"eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth chapters\" give a short account of the principal points in the history of M odern Freemasonry from 1717 to o ur own days; and which includes a chapter upon the design, origin and history of what has c ome to be term ed high - grade Free - masonry, {xi} and out of which sprung the distinction between Ancient and Modern Masonry, a dissensi on which continued until the union of these two sects of Masons in 1813 . Lastly in the \"Appendix\" we have added a full series of Constitutional Charges which continued in force from Saxon times until the year 1717 and even much later; these we have slig htly modernised for the e ase of the reader. {xi}  C O N T E N T S.  ------    Page.

CHAPTER I.  ARCHAIC LEGENDS IT may reasonably be supposed that the advancement of mankind which we term civilisation h ad made great progress in h ot climates before the Arts, science, and more e specially the mystery of building temples and houses of stone, brick, or wood was developed. Religious mysteries, the rudiments of science, and open and secret worship, if not inn ate, which we believe them to be, would arise, and as the e rection, first of temples, and then of hou ses, indicates a knowledge of geometry and constructive tools, it implies a more advanced culture. The tradition which h as reached us through the ages is that mankind contracted very slowly the protoplasm which form s our natural body, after which a vari ety of wants became apparent t hat were in earlier ages unfelt. Whether we accept or reject this v iew, we can realise that the united intellect of thousands of years has been unable to supply any better idea of the creation and p rogress of humanity upon ea rth than that handed d own to us from the ancient sages. As man \u0000 s material nature increased his s pirituality decreased, and as his intuition tended to become dorm ant means were sought which might restore his ancient status. The discipline necessary for th is purpose was"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"neither suitable nor agreeable to the majority, and this led to the e stablishment of secret or esoteric {1} schools for those who sought t he higher spiritual development. Of an unpretentious nature at first and p ossessing but moral trials o r proofs, these schools gradually assumed a magnificent exterior under State control, with even proofs dangerous to life, and were designated THE MYSTER IES. The natural wants had now come to be provided for; the Arts and Sciences were developed: Architect ure, Metallurgy, Sh ip - building, Astronomy, Agriculture, etc., were added to Theosophia, and religious ritual. This is the tradition of the Mysteries. There are certain ancient legends in regard to a lost or sunken continent and a deluge which, though n ot absolutely accepted as history, are too probable to be passed over in silence. It is admitted b y scientists that the surface of our earth is c ontinually wasting away, with the result that the bed of the ocean is being slowly raised, and the geographica l position of the land is c hanging: we see in one locality that the ocean is washing the land away, whilst in another the sea is receding. Equally g reat climatic c hanges are slowly developing; thus Greenland was at one time a torrid clime, which at a late r age, to be reckoned only by tens of thousands of years, was s ucceeded b y intense cold, and when our own island was depopulated b y a deluge of ice and frost. These changes are attendant upon what astronomers term the \"Precession of the Equinoxes\"; ther e is a gradual displacement of the poles of the e arth, occurring in cycles or periods of 25,000 years, and the last of which reached its extreme point about 12,500 years ago, when it is held that a great cataclysm occurred which changed the face of the e nt ire globe. It follows of necessity that men \u0000 s habits must change with climatic c hanges. The Hindu priests have a complicated series of cycles within cycles, which are not altogether imaginary but are grounded upon recondite astronomical calculations. Wh en we remember that there is a great central sun round which the e ntire galaxy of planets and suns revolve, we may draw the analogy that in imm ense cycles what we may term seasonal {2} changes or states are produced, even on these planets and suns, similar to those which occur on our earth.<< Vide \"Notes and Queries\" (S. C. and L. M. Gould, Manchester, N.H.), xi, p. 203 .>> There e xists in Thibet and India a \"Secret Doctrine\" which is of unquestioned antiquity, and of which analogical confirm ation may be found in the writings of the ancient Philosophers. This doctrine allows for the e xistence in extreme antiquity of a sunken continent in the Pacific ocean, of which the present islands are mountain tops, and in the Atlantic ocean of seven islands, the last of which sank b eneath the waters about the period which we have assigned for a great cataclysm, or 12,500 years ago. Behind this account, which in the East is c onsidered historical, lies the cyclical doctrine of a Day and Night of Brahm, or by whatever other word the impersonal D eity is designated. These cycles are the Outbreathing and Inbreathing of the Unknowable deity, or everliving Spirit and p rimal Matter; the gradual progress of all created matter is the divine Day which proceeds from the e theria l or cometary to the concrete by means of the Tatwas, which will correspond with the Genetic Days of Moses, and these again with the gestation of the ordinary foetus; in the divine Night everything again reverts to the etherial state, to be again followed, in imm ense cycles, by a reversed action. The mythological account of the Hindu Paradise places Mount Meru at the North - pole, or the imperishable land ; a circular island upon which is the \"City"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of the Gods,\" which is s upposed to be a perfect square gua rded b y a wall protected b y eight circular towers, and the holy mount, which is of conical shape, rises in the centre of the city<<\"Anacalypsis,\" i. p. 507 >>. Temples have been designed to represent t his legendary Meru, and it has also form ed the basic plan of cities, which we may mention later. It is also noteworthy that the Egyptian legend of the Mystery God, Osiris or Heseri, is applicable to 68 Degrees north latitude, or where the sun dies {3} for 40 d ays, and which was then a hot climate, according to the legends. We know that the Mamm oth existed there and fed on tropical herbage. The north they consider to have been torrid owing to the then n ebulous or cometary state of our globe, which h ad neither cooled d own n or hardened. Humanity, of a sort, existed in that land, but was moon - bred, etherial, globular, gigantic, sexless, generated as are atoms by self - multiplication. To these succeeded a second race, giants, of whom the later and more material were inspired b y the Solar gods, these were dual - s exed or herm aphrodite, as many form s of life yet are, and more compact than the first race. The Arabs and P ersians have legends of such a race, and represent that it was ruled b y 72 k ings of the name of Suleiman, of whom the three last reigned one thous and years each. It does not seem that these Suleimans, who are, par - excellence, the rulers of all Dji ns, Afreets, and other elemental spirits, bear any relationship to the Israelite King, that being a more modern application. We find the name as one of t he gods of the ancient Babylonians, and the late Doctor Kenealey, who as a Persian scholar translated the poems of Hafiz, asserts that the e arliest Aryan teachers were named Maha - Bodhs or Solymi, and that Suleiman was an ancient title of regal power, synon ymous with S ultan in Asia, Pharaoh in Egypt, Khan in Tartary, Tsar in Russia. There is also a Persian legend which alleges that in the mountains of Kaf, which can only be reached b y a magic ring (that of Suleiman), there is a gallery built by the giant Ar zeak where the statues of the ancient men are preserved who were ruled b y the Suleimans, or wise Kings of the East. Many an Eastern storyteller laments the departed glories of the throne of Suleiman, located near the present Aden in Arabia, which it has b een suggested may have been populated b y Kushites from the Hindu Kush. There is a very wonderful structure hewin out of solid rock on the confiness of Afghanistan and India called the Takht - i - Suleiman, or throne of Solomon, its ancient Aryan n ame {4} bein g Sh anker Acharya, fabled to have been erected b y supernatural means, and k nown to have been a great rendezvous for two thousand years of merchants \u0000 caravans. It is on the western side of the Suleiman Mountains. Leaving this s light digression we return to the Secret Doctrine, which goes on to relate that in course of time a third race of men were produced with bones and d ivided into sexes, and who are practically the first race of Adamic men, for the rib of Adam is a euphemism alluding to the division o f sex. These are said, after developing a monosyllabic language, now represented b y Chinese, to have spread over the long lost Pacific c ontinent; here they became great builders, developed the religious Mysteries, and spread from north to south, populatin g the Atlantic c ontinent, who are considered a fourth race, after the Pacific continent had d isappeared. Here was the home of the proto - Aryan race of a brown - white complexion. A colony of these settled in Egypt in remote ages, where they introduced the a stronomy and zodiac of Asura - Maya of Romakapura, and the pupil of Narida, of whose books the Indians c laim to have"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"some fragments. Another colony of educated p riests s ettled upon an island, where the desert of Gobi now exists, but then an inland lake, whi ch h eld in its bosom 12 smaller islands. These priests, or at least some of them, allied themselves with a red - yellow Mongoloid race possessing g reat intuitive powers, a race of which the Chinese are a branch, for it is c laimed that there were seven sub - r aces in each of the 3rd and 4 th races. The interm arriage of these two races, which we may compare with that of the sons of God with the daughters of men, gave rise to a fifth race of Aryans, who sent out civilising missions over the world, and it is ass erted that there are records which show that these priests travelled into Europe to superintend the erection of religious s tructures s uch as existed amongst t he British Druids, and it is not impossible, as the Eastern civilisation h ad a lengthy precedence over that of Europe. {5} When the island of Atlantis s ank a pass was reft which drained the Desert of Gobi, and caused the Aryans to take refuge in the mountains and high table - lands, and the change of climate may have sent out others to seek a warm er home; others being forced outwards by the increase in population, and thus compelled to colonise new regions. Thibet has preserved many details of the wars of this lost Atlantis, charging the cause of its destruction to the cultivation, by a portion of it s tribes of black magic, or the left - hand p ath. It may be mentioned that there yet remains between Cabul and Balkh, or the ancient Bactria, some five imm ense statues from 12O to 60 feet high, said to symbolise this doctrine of these successive races<<The Secret Doctrine, of H. P. Blavatsky.>>. It is c urious that on Easter Island there are some similar statues, ranging from 70 to 3 feet high, mentioned b y Cooke as equal to o ur best masonry, and of which investigation h as been made by the Smithsonian Instit ute, and which are said to have been wrought in lava with iron tools. The Egyptian priests had a chronology vastly in excess of the ordinary computation, and the accounts dovetail with what we have already related. Herodotus, who visited Egypt about 45 0 B.C., states that the following were careful records of time preserved b y the priests. Before any King, a dynasty of gods ruled in Egypt; the First of these were the 8 great gods, sometimes enumerated as 7; then followed the 12, who were produced from t he e ight, of which the Egyptian and Tyrian Heracles was one, and who ruled 17 ,000 years before the historian \u0000 s time; Horus, the son of Osiris, who the historian tells us is identical with Bacchus and his s on with the Grecian Apollo, ruled 15 ,000 years befo re his own visit. From the time of Menes, the first human king and founder of Memphis, the priests read over to him the names of 330 k ings, and also showed him the statues of 34I hierophants, which the historian estimates, at 3 to a century, as representi ng 11,340 years from the foundation of Memphis. Herodotus {6} w as prohibited from giving any esoteric inform ation, but we may point out that there is an affinity between the twelve zodiacal signs and the labours of the Grecian Heracles whom Herodotus c ons iders to be much more modern than the Heracles of Egypt and Tyre, and whose labours were applied to the Hercules of the Latins. The great gods may refer to the Cabiric culte, the lesser gods to the Aryan, but we shall see more of this as we proceed. The form er are represented b y the planets, and the latter by the zodiacal signs. The birth of the gods may indicate the introduction of their worship into a country or district, their m arriage the e ra when one worship was associated with another, whilst their death may be e xplained on the doctrine of an alleged"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"reincarnation. The Egyptians, Herodotus s ays, were the first who erected altars, shrines, and temples, and who engraved the figures of animals in stone; the first to divide the year into twelve months, and to give names to the 12 gods; the first t o defend the doctrine of the soul \u0000 s imm ortality; the first t o develop geometry. It is worthy of note that 3, 7, and 12 are prominently represented in Hebrew. There are 3 mother letters, 7 d ouble, and 12 sim ple characters, which actually bear a planetary and zodiacal signification. The Hebrew alphabet is but an adaptation from an older one, but the arrangement proves that the inventor was an Initiate of the Mysteries, of which this alphabet is the synthesis. It is asserted that in the most ancient times there were two secret zodiacal signs and ten that were known as also 10 simple characters. It is now impossible to fix with mathematical precision the dates of such zodiacs as exist. Of the Egyptian that at Dendara might refer to 13,000 B.C., but there is one at Esne which might refer to 15,000 B.C. Without doubt the ancient Hierophant who designed these figures embodied therein a secret doctrine, and it has been supposed that the system was intended to sym bolise the destinies of humanity for the 2,500 years which each sign represents, or for the period which the sun occupies in over - runn ing {7} a sign. The chronology here set forth is much in excess of that allowed b y the more e xtravagant archaeologists, b ut, in some confirm ation of it, Baron Bunsen admits traces of buried p ottery which may be 20,000 years old, estimated upon the deposit which the Nile leaves at each ann ual flow. The Aryan legend of the sunken Atlantis is s aid to have been recorded in Eg ypt. Plato indirectly inform s us in the \"Timaeus\" that when h is ancestor Solon visited Egypt t he priests of Neith at Sais inform ed him that many catastrophes had occurred to mankind in remote times, the most remarkable of which was one contained in the re cords of the temple. That some 9,000 years before this v isit, which took p lace about 600 B.C., a large continent and some adjacent islands had p erished in one night by earthquakes, and that from these islands was the way to the true continent; that the in habitants of this Atlantis were a race who recognised that great advantages s prang from a just and righteous c omm erce; that they had conquered and colonised Greece, and extended themselves on one side as far as Lybia, and on the other to Tyrrhenia. But a part of the island \u0000 s inh abitants had given themselves up to selfish aggrandizement, and had made war upon the well disposed p eople, and to subvert the good regulations which h ad b een established b y Poseidon and his son Atlas. Whereupon the incensed gods, in one night, sank the country of Atlantis beneath the waves of the ocean. It is further stated that the country had temples of black and white stones, decorated within and without with precious metals. The shrine of Poseidon and the palace of the King w as surrounded with three sheets of water, f orm ing three parallel concentric circles, and a temple e xisted roofed with gilded copper. Theopompus in h is \"Meropis\" attributes a similar account to the priests of Phrygia, and tells us that the island contained a fighting and a contemplative race; the form er knew how to make themselves invulnerable to iron, so that t hey could only be wounded b y stone or wood. Proclus quotes Marcellus on the subject. {8} Blavatsky says that they had a written character and used it with the tann ed skins of monstrous animals now extinct. Professor Bowdler Sh arpe thinks that allied form s of birds point t o a lost continent which stretched from South"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"America to Au stralia with an arm extending to Madagascar, and this would meet the a ccount of Plato. We have another account, similar in its essentials to that recorded. \"The Popul - Vul,\" or \"Book of the Azure Veil\" of the Mexicans, tells us that t hese Atlantians were a race that \" knew all things by intuition,\" and repeat t he charge of sorcery, or black magic, as the cause of the destruction of their country by the gods. This book allegorises and p ersonifies the forces of nature. The \"Troano MS.\" records the same matter with special mention of the geological changes which the catastro phe caused. Dr. le Plongeon translates a passage thu: -- \"In the year 6 Kan, on the 11th Muluc, in the month Zac, there occurred terrible e arthquakes which continued without interruption until the 13th Chuen.\" The MS. goes on to say that the land of Mu disapeared and that ten countries were scattered, and that t his occurred 8 ,060 years before the book was written. This writer advances s till more e xtraordinary matter confirm ative of the statements of the book. We find in the grave - mounds of a prehisto ric race<<See \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum,\" v, part II.>>, as well as in the architectural sculptures of the Mayaux, the cross in its v arious form s; the tau cross {T} of Egypt, on the breast of numerous s tatues throughout America, the e quilimbed cross {+}, an d the so - called Latin cross {symbol: a Latin cross}, a form equally found in Egypt in pre - Christian times. There is the winged - egg with a symbolic explanation same as was given to it in Egypt<<\"Sacred Mysteries of the Mayas and Quiches 11,500 Years Ago.\"> >. Brother George Oli ver, D.D., asserts that these races used a cube of pure crystal in their temples, and Dr. le Plongeon, who spent twelve years in overhauling the ruins of Yucatan, has found cubical dice upon which is engraved a human h and, as well as crystals of a globular form , arrows of jade, the {9} hardest of stones, etc. The hand, as a symbol, held an important place amongst these people, as it is found stamped on the inside of buildings as if it was done with the actual hand of the architect as a mark of approval, or as a modern Indian Rajah stamps his own h and on the standard given to o ne of his troops; the same custom appears in the Temples of India. Le Plongeon further found an altar which is a facsimile of one at Anger - thom in Cambogia, and he also claims that he has discovered the tomb, statue, and cremated b ody of Prince Cay Canchi, the High - priest; in the centre of his mausoleum was represented 12 serpent heads, and the statue which h e disinterred at Chichen Itza, the city of the Sages, po ssesses a carved apron on which is figured an open h uman h and. The number seven is an important factor in their secret symbolism. The Doctor, who found a difficulty in getting into print because the publishers s aw no money in the subject, claims that t he following account is sculptured upon the ruined temple of Uxmal, and confirm ed b y the \"Troano MS.\" as the veritable history of the country, but which h as become mythologised in the old world: the history of an Empire more ancient t han Atlantis, embracin g three continents peopled b y a red and b lack race, that is including North and South America a nd Atlantis; that t his empire was symbolised b y the trident, and the three - peaked crown of its kings, and alluded to in mythology as the kingdom of Poseidon, Kro nos, or Saturn. There was, says the author, a deified k ing named Can, whose totem or emblem was the serpent, and a rule of his kingdom, as in some Asiatic countries, was that the e ldest son should marry his youngest sister. This Can"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"had 3 sons and 2 d a ughters, thus making a famly of 7, each of whom r uled one of seven cities. Following the rule already mentioned, one of the brothers named Coh, chacmol or leopard, took to wife his s ister Moo, but their brother Aac, whose TOTEM was the turtle, out of love for his s ister slew her husband treacherously. According to {10} the custom of the country he is represented as offering her fruit, whilst she is s eated under a tree upon which is perched a macaw as the \"totem\" of Moo; the serpent, or her husband \u0000 s emble m, is twined in the branches of the tree, whilst a monkey stands by as if representing a councillor. The tree is the e mblem of the country, and the representation is in close conform ity with the legend of Genesis as to the temptation of Eve. Moo refuses to accept this s ymbol of the love of Aac, and he puts her to death, as well as her elder brother Cay Canchi, or Hunacay, the wise - fish, the high - priest. It is noteworthy that in the sculptured representations of this legend, or history, whichever it may be, the murderer Aac is represented as a Sun - worshipper, whilst Coh and his s ister Moo venerate the serpent. A curious analogy to this is to be found in Egypt, it is in a statue of Typhon or Set as described b y Plutarch. It is the representation of a hi ppopotamus, which corresponds to the turtle of Aac, and on the back of the animal is a hawk and a serpent in the act of f ighting. Le Plongeon again affords another correspondence with Egypt in the description of the 12 k ings descended from the 7 of the ra ce of Can, who ruled b efore the destruction of Atlantis; for we have here the 12 minor gods and the zodiac, and the 7 greater gods or planets. The account may be veritable history, as Le Plongeon maintains that it is, but it is possible that t he author m a y have mistaken for history a still older mythology carried from Atlantis to Pucatan. The temple of Chichen Itza is itself an interesting study. It is built on a ground p lan of three apartments which {Symbol on two lines of text: A Greek cross with a s hort horizontal bar at the top and b ottom of the vertical arm } make a triple cross. In one peculiarity it corresponds 1 with some ancient temples in Egypt and Cambodia where a keyed arch was then n ot known. It has a triangular arch constructed b y the ove rlapping of large stones, in which the three sons of Can are symbolised; by taking in the sides we have five to include the two sister; and adding the e nds we have seven or the whole family; numbers which are sacred b oth in Central America a nd in {11} the East. Over the door of the sanctuary is represented b oth the cross - bones and a skeleton holding up its two fleshless arm s in the form of two squares, a position which is s ometimes represented in Egypt as that in which the soul appears before Osiris. Here again it is s ingular that a corresponding doctrine is found in India as to the symbolism of the walls and floors of their temples. There are other temples in Yucatan which were intended for sun - worship, the ground p lan being three concentric c ircles, lik e the lakes we have mentioned as surrounding a palace in Atlantis But the most extraordinary part of the claims of Le Plongeon is that he has discovered the interpretation of the hieroglyphical inscriptions and finds that the character used, with the e x ception of a very few letters, is absolutely identical with the hieratic alphabet of Egypt, whilst the language which these characters bespeak is yet found in almost pristine purity in the dialect of Patan, a language which is perfectly constructed and str ikingly resembles the Coptic. As in Egypt and Chaldea the ground p lan of a temple was the oblong"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"square {symbol of a horizontal rectangle}, which was again the symbol both in Yucatan and Egypt of the letter M or \"Ma\", which implies the e arth, and the word Maya. In the names of the Greek alphabet Le Plongeon finds a poem, the Patan words of which gives the history of the great catastrophe. The Mayaux had their religious Mysteries which were governed b y 12 p riests, with initiations and carefully g uarded sacred rites, of which some account may be gathered in the writings of the Quiches, a neighbouring race at Xibalba: in passing through these initiations the Neophyte had to undergo most severe bodily trials, which Le Plongeon compares with certain descript ions in the Chaldean \"Book of Enoch\". It is not, however, shown that in these Mysteries Art symbolism exists s uch as we shall find in Thibet and China a nd in Freemasonry. We learn elsewhere from some researches made at the instance of the Smithsonian Ins titute that t hese, or similar Mysteries, {12} are yet preserved b y the Zuni people and consist of twelve orders of priests, into some degrees of which Mr. Frank H. Cushing has recently obtained admission after undergoing severe bodily trials. Historical a nd religious analogies with Yucatan are to be found amongst the Japanese who represent the first seven gods by the same symbols as the Mayas, and Brother George Oli ver sets forth that a Japanese candidate, in initiation into their Mysteries, represents the sun \u0000 s passage through the twelve Zodiacal signs. It is s ingular that t he Mayaux legends or Mythology should contain so much in comm on with Egypt, Asia, and India. Persia has the tradition of one brother slain by another. The Hindu \"Ramayana\" represents that the king of the monkey race, perhaps an inferior aboriginal tribe such as the Andamans, had two sons, Bali and Sougravia, each of whom desired the same wife, and Sougravia, by the aid of the divine Rama, treacherously slew his brother Bali. It is al leged, in confirm ation of Solon \u0000 s statement, that Atlantian emigrants s ettled in Egypt and Greece, that t hey equally settled in the Dekkan. Indeed, the \"Ramayana\" states that Maya, the magician and architect of the Davanas, took p ossession of South India and navigated the ocean from west to east and from the south to the north; the word Maya here meaning a dweller upon the sea. In the Atlantic Islands, or m ountain tops of Atlantis, there is a general belief that a system of secret Mysteries prevails, an d this s eems to have been established as a fact by several recent Masonic experiments.<<\"Canadian Craftsman\", xvii, No. 4; also A.Q.C.>> The natives of Virginia have a society of Initiates designated Huseanawer. The mother prepares a funeral pyre for her son of whom a simulated sacrice is to be made, as in the case of Isaac, and during the preparation she weeps him as dead. A tree is c ut down and a crown made from its boughs: the initiate is given a powerful narcotic by which h e is thrown into a state of somnambulism, and after a protracted retirement he {13} is looked upon by his tribe as a new man. Again, the negroes of Guinea have certain Mysteries c alled the Belly Paaro; the candidate is led into a wood where he is divested of all clothing and metals ; here he passes five years in absolute seclusion; after this he is initiated into the most secret doctrines of the sect.<<\"Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries\". Jno. Hogg, I875 , by Heckethorn.>> The object of their worship, as with the Maoris, is Rangi and Papa, or the heavenly Father and the e arthly Mother Even in the Pacific islands, or the mountain tops of a great sunken continent which h as been denominated Lemuria, there e xists a system of religious Mysteries. Heckethorn mentions that at T ahiti and scattered over Polynesia, is"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"a society called Areoiti, which h as s even degrees of initiation, which n one but the king may pass over all at once. One of their ceremonies is practised at the winter solstice, and it is a funereal ceremony resemblin g that in h onour of Osiris, Bacchus and Adonis. The meaning underlying this initiation is the generative powers of nature, and laymen h ave to undergo severe bodily trials.<<\"Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries\". Jno. Hogg, I875 , by Heckethorn.>> There are cave pictures in Au stralia of a race more ancient t han the Bosjesmen, one of these caves has a robed figure with a rainbow round the head which the Rev. J. Matthew considers to be identical with the chief god of Sumatra.<<\"Lucifer\", xiv, 1894 .> > There are many g eneral assertions that a system of signs identical with modern Freemasonry exists amongst the native Au stralians, and one such account appears in \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum.\"<<Vol. x. Bro. F. Jones.>> But the most precise account is a pap er in the \"New Zealand Craftsman\" of 8 Feb., 1898 , by Brother Henry Stowell, whose grandmother was a Maori. The paper deserves to be fully copied. \"The Maori in their traditions, \"Fangitawhiti\" (epic poems), and language show conclusively that ages ago there was at Hawaiki, a grand temple known as Wharekura, {14} at which temple meetings were regularly held and p resided over by Tohunga, or initiates of a very high order, and wherein was taught and practised a perfect system of principles in an esoteric form , with exhaustive and appropriate rituals, also symbols, signs, and p asswords, and that these were kept and p reserved on tables of stone, which latter were deposited in the temple. The ritual and symbols were e ntrusted b y the Ariki - Ranji ( divine and s upreme head) to the various officers in order to properly carry out t he ceremonials c onn ected with these meetings, whereat only those others who were e ntitled to be present had the happiness of listening to the recitals, and of observing the uses of the hi gher symbols. Regarded from a Maori point of view this Masonry is neither m ore nor less than the relation of \u0000 the main features of creation and the origin and history of the higher destiny of man, \u0000 which relation was accompanied with appropriate symbols. TANE was the G.A.O.T.U., he may or m ay not be identical with the Chaldean Oann es. The language in which this wisdom r eligion was embodied is extremely archaic, but thanks to my having been taught in my y outh by an aged Tohunga, and relative, some of the symbols and mysteries, I understand many of the allusions and am acquainted with various s igns. A knowledge of astronomy being absolutely essential to a proper r ealisation of the principles of the order, its Adepts -- Tohunga - Kokorangi -- constantly taugh t in observatories its elements and p henomena, to those who were accepted for qualification. \"Under the Maori system the two main Pillars, together with their Chapters, were represented b efore the dome of the sky. These were divine. A subordinate pill ar was \u0000 the Pillar of the Earth \u0000 ; at certain points the Nagana or centre was traced. These were two great circles which intersected and which had their corresponding circles. The square was taught upon four points of the visible universe. Moral teaching s were more or less {15}} associated with the Figure of the Ripeka cross, the type of good and evil, or enlightenment and ignorance by two o pposing lines. It appears that there is a universal tendency to restrict, thwart, or delimit its beneficial functio ns. Hence, \u0000 \"He waewae tapeka ta ta a ra Ripeka.\" \u0000 ( \u0000 A foot which diverges from the good or pure to the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"evil or impure path. \u0000 ) The figure of the triangle, Tantora, form ed the basis of, or for, the most elaborate calculations in conn ection with astronomy and geography. \"The term \u0000 Mason, \u0000\u0001\u0000 Masonry, \u0000\u0002\u0000 Masonic, \u0000 are used in the English sense and for convenience. Days and months were measured b y successive phases of the moon, while the year was marked b y the heliacal rising in June of the star Puanga, Rige l in Orion, due e ast, this being the star of the Maori new year, and the first sign of the Awahio - Rangi, or zodiac. \"I have no knowledge of the use of such a thing as the 24 inch gauge, but can vouch that calculations of length or distance were worked o ut with n ice exactitude. The signs in use varied from those of the Europeans. Still i n some important respects, so far as a mere M.M. is able to compare, there is astonishing agreement, and the agreement suggests \"a variation on the European scale,\" owin g to the incorporation or blending therein, of the term s of the Oath. The ordinance of the Tapu sanctity was its (Masonic) very essence: any infringement thereof, or neglect of its observance, by whomsoever, resulted in sure and speedy death, which was th e true penal sign, silent and awesome. Then again \u0000 Speculative Masonry \u0000 was not advanced or urged, and each one appears to have used his enlightenment for the purpose of furthering his knowledge along these ancient lines, which embraced the complete syste m, offering that fulness of happiness granted to mortals who were e nabled to penetrate the very depths of nature, and b y revelling in h er m ysteries attain the threshold of the divine.\" There are numerous other archaic legends which might have appeared i n this chapter but which it will be more {16} convenient to refer to hereafter by way of illustration. Those of Genesis, for instance, come within this c ategory. The Adamic legend of Genesis has the appearance of being the e soteric c aste mythology of a t ribe which settled in the Caucasian h ighlands, holding the Aryan doctrine of divine incarnations, to which they g ave the e xpression of a coming Messiah, or divine reincarnation, who was to redeem and rehabilitate their own fallen race alone, and we have se en that the serpent was equally an esoteric emblem in America. Analogous legends to those of Genesis appear also in Vedaic literature. A clergyman recently advanced in h is book entitled the \"Fall of Adam\" that it allegorised the intercourse of the higher spiritual or Adamic man with the lower and soulless race of pre - Adamites, and as we are not bound d own by the Rabinical chronology we may carry such a theory back to the \"Moon\" and \"Sun\" races of Thibet. In the American Can we may have a coincidence wi th the Tartar title of Khan, and p erhaps with the Biblical Cain. In the scriptural account it is Cain, the eldest son, who, like the Thibetians, offers a sacrifice of the fruits of the e arth, slays his younger brother Abel who o ffers a sacrifice of blood, and who leaves no progeny. The continuance of a spiritually minded line devolves upon the third son, or race of Seth. It is after the marriage of these sons of God with the daughters of men that we find the union of the worldly arts of the line of Cain with the more spiritual li ne of Seth. According to the Talmud Lamech marries the two daughters of Keenan, to whom it assigns the stone tablets of prophecy; the progeny of these marriages become men of renown -- Jabal, Jubal, Tubal Cainl, &c. In Egypt owi ng either to a racial inversion of the legend, which may have e ither been the production of some very old racial war, or later to mark their detestation of the Hyksos, or Sh epherd Kings, the priests made of the god"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Set, or Seth, a devil i dentical with Typh on who murdered his brother Osiris. There e xisted in Africa, contemporary with the beginn ing of {17} Christianity, a sect of Abelites, and it is not improbable that t he Syrian Baal, the Cretan Abelios, the Celtic Abellio, and the Greek Apollo, were modifi ed versions of the Hebrew Hebel or Abel. It is worth while to note that the Jewish Bible makes the line of Cain to be the first to build a city, which may mean a series of wooden h uts analogous to those which originated the trabeated, or beam style of s tone work, prevailing amongst the e arly Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans in their temples and coming down even to Christian times; found as well in the cave temples of India, which are richly and wonderfully carved to represent woodwork. After the flood it i s the descendants of Ham who become the great builders, and Japhet is to \"dwell in the Tents of Sh em,\" which tent is the prototype of the Pagodas of China, Persia, and Japan. As these legendary accounts of an art which spread from a sunken continent are scarcely more than prehistoric tradition, we need not follow the subject further in this c hapter; widely spread as these traditions are, they can scarcely be altogether baseless. Some confirm ation h as been found b y scientific s ea - soundings, and further c orroboration is afforded in the accepted fact that all the Pacific islanders are of the same race, and speak d ialects of the same language, and this at a distance from each other which is impassable to their small boats; all equally say that their forefath ers dwelt in a land over which the waves of the ocean n ow sweep. We are, f or these various reasons, justified in a belief in the veritable existence of such continents, and, by the same parity of reasoning, as we find sacred and secret mysteries existin g amongst them, in the Pacific, Atlantic, and in Au stralia, we are justified in supposing that these sacred schools are as old as the race that inh abited these continents. We see, however, that t hese mysteries have no architectural aims, and are a part of the conjecture with which we began this c hapter, as to the relative position of religion and art. If the reader places no {18} confidence in these traditions, until science has pronounced upon them, he can forget that he has read them, and p ass on to wha t is more generally accepted. In the following pages c loser proof will be found of the e xistence of a system resembling Free Masonry, and though we have not a minute book to prove that primeval man invented Free Masonry, under a more ancient name, and t hen established Lodges in Tartary, Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Italy, Britain, etc., yet the fact that similar societies existed in all these countries is indisputable, and there is no doubt that other and more important links will yet be brought to light by a diligent perusal of old classical authors, by someone who has the intuitive ability to understand the language of Mystery. {19}   CHAPTER II. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" PROTO - ARYAN C IVILISATION AND MYSTER IES. PHILOLOG ISTS seem to b e fast arriving at the view that when the whole e arth was of \"one language and of one speech\" it was a primitive monosyllabic or Turanian tongue. The word Turanian is most indefinite, for it is taken to include the small, dark, long - headed Dravidian race of India, which penetrated Britain before the Aryan Celt and of which the Basques of Spain are a survival; the long - headed white race of Scandinavian h unters; and the white, broad - headed Mongoloid, whom we chiefly term proto - Aryan, as an early branch of th e Aryan race; a race which in prehistoric times s pread from Lapland to Babylon, and from India to Egypt and Europe. The modern discoveries of archaeologists, in the countries occupied in remote times by this once powerful proto - Aryan race, have scarcely yet had time to filter down into the ordinary Masonic c hann els, but they must in course of time considerably modify the views of older writers upon our Masonic Mysteries. It would seem from what can be gathered that we owe advanced b uilding in stone and brick to this race, and the assimilation of their so - called Turanian speech is indicated b y this, that, Monsieur Lenorm ant traces the remotely conn ected Proto - Median and Akkadian of Babylon to the Ugro - Altaic family of languages, traces the Aryan to the sa me Finn ic race of the Ural mountains, and the anthropological evidence is as c onclusive as the language of the Ugro - Altaic origin of the Aryan race. It may have taken {20} tens of thousands of years for the development of the proto - Aryan into the Indo - Ira nian tongue, Zend, Sanscrit, Pushtu, Baluchea, as well as the Aryo - European languages, including Greek, Latin, Sclavonic, Lettic, and Teutonic. From it also sprang, at an earlier period, the Celtic of Europe, and from it, by a probable mixture with a blac k or Hamitic s peech, the Semitic tongues s poken in Assyria, Phoenicia, Arabia, and Palestine. Even with the comparatively slight knowledge which we possess of the ancient Turanian and p roto - Aryan speeches it may be taken for granted that a race which h a d founded a language which embraced certain roots equally found in Teutonic, Greek, Celtic, Semitic, and Sanscrit, and their cognate dialects, before separating into colonies, and which embraced term s in art, agriculture, jurisprudence, f amily life, religi on, etc., had even then made progress in geometry, in the building of temples and houses, and architecture generally. In this c hapter, however, we are dealing more particularly with an earlier phase of culture, but it is necessary to say some little of Ar yan advancement. A high state of civilisation was developed in the highlands of Europe and extended to o ther centres in Northern India which included Thibet. The Indian Vedas assign the centre of their culture to the Himalayan source of the Ganges, \"th e abode of the Gods.\" The Persian Avesta seems to point to the northern plateau of Pamir. We have no certain inform ation in regard to the departure of colonies from their parent home, but no doubt the causes were various. The continuous increase of popu lation would, of itself, make it a necessity. The Zend Avesta a ttributes their departure from their original home to climatic changes: Ahriman, the e vil spirit, who is mentioned b oth in the Avesta a nd the Vedas, introduced cold. The nomadic habits of the people as breeders of cattle led them into Europe. In the Himalayan centre or that of the Hindu, a war arose between those who had assumed d ivine powers in virtue {21} of their,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"orally acquired, knowledge of the sacred hymns, and the warrior or Maharajah class, who were subdued b y a divine being who incarnated as Rama, upon which the priests allowed favourable term s and p erm itted the warriors to receive a limited amount of sacred k nowledge, and to \"hear\" the Vedas, when collected in writing, read. A prev ious incarnation is alleged for the benefit of the \"monkey race,\" by which is perhaps meant some low - caste tribe, but that of Rama represents s ome prehistoric reform er of the Turanian culture, to whom a divine origin is assigned. At the period when the advance into India began, some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago, a race e xisted under the name of Tchandalas, probably partly Aryan, and partly Hamitic and other conquered Turanian races. These migrated to o ther parts, and some are believed to have originated the Semitic tribes. Such of the Tchandalas as remained were treated with the greatest barbarity by the Rishis or ancient Brahmin rulers, and were compelled to submit to a slavery which reads like that of the Hebrews in Egypt.<<\"Mackenzie \u0000 s Royal Masonic Cycl opaedia,\" also \"Blavatsky \u0000 s Secret Doctrine.\">> There were e x - Brahmins amongst them, and a caste system was established amongst the tribes which the Rishis did their best to suppress. It is not possible to give any reliable e stimate of the centuries th at elapsed before the reduction into writing of the ancient hymns, and the conversion of the rocks into temples of Cyclopian architecture. The late Baron Bunsen deemed that the date 4,000 B.C. might be a very suitable e ra for what we may term the \"manifes tation of light,\" or the beginn ing of recorded history, and the desire to transmit the same upon monuments, in Egypt in h ieroglyphics, in Chaldea upon slabs in the cunieform . The Iran and the Hindu had d eveloped the Avesta a nd the Vedas; the Babylonian an epic upon the journey of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac; the Egyptian the Book of the Dead, and the books of Herm es. But the nomadic Aryans of Europe had not made the same {22} progress, the Celt was the most advanced b ut used b ronze tools until about 2,000 B.C. Hence the Esoteric c laims deserve serious c onsideration. Their earliest buildings are subterranean caves wrought with infinite labour and p erseverance. We should have liked to enlarge upon these wonderful cave temples wrought in solid rock b ut space forbids. An interesting visit to some of these is recorded in the late H. P. Blavatsky \u0000 s book entitled \"The Caves and Jungles of Hindustan.\" That of Elephanta is a threefold construction, and it is alleged that all castes, and even kings w rought with the chisel i n its construction. Whilst the oldest cyclopean architecture is attributed in Europe to the Pelasgians, in India it is attributed to the Pandus who were a pre - Brahmin tribe, and Ferguson regards the analogy of this s tyle with that of the Incas of Peru as one of the most remarkable facts of history. It was in these prehistoric times that t he symbols of the two creative forces of nature developed, represented b y crux - ansata, lithoi, or lingam, and the vesica piscis, or yoni. They ar e e qually the signs of a dogma which lay at the root of all religions in regard to fire, not the fire burning upon the altar, but the fire which that symbolised and was term ed \"divine darkness,\" a spiritual or m agical fire, seen by g ifted seers, of which t he e arthly symbols are the pyramids, the obelisk, and the church spires.<<\"The Rosicrucians,\" Jenn ings.>> The oldest of the Turanian, or proto - Aryan, races had an organised priesthood of three grades, as in that of the Art school. It is true that we ca nn ot now give proof that such a system is as ancient as humanity, but we"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"may accept its extreme antiquity from the fact that in the most ancient historic times there was a widespread system of three degrees of Theosophy amongst people hopelessly separated. The Finlanders from the most ancient times to the present day have had a magical system of three grades which are term ed Tietajat (learned), Asaajat (intelligent), {23} and Laulajat (incantators). The Babylonian Chasdim were term ed Khartumim (conjuror s), Chakamim (physicians), and Asaphim (theosophists).<<\"Chaldean Magic,\" by Lenorm ant.>> There yet exists in India certain Kolarian and Dravidian tribes who possess a magical system similar to that of the Finn ic and Babylonian races, and they practise a system of secret initiation which they claim has descended to them from a time more ancient than the invasion of their plateau in central India by the Aryans, a conquest occurring thousands of years ago, but we purposely abstain from following European d ates as they are altogether unreliable. Their grades are Najo (witches and wizards), Deoni or Mati (wizards), and Bhagat (diviner). It is s aid that in the grade of Bhagat the Master priest goes through a part of the initiation alone with the aspirant, an d that t he ceremony is completed at night time with a corpse, near to some water. Amongst these tribes are the Gonds, sprung from Dravidians, who in early times reached a high degree of culture; in Chanda a re the ruins of a palace and town with a perfect network of underground p assages, which h ave never been explored b y Europeans, and which, tradition states, lead to a series of halls where secret conclaves were form erly held.<<\"The Kneph,\" v, p. 40 See also Mr. E. D. Ewen \u0000 s paper (who resided several year s amongst t hese people) in \"Five Years of Theosophy.\">> Mr. James Ferguson, F.R.S., in a lecture read b efore the Bengal Institute of this c ountry maintains that the original occupiers of India were a Turanian race of builders who were tree and serpent wor shippers, and that the Pelasgian inh abitants of Greece possessed the same features, in each case before the Aryan invasions and conquest of these countries. The full comprehension of this is the key to much that is puzzling in the transmission of Masonry and the Mysteries. There are important distinctions between the Hindus and these aboriginal hill - tribes; the latter have no caste divisions, they eat flesh food and offer live victims in sacrifice to their {24} gods; and are essentially either of a Mongol ian or Turanian type, like the Burm ese and Japanese. The Median Magi, or sacerdotal class of the proto - Medes were originally a so - called Turanian priesthood. But at some remote period there arose in the region n orth of Bactria a monotheistic reform er w hom his followers term ed Zaradust, the first of the name, and who is probably the same prophet whom the Hindus term Parusha - Rama, and it is this reform ed Median civilisation which constituted the religion of the most ancient Babylonians; and of the somewha t more modern Persians. It is c lear that the race worked metals and built in brick and stone from their earliest migrations. In the time of Cyrus I. these Magi consisted of three classes, thus named b y the learned Germ an scholar Heeren -- Harbed, or disc iple; Mobed, or m aster; Destur - Mobed, or complete Master. These constituted a sacerdotal College over which presided a Rab - Mag, or chief magian. The word Magi, or Mahaji i n S anscrit, means great or wise. Their distinguishing attributes were the Costi or girdle; the Havan, or sacred cup; and the Barsom, or bundle of twigs grasped in the hand; a symbol not properly understood b ut supposed to represent staves that were e mployed"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in divination, but it is much more probable that it was a symbol of that union w hich was to give strength to their order. The cubical dice were said to be used by them for divinatory purposes. Aristotle asserts that this Magian pontificate was more ancient than the foundation of Egypt; and P lato, who had an exalted opinion of the pu rity of its doctrines, confirm s this antiquity. Herm eppius s ays that the primitive Zoroaster was initiated b y one Azanaces 5,000 years before the Trojan war, or, as is s upposed, 8,168 years ago; Endoxes s ays that he lived 6,000 years before the death of Pl ato, or 8,237 years ago. In its proper place we will take the rites of the Aryan Mysteries of Mythras. Heckethorn asserts that the Indian Gymnosophists were the disciples of the e arly Magi, and that these Magi had {25} put forth 5,000 years before the Il iad was written the three grand poems of the Zend Avesta, the first ethical; the second military; and the third scientific. They taught t he duality of nature as exemplified in light and darkness, heat and cold, summ er and winter, good and evil, of which t wo principles, in the revolving cycles, the good would b ecome paramount. Ernest de Bunsen says that it is proved that the three grades of the Jewish Rabbinical school are an exact parallel of the three grades of the Magi; that it was a secret school of Scribes, its highest teaching embracing the doctrine of the indwelling Holy Spirit in man, and that Jesus was a Rabboni. The Babylonian Rabu corresponding with the Hebrew Rab, the Mobed with the Rabbi, and the Destur Mobed with the Rabban or Rabboni. The Persian Mazda is equally styled Ahmi yat Ahmi -- I am that I am.<<\"Miscell. N. & Q.\" (Gould, 1894 ), xii, p. 304 .>> The British or Celtic Druids were a priesthood that had features c omm on to the Eastern Magi, and were divided into three classes denomina ted Bards, Ovates, and Druids. Michaelet says that it is wonderful the analogy which the names of the gods of Ireland -- Axire, Axceavis, Coismaoil, Cabir, bear to the Cabiri.<<\"Freemasons \u0000 Mag.,\" 1860 , i, p. 166 .>> The e vidence of Strabo is to the same effect, as he says that the British Druids practise the same religious rites as existed at Samothrace. They cause their ancient progenitor to exclaim: \"I am a Druid, I am an architect, I am a prophet, I am a serpent.\" We shall see that the Cabiric Rites were the prerogative of priests and architects, embodying the drama of a murdered god. There can be small doubt that the Irish legend of Gobham - Saer, the son of Turibi of the Strand, who was murdered with h is 12 companions by 12 robbers, is a vulgarised e xoteric reference to the murdered Cabir and the 12 signs of the Zodiac. O \u0000 Brien says that he was a Guabhres or Cabiri, and that Saer has the signification of son of God. He advocates in h is {26} \"Round Towers\" the Phoenician origin of these buildings wit h their appropriation by later Christian Monks; often, as at Glendalough, seven small chapels, or altars, are attached. It is possible, as has been maintained, that north Europe was the centre whence the Orientals derived their legends, and that Chaldean, whence Culdeean, was as appropriate to the Druids as to the Babylonian, and that as the Essenians were Babylonians, the Culdees were Essenes, as held b y the venerable Bede, and thus the Essenes, or Assidiana, were Culdees. The chief British gods were H u and Ceridwen, or the Ouranos and Ghe of the Cabiri; and it is worthy of mention that there are Druidical unh ewn stones and temples in cruciform , the one in the island of Lewes c onsists of 12 stones each limb having three, and the subterranean of New Gran ge in Ireland is also"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"cruciform . Higgins in h is \"Celtic Druids,\" mentions in S cotland as prechristian, a crucifix o n one side of which is a lamb, and on the other an elephant. There is nothing very remarkable in the prechristian existence of such cruci form structures, in Italy it predates architecture, and the Rev. Baring Gould p oints out that there are in S outh Italy lake - dwellings of an imm ense antiquity where the cross - form is of greater antiquity than the bronze age. The cyclopean temple at Gazzo i s built on the basis of a Latin cross, and hence it was a religious emblem of the Cabiri. It is found in India in the most ancient cave of Elephanta, and is equally an emblem in central America. There are also two prechristian caves in Ireland of this fo rm .<<See \"Freemasons \u0000 Magazine,\" 1857 . p. 276 .>> We mentioned its use by the Maori race. Toland p oints out that the three divisions of the Druidical system which we have mentioned must not be taken as progressional degrees. They were three classes c or responding to Soothsayers, Physicians, and P rophets. The last, or the Druid class, had four degrees c onferred at intervals of 3, 6, and 9 years. The Bards and Ovates {27} w ere e ach divided into three classes with special functions.<<\"Toland,\" quoting Jon es.>> Taliesin as an initiate e xclaims -- \"Thrice was I born, now I know how to acquire all knowledge by meditation.\" The e mblem of the Druid was a vitrified egg, chased in gold, and hung from the neck, and which h eld up to the light shewed a sacred toke n; the \"Serpents,\" or Druids, prepared it. It is generally accepted that the theology of these sacred Colleges, even in the most ancient times, taught the e xistence of one sole power or creator of the visible universe, though triplicated in His manifest ations, and that from Him proceeded the minor gods, angels, and d emi - gods. He, the one, was Dyaus in Sanscrit, Zeus in Greek, Tiu in Teutonic, the ancient inscriptions and b ooks of the Egyptians place it beyond d oubt; the Chinese, the Magi, Hindus, Hebrew s, etc., all add confirm ation, and various other proofs are adduced in the work entitled \"Natural and Revealed Religion\" of our brother the Chevalier Ramsay. It is imm aterial by what name the prophet, or outteller, who revealed this doctrine whether Taut, Fohi; Zaradust, Rama; Enoch or Edris whose pupil Abram, or great - father, was; the doctrine of one God, uncreated, incorporeal, all - seeing, all - powerful, everywhere present, and d welling incomprehensibly in his own unity, gleams out through the darkness of the ages. And though the doctrine admits of minor deities as agents of the Supreme the dogma of unity form ed the background of all the ancient religious Mysteries, coupled with that of divine incarnations, and that indwelling holy spirit in men, which ma kes him equal with the minor gods. The e xamples which we have given of an arcane society divided into degrees, so widely separated b y locality, by language, and b y mann ers, f rom data existing some thousands of years ago, unmistakably point t o a much mor e ancient derivation from a comm on centre, unless we admit an intuitive need for some such system. We {28} find equally the same widespread d istribution of geometrical symbols intended to typify Theosophical truths, and embracing cosmogony and creation. It is held that each symbol represented a letter, a colour, a number and a sound, thus c onstituting an esoteric hieroglyphic understood b y the Initiates of every country. As an example we might easily arrange a set of very ancient symbols form ing little u nderstood Masonic emblems, and equally carved b y operative masons on the ancient ruins of Asia, India, and Egypt, and these might again be applied on the plan of the old"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Philosophers to the recondite mysteries of nature.

We have already made slight allusion to the Cabiri, and all authorities are agreed that t he Mysteries practi sed under this name were allied with the Cyclopean Masonry and its builders, and that those Rites and Buildings, in all countries, were the religion and architecture of a primitive race which preceded the Aryan invasions of Media, Babylon, India, Greece, a nd Egypt. The primitive inh abitants of Babylon, whom it has been agreed to term Akkadian, were more nearly allied in blood, language, and religion, with the Finlanders, Mongolians, early Egyptians, proto - Medes, Pelasgi, Etruscans, perhaps also American In dians, all so - called Turanian, than they were with the Elamites, Ethiopians, Arabians, and other Semites, or with the Hindu, Persian, and other Aryan races, that appear later on in the pages of resuscitated history. Yet there are actual traces of speculat ive Freemasonry, intimately allied with the religious Mysteries, amongst these primitive proto - Aryans. A clear explanation of these particulars does not admit of being printed, but every intelligent Free - Mason will be able to read, {29} w hat we may write, between the lines, and thus s upply for himself what we may leave unexplained. Recent discoveries go to prove that Palestine had its Cabiric or Magian Rites, and that long before the invasion of the \"brigand Joshua,\" the son of Nun, as an old inscriptio n is s aid to term that scriptural warrior, Akkadian civilisation existed in S yria, and the legendary Cain, Abel, and Seth of Genesis, and their progeny, find their analogies in other of the religious Mysteries. But t he Talmud or Mishn a, which is a very an cient explanation of the Law, differs materially from \"Genesis;\" thus it is s aid that in the days of Cain \u0000 s s on Enoch, and in the days of Seth \u0000 s s on Enosh, the people made images of copper and wood to worship, and it is to Keenan the son of Enosh that t he Talmud attributes the prophecies of the destruction of the world, which h e wrote upon tablets of stone. Enoch is represented as a Herm it, and the word implies Initiation. Lamech when blind b y age is s aid to shoot his progenitor Cain by the accident of an arrow, and further, in h is grief, kills by accident his own son. Hence the traditional Lament of Lamech in Genesis which h as been supposed to be a veiled confession of Initiation. The scriptural Tubal - Cain who was s on of Lamech by the daughter of the Se thite Keenan seems to be e qually a Cabiric legend in the Crysor of Sanconiathon the Phoenician h istorian, who is supposed to have lived as a contemporary of King Solomon. Equally Tubal - Cain, and Crysor, is the Vulcan of Greek mythology. Sanconiathon says of this Crysor: -- \"Men worshipped him as a god after his death and they called him Diamachius, or the great inventor, and some say his brother invented the making of walls and b ricks. After these things, of his race were born two young men, one of whom was c alled Techn ites or the artist, the other Geinos Au tochthon or earth born, or generated from the e arth itself. These men found out to mix stubble with the brick earth, and to dry the bricks s o made in the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"sun.\"<<Cory \u0000 s \"Ancient Fragments,\" 1876 , p. 8. >> {30} Sanconiathon further states that Upsistos was deified after he had b een torn in pieces by wild - beasts, and that he was the father of Ouranos who invented sculpture, and of Tautus who invented hieroglyphics, and represented the constellations by pi ctures; he says also that in the third generation two Pillars were e rected which were dedicated to \"Fire\" and \"Wind.\" According to F. von S chlegel there e xists a tribe in Eastern Asia, in the mountains, that possesses an inverted history resembling the Cain and Abel legend, but with these people it is the youngest brother who o ut of envy at the success of his elder brother, in mining for gold and silver, drives him out of the fatherland into the East. This writer, in h is \"Philosophy of History\" thinks t hat the wars of races, the giants and the Titans, may be traced in the Biblical legends, and he is inclined to identify the holy Sethite race with the seven h oly Rishis of Brahminical tradition. He also supposes that t he confession of Lamech may hint at t he beginn ing of human sacrifice. As Cain \u0000 s offering was the fruits of the e arth, animal life ought to have been as s acred to him as to the Budists. As Cain was the e ldest son S chlegel \u0000 s v iew w ould make him the prototype of the Turanians, whilst Seth woul d represent the prehistoric Aryan; and these races the Talmud would again reunite in the posterity of Lamech, which does actually point to the union of religion and art. As a matter of fact the Babylonian, Phoenician, and Jewish legends of the invention of the arts c an only be looked upon as an attempt to explain the remote origin of these, something invented to please the curious, and to point out t he e arly period at which these were supposed to have successively originated; the Persians have similar le gends applied to their own people. But we are not without some proof to shew that an esoteric Masonic s ystem was known to these e arly races, from which proceeded the \"hundred families\" that founded the Chinese culture. Owing to the researches of Professo rs de Lacomperie, {31} Douglas, and Ball, it has been established that the Bak tribes, which entered China a bout 4,000 years ago, had the archaic c uneiform character, and the customs of the tribes of Elam and Chaldea, which alone is sufficient to establish a comm unity of race. The Yh - King, or Book of Changes, in its original form was about a sixth of its present extent and term ed the Ku - wen, and is a vocabulary of the primitive cuneiform thus uniting with the other countries which used it. There can be no doubt that the primitive Mysteries were held in Groves, and that t he Initiates, as in the Druidical Rites, were received \"in the e ye of day,\" the trials being rather m oral than physical, the latter being a later stage, when the schools had somewhat degene rated, and temples s pecially adapted for the physical proofs began to be built. Before we e nter upon the nature of the CABIRIC MYSTER IES, and the Architecture term ed CYCLOPEAN, we will endeavour to prove that in the most ancient times there was in exist ence an actual Society such as we now term Freemasonry. We will take first the Chinese, who are the most primitive of civilised races, and still retain their m onosyllabic language, represented b y hieroglyphics of which each is the picture of a root - word, of such value that the characteristic meaning is understood throughout the Empire, even where the spoken language is mutually unintelligible. It is a culture concreted thousands of years ago amongst a race closely allied in language, religion, mythology, and astronomy with Akkadian Babylon. Moreover the archaic tablets of Thibet have"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"mystical allusions in consonance with the Mysteries, but we will allude to these in a later chapter. There occurred in the year 1879 in the District Grand Lodge of China a discussion upon the subject we have mentioned above, from which we learn that about 4,000 years ago this people had a symbolism identical with the Masonic Craft. An altar in form of a perfect cube was used to typify the e arth, and this may be read in con junction with what we wrote in our last chapter on the Maori {32} rites, the circle being an emblem of heaven, and \"earth\" and \"heaven\" in union were Cabiric deities. The N.E. and S.E. are relatively used to imply the beginn ing and conclusion of an object in view. One of the oldest words in the language is literally \"square and compasses\" and signifies right conduct. The skirret as an h ieroglyphic s ignifies the origin of things. When the Emperor of a new dynasty succeeded he began the e rection of a new temple under the oversight of a Grand Architect. Aprons were used which bore emblems denoting religious office -- there is a plant, an axe, and another not clear. The Sh u - King, which is one of the oldest books in the language, gives the representation of two jewels in jadestone, which is one of the hardest and most valuable of all stones and the most difficult to work; these two are the square and the plumb - rule. The same book speaks of Chien jen, magistrates, which is literally \"level men,\" implying wha t is expected of them; and the three chief officers of State are called the San chai, the three houses or builders; and one of the most ancient names of deity is the \"First Builder.\" The Emperor Sh un, about 3,000 years ago, had amongst his attributes the circle and rule; and the hamm er in the hands of their kings was an emblem of authority. When a monarch died the e mblems of authority were returned for the purpose of reinvestiture.<<The \"Masonic Magazine\" (Kenn ing).>> In Masonry this is done on election of a new Master. We learn from the \"Book of Odes\" t hat when an Emperor sacrificed he divested himself of his Imperial robes, was barefooted and b areheaded and girt with a lambskin. At the spring festival, which h as much in comm on with the rites of the Grecian Ceres, we see following the procession a boy with one foot bare and the other shod, but which they apply to the \"yang\" and \"yin,\" or the positive and negative principles of nature. Brother Chaloner Alabaster, from whom we copy some of these illust rations, says that this building symbolism was c ontinued b y the Chinese philosophers of the 5th century B.C. Thus we {33} read in the \"Great Learning\" that \"a man should abstain from doing unto others what he would not they should d o unto him\"; and the wr iter adds, \"this is c alled the principle of acting on the square.\" Other similar expressions are used b y Confucius 481 B.C.; and his later follower Mencius s ays, \"that a Master Mason, in teaching his apprentices, makes use of the compasses and square; ye who are e ngaged in the pursuit of wisdom m ust also make use of the compasses and square.\"<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\", ii, p. 12O, and iii, p. 14.>> Every trade in Japan h as a Guild, and they are said to have been derived from China, by way of Korea, 3,000 years ag o. At t he present t ime we are not t horoughly inform ed whether a system identical in all respects with that of China existed in Babylon, but there are indications that such was the case, as well as in Egypt, and we have already pointed out t hat Yh - King i s an Akkadian vocabulary of root - words. Mr. St. Chad Boscawen h as afforded us a note, where he treats of the ancient Calneh, about 3,800 B.C.<<\"Modern Thought,\" 1883 .>>; in this article he represents"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the Viceroy Gudea a s Patesi, or sceptre - bearer, subserv ient t o the King of Erech, and term s him the chief priest and architect as well, his palace indicating the art influence of Egypt. His s tatue represents him as s eated and having the right arm and shoulder bare; on h is knees is a tablet containing a plan, or what Modern Masons term a Tracing - board, of his palace or temple; the e dge of this tablet is divided into a scale of 20 3 /10 inches to the cubit, a measure corresponding with that used in Egypt. Brother W. H. Rylands deems that this c ubit may have divi ded the plan into chequered squares though n ot shewn thereon. Pure copper images of the Cabiri have been disinterred at Calneh. Very strong philological grounds have been shewn by Dr. Miller in h is \"Har - moad\" for identifying the Chinese Masonic s ystem with Babylon, and this must be read in the light of the remarks we have made thereon. {34} One of the e arliest Akkadian Kings named Lik - baga was a pyramid b uilder and, like Melchisedek, a king and p riest of the Most High; he uses as a title the term Pa - teshi, which is thus literally translated \"Pa\" -- anoint, \"te\" -- corner stone, \"shi\" -- to strike; and the same term is used b y his s uccessors. Patasso is a hamm er, and the term Patoeci was the habitual designation of the images of the gods of the Cabir ic Mysteries. Lik - baga seems to have modified Akkadian theology and was the crowned architect and apostle of Sin (moon), Samas (sun), Bel, and Anu. Another term used b y these kings, and applied b y Nebuchadnezzar to the most ancient kings, is Pa - teshi tsi - ri, which is translated Sublime Master by Dr. Schrader; it is c onn ected with the Hebrew Pat - tish, a hamm er, or the Cabiric hamm er in the hand of Tubal - Cain or the Greek Vulcan. With the Akkadians the god of copper - smiths had the same name as the god of i ronworkers amongst the Laplanders, and the words for iron and copper are the same respectively.<<\"Chaldean Magic\" -- Lenorm ant.>> It is, however, through the Aryan S anskrit that we can more particularly trace the assimilation of Akkad to a building frater nity, for the word Ak means to pierce, Akra is a sharp p oint, Akri is c orner, Akana is a stone, Aktan is the number eight or the angles which are in a cube. Akman in S anscrit is a stone and in Persian h eaven, and as a cube symbolises the e ight cosmogonica l powers, the word comes to imply the whole heavens. In Greek, which is an Aryan tongue, the name of the father of Ouranos is Akmon, and Diodorus makes Ur, or Ouranos and Ops c hildren of Akmon and p arents of the Titans, who are again the Cabiri. Akmon is also an anvil, which means a meteorolite, from which iron was first made, for in Greek Sideros is iron and related to the Latin S idus, a star. The word Ak in the Akkadian signifies to build or to make, hence we have ta - ak, tak, tag, a stone or m ountain, and akka, a building temple or sanctuary; these significations further conn ect Akkad, or proto - Aryan, with the Hindus and their architecture. {35} Ak is also the monogram of Nabu who is Mercury, Marduk, whence Nimr od; Nabu is therefore Mercury, and the He rm es of Egypt, the revealing God. In S emitic Assyrian abn is s tone, abni stones, banah (Heb. benah) is to build. The learned Alexander Wilder<<Gould \u0000 s \"N. & Q.\", xiii, p. 296 .>> expresses an opinion that Nimr od, founder of Babylon, was of Tartar descent, in which language the word means \"spotted,\" and may point to the leopard skin in which the Assyrian priests of Dionn isi were clothed. If Nimr od p ersonates Kronos, as s ome hold, he was in that case a Cabiri or king of the race of Cyclopean builders."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" Fr om all this it is argued, with much soundness, that the first kings were both priests and architects, or the Grand Masters of these, and of the class of Cabiri who were first workers in stone and b rick, and afterwards in metals, and that t hey transmitted a traditional doctrine of the temple, based upon cosmogony and the creation of the world.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" v, pt. 2.>> It explains why Genesis assimilates the worldly arts with religion, and shews the high respect the Hebrew priests had for art, though d eficient in practice. The Babylonians must have afforded inform ation to Ezra who revised the Jewish Bible, and it may be pointed out that these people were builders in brick rather than stone, and hence that the practice of art would vary in a country wit h that in which stone was used.  CABIRIC MYSTER IES AND CYCLOPEAN WORK . When we approach h istoric times we find that the actual Cabiric Mysteries were of Grecian continuation and p erpetuated at Samothrace where they had been in existence, from a remote e ra, far into Christian times, and where they were held in great veneration, not only for their antiquity but for the purity of their doctrine. They are said to have retained much of their techn ique in the Chaldean language, and to have pre served much of the Masonic s ymbolism which we have seen in Chinese practise, {36} for the aboriginal inh abitants of Greece, Pelasgians, were an allied race, and Dr. Petrie asserts that pre - Hellenic, or proto - Aryan Greeks, were in Egypt, either as friends o r captives, 2,500 B.C., with a civilisation all their own. Barbarous wars arose, the Aryan Hellenes devastated the country, and d uring an era of oppression reduced the old inh abitants to subjection; we find them denominated P elasgi with a succession of 26 kings followed b y 7 p riests. Egypt eventually sent them r ulers who restored their country to prosperity, founded cities and gave them laws. Upon this we learn that the Cabiric Mysteries were in practice at Samothrace, and that they were, or had b een, a fraternity which combined art with religion. Herodotus s ays that Samothrace had these Mysteries from the Pelasgi, and that they taught the initiated b y a sacred tradition, why the figure of Herm es, Mercury, or Casmillus was c onstructed in a peculiar m ann e r, from which we gather that they used P hallic s ymbols as emblems of the generative powers of nature; and this historian, who wrote 450 B.C., tells us that the names of their gods were derived from Egypt, as anciently they used the general term \"Disposers. \" The views of all authorities are in unison with those of Frederick von Schlegel, who says that t his primitive people were the constructors of the Cyclopean buildings of Greece and Italy, being the original inh abitants who were conquered and overrun by the Aryan imm igration of Deucalion, that they were a people who had the traits in comm on with those of many other countries, at a remote period.<<\"Philosophy of History,\" p. 234 .>> Before we consider their Mysteries we will say something of their arch itecture; a style which is of prehistoric antiquity. It was v ery massive, and built of irregular and well - bound b locks of imm ense size, so well knit t hat though without cement a knife blade would not enter the joints, and so placed that a large block migh t be withdrawn without endangering the structure. The French {37} Institute, in 1804 , traced about 150 towns which were in part, at least, Cyclopean, and 127 of these were in Europe. Strabo says that t he"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"builders were from Syria in Asia Minor, by which h e means Assyria; the same writer m entions v ast caverns in Argos which h ad b een converted into a Labyrinth by the Cyclops; and here was a statue of the father of the gods, which h ad a third eye in the middle of the forehead, and which was s aid to have been brought from the palace of Priam at Troy, an Asiatic c ity intimately conn ected with Assyria. Pliny states that in the island of Lemnos, the home of the Cabiric Mysteries, there was a Labyrinth of 150 columns, each stone of which might be moved b y a chil d; hence we learn that they resembled the rocking stones of the Druids; and Dr. Daniel Clarke found a stone circle at the top of Mount Gargarus, where the gods, according to Homer, assembled at t he siege of Troy.<<\"Anacalypsis.\">> Pliny attributes the wor king of iron to their invention, and the first inh abitants of Sicily are said to be of this race. Achilles Statius, bishop of Alexandria, mentions a statue in a temple on Mount Cassius, between S yria a nd Egypt, which h eld a pomegranate in the hand; it is a temple which S anconiathon deems to have been built by the descendants of the Cabiri.<<Mackey \u0000 s \"Cyclo. Art. Pomegranate.\">> This peculiar Masonry is found upon the summ its of mountains, a position in which Homer places the Cyclops and the Lastragons, and Theocritus the establishments of the old P elasgi. As it demanded a large e xertion of physical strength the later, but still ancient, Greeks attributed the work to giants who had an eye in the middle of the forehead as had P riam \u0000 s s tatue of their deity . Mythology makes them sons of Neptune and Amphitrite, whom Jupiter overthrew and cast into Tartarus where they become the assistants of Vulcan; thus assigning a sea - pedigree to these workers in iron and stone, and typifying an enforced slavery by their { 38} Aryan conquerors. They are fabled to have made the sickle of the Greek Kronos or Saturn, whom the Latins made the god of agriculture, in whose reign a ship grounded at Samothrace, where the passengers s ettled and erected a temple for their Mysteries. It is further pretended that these Cyclops c onstructed for Jupiter a cubical altar of brass upon which the father of gods took his oath before attacking the Titans, and upon this altar was engraved the name of Deity. Three principal Cyclops are mentioned -- Brontes, Steropes, and P aracmai. We see that like Hiram, who has c redit for building the temple of Solomon, the Cyclopean Cabiri were not only skilled b uilders in stone but workers in brass and iron, a race subject to Vulcan, and that all this long pr eceded the introduction into Greece of a Masonry of flat and squared stones, which came into use about the time of the Egyptian colonisation, after the ages of barbarism occasioned b y the Aryan wars. Besides India, which we have mentioned in its c ave te mples, and Greece, other nations have this ancient style of Masonry, and Syria, under Babylonian influence, has many traces of it, older than the invasion of Joshua a nd the Abri, and it is quite possible that t he Hebrew invaders had much of their special b ias from the school of Melchisedek, King of Salem. It has been shewn by Monsieur Perotti that some of the most ancient ruins in Palestine are Cyclopean, or as he term s them Pelasgian, and he instances s ome at Ephrata or Zelzah, in other places are later ruins of a mixed style, built compositely of polygonal and squared b locks; at Rama is a doorway resembling, on a small scale that of Atreus at Mycenae;<<\"Freemasons \u0000 Mag.,\" 1862 , viii, p. 384 .>> Cyclopean ruins exist also at Bashan and Baalbec. The Rev.

They are supposed to be {39} derived from the worship of Mythras, the lion being his s ymbol. The triangular form of the stone had a special signification. The Cyclops were worshippers of fire, Vulcan, and the sun.\" Older and still more important than Mycenae is the recent discovery in Crete of the palac e of Minos at Knossos, with its works of art, and its Dedalian labyrinth of passages and rooms, but more remarkable still tablets and records partly in h ieroglyphics, and p artly in alphabet. In an article in the \"Builder\" in 1865 , Monsieur Renan states that this s tyle is the most ancient in the world, except it be the Pyramids, and he points out that Homer m entions the great strength of the walls of Tiryns and Mycenae in Argolis, the form er of which is s aid to be 20 feet thick: the Etruscan style, he say s, is derived from it, but when it had made a decided advance, as it indicates improved architectural knowledge. He also points out that wherever this Masonry is found there e xists a tradition of an ancient race of giants, who have passed away or been des troyed, and he attributes the remains of this s tyle in Palestine to the Anakim, Rephaim, and the Canaanitish tribes.<<Ibid, 1865 , xii, p. 146 .>> \"Britain.\" The Cyclopean architecture of the British isles is prominent and may range from 4,500 to 1,500 y ears antiquity,<<WEH NOTE: Carbon dated in modern times to be up to 8,000 years old as to wooden precursors.>> and are well described b y Toland as they existed 200 years ago. Numerous c ircles of stone were dedicated to the sun: that in the isle of Lewes h as 12 obelisks and a 13th in the centre representing the rudder of a ship, and reached b y a passage of double obelisks each of 19 stones with a 39th guarding the e ntrance of the avenue. We have here the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the Sun, and the Druid cycle of 19 years. At St. Burien in Cornwall i s a temple of 19 stones, each 12 feet distant, and a 20th of greater height in the centre, this may refer to the 19 years c ycle of 12 months. In these temples a large altar was erected near which stood {40} the Cr uimthear or priest, and adjacent are found p rodigious stones which can be moved b y a touch at the right place, whilst elsewhere they resist all the strength of man. Toland mentions one of these Cromleachs at Cruich, in Cavan, placed in the midst of 12 obe lisks, covered with brass, on which stood statues of the gods, whilst the bowing - stone was c overed with gold and silver. The Circles of Stonehenge are 3,600 years old, according to the calculation of Professor Norm an Lockyer, founded upon its orientatio n as a Sun - temple 1680 years B.C. This c alculation is c onfirm ed b y the discovery in 1901 , when making some repairs of the chippings from the two descriptions of stones, of which the two circles are composed, together with rude flint axes and hamm ers of th e pre - bronze age, \"i.e.\", 1500 to 2000 B.C. In the face of the varied authorities we have quoted it is not possible to come to any other conclusion than that the Cyclops were the primitive builders and workers in metals, and that t heir descendants the C abiri were until we approach Christian times a religious and operative brotherhood which then became e ntirely speculative. There is a mythological groundwork for the assimilation of the various nations that practised the Cyclopean style. Plutarch quotes Anticlides as affirm ing that Isis was the daughter of Prometheus, who as"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"a revelator of arts was a Cabir, and wife to Dionysos or Bacchus, and Dionysius Halicarnassus s ays that Atlas left his habitation on Mount Caucasus and became King of Arcadia. Apollo dorus affirm s that t his Atlas was s on of Japhetus and b rother to Prometheus. Pausanius inform s us that t he Arcadians were all Pelasgi, as were also the inh abitants of Argos, and that the Pelasgians had that name from a King Palagius.<<Bishop Cumberland; \" Origenes.\">> Dionisu is Assyrian, and also Indian as Dionysos, whilst admittedly Egyptian as Bacchus; hence the Dionysian artificers of Greece may have sprang out of the Cabiri. Raol Rochette considers that t he Cyclop Palaemonius, to whom a Sanctuary was raised, was {41} the Tyrians Heracles. H. P. Blavatsky says that the - builders of the sacred columns at Gadir covered them with mysterious c haracters and figures, of which the same is s till found on the walls of Ellora, that gigantic ruin of the temple o f Visvakarm an styled \"the builder and artificer of the gods.\" It is quite likely that the physical and superior strength of the Cyclops has a foundation in fact. Apart from the testimony of ancient writers, collected b y men of the stamp of Grotius, in re gard to the e xistence at one time of a race of giants, there has recently been discovered at Piedmont in Moravia the skeleton of a human family, side by side with the bones of the Mamm oth, that of the man being of \"extraordinary size.\" At the Grotto o f Ro chers Rouges, Mentone, skeletons have been found under 29 feet of limestone stalagmite, which may be reckoned to represent 8,000 years, that of a male was 7ft. 9in. without head, and that of a female 6ft. 3in. \"Cabiric Mysteries.\" In order to arrive at an idea of the Cabiric Mysteries and their several great gods, or powers, we must recognise their antiquity, and the fact that their chief constellation was the Great Bear, the seven stars. Of the Pleiades a seventh star is s aid to be lost, \"the six pres ent the seventh h idden.\" We must also consider the most striking facts of nature, which led to the division of time into days, months, and years. The first measure of time is a contest between light and d arkness, a day and a night, or what is now known t o be a revolution of the e arth round the sun. The next measure of time was the birth and d eath of the moon, or what we know as a monthly revolution of the moon round the e arth. It would next be noted that the seven stars of the Great Bear m akes a complet e turn round in 365 d ays or thereabouts. The 13 lunar and 12 solar m onths in the ann ual birth and d eath of the sun is a later and more complicated calculation of a year, though it corresponds with the ann ual revolution of the seven stars round a polar cen tre, which was what the Cabiri plainly comm emorated. {42} The Sun was the Semitic, rather than the Cabiric s ymbol, and may possibly be indicated in the archaic hymn of the Akkadian victory of Hea over the seven - headed serpent. Other changes of the sym bolism succeeded and we have the seven gods applied to so many spheres, or to the planets, and finally anthropomorphised into seven gods of arts. We read<<II \"Kings\" xvii., v. 30.>> \"The men Of Babylon made Succoth Benoth,\" which is understood to be the i mage worship of the Pleiades. The late Doctor Walker Arnott asserted that none could comprehend Masonic ritual without a full knowledge of Hebrew astronomy. These considerations tend to prove the greater antiquity of the Cabiric s ystem, as preceding the Mysteries that made a dying g od of our solar orb; and it has also a higher scientific basis, as implying the origin of systems from that far distant central sun, round which all the globes revolve. It is on these natural phenomena, spiritualized in the My steries, that their ceremonies"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"are founded. Apollodorus and Varro say that the Cabiri adored the heavens and earth under the names of Ouranos and Ghe as the creators of mankind: Hindu spirit and matter. According to Sanconiathon and the Phoenicians, th e Cabiri were the e ight sons of Sadyk, of whom the youngest, named Eshmun or Akmon, or in the Greek version Cadmillus or Casmillus, was s lain by the others. Misor, the brother of Sadyk, was father of Taut, and received the inh eritance of Egypt, and the Ca biri record it, a claim that the most ancient inh abitants of Egypt were of this ritual. Of these e ight, three were most noted, and were term ed b y the Greeks Axieros, Axiochersos, and Axiocheres, and as \"xi\" is but the Greek \"chi\" it has been suggested<<Dr . Tytler, in \"F.M. Mag.\">> that these names may be transmuted into Chaldean as Ahea, Ashur, Ahea, which is equal to I am that I am. Mr. Edward C. King<<\"Akkadian Genesis,\" p. 59; \"Exodus\" iii. v. I4; Ahih Ashr Ahih.>> reads these words Aya, Asher, Aya, an d {43} w hen Theodoret asked a Jew the true pronunciation of the sacred name HB:YH YH, the Jew said \"ya,\" and wrote \"aya,\" for he was not perm itted b y his law to pronounce the sacred name. Equally in Masonry there is a Word which can be written but not pro nounced, and there is a mode of uttering that word which cann ot be written. Some writers s uppose that the three Cabiri, or Corybantes, symbolise sun, moon, and earth, in the contest between which one is s upposed to be slain in eclipse, and quote the words of Hesiod -- \"Stained with blood and falling by the hands of two celestial bodies.\" One of the gods was named Eubulos, pronounced very similarly to three words used in \"Ancient\" Masonry, which h ad a reference to Solomon \u0000 s temple, which all ancient writer s admit was a type of the universe. The slain Casmillus had the same signification as the Osirian sun - god, and in the Phoenician, Babylonian, and Egyptian books, and cosmogonies are some curious references which may typify circumcision, the Mythraic bap tism of blood, and the Taurobolium or baptism of bull \u0000 s blood, which is referred to in the Phrygian version of the Cabiric rites. Thus, on the authority of Philo Byblus, we have it in the legend of Kronos that he sheds his s on \u0000 s blood as a propitiation to his father Ouranos and circumcised his family, and from the words used it would seem that this was s ymbolically acted in the Mysteries. In another legend, El castrates his father Ouranos in order to fertilise the rivers, in which is found the first germ of life. Again Bel Merodach cuts open the dragon Tiamat, or chaos, from which h e proceeds. In the Egyptian \"Ritual of the Dead\" it is s aid: \"the blood is that of the sun as he goes along cutting himself.\" Masonic writers tell us that the Initiated sym bolically embrued his hands in the blood of the slain Casmillus. These murdered gods, as in the case of Osiris and Adonis, usually suffer in the generative parts, indicative of the transfer of the life principle, and it is s aid mythologically that when th e two o ther gods slew Casmillus they fled {44} w ith a chest containing his genitals to Etruria, in which we have doubtless a notice of colonisation. The Cabiric gods were held to be the instructors of mankind in all useful knowledge; magical rites, buil ding, smelting and working in metals, shipbuilding, music, etc., and were denominated Techn ites or artificers. Sanconiathon says that Ouranos was the father of Sculptors, as was Hiram the father or Abiv of Masons, metal workers, carvers, and d yers, and in verity a Cabir. Faber considers that t he term Fabri by which the Latins designated"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Artificers in general is derived from Cabiri, and he also asserts that \"all the most ancient remarkable buildings of Greece, Egypt, and Asia Minor were ascribed to Cabiria n or Cyclopean Masons.\"<<Faber, \"Cab.\" i. p. 35.>> As the rites also professed to instruct the candidate in incantations s uch as we know w ere used b y the Akkadians of Babylon that alone would indicate identity of origin. The learned Hyde attributes the name Cabir to Gabri, Guebri, fire or sun worshippers; and as the slain god is named Akmon, which word also means a cube of eight angles, heaven or Ouranos, it is therefore equivalent to the Semitic Ur and Urim, and remotely to Hiram, whose father Josephus says was named Ur. It is s aid that the Initiatory ceremony into the Mysteries of Samothrace lasted three days and was term ed \"Enthronement,\" and that mystic dances representing the motions of the heavenly bodies were perform ed round the throne, which c onn ects the rite with astronomy. A white - stone was presented to the Initiate as a symbol of membership. Hives of bees were preserved in the temple, and the interior cavern or Sanctuary contained a pyramidical chamber as its most sacred p lace. Heckethorn asserts that in the Phrygian branch of these Mysteries they had a pine tree cut to form a cross, with the figure of a man upon it, and the same thing is asserted of the British Druids. The tomb of Midas in Phrygia is adorned with the, equal - limbed cross, or the modern Greek {45} form . Eusebius, who can see only the worst side of the Mysteries, writes of them in the same style as the modern secularist upon the scriptures. Ection, he says, founded the Samothracian Mysteries, and Venus s prang from the memb er of Uranus which was thrown into the sea, wherefore a lump of salt is the symbol of generation. These are what the Phrygians c elebrate as the rites to Attys, Cybele, and the Corybantes. Certain signs were, \"I have e aten out of the tambourine. I have d rank out of the cymbal. I have carried the mystic salver. I have slipped into the bed.\" Similar expressions are found amongst the Druids, and were known to the Eleusenian initiates. They are but allegories and not actual rites. Clemens of Alexandria speaking of these Mysteries s ays: -- \"Know that having killed their third b rother they covered the head of the dead b ody with a purple cloth, crowned it (or encircled it with a chaplet), and carrying it on the point of a spear (or bearing it on a brazen s hield), buried it under the roots of Olympus. The Mysteries are in short murders and funerals.\"<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" v., p. 173 . -- \"Exhort,\" ch. ii., also \"Eiusebius,\" prep. \"Gos.\" c. iii., b. 2.>> Where two gods murder a third the reference may be to two seasons and winter. \"Babylon.\" We will now glance at the Babylonian contemporaries of these Cyclops or Cabiri. Berosus the Chaldean h istorian records that the civilisation of Babylon was derived from a god who was half man and half fish, and who rose each day out of the Erythrean sea, and Lepsius has expressed the opinion that the legend p oints to Egyptian sources. The faith of the old Akkadians was of a magical nature in which amulets, as in the Cabiric Mysteries, played a leading part. They adored the spirits of nature and the e lements, whom they believed to be ruled b y three great gods -- Anu the supreme; Hea the ruler of the e arth from his heavenly boat; and Mulgi the lord of the underworld or Hades. Each of these had his feminine consort. Hea is the counterpart of the Hebrew { 46} Jehovah, he walks with, talks with, and instructs mankind; and a hymn, which is possibly the most ancient in the world, describes his power and might and his v ictory over the seven - headed serpent, a metaphor equally fo und"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"in Lapland, Thibet, Egypt, India, Greece, and even Yucatan. These Akkadians were, like the Egyptians and Mayaux, pyramid b uilders, and the ruins of Babel or Borsippa is of this nature. It came to be called the temple of the Bit - zida or of the right h and, and there is an ancient cylinder which represents a seven - stepped p yramid, at the top of which is a colossal hand, and eight worshippers, corresponding to the Cabiric gods s urround the pyramid in worship. The locality of Babylon gave them in specul ation two \"Great Pillars,\" t he \"Mount of the world,\" in the northeast, or Ararat, which they also term ed \"the abode of the gods,\" and which was to them what Meru was to the Aryans, and a corresponding mount in the south west, whence was the descent to the domain of Mulgi the ruler of the dead; which descent was alleged to be guarded b y seven concentric walls, with one gate in each wall. All the great mountains of the East are represented as the residences of a spiritualised race. At a remote period the priests had composed an epic in twelve books answering to the Zodiacal signs over which the sun - god journies -- in Akkadian Isdhubhar, in Egyptian Heracles, in Tyrian Melcarth. It comm ences the first book or m onth with the siege of Ghizdubar or Isdhubhar in Erech -- it is light which overcomes darkness. In the second and third the hero resorts for comfort to the prophet Heabani. In the fourth and fifth there is war, figuring the e lemental storm s. In the sixth and seventh we have the lives and d isorders of the hero and Ishter, believed to refer to the moon \u0000 s c hanges. Ishtar descends into Hades, like Ceres of Greece, to seek aid from Mulgi, and is divested of some portion of her apparel at each gate of the seven walls. In the e ighth and ninth we have the wanderings of the hero and a Paradisical garden. In {47} the tenth the hero is ferried over the Styx that he may be restored to health by Tamzi, the translated Sage. The e leventh is a similar account of the deluge to that in Genesis. The twelfth comm em orates the death of Heabani. In analogy with this s acred number seven, the tower of Babel had seven stories, and Herodotus inform s us that Ecbatana in Media was guarded b y seven concentric walls, each of which, as were the stories of Babel, was painted to represent one of the seven spheres or planets. The Mythraic Mysteries though proto - Median in their conception, were Aryan when we become historically acquainted with them, and they had seven caverns of Initiation approached b y g ates in a pyramid of sev en landings, and the trials of Initiation are doubtlessly allegorised b y the ancient Persian poet Ferdusi, in the Heft - Khan or labours of Rustam. In this the implication is obvious that t he mythology was more ancient t han the e rections which symbolised it , old as these are in the world \u0000 s history. The tower of Babel or Borsippa, \"which h ad been left unfinished since the deluge,\" was c ompleted b y Nebuchadnezzar with the addition of an eighth story \"according to the original design\"; this last consisted of a \"cubical chamber\" as a shrine for the god, the appointments being of gold. The oldest temple in the world is s aid to have been discovered b y excavators at Biaya in Central Babylonia. The walls of the tower were first uncovered and the summ it cleared. The first inscription on the surface was brick stamped with the name Dungi of 2750 B.C. A little lower appeared a crumpled p iece of gold with the name Param Sim who lived in 3750 B.C. (\"Freemasons \u0000 Chronicle,\" 15 Au g., 1908 .) In h is \"Seven Great Monar chies,\" Professor George Rawlinson term s the Tower of Babel the \"Birs - i - Nimr od,\" the ancient temple of Nebo at Borsippa. It"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"was a perfect square of seven ascents or stages, 272 feet at base, each way, the four corners facing the Cardinal points, and the { 48} seven stages occupying a height of 156 feet, the highest of all was a perfect cube and the Sanctuary of the God. Rawlinson \u0000 s arrangement of these is as follows: -- STAGE. COLOUR. PLANET. Basement, B lack, Saturn. Second Stage, Orange, Jupiter. Third \" Blood Red, Mars. Fourth \" Golden, Sun. Fifth \" Pale Yellow, Venus. Sixth \" Azure, Mercury. Seventh \" Silver, Moon. A similar symbolic plan existed in India, for we find Seven Courts of which the last, or central ones, have no canopy, but that of the heavens. In Egypt, the most ancient of the Pyramids, that of Saccarah, consisted of Seven S tages, the same thing equally existed in Mexico. All the wonderful works wrought by the god Hea upon earth were perform ed by virtue of an omnific Word, which would seem to have been los t to the Magi, though the ancient priests of Egypt appear to have claimed that they possessed it, and they had a god \"whose name is hidden.\" The Jewish belief as to the power of the Ineffable name of their God JHVH -- Yahvah, Yihvah, or as we, incorrectly , use it Jehovah, would seem to be based on these beliefs. Yahvah reads, He causes to bring forth. \"Assyria.\" A complete fusion of the Akkadian and Semitic faiths had taken place before 2500 B.C., and the population h ad b ecome known as Chaldean. Assy ria, civilised from Babylon, rose into power, though its precise beginn ing has not been traced. About 1820 B.C., Samsi - Vul built at Assur a temple to Anu and Vul, and Iritak b uilt one called the \"House of Salvation.\" Samsi - Vul also repaired the temple of Ishter then at Nineveh. About 1350 B.C. Budil built a palace at Assur which h is s uccessor Vul - Nerari I. enlarged and which h is s on Sh almaneser 1300 B.C. still further extended; he also restored the great temple called the \"Mountain of the world\"; he furt her built the new city of Caleh, about 18 miles from Nineveh, founded a palace at the latter place, and repaired the temple of Ishter there. His s on Tugulti - Ninip {49} assumed the title of \"King of Nations, King of Sumar and Akkad, and conqueror of Kardun iyas\" (Babylon). The next great builder was Tiglutli - Pileser, 1120 B.C., he rebuilt the temple of Assur, after a lapse of 701 years and raised there two pyramidical towers; he also improved the palaces of Assur and Nineveh, and left his c ountry one of the foremost monarchies of the world. His tablet, in the British Museum, represents him with a Maltese cross which h angs from the breast, and there is also o ne of another king having the like decoration. There is a somewhat remarkable Assyrian confirm atio n of the antiquity of the Masonic s ystem of consecration to be found in the inscriptions. When Cyrus King of Persia discovered the foundation of his early predecessor in Assyria, Assur - bani - pal, he says -- \"I laid the foundation and made firm the bricks; with beer, wine, oil, and honey.\"<<\"Records of the Past,\" iv, p. 171 .>> Other inscriptions mention oil, and the sacrifice of animals. The foundation cylinder of Naboniadus, a Babylonian King conquered b y Cyrus, speaks of the discovery"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"of the foundation - st one of the temple built by Naram - sin, son of Sargon of Akkadia the Semitic c onqueror of Babylon 3,200 years earlier. Recent digging is s aid to carry Babylonian data to 8000 B.C. Something of the nature of caste initiation must also have e xisted amongst the Au gurs and Sacred Scribes. Professor Sayce in h is \"Hibbert Lectures\" has to this effect -- A tablet states that an Au gur m ust be, \"of pure lineage unblemished in h and or foot,\" and speaks thus of the vision which is revealed to him before he is \"init iated and instructed, in the presence of Samas and Rimm on, in the use of the book and stylus,\" by \"the Scribe, the instructed one, who keeps the oracle of the gods,\" when h e is made to descend into an artificial imitation of the lower world and there behol ds \"the altars amid the waters, the treasures of Anu, of Bel, and Hea, the tablets of the gods, the delivery of the oracle of heaven and earth, and the cedar tree, the beloved of the great gods, which their {50} hands have caused to grow.\" It is thought t hat each sign of the Babylonian Zodiac had its s pecial order of priests, in all twelve. In very many countries the e ternal stability and p ower of the deity was represented b y a square block or cube stone. Maximus Tyrius s peaking of the worship of some god b y the Arabians s ays -- \"The statue that I saw of him was a square stone.\" Phurnutus s peaking of the figuration of Herm es or Mercury says -- \"As the square figure betokens his s olidity; so he wanted neither hands or feet to execute what he was c omm and ed b y Jove.\"<<Toland \u0000 s \"Druids.\">> Some approximation of the very ancient flourishing period of the Cabiric Mysteries may be form ed upon consideration that the Nagon - wat of Cambodia contains Cabiric sc ulpture in its architecture; the fish - man or Dagon o f Babylon, and equally with every nation, including the Mayas of America, the monkey g od. No o ne now knows what people e rected the place, but Blavatsky, who is good testimony on a point of this nature, maintains that whoever built Nagon - wat were of the sa me religion and race as those who built the ancient Pagodas, the Egyptian pyramids, and the ruins of Ellora, Copan, and Central America. \"Egypt\". If we now turn to Egypt we find it accepted b y scholars that its earliest known population were allied wit h the Akkads of Babylon, by language and religion. Besides the affinity of the ancient Coptic to the Chinese and Chaldean speech, it is admitted that before the Osirian worship b ecame general, and it is as old as Menes the first King of Egypt, there was a n identity of religion; and that the seven gods of Memphis represented in the worship of Ptah -- the potter who creates the world out of the mundane e gg -- and his minor gods, are identical with the gods of the Cabiri. The greater antiquity of Egypt would seem to be proved b y the mutations of the methods of writing, for the Egyptians besides their Hieratic and Domatic alphabet, reserved the hieroglyphic s ystem for {51} sacred things; the Domatic was then used for secular m atters, and the Hieratic for their sacred manuscripts. This latter alphabet they transmitted to Phoenicia, whence through Greece and Rome, in a gradually modified state, it form s the characters of our own times. But when the Akkadians s ettled in Babylon they were already possessed of the cuneiform alphabet, and although the e xact locality where this was developed has not yet been settled, it is possible that they carried it with their language and religion by way of Bactria from their primitive home in the Caucasian h ighlands, or those of central Asia. The Egyptian S esun, the Babylonian Nabu, the Akkadian and Aryan Ak, and the Chinese diagrams c alled the Kouas, introduced into the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"primitive Yh - King at a later period, all have the same relation and are e qually represented b y eight parallel lines in two fours. The \"Ritual of the Dead\" or Manifestations of Light, contains allusions to the Cabiric c onstellation of the Great Bear or seven stars, who are e qually the seven sons of Ptah; the seven spirits of Ra; the seven companions of King Arthu r; the seven Hohgates of America; the seven Lumazi or leaders of the star flock of Assyria; they may also be applied to the seven Amashpands of Persia, the seven Rishis of India, and seven spirits that surround the throne of God. Mr. W. St. Chad Boscawen asserts that at a remote period, a close intercourse e xisted b etween Egypt and Chaldea, the point of junction of the two civilisations being the peninsula of Sinai. The old legends of Chaldea a nd the old hymns of Eridu which, on the evidence of silt, are assigned a period of 6,000 years B.C., betray a culture derived from a maritime people; Eridu, like Memphis, was c alled the \"Holy City,\" and in Chaldea we find a god named Asari and in Egypt Heseri or Osiris, whilst in India we have Iswari. At the remot e period of which we are writing we have no written account of the nature of the Mysteries practised either in Egypt or Chaldea, and we must judge the secret rites, by what we can ascertain of them at a later {52} period; we know, however, that that which was applicable to the Cabiric gods of Greece and Chaldea was also applicable to the seven sons of Ptah at Memphis. Sanconiathon inform s us that in the time of one of the most ancient hierophants, they had corrupted their Mysteries by mingling cosmogonical affections with the historical traditions; from which we see that before his time they had d iverged from the Cabiric ritual. It is v ery noteworthy that Egypt was the most prosperous during the e ras which followed the accession of Menes their first King. Most of the arts known at this day, and some which we do not know, are pictured in the e arliest tombs, and these include gold mining and smelting, Cabiric c laims, of which we accept Tubal - Cain as the father on Hebrew evidence. It was the custom of the priestly caste to confer Initiation upon a new Pharaoh, as was the case in Babylon, and there are traces of art symbolism to be found in the e arliest times. Thus the Cubit rule was the sacred symbol of Truth; and we are told b y Diodorus that t he ancient H ieratic alphabet, distinguished from the Domatic or comm on, was of this nature, as it made use of the tools of carpenters, and he instances the hatchet, pincers, mallet, chisel, and square. The most ancient ruins c ontain Masons \u0000 Marks, such as the point w ithin a circle, the triangle, the trowel, the tau, and triple - tau. We give here a part of the first chapter of the \"Book of the Dead;\" the work is of a composite character and comm ingles the Memphian theology of Ptah with that of the Theban Amen, and the Osirian theology. The copies also vary according to the social position of the dead for whose burial the copies were intended. \"I am a Priest in Abydos in the day that the e arth rejoiceth, I see the secret places of the winding region, I ordai n the festival of the spirit, the Lord of the abiding land, I hear the watchword of the watchers over m e, I am the Architect of the great barge of Sochais, (Ptah.)

I do not compute my justification in many parts, My soul stands up square to the face of tbe J udge, It is found true on the e arth.\" (Guild Symbolism.) Another passage says -- \"As the sun died and rose again yesterday, so man dies and rises again.\" There are many passages in the Ritual which clearly imply secret Initiation. The representat ions of the Judgment Hall of Osiris -- the living one, the Master of life, the Master of all, in all his c reation, names, functions, diadems, ornaments, palaces, etc., is of a very impressive character, and has been incorporated with the Christianity of la ter times. In some of the papyrus MSS ., both in h ieroglyphic and hieratic c haracters, 3 - 4,000 years old, the spirit appearing for justification stands between Isis and Nepthys pictured with the sign of a Fellow Freemason; in others he is holding up b oth arm s, representing two squares; in this following the written statement t hat he stands \"square\" before his judge. Each district of Egypt had its Trinity of Gods: -- Thebes, in the 14th century B.C. had the \"hidden god,\" Amen, \"Maker of all things; Thou only one\"; Muth (mother) Mother Nature; Khensu (the child): in the 4th century B.C. we have Amen or Khepura (creator); Tefunt (humidity); Sh u (light). Abydos had Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Elephantine -- Khn um or Chn oumis; Anuka or Anocuis; and Hak. Helio polis had Tum or Harm achis; Nebhetp; Horus. Memphis had P tah by Merenphtah; Nefer; Atum. Though this c hapter has run to great length something must be said of the architecture of this extraordinary people. The oldest structures which remain are the {5 4} pyramids, and the most ancient of these is possibly 8,000 years old, and may be described as a mere cairn of stones. Next follows the great pyramid of Ghizeh, which h as been term ed a stone bible, the Masons might call it t hat wonderful religious, scien tific, and astronomical Tracing - board. According to Herodotus it was built by Cheops, whom the priests held in detestation, as he had caused all the temples to be closed d uring its erection, its date variously estimated at 3324 to 4325 B.C. It is s aid th at the architect was Khufu - ankh, an Osirian, who was buried near to it. Cheops was c ertainly an Osirian, whilst t he priests were opposed to that worship.<<\"Egypt,\" Wm. Oxley, p. 87.>> All the pyramids had their official priests attached, and even in the earliest t imes fabulous s ums were lavished upon these structures, and upon their temples. These latter were divided into three portions: -- 1, an outer court, not always roofed; 2, the body of the temple; 3, the Holy - place and the shrine of the god in who se honour the temple was built. The temple of Jerusalem was of analogous c haracter. Archaeologists c onsider that t he prehistorical nucleus was the holy - place, and that gradually other chambers began to be e rected around it. The pyramid was the model upo n which the builder acted, the walls s loping and narrowing upwards. There are grave discrepancies amongst t he learned in regard to the chronology of this nation, owing to disagreement as to whether certain"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"dynasties of kings were reigning contemporaneou sly; but the great pyramid of Ghizeh, whatever its real age, shews a marvellous knowledge of geometry, astronomy, and operative Masonry. The hardest granite has been chiselled with such mathematical accuracy that a knife blade will not enter the joints, a nd men of science suppose that they have discovered in its c onstruction the evidence of a learning equal to that of the present day. The number 5, and its multiples, is the radical basis of its measurements; precisely as the Israelitish Tabernacle is s et up with the like {55} multiple of 5, whilst t he Temple of Solomon works upon its exact double or 10. The pyramid is found to be an exact mathematical expression of the proportion which the diameter bears to its c ircumference, that is as 1 is to 3.1459 {SIC }. It is accurately oriented, that is its four sides are opposite the cardinal points; and it occurs that twice in each year, at a period of 14 d ays before the spring, and 14 d ays after the autumnal equinox, the sun for a short period seems to be resting upon the very apex o f the pyramid, as if it was its pedestal. It is s o constructed that five hundred million pyramid inches, or twenty million cubits, represent the polar axis of the e arth. The height multiplied b y ten to its ninth power gives the distan ce of the sun from the e arth (about 92 1 /2 million miles). If the length of each of its four base lines is divided b y cubits of 25 inches it gives the e xact length of a solar year, in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The length in inches of the two dia gonal li nes, drawn across the base, gives exactly the number of years occupied in a full procession of the e quinoxes, or 25,826 1 /2 years. The e ntrance is s o designed that it indicates the obliquity of the polar axis of the e arth, and the stones of the Ma sonry above the e ntrance form the monogram of Osiris, it is a cube over which are two squares. The chambers are equally based upon intricate mathematical calculations, and various astronomical facts are symbolised in the arrangements of its s everal parts, but for these particulars the reader m ust consult some of the works which h ave been specially written on the subject. The coffre in the King \u0000 s Chamber is generally considered a \"pastos\" of Initiation, but is s aid also to constitute a standard of dry meas ures. Even a prophetical bearing is s aid to be found in its measurements, but as this is the least certain of these various uncertain correspondences we will not enter into it here. Herodotus s ays that it took 300 ,000 workmen to build the structure in 30 years, and that one - third of the men and of the time were e mployed in making a causeway {56} for the blocks. Noting its s plendid work, we may ask, if this pyramid is only 5,000 years old, of what age is Cyclopean work? But t he pyramid of Cheops has a much more important bearing on Speculative Freemasonry than anything that we have yet said; and though the secrecy of the priests of Egypt was absolute, yet is not altogether impenetrable. This s ecrecy was equally stringent at Memphis, Thebes, and Helio polis, and when Pythagoras applied for initiation h e was referred from one to the other. The architect of Cheops embodied the Osirian Mysteries in imperishable stone, as did also the builder of the Babylonian Borsippa, and the designer of the Persian cave of Mythras. And now for something of the Mysteries of Egypt, as represented b y this pyramid. The e ntrance and its passage conform to the letter Y, or \"two paths\" of Pythagoras and the broad and narrow w ay of the Greek Mysteries. The descending path lea ds to an underground chamber, the floor of which is rough and unh ewn, as is the rough Ashlar of a Freemason. The ascending passage leads first to a middle chamber named the Queen \u0000 s, or"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"that of our Lady Isis, and above that is the King \u0000 s c hamber with the e mpty sarcophagus of Osiris; over all are five secret chambers of small dimensions. Dr. Oli ver asserts that the \"vesica piscis\" enters into the constructive design of the Queen \u0000 s c hamber.<<\"Freemasons \u0000 Treasury,\" p. 241 .>> The whole of the internal struct ure covers an all - important allegory. It has been recently shewn by Brother W. M. Adams, and having the general approval of Professor Maspero, that t here is a relationship b etween the internal structure of the pyramid and the \"Ritual of the Dead,\" or as M aspero says, \"both the one and the other have reference to an ideal house which Horus was c onceived to have erected for his father Osiris,\" and Adams points out that the Well, the hidden lintel, the north and south passages apply equally to the heavenly te mple, and the e arthly counterpart. It is in fact the e mbodiment, perhaps 6,000 years ago, of a {57} speculative and operative Masonry consonant with the spiritual faith of Osiris. The religious s ymbols of Egypt, according to Mr. William Oxley \u0000 s work on Egypt, changed with the progress of the sun through the signs of the zodiac, an assertion confirm ed b y much evidence. The e ra of Osiris and Isis is mythical, yet they are represented as parents of the twins Horus and Harm achis. In the year 4,565 B.C. th e sun entered Taurus, and the Bull became the e mblem of Osiris. It entered Aries 2,410 B.C., and the Ram becomes the e mblem of Amen at Thebes. It entered P isces 255 B.C., and we have crocodile - shaped gods, and the fish is a Christian symbol. The Egyptia ns c onveyed something of this nature to Herodotus, who records it in a curious fable: Heracles desired to behold the highest god, he being one of the 12 minor gods; at length to meet his prayers, the supreme one revealed himself clothed in the skin and wit h the head of a Ram. The late Godfrey Higgins s upposes in h is \"Anacalypsis\" that when the sun entered Taurus he found man a negro such as the black Budha, and when h e e ntered Aries he found him still black b ut with aquiline nose and straight hair as in th e handsome Chrishn a. The recent discoveries of Colonel Ram indicates that the Sphinx is one of the most ancient monuments of Egypt, as it was old in the days of Cheops, and there is a tablet which shows that it was repaired b y Pharaoh Chephren. It repr esents, as facing the rising sun, the god Ra - Harm achis and has at its base several chambers hewn in the rock, the tombs of kings and p riests devoted to the worship of Harm achis. During the 5th dynasty of Kings s everal small temples were e rected, as at E sneh, some pyramids, and an Osirian temple at Dendereh. There is an inscription of the 6th dynasty in the Ghizeh Museum, in which Una, a man of the people, describes how he had b een sent by Pepi I. to cut, and then convey, a block of stone for the royal { 58} tomb; he details the mode in which h e accomplished this, with much engineering skill, about 3,400 B.C., and styles himself \"chief of the royal workmen.\" Usertesen I., perhaps 3,000 B.C., laid the foundation of the temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, and assumes himself to be son of the double Harm achis; the same king built the front part of the temple of Karnak, which measures 1,200 feet by 348 feet; he also enlarged the temple of Ptah at Memphis. Professor Norm an Lockyer, F.R.S., considers that as Karna k is oriented to receive the direct shaft of the sunlight at t he season when it touched the horizon, opposite the temple gateway, that it was built 3,700 B.C. The superintendence of Egyptian Craftsmen by higher officials is s hewn in the rockcut temple o f Rekhmara, as 3,400 years ago the Vizier of Thebes is"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"represented with all his attendants, \"inspecting all the handicrafts made in the temple of the house of Amen, and teaching each man h is duty concerning his trade.\" His inscription concludes: \"I have l eft no evil deeds behind me, may I be declared just and true in the great judgment.\" (Boscawen in \"Globe,\" Au g., 1900 .) A few centuries later the famous Labyrinth was erected; it represents the twelve Zodiacal signs, and the twelve great gods, and cont ains 3,000 chambers with a lofty carved p yramid as adjunct. As proof that t he priests had a monotheistic c reed we quote the following words from over the gate - way of the temple of Medinet - Abou: -- \"It is He that has made all that is, and without Him nothi ng has been made.\" The temple of Luxor is the largest upon earth, but space fails us to record a tithe of the mighty works of this wonderful race. The names of numerous architects are preserved and Brugsch, Leiblein, and Lepsius, give the names of thirty - four, some of whom were allied with the reigning Pharaohs. Comm ercial intercourse e xisted with China, as pottery, and other works of art, have been found in very ancient tombs. There is the record of an Artist of the name of Iretsen, of about 2,800 B. C., in which h e says: -- \"I know the {59} mystery of the divine Word; the ordinances of the religious festivals, and every rite perform ed therein, and I have never strayed from them. I know how to produce the form that issueth forth and cometh in, so that each member goes to its place. I know the contemplating eye, without a second, which affrights the wicked; also the posing of the arm that brings the hippopotamus low. I know the making of amulets, by which one may g o and the fire will not give its flam e, nor will the water destroy. I am an artist wise in h is art, a man standing above all men by his learning.\" One passage here can only refer to the e gress and ingress of the soul in trance, as in the Yogism of India, and the amulets against fire and wat er would seem to refer to the trials of the Neophyte by fire and water in the Mysteries. But in our days v ery extraordinary tales are told about the priests of Japan, and other less civilised p eople, walking unh arm ed over hot coals. We wonder how this ar tist would interpret the following symbolic design upon an ancient monument? A lion h olds in one paw a crux - ansata {Symbol: Ankh}, and with the other takes the hand of a recumbent man, whose head is near an altar, as if the lion intended to raise the man ; at the altar stands a god with the hailing sign of a Craftsman.<<Vide Pike \u0000 s \"Morals and Dogma,\" p. 80.>> The highest development of Egyptian civilisation was during the patriarchal times extending from the 4th to the 12th dynasty, say from 7,000 to 2 ,400 B.C., and b efore Egypt began to be affected b y foreign influence. The kings had their \"Court Architects,\" t he profession being held in such h onour that t his officer often mated with the royal family. During the whole period that we have named the hi ghest positions of the State were open to intellect, and the humblest man might aspire to become a General, a Court Architect, or a royal Scribe: the Kings were the fathers of the people, and accessible to their subjects, and a successful soldier or archit ect might become, as the highest prize, a \"Royal Companion,\" or a \"True royal {60} Companion,\" and b e intimately associated with the King.<<W. St. Chad Boscawen.>> Runn ing contemporaneously with the Egyptian culture was that of the great Scytho - Hittite Kingdom, the e qual of Egypt, in metals, buildings, and art, and Captain Conder points out that the point within a circle, {Symbol: Circle with point in center}, was their phonetic s ymbol for \"An,\" or God; the five - pointed"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"star, {Symbol: Pentagram}, the sym bol of \"to,\" which implies either down, or to descend, and that t he cypriote symbol of two triangles joined at their apex, {symbol li ke \"X\" with the top and b ottom chevrons c losed to triangles}, but without the bottom line, {symbol as last, but with the lo wer chevron left open}, was the Hittite character for m an or protection.<<\"Lucifer,\" ix.>> A long period of historical darkness now supervenes, and it has been discovered that a race totally distinct from the Egyptians had taken possession of the highla nds to the north of Thebes, between the 7th and 9 th dynasty. They were a tall, powerful race, resembling the Lybian and Amm onite people, had wavy brown h air, prominent aquiline noses, and used flint axes and copper implements. They were accomplished p ott ers, stone workers, and metallurgists. In a ritualistic s ense they were cann ibals, and b roke the bones of human bodies to extract t he marrow. Near to the home of this recently discovered race was Nubt, a town which was devoted to the worship of the execr ated Set and which is mentioned in one of the Satires of Juvenal, as the origin of horrid wars, and cann ibal orgies. Following upon this, as if in some measure due to it, was the domination of the Hyksos, or Sh epherd Kings, who o verran Egypt, between 25 00 and 1600 B.C., perhaps dependent in part upon the ferm ent which arose in Central Asia when the Elamites invaded Babylon, and these Hyksos s eem to have followed the religious v iews of the Semitic tribes, though some writers have thought that they were ol d b elievers who were opposed to the ritual of Osiris, which we shall mention in our next chapter as an Aryan ritual, the weight of evidence is altogether in favour of a foreign origin of {61} the invaders. Manetho, an Egyptian h istorian who was employed b y the Greek P tolomies to investigate the ann als of Egypt, asserts that t he Hebrews were of this race.<<J osephus, \"Against Apion.\">> Simplicius asserts that what Moses taught the Hebrews he had learned in the Mysteries. These Hyksos were at length expelle d b y a Theban of the name of Aahames and the Osirian temples were reopened. Very recently the mumm y of Menephtah was discovered at Luxor, and on examination at Cairo was held to be the Pharaoh who pursued the Israelites; he was the 2nd k ing of the 19th dynasty. Thothmes III., about 1,600 B.C., relates the ceremony which h e observed in laying a foundation - stone at Buto, but the tablet is imperfect. The first stroke of the hamm er thereon appears to be intended to conjure the keeping out of the water; a document was deposited in the stone containing the names of all the great gods and goddesses, \"and the people rejoiced.\" There is also an inscription of this period on the Statue of Semut, in which h e is s tyled: \"First of the first, and Master of the wor ks of all Masters of work.\" There are also Geometrical diagrams of this period indicating the knowledge of the square, and in the great pyramid there yet exists a workman \u0000 s diagram indicating the method of making a right angle; the \"vesica piscis\" exist s in a recess over the King \u0000 s Chamber. Some of the drawings yet exist of a Canon of proportion for the construction of the human figure, which Vitruvius represents by this {X}, the navel being the centre; and though from the e arliest to the latest t imes, the Canon varied, the relative proportions were fixed b y form ing a chequered d iagram of perfect squares. Clement of Alexandria says that the temples of Jerusalem and Egypt separated the congregation and the Sanctuary by a large curtain of four colours, dr awn over five pillars, the one alluding to the cardinal points of the compass, the other to the e lements. The"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Pyramids were worked from the centre by the angle {62} 3, 4, 5. The Guilds s ay that this s ymbol {Neteru: Three vertical li nes with a horizontal right angle line at the top of each one to right}, indicates the presence of 3 G.M.M. \u0000 s. There followed upon this era the introduction into Egypt of a large amount of Babylonian influence, but to render this c omprehensible some e xplanation is necessary. At some remote period races of conquering Cushites from Ethiopia, followed b y Semites, settled in Elam, had p lanted themselves in Babylon. The first of them was probably a worshipper of the god Marduk, or Mercury who is also Thoth and Herm es, for the Bi blical Nimr od is one with Marduk, the beginn ing of whose kingdom was Babel and Erech and (Ur in) Accad, and Calneh in the land of Sh inar. These new comers accepted the religion of the earlier Akkadians, whence we may assume e ither that t here had arisen n o great distinctions in the mode of worship, or that the latter had influence as a race of higher culture. The conquerors, however, changed the names of the gods to adapt t hem to their own Arya - Semitic tongue, and as astronomical term s are in that language the inference is drawn that t hat science was a Semitic development.<<\"Chaldean Magic,\" -- Lenorm ant.>> The chief gods of the assimilated race were Samas the sun - god; Sin the moon - god; and Yav \"the inundator,\" who is probably Hea of Akkad. They accepted the doctrine of the soul \u0000 s imm ortality.<<\"Records of the Past\" -- translated hymn.>> The e arly Assyrian King Asir - nasir - pal claims all the diabolical conquests which h e relates in h is inscriptions from these gods, and p roclaimed himself as the \"exalter of Yav.\" The Semitic names of Beth - Yakin and Yakin, as names of places and p ersons are found in these e arly inscriptions. The remains of this theology exists to - day amongst the Yezids of Asia, the sun is worshipped b y its old name, and the moon and b ull re ceive e qual veneration amongst some of the tribes, and with the worship have been transmitted secret modes of recognition, which a writer who was acquainted with them term s Freemasons \u0000 {63} signs.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" iv. -- Yezids (Yarker).>> It equally con stitutes an argument for the possibility of the uninterrupted transmission of Freemasonry from century to century; and it is impossible to o verlook the many striking points of similarity to the primitive Mysteries which it possesses; and the inference whic h we may draw from this is that an educated p riesthood had added art and science to their curriculum, and that all temples yet continued to be e rected under their supervision. The Chaldean civilisation about 4,000 years ago dominated Syria, and its tong ue became the diplomatic language of the known world, whilst comm erce was maintained extensively between Egypt, Babylon, India, and China. About 1500 B.C. an Egyptian King of the name of Amenophis III., a worshipper of the Theban god Amen, married an Asia tic woman who surrounded the throne with her kindred, and a Babylon S cribe was established at the Court, for Chaldean legends were copied and sent t o Egypt. Their son Amen - hotep adopted the Chaldean faith and changed his name to Khu - en - aten, withdrawing f rom Amen, then one of the oldest priesthoods in the world. He built in eight years the vast city of Tel - el - amarna, where for seventeen years he e nforced the worship of the \"Solar disc,\" or its v italising rays. It was in fact the worship of the sun \u0000 s v ita l rays as the source of all vital li fe, power and force. Probably in some respects it was a restoration of the faith of the Hyksos but it term inated again with the death of the King. In the e rection of his new city, Bek, the hereditary successor of a lon g line of Egyptian architects, is described as -- \"the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"artist, the overseer of the sculptors, the teacher of the King himself.\" His assistant, or what we should now term , his Deputy or Warden, was Potha, who is described as -- \"Master of the Sculptors of the Queen,\" by whom no doubt the Asiatic is meant. These valuable records have only recently been disinterred, and in the house of the Master, trial - pieces were found in various stages exemplifying {64} the cutting of hieroglyphics, and as well, perfectly finished p ortraits and statues, without any admixture of foreign style, and which are e qual to any work of the moderns. It is noteworthy that the ground plan of the tomb of the Queen of Amenophis III., about 1470 B.C., is a cross of the Latin form , and a s Mr. William Oxley says, \"exactly on the plan of a Christian church.\" The Ramiside dynasty, in which the priests of Amen came again into power, did much in the 14th century B.C. to adorn Egypt with stately buildings, and Beken - Khonsoo describes himself as the architect of Rameses II., \"the friend of Amen,\" and the restorer of Karnak, and Dr. Wm. Birch inform s us that the twins Suti and Har were Mer - kat, architects, who had charge of Karnak. Rameses III. makes a record of the numerous temples which h e r estored. He built at Thebes a temple to Khons, of good hewn sandstone and b lack b asalt, having g ates whose folding doors were plated with gold and itself overlaid with electrum like the horizon of heaven.<<\"Records of the Past,\" vi.>> It is unfortunate that we have so little that is authentic in regard to the rites of the Mysteries, though the doctrine is fully embodied in the \"Ritual of the Dead,\" we only begin to have details after they had b een carried to Greece by Orpheus, Cadmus, and Cecrops in the 16th century B.C. All the Egyptian Kings were initiated into them, and are represented as adorned with very handsome aprons. There are also representations, in paintings, of scenes which may equally apply to the e arthly Mysteries, or to the passage of t he soul in the after life, which was in reality the object of the sacerdotal mysteries, and it was a firm custom in Egypt to adapt their whole life to their faith in the future, or to enact in their religious rites, that which they believed would follow on quitting the body. In our next chapter we may be able to form a more solid opinion upon the changes made in the Cabiric Mysteries, which were clearly the most ancient of the great Mysteries, by the advanced Aryans, and as to the alleged {65} changes ma de in ancient Egypt by the substitution of cosmogonical or natural effects, for such traditional history as that recorded b y Sanconiathon, Berosus, etc., a natural consequence, for the Egyptians were undoubtedly a nation of mixed blood. They seem first t o have been of the Negro o r Hamitic type with a polytheistic c reed, they saw God in all nature and in all form s. As proto - Aryans they developed greatly the arts and sciences. Lastly, reinforced b y purer Aryans they became the Apostles of the conditional i mm ortality of the human soul. During the thousand years rule of the Hyksos, or Sh epherd Kings, they were in constant contact with a monotheistic c reed, but no sooner had they driven out these oppressors than the rites of the doctrine of imm ortality, under a Father, Mother, and Son, arose in their old splendour. By way of closing this c hapter it may be pointed out that we have first a series of Mysteries, which amongst people who, living in h ot climates, had little need of art, and confined themselves ra ther to speculative views of the creation of the world and the relations that exist between h eaven and earth. To these, in the next stage were added the whole circle of arts and science, the older"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Mysteries as to the creation of the world and the affinity between h eaven and earth were retained, but a superior r ace of Cabiri added an improved architecture, agriculture, metallurgy, shipbuilding, and all the arts. The third stage which followed was the separation of the Mysteries of Religion and Art into two branches. {66}  CHAPTER III.  ARYAN C IVILISATION AND MYSTER IES. IN the long series of ages which it took to develop the Ugro - altaic monosyllabic language into proto - Aryan, and in the centuries which i t took to convert the Aryo - European into Celitc, Latin, Sclavonic, Lettic, Germ an; other branches into sub - dialects as, for instance, Indo - Aryan into Sanscrit, Persian, Greek, Arm enian, Pushtu, Kurd, Baluchi, Hindustani; and again the Semitic s peech into B abylonian, Assyrian, Phoenician, Arabic, etc., need we feel surprised if the Rites of the Theosophical and Art Mysteries underwent a variation also. Thus the primitive Mysteries known as Magian and Cabiric, were denominated Osirian amongst t he Copts; Tamm uz and Adonis amongst t he Semites; Dionysian amongst t he Assyrians and the Greeks; and applied to Bacchus amongst the Latins. Yet all had the same primitive origin in a remote Arcane School, and varied b ut by a gradual development in techn ique. And not withstanding such departures from an exact form of transmission, with the change of scene, in passing from one country to another by colonists, the social customs of Oriental nations are most unchanging. We have already instanced the practice to - day of Ba bylonian rites by the Yezids. The sacred springs and trees of the old worship are venerated with the ancient rites of music and the dance. The priests of Christianity may be seen practising their ceremonials with the serpent staff of Mercury or Esculapiu s in their hands; and also personating the High priest of Zeus of Vanessa. The ancient {67} Artemis of the Lakes, the Ephesian Aphrodite who is Ishter in Chaldea, and Astarte in Phoenicia, has been succeeded b y the Virgin of the Lakes, with a special soci ety called the Takmorei which h as c onsolidated into a species of Freemasonry term ed the \"Brotherhood of the Sign.\" Even in this c ountry many curious customs of the Druids have been preserved in the three kingdoms. And as Free Masonry can unquestionably b e carried up to very ancient t imes in England, and, beyond, its legends into Oriental lands, what right can be adduced to condemn its traditions as altogether false? The sacred Mysteries spread with the various c olonies into many lands and in the lapse of ages began to apply their traditional knowledge to their new home, under the supposition that their ancestors had occupied this residence in all time. The late Lord Beaconsfield, in h is \"Lothair,\" speaks of the MADRE NATURA as the oldest and the most p owerful of the secret societies of Italy, whose mystic origin, in the idealised worship of nature, reaches the e ra of paganism, and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"which, he says, may have been founded b y some of the despoiled p rofessors of the ancient faith, which as time advanced has a ssumed many form s. Its tradition that one of the Popes, as Cardinal de Medici, became a member of the Fraternity is accredited upon some documentary g rounds, and it accepted the allegorical interpretation which the Neo - Platonists had p laced upon the Pagan creeds during the first Ages of Christianity. It is necessary to say that in dealing with the chronology of the ancients we have no certain era which enables us to give dates with the least precision. We saw in our last chapter that from North Europe colonies s pread over Asia, Arabia, and Chaldea, erecting some wonderful structures in their passage and introducing art into their new settlements. The Celts, Persians, and Greeks continued together a sufficient length of time to merit the title of true A ryans, but of the main branch the Hindu u ndoubtedly made the greatest progress in architecture, {68} literature, and early civilisation. There is a record, which we will allude to later, that a whole arm y of pure Aryans entered Egypt. The cradle of the H indu is traditionally held to be the high - table - land b etween Thibet and India in the region of the lake Mansurawara. Before their advance into India three chief peoples were in possession of that country: the Dravidians of the north west, who have some af finity with the aborigines of south and west Au stralia, use the boomerang as a weapon, and have the same words for I, thou, he, you, etc., these now use a language represented b y Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kanarese, Tulu, Kudugu, Toda, Kota, Gond, Kandh, Ur ain, Rajmahal, etc. A second tribe was the Kolarians driven from the north - east against the Dravidian, and so broken up into Santals, Savars, Kurkus, Juangs, Hos, etc. A third race were the Tibeto - Burm an tribes who have an affinity with the Mongolians. Lastly, and after the invasion of India, Scythic tribes, as the Jats or Getae, and the Ghakkars, secured a footing in the country; our Gypsies seem to spring from the Jat race. As Aryan civilisation was but an advance upon what we have term ed p roto - Arya n, so also it follows that t he art of building with squared and levelled stones, wrought by the use of square, level, and p lumb was the gradual improvement upon the Cyclopean system of irregular blocks; and mingled with the most ancient level architecture of India, equally with various other countries, are walls which resemble the Cyclopean method of building;<<\"Philosophy of History.\" and from this, and other circumstances, we may draw the conclusion that Aryan culture was the medium of advanced architectu re. This improvement had b irth in n orth India a nd one of the oldest cities was the Aryan colony of Balkh where are vast ruins, colossal images, of which the number of prominent figures, or r ecesses, amount t o twelve thousand, in subterranean temples hewn out of the solid rock. At a remote period there arose a contest for supremacy {69} between the warrior and the priest, who had the oral hymns that now compose the Vedas; also term ed the wars of the solar (warrior) and lunar (Brahmin) races. The priests or Brahmins obtained a victory over the Maharajahs who were of a different branch of the Aryan family, and were both warriors and agriculturists. An alliance was form ed, and the warriors were perm itted to receive a limited amount of religious instruction , and at a period later than the oldest Vedas, a system of hereditary caste was established in three chief divisions, the Brahmin, warrior, and artisan, which may be now considered three distinct Rites of the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" It has long been thought that som e of these ancient wars were the result of a dispute as to the relative power of the two forces of nature. In prehistoric times a system had spread over the world in which creative spirit was represented b y the Phallus, and first or primordial matter by t he Yoni, or the male and female organs of generation, but it is s omewhat doubtful whether the most ancient hymns accepted these e mblems; the e mblems are older than any of the hymns when comm itted to writing, but the probability is that when the hymns were written they had not then been sectarianly adopted. Primordial matter, upon which the action of spirit is s upposed to take place, is not ordinary matter as we designate it, but its originator; and it is a scientific fact, well known to the ancients, and e mbodied in the \"Divine Poemander\" of Herm es, that matter, such as we know it, cann ot be destroyed, we can only change its form , and under all that we see lies this primordial matter, as the vehicle of spirit. Both spirit and p rimordial matter are e terna l, and in the recondite aspect of Aryan philosophy, all creation springs from the union of these two indestructible principles, which is Para - Brahm, or Deity without form . In Egypt t he conjoint worship of the two active principles, or latent forces, is fo und emblemised in the crux ansata {Symbol: Ankh} w hich embraces both attributes; separately they appear {70} also in the obelisk and the vesica - pisces, but also in various other emblems in all countries. In remote times s ects arose that made a separate sy mbol of one or other of the principles. It has been shewn by Dr. Inman<<\"Ancient Faiths in Ancient Names.\">> that most Hebrew names have reference to the male principle. On the other hand the Greeks, who are designated Yavans in Hindu literature, with other tribes that it was s aid were e xpelled the Aryan h ome with them, were worshippers of that female nature, or principle of nature, which in Egypt was adored as Isis; in Babylon as Ishter; in S amothrace as Ghe; in Britain as Ceridwen; in Italy as Cybele; in Greece as Ceres; in Arm enia a s Anaitis; in Germ any as Hertha; in Persia a s Mythra; and we may even add, in Christian times as the Virgin Mary. The learned Brother Dr. George Oli ver, in h is \"History of Initiation,\" professes to give the ceremonials o f Initiation into the Brahminical Rites of Mahadeva, but as we know of no evidence of their accuracy we shall refrain from quoting the account. There is a very interesting legend in Porphyry, which h e gives upon the authority of Bardesanes, an Initiate an d Gnostic, who had it from the Brahmins. There was a very lofty mountain which h ad in it a cave of large dimensions. It contained a statue of 12 cubits with its arm s extended in form of a cross, the face was half male and half female; on the right breast was represented the Sun, and on the left the Moon; the arm s had figures of the sky, the ocean, mountains, rivers, plants, and animals; on the head of the figure was a god enthroned. Beyond this was a large e xtension of the cavern, guarded by a door from which issued a stream of water, but only the pure in mind could pass this door; but upon doing this they reached a pellucid fountain. The writer supposes that it is to this c avern of Initiation that Apollonius of Tyana alludes to the letters which h e addr essed to the Brahmins, where he is wont to say, \"No! by the Tantalian water by which you Initiated me into {71} your Mysteries.\" The description of this c avern h as s ome points v ery similar to the Peak cavern in Derbyshire, which Faber supposes was used b y the Druids for like purposes. The late H. P. Blavatsky asserts that every ancient and modern Initiate takes the following oath: \"And I swear to give up my life for the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"salvation of my brothers, which constitute the whole of mankind, if called upon, and t o die in the defence of truth.\" A system of caste initiation does exist amongst the Hindus at this day. Thus a Brahmin youth is first invested with a sacred symbolic c ord worn from the left shoulder to the right hip, which is done at about 8 years of a ge; for a Brahmin the thread is c otton; warriors of flax; traders of wool. As the Parsees are of Aryan race, a similar custom prevails amongst them; the cord in this case goes thrice round the waist. It is three yarns twisted into o ne thread, and three o f such threads knotted into a circle, symbolising \"one in three, and three in one\"; it also signifies these conquests, over speech, thoughts, actions. The Hindu youth is from this time instructed in the Mysteries of the Vedas, and when h e comes of age he is form ally bound in the Goparam to the service of his temple and instructed in the science and higher Mysteries of his religion; it is practically analogous to Christian baptism, and confirm ation. But t he instruction of a Hindu is s ometimes c ompared to a \"nine - storied house,\" and they speak mystically of nine spiritual grades, represented b y nine jewels upon a string, or in the hands of a beggar. A Hindu Mason thus allegorises the practices of a Brahmin: \"With the sacred Word of a Brahmin on h is lips, th e Yogi closes his eyes to the visible creation, that in abstraction h e may erect the symbolic temple, looking heartfully upon h is body as a temple with n ine gates, governed b y three principal officers, supported b y three subordinate agents. The temple of Truth is thus built in the heart, without the sound of metal tool.\" The symbol of a Pranayani Yogi, as an emblem of the prolongation of life beyond the ordinary time, is the 5 p ointed star in a circle, {Symbol: Pentagram in a circle}. {72} Then again there are degrees of Aspirants who are taught by Brahmins of different degrees of learning, and these again by ascetics or Mahatmas of different degrees of spiritual knowledge. The Buddhists of Thibet recognise four degrees of spiritual advancement; and a mongst the Moslem sects of India, Persia, and Turkey, the system is s ometimes of four, and with others of seven degrees. Much of this is s poken mystically and with secrecy, and has its counterparts in the e soteric s ide of Freemasonry. There is a symbol ic doctrine taught by the Brahmins to their disciples in respect t o the construction of their temples, and given orally; their basic symbol is the e quilateral triangle, the first corner r epresents \"birth,\" the next \"death,\" and the apex \"imm ortality;\" t he four walls, floor, etc., are typical of their doctrinal teaching; the e ntrance must be e ither south or west so that the worshipper m ay face e ither the north where the gods are said to reside and whence knowledge comes, or the e ast whence rites and ceremoni es are derived; the body of the temple represents our human body, and the central image, which h as its emblem, much resembling the \"Seals\" of the Rosicrucians, symbolises our own \"jivatma,\" or imm ortal spirit, but the aspects or faces are only explained fu lly to competent Initiates.<<\"Mis. Notes and Queries,\" x, p. 279 .>> This s pecies of instruction h as been equally applied to o ur own cathedrals. There is also supposed to be what we may call an invisible tyler, represented b y a statue. That t he ancient Brahminical system of Initiation was fearfully secret is evidenced b y the \"Agrouchada Parikshai\" or m anual of Hindu caste - initiation, which makes death the penalty of indiscretion. Every initiate of the first class who betrays the secret instruction to me mbers of other castes must have his"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"tongue cut out, and suffer other m utilations. Again, it is s aid that: \"every Initiate, to whatever grade he may belong, who reveals the great sacred form ula must be put to death.\" And, \"any Initiate of the third class who reveals, before the prescribed time, {73} to the Initiates of the second class, the superior truths, must be put to death.\" Blavatsky states that if an aged Brahmin was tired of life he might give his own blood, in place of an animal sacrifice, to the disciple whom he was initiating. Sh e makes no reference to her authority, but the act is probable e nough. We shall allude shortly to the Mysteries of Mythras, Dionysos, and Osiris, as systems practised b y the Aryan race, but it must be borne in mind t hat the Hindus teach that the Persians and Greeks were of the warrior and agricultural caste, who were only allowed p artial instruction in Vedaic learning, but it is possible that they branched from the parent stem before the e stablishment of caste, and ot hers refused caste arrangement. The Maharajahs of India identify themselves with the legislation of Bacchus or Dionysos, whom the Germ an savant, Heeren, believes to be the Parusha - Rama, or incarnated p riest who aided the Brahmins. The basis of the Devana gari character of the Hindus, called the \"Alphabet of the Gods,\" is the square {symbol of a carpenter \u0000 s s quare: a vertical li ne with h orizontal li ne at top from left to apex o nly}, term ed \"the pillar of knowledge e ntwined with the garland of thought.\" B ut besides the Initiatory ceremonies of Brahmins, and warriors, there has existed from r emote times a succession of members of an Art Fraternity, using the investiture of the sacred thread, and with an Initiation of their own intended to embrace all castes . The god whom they recognise is Visvakarm an, the great builder, or Architect of the Universe, and Lord of the Art Fraternity. Mythology says that he crucified his s on S urya (the sun) upon h is lathe, which is esoterically the Jain cross, {Symbol: Swastik a}, or four squares joined at the ends; and the Pagodas of Benares, and Mathura a re built as an equal - limbed cross, as an many others, of which we mentioned some in our last chapter. In a lecture of 1884 Bro. Nobin Chand Bural speaking of the e xisting H indu sect of Visvakarm a says that all description of Artizans observe the last day of the month Bakdra a s a close holiday sacred to Visvakarm a, and will {74} not even touch a tool, and says: \"Mr. Ferguson, the celebrated archaeologist, who is a good author ity on these matters, conn ects the sect with some of the old temples abounding in those parts, and b y reason of these temples bearing Masonic s ymbols and d evices sc ulptured on their walls, competent authorities conn ect the sect with Masonry.\" When Jacol liot, the celebrated French savant and author, was s tudying the antiquities of India, he was inform ed b y the priests of Benares, that, in very remote ages, \"thousands of ages before our era,\" he says, the Artisan caste form ed two divisions the one of which adopted as its mark or sign the plumb - rule, and the other the level. They eventually united into o ne, in order the more e ffectually to resist the confederacy between the two higher castes; and all the great works of remote ages were e xecuted b y this c onf ederacy. As this confederacy is evidently a mixed caste, and as the two higher castes, refused them equal recognition, it seems evident, that these builders were a mixture of Aryans and aborigines, who had their existence as a Fraternity before caste exis ted, and from the e vidence adduced in our last chapter, and the splendour of their labour, a branch of the Cabiric fraternity."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" A remnant of this c onfederacy was recently brought t o light by a very ridiculous mistake of our Government in India by interpr eting \"mystical\" language as \"to the repair of their temple,\" by Yogis, \"literally.\" It is located in Cochin where the \"dynasty\" is of Dravidian origin. They claim, in a pamphlet, equal right t o the sacred cord with the Brahmins, and even dispute their a uthority, claiming that their privileges and special symbolic instructions were conceded b y the Rishis who founded the Brahminical caste Initiation, in those remote ages when h ereditary caste was first established. Whilst the Brahmins use \"nature\" symbols to embody divine truths, they express the e soteric truths of the Vedas by \"art\" symbols, plans, and measurements. (The reader should note this because it is the {75} essential difference between Modern Free Masonry and the church.) All temples and even p rivate houses are e rected according to traditional symbolism, which conveys a secret and esoteric doctrine. An Anglo - Indian Officer who had the duty of inspecting the Guilds at the date of the Mutiny says they have all which Masonry possesses. We have here an Art Society springing out of the old religious Mysteries but becoming by conquest an independent organisation, tolerated for its great services. Such were the Dionysian Artificers of Greece, whence originated the Roman Colleges of Artificers, and we shall assign good reasons for believing that it was this c reation of caste that made Artists into a separate society. Brother C. Purdon Clarke, who has had p ractical experience amongst these Master builders, confirm s the general truth of these claims .<<\"Vide Ars Quat. Cor.,\" vi, p. 99.>> He says that the Hindu carpenters and masons, who are also carvers, constitute a body that claims peculiar privileges of divine origin, which, though often prejudicial to the Brahmins, were usually conceded. To thes e artizans belong 32, or as s ome reckon 64, of the Sh astras of which they are the custodians. At the great temple of Madura, in 1881 , whilst one of these Sh astras were read out, an architect drew from the details the representation of one of their deities . The record seemed b ut a string of meaningless figures resembling a table of logarithms, but when these were marked d own in off - set lines, on both sides of a centre stem, it produced a representation of Vishn u with h is flute, standing upon one leg. He n oticed that the centre stem was divided into 96 p arts, and he further states that t he Pagoda a t Cochin in Travancore has a special room set apart for the temple architect, the walls being decorated with full size figures of temple furniture. All this s eem s to be an advance upon the chequer designs which were used in ancient Egypt. Ram Ras, in h is work upon the building caste, says that jealous of the Brahmins and of trade competitions, they took care to conceal from {76} the rest of the people the sacred volumes which h ave descended to them. The Sh astra on civil architecture says that, \"an architect should b e conversant in all sciences, ever attentive to his v ocations, generous, sincere, and d evoid of enmity or jealousy.\" The late Brother Whymper state s that the key - stone used in erections by the earliest Aryan builders was tau - shaped {symbol: A squared hollow \"T\" composed of two rectangles and shown by outline only} and that the wedge - shaped k ey - stone, though of old d ate, is of a more modern form .<<Ibi d. vi. >> According to the Vastu Sh astra, the ancient Hindu temple consisted of seven courts, as at Srirangam and Mavalipuram, their seven walls referring allegorically to the seven essences of the human temple. In the centre of these courts was a raised seat without any covering. At entrance the worshippers had to undergo purification before a fire, kept burning for that purpose.

The palace of the King of Siam has s even roofs, and he only can occupy the highest stage. If we rely upon the Hindu tradition, as we may, that the Persians and the Greeks were members of the Maharajah caste, coupled with what seems to be historical fact that certain parts of India refused caste laws, we find a reason for the special characteristics of the Mysteries, so far as applies to Brahmin governed countries but not t herefore of general practice. It leads to this conclusi on that in the Rites of Maha - deva we have the Brahmin caste; in the Mythraic, and their equivalents, we have the Maharajah caste; whilst in the followers of Visvakarm an we have the Artizans, and this c ombination tends to prove the contentions of the last n amed, coupled with the e vidence of the priests of Benares, that they were sanctioned when the warriors c ombined with the Brahmins to confine e ach profession in a close fold, and make hewers of wood, and d rawers of water, of an ancient population that they conquered upon advancing into India. We {77} should not expect under the rule of an old patriarchal government to find religion and art divorced, nor a body of Masons, practising a system of religion as a separate organisation. Native Mysteries, which fo llowed the Cabiric s ystem of religion and art in union, would b e rendered subject by caste laws to the Brahmins, and socially reduced to an inferior position, and new bodies would arise on this basis. \"Persia.\" The Magian system, as has already been ob served, was not Persian but proto - Median, and as their civilisation preceded the Aryan it argues strongly that a Mystery of the nature of the Cabiric, which combined Theosophy, Science and Art, was of greater antiquity than a Mystery founded upon caste law s, and that t he latter system simply modified the form er according to the doctrines of their incarnate deity with separate rites s o arranged as to preserve caste distinctions. The pontificate of the Magi, as it had b een received from the first Zaradust, w as the instructor of the Persians, but reform ed in the time of Cyrus by a second Zoroaster, and these Mysteries eventually spread over the world and into several counties of Britain. Art has a similar tradition to India. \"Mythraic Mysteries.\" It is b elieved that the Initiation of Mythras c onsisted of seven degrees. The first degree was \"Soldier of Mythras,\" Porphyry says that the second was that of the \"Lion\" -- Lion of Mythras; then followed the \"Child of the Sun,\" and we find Initiates term ed \"Eagl es,\" and \"Hawks.\" Herodotus asserts that Mythra is Urania; and Ouranos, the Hindu Varuna, was the highest god of Orpheus; Dionysius the Areopagite uses the term , \"the threefold Mythras.\" During the Initiatory ceremony the candidate passed, as is also s aid of the Brahminical, through seven caverns, the last of which was embellished with the signs of the Zodiac. Celsus mentions that there was a great ladder of steps, with gates or portals on each, coloured to represent the seven planets as in the turrets of the tower of Babel, {78} and the walls of Ecbatana, but Faber justly thinks that t his ladder was a pyramid such as Babel itself. The Neophyte underwent 12 trials, the number of the Zodiacal signs, and d uring the reception was offered a crown on the po int of a sword which h e had to refuse, saying: \"Mythras is my crown.\" He was then offered a wreath which h e cast down, saying: \"My crown is in my God.\" Justin Martyr says: \"They take bread"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"and a cup of water in the sacrifice of those that are Initiated a nd p ronounce certain words over it.\"<<Faber i. p. 458 .>> Au gustine: \"The candidate received an engraved stone as a token of admission to the Fraternity.\"<<2 \"John ,\" dis. 7.>> Tertullian: \"Mythras marks the forehead of his s oldiers, celebrates the oblatio n of bread, introduces the image of a resurrection, and under the sword wreathes a crown\"; he also speaks of a baptism and the promise of absolution on the confession of sins.<<\"De Proescriptione,\" c. 40.>> It is s aid that when Maxime the Ephesian Initiat ed the Emperor Julian, he used the following form ula, on baptising him in blood: \"By this blood I wash thee from thy sins. The word of the highest has entered unto thee, and his s pirit henceforth will rest upon thee, \"newly born.\" The newly begotten son of the highest god. Thou art the son of Mythras.\" Bread and wine have been h eld to be the body and b lood of Bacchus, and Mr. St. Chad Boscawen (1900 ) ann ounces that he has just received from Egypt some old Gnostic papyri of the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. in which the names of Jesus, John , and P eter are said to be powerful. Over a cup or chalice these words appear in Greek: \"This is not wine, this is the blood of Osiris,\" and over a piece of bread: \"This is not bread, this is the very body of Osiris.\" It proves that the spirit of the Arcane Schools existed far into Christian times. The European Temples of Mythras were an oblong square reached b y a Pronas on the level, from which a few steps led to the actual temple. On each side of the e ntrance was a human figure, one of which h olds a raised {79} torch, and the other a torch reversed. Benches occupied the two sides, and at the further end was the Altar, and b eyond it a statue of Mythras Tauroticus with the sun at the god \u0000 s left hand, and the moon at h is right hand. M. Caumont in h is magnificent work on the Mythraic Mysteries gives an example of the Mythraic sc ulpture at Chesterholm. It is a bordered triangular structure on which is sc ulptured at the top a small circle, below that an equal - limbed cr oss, over a semi - circle or crescent. Below that a cock, and at the corner a double circle with cross in centre. The god often appears holding a pair of scales. He quotes a text of St. Jerome to prove that the Rite had seven degrees and that the Mystae ( Sacratus) took successively the names of Crow, Occult, Soldier, Persian, Courier of the Sun (Heleodromus), and Father. There are representations of four small loaves marked with the cross, representing no doubt the bread and water which they consecrated. The lion, he says, is an emblem of fire, to which water is inimical. From two o f the passages quoted above it would seem that a simulation of death preceded b aptism, thus making it a symbol of the new birth, and hence it follows that Christian baptism is a version of this mystic rite of the Mysteries. In a report of Ferm ecius Maternus, read b efore Constantine, it was s aid that at the celebration of the festival of the Sun, which took p lace at the same period of time as the Jewish passover, a young ram was s lain. The priests of Mythras offered b read and water to the worshippers whilst whispering, \"Be of good courage, ye initiated in the Mysteries of the redeemed god, for we shall find redemption from our afflictions.\" There are Mythraic monuments whi ch bear close resemblance to the symbolism of the \"Apocalypse.\" In some the god is represented in the act of slaying a bull, and he is c rowned with a tiara on which is s even stars; in others he appears with a torch in each h and, whilst a flaming sword iss ues out of his mouth. Most of the figures of this god have a man on each side of him, one"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"holding a torch {80} flaming upwards, and the other in a reversed p osition. Mr. Ernest de Bunsen compares the offering of bread to the Haoma sacrifices of the undiv ided Aryan family, where the priests offered in a cup a piece of the holy plant and some round flat cakes, or draona, corresponding with the Christian wafers, but mystically alluding to the solar disc, and he further says that these Hota priests c orrespond with the seven soma priests of the Hindus, and that the Avesta has this address for the Mysteries: \"Eat, ye men, this mayazda, ye who are worthy of the same by y our purity and p iety.\"<<\"Mis. Notes and Queries\" (Gould), xii, p. 238 .>> After the revolt o f the Persian tribe against t he Brahmins, the form er converted the Vedaic Ahriman into an evil being, or devil; and named other Vedaic gods as his followers; the Greek Ouranos is the Hindu Varuna a nd Mythras is associated with Ahura, as the Hindu sun - god i s with Varuna. \"Arts.\" The invented arts have their legends. Hushang the son of their first King Kiumers accidentally discovered fire and the blacksmith \u0000 s art, further developed b y Tahumers; then weaving was invented; his s laves the demons taught him letters. The next king was the wise Jemschid, in whose time military accoutrements were fabricated; he built in brick and gave laws, but lost his life at the hands of Zohak, a monstrous usurper of Arabia, but was avenged b y Feridun of the Kainian race, on e of whose sons s lew the other. According to the poet Ferdusi<<\"Sh ah Namah.\">>, who collected the ann als of the Persian Kings c lose upon a thousand years ago, Jemschid erected the Artizans into a class by themselves, under a chief, that we should call G ra nd Master, giving them laws, which Jemschid himself interpreted: -- \"Selecting one from each, the task to guide, By rules of art, himself the rules applied.\" Brother C. P. Clarke inform s us that t he modern Persian Master - builder works out his ideas by a secret method, in {81} w hich a plan is divided into equal chequered squares, of which each square represents either one or four square bricks s uch as are used in Persia. It is a miniature of one which is transferred to the floor of the Master \u0000 s workroom, where the patterns are incised in a plaster of Paris groundwork ready to serve as a \"mould\" from which slabs may be cast.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\", vi, p. 99.>> The system yet form s the floor - cloth of Free Masonry; it is s till i n secret pract ice in Persia a nd agrees with the square designs of old Egypt which served to fix a canon of proportion. The Guild Free Masonry says that Solomon \u0000 s temple had squares of a cubit now represented on their carpet. \"Egypt.\" The worship of Osiris had its c entre at Abydos, and was probably the system of an Aryan colony, even if the first King Menes was not of that race. Kaluka Bhatta mentions an Aryan king named Manu Vena, who was driven out of India a fter a five days \u0000 battle and led his arm y into Egypt. G eorgius Sincellus tells us that in the e arly times of Amenophis an Indian colony imm igrated to Egypt, but t he worship of Osiris is v ery much older than Amenophis. The historian Heeren demonstrates that certain skulls of mumm ies resemble those of Bengalese , though this rather conn ects them with a pre - Aryan race of Indians, and a modern Indian regiment found in the god - ruins of Egypt, the deities of their own country, and P hilostratus s hews that comm ercial intercourse e xisted. There is, however, a perfect r esemblance of priestly governance in Egypt with the laws prescribed b y Manu for the Aryan priests; moreover the social habits, creed, and even minute questions of costume, are"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"resemblances between Egypt and India that cann ot be e xplained away. As in minor so also in questions of religious s acrifice, the cow, bull, and crocodile were sacred animals, but equally the bull was s acrificed, and the doctrine of Metampsychosis was held, all equally by both n ations. Flinders Petrie has sanctioned the belief that K ing Menes is the Mythical Manu of India. {82} \"The Mysteries.\" The Egyptian Mysteries were celebrated in h onour of Isis and Osiris, the form er symbolised b y the Moon, and the latter by the Sun. We have few authentic details, but we know that Isis c or responds with the Grecian Demeter and Latin Ceres, and Osiris with the Grecian Dionysos and Latin Bacchus. Iamblichus s ays that Amen represents the hidden force which brings all things forth to light; he is Ptah when h e accomplishes all things with skill and truth; and Osiris as the good and b eneficent god. Damascius writes: \"Of the first principles the Egyptians s aid nothing, but celebrated it as a darkness beyond all i ntellectual conception, a thrice unknown darkness.\" Jenn ings considers that the Mysti c black and white bann er of the Templars referred to this doctrine. Plutarch inform s us that Isis was apparelled in clothing partly black and p artly white to indicate a notion of the Deity, and that the dead were so clothed to shew that the idea remained with them. Dion Chrysostom says that the ceremonies of the Mysteries were an alternation of light and d arkness. It is s aid that healing of the sick b y sleeping in the temples was an actual fact, aided often by dreams, and was \"not fable as amongst the Gr eeks, but actual fact.\" The Mysteries of Isis required of the candidate a lengthy purification and severe bodily trials. It was a representation of the trials of the soul in the future life, from which lessons for conduct in this life might be drawn. We shall see more of this in comparison with the Greek Mysteries, which were derived from the Egyptian. In the drama of Osiris the legend relates how he was s lain by his brother Typhon, in like mann er as Bacchus was s lain by the Titans, and his body thr own into the Nile. The river carried its burthen to Byblos and d eposited it on a \"tamarind\" t ree, which enclosed it in its growth. Isis travels about lamenting the loss of her husband, as did the Grecian Demeter and Latin Ceres lamenting the loss of her daughter Proserpine, and is at {83} length led to the place where the body rests and which she recovers. After this Typhon seizes again the body, dismembers it, and scatters the pieces over the 26 nomes into which Egypt was divided. The sorrowing Isis no w w anders about to collect the various pieces, and at length recovers all but the generative part, for which a substitute is made. Eventually the son Horus overthrows Typhon, and reigns in the place of Osiris. A curious analogy with Masonry may here be noted: the sacred word of the Hebrews, JHVH, in that language signifies generation; in the Egyptian Mysteries it is the generative organ which is lost and a substitute made; in Masonry it is the word which is lost and a substitute which is given in its pl ace. A level was recently found in the tomb of Semoteus, a King of the 20th dynasty. (Initiation, April, 1903 , p. 39.) In the natural aspect, followed b y Plutarch, the allegory represents tropical heat and the fertilisation of the land b y canals for t he distribution of the Nile, which they represented b y the sun, with a stream of water issuing from the mouth. In the second p lace Osiris is the sun, Isis the moon, Typhon is night, Nepthys twilight. Thus the sun sets in the west pursued b y the moon, los t in"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"the darkness of night, to rise again as Horus in the newborn sun. In another and higher aspect, Osiris and Isis s ymbolise spirit and matter, {Symbol: Venus}, or the two forces. Isis is usually represented as a mother nursing her son Horus, and this simile is used b y Grecian philosophers, who were always less reticent t han the Copt, to symbolise primal matter; thus Oscellus term s it \"mother nurse\"; Plato, \"the reception of all generation as its nurse\"; and Aristotle, \"a mother.\" The \"Au reus\" attribut ed to Herm es makes use of this symbolism to reveal, and yet hide, the alchemical process. The true spiritual import, we must seek in the \"Book of the Dead\", for the \"Books of Herm es\" are lost to us. Brother Malapert professes to find the ceremony of Init iation in the jewels, rituals, and sculpture deposited in the Louvre, certain of which are considered {84} to shew that the approaching candidate, properly prepared, is taken charge of by his guide, and the purifications proceed, in regular order -- until the Neophyte is brought before the hierophant, who is s eated upon h is throne with the scales of justice before him. It is a Mystery of the cross as an emblem of eternal life, equally a Cabiric s ymbol, or still more ancient. The Rev. Mr. C. W. Leadbeate r has s ome very interesting remarks in regard to the ancient sacerdotal initiations, for the priests had their own Initiations to which they alone were admissible. He claims that the cross was the e mblem of the descent into matter, and that, to represent this, the candidate was laid upon a cruciform bier, hollowed to suit the body of the candidate, wearied after a long preliminary ritual. His arm s were loosely bound with cords, and he was then carried from the Hall of initiation into the Crypt, or lower v ault of the temple, and p laced upon a sarcophagus to represent actual burial. He remained thus for three e ntire days, whilst the tests of earth, water, air, and fire were applied to the divorced soul, as a practical experience of invulnerability. On the fourth day of the e ntombment he was brought forth and exposed to the first rays of the rising sun, and restored to natural life. He thus develops the Rubric of the hierophant: \"Then shall the candidate be bound upon a wooden cross, he shall die, he shall be buried, and shall descend into the underworld; after the third d ay he shall be brought back from the dead, and shall be carried up into heaven to be the right hand of him from whom he came, having learned to guide (or r ule) the living and the dead.\" Th ere is a very ancient dirge, called the \"Maneros\", which is s upposed to have been chanted over the Neophyte. There are said to be some ancient mystical MSS . which speak of this trial as \"the hard couches of those who are in travail in the act of giving bi rth to themselves\"; that is \"crucified b efore the sun.\" Plutarch says that \"when a man dies he goes through the same e xperiences as those who have their consciousness increased in the Mysteries. {85} Thus in the term s GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - upsilo n - tau - alpha - nu and GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - iota - sigma - theta - alpha - iota we have an exact correspondence, word to word and fact to fact.\" It seems evident from this, and from other things that we shall mention in our next chapter, that Plutarch is all uding to the actual divorce of soul from the body, related to what may be an allegory which h e recites, under the tale of a man n amed Aridaeus or Thespesius of Soli i n Asia Minor, who apparently died from a fall, and after three days returned to his body, and d etailed his experience of the e xquisite sights which h e beheld.<<\"Theos. rev.,\" xxii, p. 232 . Vide also \"Secret Doctrine,\" ii. p. 359 .>>"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" In the year 1898 an interesting discovery was made of the tomb of Amenophis II. It is entered b y a steep incl ined gallery term inating in a 26ft. well, having passed which the tomb is reached. In the first chamber was found the body of a man bound to a rich boat - like structure, his arm s and feet are tied with cords, and his mouth gagged with a cloth, the breast a nd head have marks of wounds. In the second chamber were found the bodies of a man, woman, and child. The third is the tomb of the king, the roof is s upported b y massive square columns painted d eep b lue and studded with golden stars, the walls covered wi th paintings. At one e nd is the sandstone Sarcophagus, rose coloured, which enclosed the mumm y with chaplets of flowers round the neck and feet. To the right is a small chamber in which other m umm ies of later kings have been placed. The floors of all th e chambers are covered with such articles as s tatues, vases, wooden models of animals, and b oats. The Mysteries of the Latin Bacchus, who is Dionysos in Greece and Assyria, and Osiris in Egypt, are thus s poken of by Macrobius: \"The images or statues of Bacchus, represent him sometimes as a young man, at other times with the beard of a mature man, and lastly with the wrinkles of old age. The differences relate to the sun, a tender child at the winter solstice, such as the Egyptians represent him on a cer tain day, when they bring forth from an obscure nook of their Sanctuary his infantine {86} image, because the sun being then at the shortest, seems to be but a feeble infant gradually g rowing from this moment.\" The learned French writer Christian consid ers that the 22 symbolical designs of the Tarot cards embody the synthesis of the Egyptian Mysteries, and that they form ed the decoration of a double row of 11 p illars through which the candidate for Initiation was led, and that these designs further corre spond with the 22 characters of all primitive alphabets.<<Vide \"The Tarot,\" by Papus.>> Dr. Clarke finds the traditional characters of the ancient Mysteries in our modern pantomime.<<Vol. iv, p. 459 , quoted in Disraeli \u0000 s \"Curiosities of Literature.\">> He says that Harlequin is Mercury; Columbine is Psyche, or Soul; the old man is Charon, the ferryman over Styx; the clown is Momus, and he e ngraves the subject of an ancient vase, which, he says, represents Harlequin, Columbine, and Clown, as we see them on the stage. In further evidence of how such legends s urvive, in n ew dresses, Baring Gould has s hown that the trials of St. George are but a transform ation of the various martyrdoms and resurrections which were related to the weeping worshippers in the temp les of Babylon and Assyria a t the fate of Tamm uz and Adonis; and that the dragon story in the life of St. George is but t hat of other dragon slayers in Semitic and Aryan Mythology. Maimonides mentions the work of Abn Washih as alluding to this. On the ag ricultural classes of the Mysteries there is a curious old Babylonian work translated b y Chwolsohn about 35 years ago. Maimonides, who was physician of Saladin, \"circa\" 1200 A.D., speaks of it as \"full of heathenish foolishn ess . . . preparation of talism ans,\" etc. Its title \"Nabatheans\" is derived from the god Nebo, and the Persian Yezids s ay that the sect went from Busrah to Syria, and that they believe in seven archangels or stars. The book is a difficult esoteric one, by an amanuensis named Qu - tamy, and p recedes the e ra of Nebuchadnezzar. We now come to what is more interesting to Free {87} Masons, and to Geometry which is one of the mystic or esoteric keys of most sacred b ooks.

It is noteworthy that the tomb of the ancient King Osymandius has a ceiling of sta rs upon a blue ground the like of which is found in the Cathedrals of York, Canterbury, and Gloucester, truly there is nothing new under the sun. The tomb of an ancient Egyptian was recently opened b y M. Maspero, and buried with the body were found the wo rking tools of a Mason. Herodotus inform s us that they prohibited b urial in wool for the reason of which h e refers to the rites of Orphic and P ythagoric initiation, thus c onfirm ing their affinity with Egypt. Cleopatra \u0000 s needle was a comparatively modern re - erection by that Queen, at a time when the Roman building fraternities may have influenced Egypt; but at its base was found, when taken down for r emoval to America, various s tones designedly laid in accordance with Masonic Symbolism, and upon a block, i n form of a square, was placed a cube, or Ashlar, also a stone wrought from the purest limestone symbolising purity.<<Vide \"Egyptian Obelisks\" (Weisse).>> In the Osirian temple at Philae, re - erected on the site of a more ancient one, about 300 B.C., are f ound many interesting representations, such as the death and resurrection of Osiris, and also a cube opened out in the form of a Latin cross, with a man \u0000 s head in the upper square. A writer in the Indian \"Freemasons \u0000 Friend\" maintains that the Copts hav e preserved, from their ancestors to the present day, much inform ation upon Masonry which may be gathered from the Hajjar, or stone cutters. He also adds that Masons \u0000 Marks are found upon the stones of buildings, as old even as the \"well\" of the great pyr amid. There was a fine old stone in the possession of Consul John Green on which was the point within a circle, triple {88} tau, sguare, five - pointed star, crux ansata, level, triangle, {symbols: circle with point in center, Royal - Arch triple tau [like a \"T\" striking the cross - bar of an \"H\"], inverted \"L\", Pentagram, Ankh, upright sledge - hamm er shape, triangle with dot in center}. Outside the Rosetta - gate are, or were, some old granite remains and two statues of Isis and Osiris, on the base of each of whi ch, as well as on the many stones around, are found the first, second, and fourth of the characters before - mentioned, {symbols: circle with point in center, triple - tau, Pentagram}. On an old stone of red granite built into the Court - house of Rosetta a mong st those we have mentioned, and others, are the tau, sloping ladder of three steps, trowel, {symbols: \"T\", slanting elongate Roman n umeral III, downward triangle with a handle on top}. At Heliopolis the above marks are found, as well as others of a differ ent character, eye, crook, two concentric demicircles, {symbols: oval on side with two horizontal lines issuing from ends, shape like a vertical li ne with a little \"u\" at top right, open eye with eyelid, shape like a rainbow w ith only two colors}.<<F. M. M ag., 1861 , v, p. 487 .>> Amongst Masons \u0000 Marks of the 12th dynasty, say 3,000 - 2,400 B.C., we find the svastica {symbol: Swastika}, the e qual - limbed cross {+}, both plain and in a circle {Symbol: Circumscribed Greek cross}, our five - pointed star {Symbol: Pe ntagram}, open angles c rossed like square and compasses, delta, letter H, &c., {symbols: +, circumscribed Greek cross, Pentagram, intersecting chevrons upright and inverted like the sigil of Saturn from the Kamia, Fire, \"H\"}.<<\"A.Q.C.\", iii.>> Guild Mason ry tells us that semicircles denote an Arch Guild. \"Greece and Italy.\" The Dionysian and Bacchic rites, through which we may better comprehend the Egyptian, were of two classes. In the first Ceres goes in search of Proserpine to Hades, as did Ishter w hen she sought her lover"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Isdhubar, Duzi, or Tamzi, these rites were in especial of an agricultural nature. In the higher Mysteries the Neophyte represented Bacchus. Plutarch says that Typhon revolted against Osiris, tore his body in pieces, mangled his l imbs, scattered them abroad, and filled the e arth with rage and violence. In like mann er in those of Greece and Italy the rebel Titans tear in pieces the god Bacchus, and as these Titans were Cyclops it appears to mythologise the war of races. As we shal l treat of these Mysteries more fully in our next chapter, we will only add here a few quotations as to their teaching. The Orphic v erses apply these Mysteries to the sun, as known by many names: -- \"The sun, whom m en call Di onysos, is a surname, One Zeus, one Aides, one Helios, one Dionysos.\" {89} The Oracle of Apollo Clarius s ays: \"Much it behoves that t he wise should conceal the unsearchable orgies. But if thy judgment is weak, know that of gods who exist, the highest of all i s Jao . He is Aides in winter; Zeus at the coming of spring - time; Helios in summ er - heat; and in autumn graceful Jao.\" Macrobius s ays that it was an inviolable secret that the sun in the upper hemisphere is c alled Apollo; also that t he ancients perceived a re semblance between the sun and the wolf, f or as flocks disappear at the sight of the latter, so stars disappear before the sun. As the Chaldean techn ique was used in the Cabiric Mysteries, so in these we are said to have a trace of Sanscrit. The words K onx Oumpax, was a form al dismissal, or as we might say, \"go in peace\"; the original is s aid to be identical with the words \"Kanska om Paksha,\" with which the Brahmins c onclude some of their m ore important ceremonies. Le Plongeon finds the e xpression may b e interpreted in Maya language, \"go hence, scatter.\" We e qually find a Theosophical and Art fraternity in the Dionysiacs of Greece, and the Persians were near kindred of the Hellenic Greeks; but according to Herodotus the descent was Egyptian, for he sa ys that the Creek Dionysos and the Latin Bacchus is Osiris, and that t he same rites are practised in both countries, but though they are known to him he is c ompelled to be silent. Yet Dionysos is the Assyrian Dionisia, the Phoenician Melcarth, and the Akk adian Izdhubar. The art of building in flat stone blocks in contradistinction to Cyclopean Masonry is mentioned in our last chapter, and seems to have been adopted about t he period when Egypt colonised the country, and as we know the perfection masonry had reached in Egypt ages before the 16th century B.C., we may reasonably conclude that t hey introduced the improved art, with the Dionysian Mysteries. At any rate we find not only the State Mysteries of Dionysos, but as in other cases mentioned, where ca ste Hellenes or Aryans had invaded the native population, {90} an Art fraternity, under the same name, which above 3,000 years ago was designated the \"Dionysian Artificers,\" and which superseded the style of the Cabiri by an improved system. This body e xecuted all level work in Greece and the Asia Minor at the period, and were an Incorporated Society; there are many inscriptions in reference to them, and their existence is placed b eyond d oubt. Their organisation was identical with the later Roman Colleg es, which again h ave their counterpart in English Guild Free Masonry. They are said to have rebuilt t he temple of Heracles at Tyre. Herodotus s tates that the priests told him that the temple"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"had existed for 2,300 years, and the old author enlarges upon t wo pillars which it contained, the one of gold, the other of emerald, which shone e xceedingly at night, and which may emblemise the two pillars which S anconiathon says were dedicated b y men of the first ages to Fire and Wind. In 1874 a peculiar discover y was made at Pompeii of a table in Mosaic work, which is now in the National Museum of Naples (No. 109 ,998 ). It is about a foot square and fixed in a strong wooden frame. The ground is of a greyish - green stone, in the centre is a human skull i n white, g rey, and b lack. Above the skull i s a level, of coloured wood, the points of brass, and from the top point, by a white thread, is s uspended a plumb - line. Below the skull is a wheel with six spokes, and on the upper r im of the wheel is a butterfly, the win gs being edged with yellow and the e yes blue. Through the protraction of the plumb - line the skull, wings, and wheel, have the appearance of being halved. On the left is an upright spear, the bottom being of iron, and resting on the ground, from this ther e hangs, by a golden cord, a garm ent of scarlet and a purple robe. The symbol of a purple robe is worthy of note, as it corresponds with what Clemens s aid of the Cabiri, as quoted in our last chapter. The Dionysian Mysteries passed into Phoenicia by wa y of Babylon, and thence e ntered Syria in dedication to the {91} god Adonis, from Adonai -- Lord, passing to Persia, Cyprus and Athens; they continued in S yria until the fourth century A.D. As Adonis was the sun who dies to rise again, as in the other Mys teries using other names, so the symbolic representation was c onducted b y acting the death of an individual for whom lamentation was made; Proserpine and Venus c ontend for the body of the handsome god, and the difficulty is settled b y a six months residenc e with each. In the drama the priest, after an interval, signified the resuscitation of the hero by exclaiming: \"thanks be to god for out of pains s alvation is c ome unto us.\" The cries of grief were then changed for hymns and exclamations of joy. It is the ceremony of the weeping for Osiris by Isis, for Tamm uz by Astarte, for Tamzi by Ishter, for Mahadeva by Sita, and that of which we read in the prophet Exekiel where he says: \"behold I saw w omen weeping for Tamm uz.\" The Phrygians, who were a very ancie nt Arm enian colony, had a similar ceremony in h onour of Anach, or Ann och (Enoch), for whom they mourned and rejoiced at the e nd of the old year. The Apamean medals of this race clearly refer to Noah and the Cabiri, and represent t hereon a boat holding eig ht persons, and the word No. This Noachian legend appears to comm ingle the heavenly boat of Hea with the e ight Cabiri, the deluge tradition, and that of Persia, which says that their first king sent out colonies in pairs of all created things. The Cabiri c Mysteries of Phrygia were in h onour of Atys and Cybele, and their priests denominated Corybantes. Professor Louis, a Jew, who lectured recently before the Society of Biblical Archaeology, advanced that t here were Guilds of Artizans and Craftsmen among st his forefathers. This is not surprising when we remember that the exponents of the law made it incumbent upon themselves to follow some handicraft, and the \"Mishn a\" advocates the dignity of labour, in n umerous passages, such as the following: \"He who d erives his livelihood from the labour of his hands is as great as he who fears God.\" {92} In all the countries, mentioned in this c hapter, the religious and Masonic emblems, and the symbols of Initiation that have come down to us are of the same specia l type, in all time. Amongst these may be named, the pentagon,"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the hexagon, the double triangles, the same in a circle and with a central point, the Jain cross of four squares, the e qual - limbed cross, the lengthened cross, and crosses of other form s. At Chunar, near Benares, is found a triangle enclosing a rose. The 49 Hindu caste - marks are carved upon the stones of their ancient fanes; and we have the mystic picture of a god crucified in space. In the case of Gautama Buddha who reform ed the Buddha d octrine, or Jain religion, and sought to abolish caste, we have Masonic allegory in ann ouncing to his disciples that he had obtained final beatitude, and the e xtinction of desire. He compares his body to a house, which the Great Architect will not re - erec t: -- \"Through various transmigrations I must travel, if I do not discover The Buddha that I seek. Painful are repeated transmigrations! I have seen the Great Architect! Thou shalt not build me another house. Thy rafters are broken, Thy roof - timbers sc attered; My mind is detached, I have obtained extinction of desire.\" The more humane worship and morality of the Aryans exercised an all - powerful influence upon the r est of the world. In the time of the e lder Cyrus, or Khai - Khosru the Persian conqueror of Media, the State system was the Median Magism of the first Zaradust of Bactria. This Cyrus was the father of Cyaxarus or Ahashuerus, of Cambyses, and of Bardes. Cy axarus on h is father \u0000 s death succeeded to the moiety of East Persia, and married Esther, or Atossa, so named after Ishter, the goddess who {93} descended into Hades. Cambyses or Lohrasp was a half brother by the daughter of Astyages or Afrasaib King of Me dia, and inh erited the other m oiety; he conquered Egypt about 520 B.C., and having first slain h is brother Bardes, and then destroyed Cyaxarus, married his widow Atossa, and so again united Media a nd P ersia. His s on Cyrus II. favoured the Magi and liberat ed the Jews; he conquered Babylon 518 B.C., and d ied without issue 506 B.C. The way was thus paved for Darius Hystaspes, or the son of Gustasp, of the Achaemenion or Royal race of Persia, had b een Viceroy of Egypt 520 B.C., and who, on the death of the cr azy Cambyses 518 B.C., would seem to have married his widow, in which case she would have been the wife of three kings; and the pretensions of Darius might thus originate, as he was not, by birth, entitled to the throne. There is a legend which says that seven princes entered into a confederacy, and agreed, on their journey, that whosoever \u0000 s horse first neighed, at sight of the rising sun, should be King, and the lot fell to Darius. This prince was everywhere successful, but the contest ended in the destr uction of the Magi, whose growing power had long been offensive to the Persian Mazdeans. An Arm enian of the name of Aracus, and a Babylonian of the name of Nadintabelus, set themselves forth as descendants of the Ancient Kings of Babylon, but were defeate d in the year 493 B.C. Darius records his numerous v ictories in mild language, upon the Behustan rock, and attributes his s uccess to the grace of Orm uzd, in striking contrast to the bloodthirsty and fanatical boastings of the Kings of Assyria, and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"we cann ot doubt t hat when Ezra the Chaldean, re - edited the Jewish Scriptures, they g ained in the direction of humanity by this c ontact with the Aryans. The destruction of the Magi was c omm emorated b y a festival term ed the Magaphonia; eventually, by careful man agement, the brotherhood made their way again to power, and P lato speaks of the system as the most pure of all religious sc hools, and there is no doubt that as Gnostic {94} Christians and Islamites their succession h as descended to o ur own times, and a for m of the Magaphonia may be represented in the Mouharren, and similar festivals in honour of Houssein, or Ali. It would appear that after the successes of Darius his religious v iews as to Mazdeism m ay have undergone some change in favour of the Judeo - Magis m of Media. He was s ucceeded b y his s on Cyaxarus III., or Xerxes, he and Darius his s on were the first and second liberators of the Jews, and hence the originators of the second temple at Jerusalem. In Egypt the Persians were succeeded b y the Greek P to lemies following upon the conquests of Alexander the Great, and these by the Roman Emperors and Consuls. Many sublime e difices were e rected, including the building of Alexandria 332 B.C. The temple of Osiris at Philae was begun about 300 B.C., and b uildi ng operations thereon continued for about two centuries, and here the Mysteries of Osiris were celebrated until l ate into Christian times. James Anderson, in h is \"Constitutions,\" says that Euclid the geometrician, and Straton the philosopher, superintende d the e rection of several great edifices. With the foundation of Alexandria, and the introduction therein of the recondite doctrines of the Greek p hilosophers, which they had gathered b y ransacking the Mysteries of all other nations, Ptolemy I. resolved to make it the seat of occult worship, by establishing there the Mysteries of Serapis, which united with the Egyptian rites of Isis and Osiris the learning of the Greeks. To inaugurate this sc heme he brought from Sinope in Pontus a statue of the god. Th e representations of this deity often accompany him with the three - headed Cerberus, combining a lion, a wolf, and a dog, whilst his body is wound round with a serpent. He typifies Osiris not only as an earthly king, but as a judge of the world of spirits. In the work of Mr. C. W. King, who writes on Gnosticism, is a sard of about the reign of Hadrian, which represents the god as s een by Macrobius, Isis s tanding before him, with h er sistrum in h er hand as if in supplication, whilst {95} in h er other hand i s an ear of wheat: the legend is HE KURR A ISIS AGNE, imm aculate is our Lady Isis. Erastosthenes, who lived 276 - 196 B.C., term s her the Celestial virgin. Other inscriptions referring to Serapis are e qually noteworthy; that on Raspe \u0000 s No. 1490 is -- EIS ZEUS S ER APIS AGION ONOMA SEBAS EOS ANATOLE CHTHO N, translated, The one only Lord Serapis, the holy name, glory, light, the dayspring, the e arth, often abreviated to GR:Sigma - Omega - Sigma. He is also called EIS ZOO S THEOS, the only living God. The \"holy na me\" may be the Arcane I - A - O, which Clemens s ays was worn upon the person by Initiates. Apuleius c omm ents upon these Mysteries but does s o very reticently. He inform s us that he had b een initiated into those of the Great goddess Isis, as representing na ture; and that though ceremonials of Serapis differed therefrom that the doctrine was the same. Damaskios asserts that the god appeared in a visible, but superhuman form , to his worshippers at Alexandria. The Rite, as in other Mysteries, required a nine days \u0000 fast and p urification. Apuleius hints"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"that the priests had other ceremonies, for he states that after Initiation into the Mysteries of Osiris he was made a Pastopheri of the temple and received into the College of Priests, exposing his bald head to the multitude, as a Catholic priest does his tonsure. In the \"Virgin of tke World,\" by Herm es, Isis inform s her son Horus that there was a triple set of Mysteries. (1) \"Initiating them in the arts, sciences, and the benefits of civilised life.\" (2) \"Relig ious representations and sacred Mysteries.\" (3) \"Prophet Initiation, so that t he prophet who lifts his hands to the gods s hould b e instructed in all things.\" Hence it is necessary to keep in mind, both in antiquity and even in later and modern times, art, exoteric rites, and esoteric Initiation. Drumm ond expresses the opinion that the Chartomi, or superior priests of Egypt, alone possessed the full revelation, which they protected b y a triple key of symbolic explanation. Bin Washih {96} says<<\"Descent of Symb. Mas.\" John Amr strong, Liverpool, 1896 .>> that there were four classes of priests of Herm es (1) those of his male descendants, (2) the descendants of his brothers, (3) the descendants of his sisters or Easterns, (4) of the strangers who mingled with the family; and he gives a very interesting account of their alleged ceremonies. The Eleusinian, Serapian, and Mythraic Mysteries were all very popular in Rome, and spread into all countries, practising their rites s ide by side with the aboriginal Myste ries, for the utmost tolerance e xisted amongst all the priests. All are known to have e xisted in Britain, flourishing g enerally until the 4th century of Christianity, and p ractised long after in secret. Besides the State Mysteries, Alexandria became th e centre whence radiated the Mystic sc hools, the Cabala, Gnosticism, Neo - Platonism, and Arcane Christianity. The Emperor Hadrian when Consul reports that there were no bishops of Christ, Chiefs of Synagogues, Theurgists, Diviners, who were not also worshi ppers of Serapis, implying a general recognition of Serapis as the personal G od of the world, and that the living God is the same under m any names. The learned Cardinal H enry Newman asserts that t he Arcane Discipline of the e arly Alexandrian Church was th e introduction of Platonism into Christianity; it was, however, that Platonism form ed b y the union of Greek thought with Egyptian Osirianism in the Mysteries of Serapis. Mr. C. W. King in h is \"Gnostics\" says \"there can be no doubt that the head of Serapis , marked as the face is by a grave and p ensive majesty, supplied the first idea for the conventional portraits of the Saviour.\" It is equally certain that the images of Isis and Horus c ontinued to be manufactured, and were renamed as those of the Virgin a nd Child. Amongst the noted Christians of this period, who were Serapians and Christians or Members of the Arcane Discipline, were Origen and Amm onius Saccus, the catechists; the latter established a School in which he obligated his Disciples {97} to secr ecy.<<Cardinal Newman.>> It is known also that the e arly Christians used the Tau cross on their tombs.<<\"A.Q.C.\", v. p. 2.>> There seems even n o doubt that the pre - Christian Rites had a Mystery of the Cross, and there is s aid to be an ancient painting in Egypt of a candidate laid upon a cruci - form bier. Justin Martyr observes that \"t he sign of the cross is impressed on all nature. There is sc arcely a handicraftsman but uses the figure of it amongst the implements of his industry. It form s a part of man himself, as may be seen when h e e xtends his arm s in prayer.\" And, apart from this, the Spiritual and consolatory faith breathed in the \"Ritual of the Dead\" is so much in consonance with the beliefs of the Christian, that it must convince the most hardene d sceptic of the antiquity of the doctrine, if he e ven discredit"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"them as articles of belief, and confirm s the words of Au gustine that Christianity existed from the beginn ing of the human race, until Christ came in the flesh. It will form a fitting close to this c hapter if we again point out that all ancient buildings c ontain a system of Masons \u0000 Marks which were cut by the Masons to shew by whom the work was done. These are e ither symbols, emblems, or more or less the alphabet prevalent where the work wa s done. Of great antiquity in Egypt they are e qually ancient in India. We find the symbols of these two ancient nations in use in Europe, side by side with Greek numerals, the Magical alphabet and Runic letters. That this c ustom has been h anded down fro m r emote ages to o ur own days as an organised form by which to ascertain the work of each member of an organised and united Fraternity, is one of the strongest arguments that can be used in favour of the e qual antiquity, and faithful transmission of the or ganisation and ceremonies of modern Free Masonry which the reader will gather has s o many points of resemblance to the ancient Mysteries; for there is ample e vidence to shew that the Mark was a part of the acquisition of an accepted Mason {98} for centurie s. But as there were various branches of the Mysteries, there must at one time have been various, varying Rites of Free Masonry. The origin of Tally (Taille -- Fr.) Sticks is v ery ancient and they are yet used occasionally. The Celtic Ogham alphabet h ad a like origin. It consisted of notches c ut at t he corner of a square stone, or else from a stem - line. The letters B, L, F, S, N, are form ed b y cutting strokes at right angles to the stem - line on the right hand, and the letters H, D, T, C, Q, at right angles to the left. Thus a single stroke to the right is B, and to the left is H, two to the right is L, and the same number to the left is D. Three to o ne side is F, three to the other is T. Long strokes numbering from one to five, cutting the stem dia gonally, expressed M, G, Ng, St, R, and short strokes, numbering from one to five, cutting across the stem at right angles give the vowels. The old Runic Staves for Calendars were somewhat similar. Strange symbols were used to mark the several festivals, but the days were indicated b y notches. As Masons \u0000 marks the Runic c haracter is c omm on. (\"Chambers \u0000 Journal,\" 1897 , p. 285 . S. Baring Gould.) The e vidence of this c hapter goes to prove, with what has gone before, that there was a system of Art Myste ries attached to the Sacerdotal Mysteries, and that they only became specifically operative by the introduction of caste laws, by Aryan invaders, and the necessities of the times. {99}   CHAPTER IV. THE MY STER IES IN RE LATION TO PHILOSOPHY. THE chief difficulty in the minds of writers who have written upon the Mysteries and Freemasonry is owing to the varieties of names by which the form er have been known in different nations, and the comparatively modern"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"d esignation of the latter Society. But t his difficulty disappears in a great measure when we recognise that the Rites are of great antiquity, derived from a primitive source, that t hey had all the same general principles and varied chiefly but in the techn icalities and language of the country in which they were celebrated. We may safely admit t hat t he general characteristics of the Mysteries were the same in all nations. Thus in the course of ages, by national divergence in the mode of expressing though t, new names for the old Rites arose, and translations made into new tongues. The Assyrian Dionisu is the Greek Dionysos, the Latin Bacchus, and the Egyptian Osiris. In other cases the Mysteries were known by their place of conferm ent, or by the name of the Hierophant who introduced them. In other cases names v aried according to the particular degree of the writer; thus it is said that Bacchus the Lord of the Cross and the pine - cone, becomes Iacchus in the mouth of an epoptae addressing him as Lord of th e planet. Similarly we learn from Plutarch that Ishter, Demeter, Ceres, and Isis are all one, and represent living matter, or m atter vivified b y spirit, which is a doctrine of the Mystae, or first grade of Initiation. The higher spiritual birth of the tw ice - born is taught in the martyrdom of these gods. {101 } Each n ation, however, gave to the Mysteries a tinge of its own culture, precisely as Osiris, Isis, and Horus, are counterparts of the two deific principles, and created form s, equally with the Christ ian Trinity of Joseph, Mary and Jesus. Pausanius gives the name of Saotus or saviour to the Mystery - god, and he was designated Liberator, and GR:Upsilon - Eta - Sigma. Varron, the most learned of the Latins, in h is treatise \"De Lingun Latina,\" says, iv. p. 17: \"The principal gods are Heaven and Earth. They are the same gods which in Egypt are named Serapis, Isis, and Harpocrates, which with Phoenicians are Thoth and Astarte, the same in Latin as Saturn and Ops (the earth). In effect t he e arth and the heav ens are the sacred instruction of Samothrace, treated as the Great Gods.\" That is they are the active and passive principles of nature, and b elong to the e arlier and less c ultured life of the Greeks. Tertullian says that they raised three altars to the great gods -- that is the male and female principles became three in their progeny -- the oldest of trinities. The ostensible hero o f the Mysteries of Greece was the sun - god, and Martinus Capellus, in h is hymn to the sun written in the fifth century, sa ys: -- \"Thee, the dwellers on the Nile, adore as Serapis, And Memphis worships thee as Osiris. Thou art worshipped as Mithra, Dis, and cruel Typhon; In the sacred rites of Persia thou art Mythras, In Phrygia the beautiful Atys; And Lybia bows down to thee as Amon, Phoenician Byblos as Adonis; Thus the whole world adores thee under different names.\" Au sonius has v erses to the like e ffect, adding Dionysos for India, and Liber for Ital y: -- \"Hail! true image of the gods and thy father \u0000 s face, Thou whose sacred name, surname, and omen,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Three letters that agree with the number 608 .\"<<Vide Pike \u0000 s \"Morals and Dogma,\" p. 587 >> {101 } YHS = 400 + 8 + 200 = 608 . In C haldee and Hebrew, Cham or Ham, heat, is also 608 . Although Cumberland, Bishop of Peterborough, in h is \"Origines Gentium Antiquissmae\" has s et himself the impossible task of deriving all mankind from Noah within the period of the Rabinical chronology, h e has many valuable quotations which tend toe e lucidate the Mysteries. He quotes Herodotus as affirm ing in h is Euterpe, for a known truth, that Ceres or Demeter is also Isis; Clemens Alexandrinus also affirm s it, and p roves it out of a book of Leon, who w rote the history of the Egyptian gods. Diodorus Siculus is c ited b y Eusebius as s aying that Osiris is Dionysus or Bacchus, and that Isis is Demeter or Ceres; Diodorus makes Prometheus the crucified Cabric God to be contemporary with Osiris. Plutarch quot es Anticlides to prove that Osiris is the same person as Dionysus or Bacchus. Prometheus is s aid to be son of Japhetus, or Japhet, and Isis the wife of Osiris his daughter, as is also asserted b y Anticlides. Another son of Japhetus, according to Apollodo rus, was Atlas. Pausanius affirm s the Prometheus and his s on Aetnaus planted the Cabiric Mysteries in Boetia, but that they received this s acred d epositum from Ceres. Much of this is mystical, but it all goes to prove what we began by saying, namely, tha t the Mysteries were all one, and varied only in the language. Herodotus s peaks of the celebration at night, in Egypt, of the sufferings of a god whose name is too sacred to be written. The Phoenician Mysteries, as we learn from Meursius, and P lutarch, exhibited the corpse of a young man strewn with flowers, for whom the women mourned, and for whom a tomb was erected. Macrobius s ays that in the Mysteries of Adonis there was a nine days fast and lamentation which was s ucceeded b y hymns of joy in h onour of the risen god. Ferm ecius inform s us the similar r ites were used in the Mythraic Mysteries. The Chevalier Ramsay affirm s that this is the characteristic of all the Mysteries, and that of their traditional history, {102 } and is a prophesy of the coming of a suffering Messiah, who is s ymbolised b y the sun.<<\"Nat. and Revd. Religion,\" ii, p. 200 .>> According to Herodotus the Mysteries entered Greece from Egypt, and from Greece they entered Italy; and he inform s us in positive language that the Rites of the Egyptian Osiris and Latin Bacchus are the same, and were carried into Greece about 2,000 years before his time (450 B.C.) by Melampus, who either took them direct, or derived them from Cadmus and his Tyrian companions. The system of these which Orpheu s propagated taught a divine trinity in unity, which, according to Damaskios, was represented b y a Dragon with three heads, that of a bull, a lion, and b etween a god with wings of gold; these Rites, if we may rely on tradition, were devoted to music. Dion ysius Halicarnassus s ays that the priests of Serapis c hanted a hymn of seven vowels: the same had p lace in Greece, and there are representations of these seven h eads, over each of which is s een one of the vowels. All the Mysteries had three principal tr ials or baptisms, namely, by water, fire, and air; and there were three specially sacred emblems, the phallus, egg, and serpent, thus represented GR:Iota - Omicron - Phi. The two generative emblems were sacred in all the Mysteries. The advantages gained b y initiation into these Rites are thus s et forth by various writers: They diffuse a spirit of unity and humanity wherever introduced; purify the soul from ignorance and p ollution; secure the peculiar"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"aid of the gods; the means of arriving at the perfection of virtue; the serene happiness of a holy life; the hope of a peaceful death and endless felicity; also a distinguished p lace in the Elysian fields; whilst t hose who have not participated in Initiation shall dwell after death in places of darkness and horr or.<<\"Anacharsis\" (Abbe Barthelemy, who gives the authors). v. p. 213 .>> Porphyry g ives the following as the precepts of the Mysteries: (1) H onour parents; (2) Venerate the Gods; (6) be Humane to animals. Plutarch (Laconic Apothegms {103 } of Lysander) to confess all wicked acts. The pre - Hebrew comm andments term ed the seven precepts of the Noachidae are: (1) Abstain from Idolatry; (2) Blaspheme not; (3) D o no murder; (4) Comm it not Adultery; (5) D o not steal; (6) Administer justice; (7) Eat not flesh cu t from the live animal. The Rites of Eleusis in Greece are those of which we have the fullest particulars, and we shall therefore take them as the complement of all the others, and give as much as c an be gathered from prejudiced and unprejudiced sources , poets, philosophers, and their bitter enemies the Christians. The Rite is s aid to have followed the Orphic doctrine, and to have been established about 1423 B.C., in the reign of Erectheus King of Athens, which city had previously been occupied b y a col ony from Egypt. Though best known, yet not the most ancient, the Eleusinia would seem to have constituted rather a democratic s ociety than a Sacerdotal College, as if their intention was to absorb all the popularity of these institutions; to be followed, at a later period, by the appropriation, by minor schools of Philosophers, of all the knowledge to be gained in these Colleges. It is, however, noteworthy that the tradition of the ancient unity of King and P riest was preserved in the title of Basileus or King given to the Presiding officer; and Lysias s ays that it was his duty to o ffer up prayers, and to preserve morality. These Mysteries were at t he same time essentially secret and sacred, embodying a scenic representation, in which all classes might pa rticipate e xcept bastards and slaves, who were e specially excluded b y the action of Euclid, the Archon, or chief, in 402 B.C., and a different person from the later Geometrician. It is worthy of note that the old Constitutional Charges of Free Masons excl ude the same persons. Although the Cabiric Mysteries, like those of Egypt, preserved, at least in name, an idea of the worldly sciences, the Eleusinia would seem to have abandoned the pretensions to these, and only required that t he Neophyte should {104 } in youth be liberally and appropriately educated. The time had arrived when art in Greece could b e learned outside the Mysteries which constituted a holy drama, influencing the ancient t heatre, and the \"Mystery plays\" of Christians. Mr. James Christie in h is work upon the \"Greek Vases\" holds that phantasmal scenes in the Mysteries were shewn by transparencies, such as are yet used b y the Chinese, Javanese, and Hindus. In symbol, he says, a ball of wool represents the thread of life not yet spun; gutta, fecundity; sesame, fertility; water, the creation of beings from that element; wine, the life; an olive leaf at the top of a vase, spirit; and a wavy line, water on which spirit acts. There were Nine Archons, of whom the Chief was properly so called as the word means Comm ander, he had jurisdiction over all ecclesiastical and civil affairs, with the title of Eponymus. The second was Basileus or King, who superintended religious c eremonies, festivals, and Mysteries. The third was the Polemarchos, who ha d care of strangers and conduct of war. The other six"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"were term ed Thesmothetae, from two words -- \"law,\" and \"I establish\" t hey form ed a tribunal for judging minor offences. All were e lected b y lot, were free of taxes, and on their Induction took an oath to administer justice impartially. Certain n oted p ersons, of whom Pythagoras was one of the e arliest and most remarkable, travelled over the whole known world, in order to o btain Initiation in the Mysteries of the countries that he visited. The societ y which Pythagoras established, as well as others of later date, was the result of an attempt t o combine in one comm on society the knowledge to be gained in all the Mysteries; curiously enough the same principle has been followed in Freemasonry. The Pytha gorean S ociety may thus be considered the forerunn er of the various Arcane Schools which followed its decay; it has the closest analogy with the Masonic Society, and whether we look upon this Craft as a primitive system, an ancient imitation of the Mysteri es, or a slightly altered branch of the Cabiri, we may {105 } equally expect to find that there is the same doctrine, or the same wisdom r eligion which lay at the foundation of all the Arcane Mysteries; and this is what we shall find as we proceed; and at t he same time it is one of the strongest proofs we can expect t o have of the antiquity of Free - masonry. We will now enquire into the general nature of the ceremonial of the Eleusinia a s a fair r epresentation of what was taught in these schools. They con sisted of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries for which there was a general preparation or apprenticeship in the shape of \"a preparation from youth in appropriate disciplines.\" Between the conferm ent of these two sections there was a probation extending from one to five years. The drama went on parallel lines with the Egyptian \"Ritual of the Dead,\" which dwells upon the moral and spiritual qualities, which are necessary in this life, that the soul may obtain justification in a future state. The apocryphal b ook called the \"Wisdom of Solomon\" (c. 17) would seem to describe the Tartarean terrors of the Mysteries, applied to the plagues of Egypt. The magnificent temple of Eleusis was lighted b y a single window in the roof, and images of the sun, moon, and mer cury were represented therein. Macrobius s ays that t he temple of Bacchus at Thrace was also round and lighted also by a round window in the roof, by which to introduce the resplendent image of the sun. Proclus s ays that the proceedings were begun with a prayer in which \"heaven\" and \"earth\" were respectively invoked. In respect t o the signs of the Zodiac the same writer inform s us that six were considered male, and six female signs; and P orphyry assimilates the journey of the sun through these signs with the twelve labours of Hercules. The three chief hierophants of the Mysteries bore respectively the symbols of the sun, moon, and mercury; and as the Basileus represented the Demiurgos who fashions rude matter or chaos into created form s, so it was typifie d that the Basileus was to recreate the Neophyte or draw him {106 } from imperfect nature to a more refined state, or as Masons equally would say, with the philosophers, work him from the rough to the perfect Ashlar. The Stolistes, according to Clemens Ale xandrinus regulated the e ducation of the young, and b ore as their emblem of authority the square rule; and the prophet had suspended at the neck an urn with the water of regeneration.<<Oli ver \u0000 s \"Landmarks,\" i. p. 161 .>> The ceremonial of Initiation bega n by a solemn proclamation<<\"Origen Adv Celsus,\" iii. p. 59.>>: \"Let no o ne e nter here whose hands are not clean, and whose tongue is not prudent.\""},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" The candidate was also, as a preliminary, desired to confess his s ins, or at least the greatest crime he had ever comm itted. He was required to bathe in the pure sea in face of the sun, and p our water on h is head three times. Certain fasts were e njoined, after which the sacrifice of an animal was made. After two days the shows began with a procession, then followed for three days and three nights the mourning of Demeter for her daughter. After which a sacramental meal of cakes and liquor was partaken. Prior to the Initiation there was an opening catechism as follows: -- The Hierophant demands: \"Who a re fit to be present at this c eremony?\" To which the answer was: \"Honest, good, and holy men.\" The Hierophant then ordered: \"Holy things for holy persons.\" The Herald p roclaimed: \"Far hence the profane, the impious, all those polluted b y sin.\" Fo r an uninitiated p erson to remain after this was death. Stobaeus quotes an ancient writer who says, that the first stage of Initiation \"is a rude and fearful march through n ight and d arkness,\" but this over, \"a divine light displays itself, and shining plains and flowery meads open on all hands before them. There they are e ntertained with h ymns and d ances, with the sublime doctrines of faithful knowledge, and with revered and holy visions.\" {107 } The first portion was emblematical of the wanderings of the soul in the paths of error and the punishments it would thereby bring upon itself; and the second p art represented the dispersion of the shades of night, before the brilliant sun of the Mysteries. Justin Martyr gives the oath of Initiation as follow s: -- \"So help me heaven, the work of God who is great and wise; so help me the Word of the Father which h e spake when h e e stablished the whole universe in h is wisdom.\" Dion Chrysostom speaks of Mystic s ounds and alternations of light and d arkness, and th e perform ance of Mystic dances in imitation of the movements of the planets round the sun. Plato in \"Euthydemus\" speaks of Mystic dances in the Corybantic (or Cabiric) Mysteries where the cradle of the young Bacchus was guarded with Mystic dance and music . The following remarks of a Naasene, or Ophite Gnostic, on these Mysteries are given by Hippolytus, Martyr 235 A.D., and confirm s other quotations we shall give from Virgil. He says that: \"The Lesser Mysteries are those of Proserpine below and the pat h which leads to them is wide and spacious to conduct those who are perishing.\" It is the truth which Chrishn a the Hindu god taught t o Arjuna, namely that those who give themselves up to worldly pleasures will be confined to the sphere of the e arth and b e reborn in such bodies as they have merited: \"It is easier for a camel to go through the e ye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven\"; \"Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat; but straight i s the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth to life, and few there be that find it.\" Apuleius in h is account of his reception into the Isisic Mysteries, after being relieved of his brutish n ature by eating roses, which was a flower sacred to Isis, proc eeds to say that he approached the confines of Hades, having been borne through the e lements, and that he saw the sun at midnight. The Latin Virgil, a poet, Platonist, astrologer, and {108 } Geometrician, has some noteworthy passages which bear upon thes e details. Priam of Troy sent away his s on Polydorus into Thrace, with a large treasure, and in order to obtain this his attendants murdered him. Aeneas, a Trojan Initiate and therefore a Cabir, happening, on reaching that part, to pull up a myrtle growi ng"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"upon a hillock, discovered b y the lamentations, which the plant is represented as magically making, the murdered b ody of Polydorus, upon which h is remains are taken up and d ecently interred. The myrtle was a plant sacred in the Mysteries, and Virgil he re speaks of the \"secret rites of Cybele, mother of the gods\"; and Cybele was the name for Ceres amongst the Phrygian Cabiri. Again when Queen Dido resorts to Magical arts to detain Aeneas from sailing: (Book iv.) \"A leavened cake in h er devoted hands Sh e holds, and next the highest altar stands; One tender foot was s hod, the other bare, Girt was her gathered gown, and loose her hair.\" A maxim of Pythagoras was: \"Sacrifice and adore unshod.\" Ovid d escribes Medea a s hav ing arm s, breast, and k nees made bare; and Roman Postulants for r eligious and p olitical offices, assumed an air of humility, with cloak and tunic ungirt, arm and b reast bare, and feet slipshod. The \"toga candida\" is yet used in Masonry. Another quotati on from Pythagoras is this: \"The path of vice and virtue resembles the letter \"Y\"; from the e xcellence of the sentiment it was term ed the \"Golden Branch,\" of which the broad, left - hand line, symbolised the e asy road to Tartarus, whilst t he narrow right lin e represented the path to Elysium. Decius Magnus Au sonius, a poet of the fourth century says: \"The Bough represents the dubious Y, or two paths of Pythagoras.\" The sacred b ranch of the Mysteries v aried in the different rites: the e rica or heath was s acre d to Osiris, the rose to Isis, the ivy to Dionysos, the myrtle to Ceres, the lettuce to Adonis, the lotus to Hindus, the mistletoe to Druids, the acacia to Jews, the palm to Christians. {109 } Turn we now to Virgil \u0000 s interesting book, which contains the account of the descent of Aeneas into Tartarus, and which undoubtedly embodies the drama of the Eleusinian representation of Hades and Elysium. A Sybil, or prophetess, requires for the purpose to be undertaken, that Aeneas s hall seek a Golden Branch whi ch shoots from a small tree. It is the mistletoe of the Druids who were of this sc hool, and styled the plant \"pren\" \"puraur\" or the tree of pure gold: it could only be cut by a pure, white - robed Druid with bare feet, and b y using a golden sickle, it proba bly form ed a part of the \"brew of Ceridwen,\" which was given to the Initiate to aid the gift of intuition; the Aryo - Celts were then in Italy. This Golden Branch was to serve Aeneas as a passport, but as the Sybil i nform s him of the death of a friend, a fa ct unknown to him, the body has first t o be found; this done we have Lamentations: -- \"With groans and cries Misenius they deplore, Old Coryanus c ompassed \"thrice\" the crew, And d ipped an \"olive branch\" in h oly dew, Whic h thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud Invoked the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.\" "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" Virgil is c areful to inform us that these were ancient Rites to the manes of the dead, and \"Ancient,\" or York, Masons of the last century, and even some in our day, used these Rites. Aeneas now follows the Sybil to Tartarus, and Virgil describes the fearful scenes he witnessed b y way of punishments inflicted upon those who left this life in an impure state. Arrived at the double path of the Branch : \"Before our further way the fates allow, Here must we fix o n h igh the Golden - bough.\" and: \"These holy rites perform ed, they took their way, Where long extended p lains of pleasure lay.\" He now reaches the Elysian f ields, where he finds his father Anchises, who proceeds to instruct him in divine things, with prophetic intimations as to his future. {110 } Such was the nature of the Lesser Mysteries; the Greater were intended to shew the felicity of the soul, when pu rified from m ortal passions, it was reborn to the realities of its s piritual nature. They are again an exemplification of the further teaching of Crishn a to Arjuna, that he who worships good angels will go amongst t hem, but t hat he, who in thought and d ee d, joins himself to the Supreme Deity will enjoy an eternity of happiness: \"Thou must be born again.\" An Initiate to the Lesser Mysteries, or those of Ceres, had his place in the Vestibule of the Temple, beyond the sacred curtain was reserved for Initiate s into the Greater Mysteries or those of Bacchus. Preparation for the Greater Mysteries required a nine days \u0000 fast and b athing in the river Ilyssus took p lace. The Mystic mundane e gg of the Egyptians was a part of the symbolism, f or Macrobius s ays: \"Co nsult t he Initiates of the Mysteries of Bacchus who honour with especial veneration the sacred egg.\" Seneca defines Bacchus as the universal li fe that supports nature. We have mentioned the Druid egg. Brother George Oli ver, D.D., quotes the Orphic fragm ents as follows: -- \"In these Mysteries after the people had for a long time bewailed the loss of a particular person, he was at length supposed to be restored to life; upon this the priests used to address the people in these memorable words: \u0000 Comfort you rselves all ye who have been partakers of the Mystery of the deity thus preserved; for we shall now enjoy some respite from our labours. \u0000 To these were added the following remarkable words: \u0000 I have escaped a great calamity and my lot is greatly mended. \u0000 \" Julius Ferm ecius gives this in the lines following: -- \"Courage, ye Mystae; lo! our god is s afe, And all our troubles s peedily have e nd.\" But the same writer inform s us that the Initiate \"personated the God,\" for he says: \"In the solemn celebrations of the Mysteries all things had to be done which the youth either did, or suffered in h is death.\" The remarks of Hippolytus from the source previously mentioned, are more {111 } curious, as"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"they seem to proceed from an Initiate who is c omparin g the ceremony with the Christian Mysteries. The Naasene Gnostic is made to say: -- \"Those who are Initiated into the Lesser ought to pause and b e admitted into the Greater and heavenly ones. Into these no unclean person shall enter. . . . . For this is the Virgin who carries in h er womb, and conceives, and b rings forth a son, not animal, not corporeal, but blessed for everm ore.\" This Initiate, in the agricultural symbolism of Ceres, represents \"an ear of corn reaped in silence.\" The re - birth of the Neophyte was represented p antomimically, for he says that the hierophant vociferates: \"by night in Eleusis beneath a huge fire . . . . \u0000 Au gust Brimo hath brought forth a consecrated son Brimus, \u0000 \" words which n o doubt t ypified b oth the sun and the initiate. The word Brimus s ignifies Powerful and was one of the designations of the Cabiric gods. Yet after all the Lesser and Greater Mysteries were rather a popular version than a full revelation, we have hinted that there were three - fold interpretations of t he Mysteries and what almost approached real death and not drama. Others existed of a more spiritual nature at various c entres. Sopatius s ays that even the Epoptae had only a part of the secret. Theodoritos s ays that \"all do not know w hat t he hierophant s know, the majority \u0000 see only what is represented. \u0000 \" \" The last term of the Epoptae\" expressed high initiation. It may aid us to recall that t hese Mystics held all nature to emanate from two principles, of which Persephone and Dionysos, or Ceres and Bacc hus, are the allegory. The first is s oul, the second spirit. Lactantius,<<\"Divine Institutions,\" vii.>> says: -- \"Sh ould anyone dare to deny the e xistence of souls after death, the Magician will soon convince him by making it appear.\" Irenaeus, Clemens, Tertullian, St. Cyprian, all affirm the same thing. The Mysteries knew equally well with the Christians, that if the purified soul remained attached {112 } to spiritual things it would eventually purify itself, as the Alchemist purifies metals, and so att ain imm ortal life. We learn from various writers that the Mysteries had their secret signs of recognition. Apuleius mentions in h is \"Metamorphosis\" that it was pointed out to him \"in a dream\" that he would recognise a certain priest by his walking as i f with a lame ankle; in the \"Apologia\" we read: -- \"If anyone happens to be present who has been initiated into the same Rites as myself, if he will give me the sign, he shall then be at liberty to hear what it is that I keep with so much care.\" Plautus<< \"Miles Gloriosus,\" iv, 3>> has -- \"Give me the sign if you are one of the Bacchae.\" Iamblichus writes -- \"Give not your right hand easily (that is, draw not towards you improper and uninitiated p ersons by g iving them your right hand), for to such as have not been tried b y repeated d isciplines and doctrines, and have not proved themselves to participate in the Mysteries, by a quinquenn ial silence and other trials, the right hand ought not to be given.\" Homer m akes Achilles to greet Priam thus -- \"The old m an \u0000 s right hand at the wrist he grasped, lest he should b e alarm ed in mind.\" Proclus advanced further and taught that there were Mystic passwords that could carry a person from one order of spiritual beings to another still higher, till reaching the abs olutely divine. The Egyptians<<\"Book of the Dead.\">> and Gnostics held the same view. Origen<<\"Contra Celsus.\">> says: \"There are names of a natural virtue, such as those used b y the wise - men in Egypt, the Magi in Persia, and the Brachmans in India. Mag ic, as it is c alled, is no vain and chimerical art as the Stoics and Epicurians pretend; neither were the names of Sabaoth and Adonai, made for created b eings, but appertain to a"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"mysterious theology concerning the Creator; hence comes the virtue of other n ames, when placed in order, and p ronounced according to the rules.\" The doctrine taught in regard to the nature of the soul in these Mysteries may be gathered from the Philosophers, but first we will see how they acquired the right to speak {113 } upon t he subject. The Chevalier Ramsay<<\"Nat. and Revd. Religion.\">> says that: \"we may look upon the Pythagoric, the Platonic, and the Orphic theology as the same.\" Proklos, who was master of the School at Athens about 450 A.D., in h is \"Theology of Plato\" say s that: \"Pythagoras was first taught the orgies of the gods by Aglophemus; Plato next received a perfect knowledge of them from the Pythagorean and Orphic sc hools.\" The last named Rites were those upon which the Eleusinia were e stablished. Proklos, in sp eaking of matter says, \"Plato was also o f the same opinion concerning matter because he is s upposed to have followed Herm es and the Egyptian philosophers.\" The philosophical schools, which followed the death of Plato, almost universally accepted him as th eir m aster, and he and P ythagoras had like veneration for the Chaldean and Magian teaching, and Amm anius Marcellenus<<xxviii, 6.>> teaches us that: \"Platon, the greatest authority upon ancient doctrines, states that t he Magian religion or Magia, known by t he mystic name of MACH - AGISTIA, is the most uncorrupted form of worship in things divine, to the philosophy of which, in primitive times, Zoroastres made many additions, drawn from the Mysteries of the Chaldeans.\" The Emperor Julian<<\"Oratio.\" >> seems to have been of a similar opinion and says: \"Were I to touch upon the initiations and the secret Mysteries which the Chaldeans Bacchised respecting the seven rayed god, lighting up the soul through h im, I should say things unknown to the rabble, very unknown , but well known to the blessed Theurgists.\" We have, however, given such matters v ery fully in our previous c hapters; the Egyptian Initiation of Plato is s pecially affirm ed b y several writers; and we may add here that the more closely philosophy approa ches Cabiric rites, the more does it resemble Free Masonry. There was, however, a refinement of the coarser part of the dramatic. \"Aphanism\" and \"Euresis\" -- the \"concealment and the finding of the slain god\" -- thus applied, in what follows. {114 } As to the nature of the recondite teaching of the Arcane Mysteries we will now quote various writers who have given us hints upon their doctrine. Plutarch says: \"As to what thou hearest others s ay, who persuade the many that the soul, when once freed from the body, neither suffers . . . . evil, nor is conscious, I know that thou art better grounded in the doctrines received b y us from our ancestors, and in the sacred orgies of Dionysos, than to believe them, for the Mystic s ymbols are well known to us who belong to the Brotherhood.\" Antoninus s ays: \"Soul is all intelligence and a portion of the divinity.\" Proklos: \"Know the divinity that is in you, that you may know, the divine One, of whom the soul is a ray.\" Heraclitus s ays of souls: \"We live their dea th and d ie their life.\" That extraordinary man Apollonius of Tyana, who visited the Indians, entered the Mysteries of various nations, and reform ed the Greeks, taught that both birth and d eath were e qually an appearance, the first being the confinement of the \"Real\" in matter, and the second its release. Plotinus, who was a pupil of Amm onius Saccus, says: \"for to be plunged into matter is to descend into Hades and there fall asleep,\" and of the doctrine itself he tells us that it is \"what is taught in the Mysteries, and that liberation from the bonds of"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the body is an ascent from the cavern, and a progression to the intellectual.\" Macrobius<<\"Dream of Scipio.\">> says that t he first death is when the soul falls into the body \"as a sepulchre,\" and that \"t he second is the natural death.\"<<A translation by Brother W. W. Westcott has been recently printed.>> Plato in h is \"Hippias\" says: \"The supreme Beauty consists in their resemblance to the divine sun, or light of all i ntelligence\"; he also refers to Orpheus as term ing our natural body GR:Sigma - iota - upsilon - mu - alpha (soma) or GR:Sigma - gamm a - mu - alpha (sema), a sepulchre. Hierocles quotes the Chaldeans to the e ffect that, \"the oracles c alled the e therial body, the thin and subtle vehicle or chariot of the soul ,\" Suidas tells us, out of Isidorus, a Spanish bishop of the sixth century, what is interesting to {115 } old Masons, especially as Isidore is quoted b y the author of our old MSS . Constitutions c alled the \"Cooke MS.,\" that, \"according to some philosophers, the soul has a luminous vehicle, called \"star - like,\" \"sun - like,\" and imm ortal, which luciform body is s hut up in this terrestrial (body) as light is in a dark lantern.\" Moderns would generally use the term s s oul - body, and spirit, but Plato designates the form er a \"winged chariot.\" Here the reader m ay be reminded that a lantern in form of a five - pointed starlight, was form erly used b y Masons, in the most solemn part of their ceremonies. There are portions of the \"Divine Poemander\" t hat must allude to Mys tery - rites: \"Hast thou not heard in the speeches, that from one soul of the universe are all those souls, which in all the world are tossed up and d own and severally divided? Of these souls there are many changes, some into a more fortunate e state and som e quite contrary; for they which are of creeping things are changed into those of watery things, living upon the land; and those of things living in the water to those of things living upon the land; and airy ones are changed into men; and human souls that lay hold of imm ortality are changed into daemons.\"<<\"The Key,\" iv, 23.>> \"The like also happeneth to them that go o ut of the body; for when the soul runs back into itself the spirit is c ontracted into the blood, and the soul into the spirit, but the mind being made pure and free from these cloathings, and b eing divine by nature, taking a fiery body rangeth abroad in every place, leaving the soul to judgment, and to the punishment it hath deserved.\"<<\"Ibid,\" 56.>> Again, in the drama of the Mysteries: \"Do st thou not see how many evils the wicked soul suffereth, roaring and crying out, \u0000 I am burned, I am consumed, I know not what to say or do, I am devoured unh appy wretch, of the e vils that compass and lay hold upon me, miserable that I am I neither see nor hear anything. \u0000 \"<<Ibid, 70. (Reprints by R. H. Fryar, Bath, also by Dr. W. W. Westcott.)>> It necessarily follows that t o be e ntombed symbolically {116 } and raised therefrom, as was done in these Mysteries, was emblematically, if not actually, to be sp iritualised or exalted out of the body. Coupled with this recondite teaching as regards the soul was the theory of RE MINISCENC E. According to this mystic doctrine which was advocated b y Plato, Origen, and some of the early Christian Bishops, as Synesius, all souls have pre - existence and have descended from the spiritual world into the e arthly prison of the body, but some souls are more divinely advanced than others. Reminiscence is therefore that faculty of knowledge which the soul brings from its heaven ly source, never entirely obscured, and when its faculties are stimulated, by discipline and a pious abandonment of the passions, is the cause of all civilising influences and discoveries. More than this, but we have said all that is necessary. Socrates,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"at his trial by the Areopagus at Athens, and to the hour of his death by hemlock, asserted the guidance of his Daemon, or tutelary spirit, and has the following placed to his c redit by Plato in h is \"Republic:\" -- \"The e ye of the soul, which is blinded and buried b y other studies, is alone naturally adapted to be resuscitated and excited b y the mathematical disciplines.\" It is a repetition of the apothegm of the Persian Dervishes: \"The \u0000 man \u0000 must die that the \u0000 saint \u0000 may be born\"; it is the divinely illumi nated eye of the Cabirian Cyclops, and the awakening or resuscitation of the consciousness of the divine image, implanted in the human soul. As to the necessary Apprenticeship for even the Lesser Mysteries, we have some inform ation in the writings of Th eon of Smyrna, who was a disciple of Euclid, and an editor of his books. Theon is c omparing the five liberal sciences as necessary for a mystically initiated p hilosopher with the five preparations for the Mysteries: -- \"Again it may be said that Philos ophy is the Initiation into, and tradition of, real and true Mysteries; but of Initiation there are five parts. That which h as the precedency indeed, and is the first, is Purification. For the {117 } Mysteries are not imparted to all who are willing to be initiated, but some persons are excluded b y the voice of the Crier, such as those whose hands are not pure, and whose speech is inarticulate. It is also necessary that those who are not excluded from initiation should first undergo a certain purification ; but t he second thing, after purification, is the \"Tradition\" of the Mysteries. The third thing is denominated \"Inspection.\" And the fourth which is the e nd of inspection, is binding the head and p lacing on it \"Crowns;\" so that he who is initiated is no w able to deliver to o thers the Mysteries which h e has received; whether it be the Mysteries of a Torchbearer, or the Interpreter of the sacred ceremonies, or of some other Priesthood. But the fifth thing which results from these is the \"Felicity\" arising from being dear to the divinity and the associate of the gods. Conform ably to these things likewise is the tradition of the political doctrines, and in the first place a certain purification is requisite, such as the e xercise from youth in appropriate di sciplines, for Empedocles s ays, \u0000 it is necessary to be purified from defilements by drawing from five fountains in a vessel of unmingled b rass. \u0000 But Platon says, \u0000 that purification is to be derived from five disciplines, namely, Arithmetic, Geometry, Ster eometry, Music, and Astronomy. \u0000 The tradition, however, by philosophical, logical, political, and physical theories is s imilar to Initiation. But Platon denominates the occupation about intelligibles -- true beings; and ideas Epopteia or inspection; and t he ability from what has been learned of leading others to the same theory must be considered analogous to binding the head, and b eing crowned; but the fifth, and most perfect thing, is the felicity produced from these, and, according to Platon, an assimil ation as much as possible to God.\" So far Theon, and his essay is a most important comparison between the relative value of philosophy and the Mysteries; it might be worth while to ask ourselves, whether these \"five\" parts of Initiation, f ive sciences, and five fountains, have any relation to the mystic pentagon, {118 } {Symbol: Pentagram} and the Masonic five points of Fellowship, in the ancient aspect; for in these old times the Liberal arts and sciences were not seven, but five. We are inform ed b y Dio dorus that the Egyptians had an especial veneration for the number five, as they considered it t o represent t he Universe, because there were five e lements -- earth, water, air, fire, and ether or spirit; and it is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"noteworthy that it was by these e lements t hat the worthiness of the Neophyte was tested b efore Initiation. It is related that when the e minent Christian, Justin Martyr, applied for Initiation into the Society of Pythagoras, he was asked whether he had studied arithmetic, music, astronomy, and geo metry, as these alone were capable of abstracting the soul from sensibles, and p reparing it for intelligibles: as he could not reply affirm atively he was refused admission.<<Oli ver \u0000 s \"Pythagorean Triangle.\" (John Hogg. London.>> We see from these e xtra cts that t he requirement of the Liberal arts and sciences were comm on to Theosophy and P hilosophy, as they were of old to Freemasonry, and is a proof, to be added to many others, that these three had one, and the same origin, and were rites of the same Fel lowship. Discipline was made to precede Initiation into the Mysteries in the same way that Freemasonry, having abandoned the teaching of the arts, and especially Geometry, now requires a certain amount of education from its c andidates. The Lesser Mysteri es were intended to teach the sciences which the Art Mysteries transmitted. The Greater Mysteries were e ssentially spiritual, embracing man \u0000 s origin, rebirth or regeneration, and his final felicity, and this passed to Gnostics, Mystics, the Church, and th e later Rosicrucians. In explanation of the term s Inspection, and Seeing, Epoptae, which are frequently used b y writers who comm ent upon the Mysteries, we will give some quotations to shew that the claim was actual and not metaphorical. Though not nece ssary to o ur subject, we may say, that Iamblichus in h is letter upon the Mysteries, has left us in {119 } no doubt as to the significance of Epopteia or Inspection, and Au topsia or Seeing, for he repeats, over and over again in unmistakable language, paragr aph after paragraph, the fact of the visible presence of superm undane beings at t he celebration of the Theurgic rites.<<\"On the Mysteries,\" par. ii, sec. iii to ix.>> These particulars, were it necessary, are too long for insertion h ere, but he proceeds t o define with care, the appearance, functions, qualities and the good effects of beholding the gods, defining archangels, angels, daemons or tutelary spirits, potentates or demi - gods, hero - gods, and souls, with all the authority of one who had b eheld and s tudied all their qualities. The means taken by these Philosophers for inducing the development of seership, was s trict chastity and p urity of life, accompanied by strict dietary, with fasts and p rayer; principles adopted in all the sacerdotal Mysteries fo r superior Initiation. The following is recorded b y Damaskios as to the appearance of the god in the Mysteries of Serapis: \"In a manifestation which must not be revealed, there is s een on the walls of the temple a mass of light which appears at first at a very g reat distance. It is transform ed, whilst unfolding itself, into a visage e vidently divine and supernatural, by an aspect severe but with a touch of sweetness. Following the teachings of a mysterious religion, the Alexandrians honour it as Osiris o r Adonis.\" This appearance corresponds, in its description, with what was s aid of Serapis in our last chapter. Porphyrios, circa 270 A.D. records in h is \"Life of Plotinos,\" t hat t hat Philosopher in order to satisfy the curiosity of an Egyptian priest, repaired with him to the Temple of Isis in Rome, in order, as the most suitable place, to invoke his tutelary Daemon, which h aving done, a divine being made his appearance, apparently so much above the rank of the ordinary daemons as to greatly astonish th e Egyptian. The e minent Platonist, Thomas Taylor, translates a passage of the \"Phaidros\" thus: \"Likewise in consequence of this"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"divine Initiation, we become spectators {120 } of entire, simple, imm ovable, and blessed visions, resident in a pure light, and were ourselves pure and imm aculate, and liberated from the surrounding vestment which we denominate body, and to which we are bound, as an oyster to its s hell.\" Proklos, in h is \"Comm entary\" on the \"Republic of Plato,\" has these words: \"In all Initiations and Mysteries, the gods exhibit many form s of themselves, and appear in a variety of shapes, sometimes a form less light, shining from themselves, is thrown forth for contemplation, sometimes the luminosity is in a human figure, and sometimes it t akes a dif ferent shape,\" into all of which Iamblichus also particularly enters. The wondrous works of Homer, \"The blind old man of Scio \u0000 s rocky isle,\" are as full of the appearance of gods and angels to man, as the Jewish S criptures. In book iv. of the \"Odyssey, \" in describing the descent of Ulysses into the Cimm erian Cavern, leading to the abode of souls, he asserts that the fumes of the blood of the victims offered in sacrifice, and slain for the purpose, were used b y the shades of the dead to reanimate and str engthen their corporeal faculties. Moses s ays, \"the blood is the life.\" Pope thus words it, on the appearance of the prophet or seer, Tiresias: -- \"Eagre he quaft the gore, and then expres \u0000 t Dark things to come, the counsels of his brea st.\" Again, when Ulysses observes the wan and melancholy shade of his mother, Anticlea, standing aloof, Tiresias the Seer thus inform s him: -- \"Know, to the spectre, that thy beverage \u0000 s taste, The scenes of life renew, and actions pas t.\" And when the mother approaches her son \u0000 s s acrifice: -- \"When n ear Anticlea moved, and d rank the blood, Straight all the mother in h er soul awakes, And owning her Ulysses thus s he speaks.\" St. Basil instructs us in this, that \"t he blood b eing evaporated b y fire, and so attenuated, is taken into the substance of their body.\" It is s aid that in the Eleusinian Mysteries the Initiate took the solemn oath required of {121 } him, standing upon the skins of the animals s lain in s acrifice. The disgusting rites of the Taurobolium, said to have been practised in some of the Mysteries were of the nature described; and it is alleged that when the Aspirant was to receive this baptism of blood, he was put in a chamber, above which was a nother with the floor pierced with h oles; in this a bull was s lain and the Aspirant received the crimson stream upon h im in the lower chamber. Prudentius has the following lines on the subject: -- <<\"Perieteranon,\" v. p. 146 ; \"Fragments of Initiation,\" Bro . F. F. Schn itger.>> \"All salute and adore him from afar Who is touched with this uncleanliness, And sullied with such recent sin - offering, Because the vile blood of the dead ox"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" Has washed him who was hid in fil thy caverns.\" The reader of these pages will no doubt remark that details of such matters have no reference to Freemasonry; that is s o, but we were minded to shew of what the Mysteries c onsisted, and what they actually professed and p ractised. Neverth eless a large amount of affinity with Masonic rites, and its s ymbolism, will be found in this c hapter by the attentive observer, and considerably more in the next. The perfectly metaphysical mind of Plato eminently fitted him for an exponent of Mysterie s which h ad reached him from r emote ages, and it may be said that the Mysteries were Platonism, and that Platonism was the Mysteries, and in this s ense we may aptly apply the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who says: -- \"Out of Plato come all things that are still written and d ebated among men of thought.\" \" Plato is philosophy and p hilosophy Plato; at once the glory and the shame of mankind; since neither Saxon n or Roman h ave availed to add any ideas to his c ategories.\" Plato himself holds that of the 5 ord ers of things (of which we have just written) only 4 can be taught to the generality of men. {122 }   CHAPTER V.  PHILOSOPHY IN RE LATION TO MASONIC RITES. WE mentioned in our last chapter the introducti on into the State Mysteries of an intellectual class who, as laymen, were destined to exercise great influence upon succeeding g enerations. The most notable was Pythagoras, who was by birth a Samian of the period of 570 B.C. He obtained initiation into t he Mysteries of various c ountries, and consolidated all that he had thus learned into a school of his own, which h e opened at Crotono in Magna Graecia. He conferred upon h imself and p upils the title of Philosophers, or lovers of Wisdom, and P hilosophy beg an to lay claim to all the Wisdom possessed b y the Mysteries. It was the first of the Arcane Schools that sprang out of the State Mysteries, in the same way that private Lodges of Masons s prang out of the General Assemblies; and in the language of Masons, the School of Pythagoras would b e term ed a new Rite of the Mysteries, but Pythagoras went beyond speculation, in a Masonic direction, by his practical views upon the necessity of studying the Liberal Arts and Sciences, and though h e flourished nearly two centuries before Plato, and nearly three centuries before the time of Euclid, he made Geometry the basic plan of all creation. The Rite of Pythagoras was divided into three classes or grades, and Dr. George Oli ver in h is \"History of Initiation,\" makes t he School or Academy of Plato, to consist equally of three degrees with Initiatory rites, but it is doubtful whether he had any better authority than will be found in this s ection; it is full of Masonic doctrine {123 } and symbolism which must be left for t he reader to"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"apply. The Pythagorean Rite was Exoteric or public in its teaching, and Esoteric or private in things intended for his Disciples, and a like rule was followed b y the Egyptian priests. The first step of the Esoteric teaching was an Apprentice ship of five years of silence, which Iamblichus inform s us might be abridged in cases of merit; the Aspirants were term ed \"Mathematici,\" because the grade e mbodied instruction in the Liberal arts, and Hippolitus inform s us that Deity was denominated \"Grand Geometrician;\" even as we saw that the Chinese term ed Deity the \"First Builder,\" and the Indian Art fraternity the \"Great or Divine Builder.\" The brethren advanced to the second step were term ed \"Theorilici,\" and here they were instructed in the e lements of divine wisdom. Then followed the very select class of \"Electi,\" who were Perfect Masters. The School had a series of darkly - worded apothegms, as for instance, \"Stir not the fire with a sword\" -- be calm. \"Abstain from beans\" -- be chaste. It had al so secret modes of recognition. Their brotherly - love was often exemplified in the most remarkable mann er, and their devotion to the Society, and its laws, by the sacrifice of life itself. \"The Master has s aid it,\" was an all - sufficient guide in their con duct. Ovid in h is \"Metamorphosis\" has an essay upon Pythagoras and his doctrines: -- \"Why dread such mere visions as death and Hades? Souls c ann ot die; they only leave one body to enter another, as I (Pythagoras) know by experience who was once Eupherb us, and recognised the shield I, in h is person bore. Death is mere change; the breath goes forth from one body to enter another (be it human or animal) but beneath different shapes the soul remains substantially the same. Hence the horror of killing crea tures, it may be, tenanted b y kindred souls. But one may g o further and say, that not souls alone, but all things s hift and p ass -- night and d ay, the hues of the sky and sun, and the shapes of the moon. The seasons, the year, changes in correspondence w ith the ages of man, {124 } Spring answering to youth, Summ er to prime, Au tumn to maturity, and Winter to o ld age.\" Porphyrios, who was a Tyrian of the name of Melek, inform s us that t he numerals of Pythagoras are hieroglyphic s ymbols, by which h e e xplai ned all ideas c oncerning the nature of things, and hence of the nature of the symbols to which we have previously alluded. It is s aid that he taught t he true Astronomy, term ed \"Mesouranios,\" as typifying the sun in its relation to revolutions of the plane tary bodies. Nor need we feel surprised at t he knowledge which this implies, as the Vedas and Sh astras of the Hindus indicate a conception that the e arth was round and the planets in revolution, at least 2,000 B.C.<<Vide \"Isis Unveiled,\" i, p. 10; also ii , p. 128 .>> Pythagoras was Initiated in Egypt after severe trials, and P orphyrios s tates that he was initiated in Babylon by Zarades, but it is doubtful whether this person or even Zoroaster were names of persons. Zar - ades may be interpreted b y Na - zar - ad , vowed or separated, and Zar - ades may be a chief or Rab - mag, whilst Zoroaster may have been a Zara of Ishter, and Zerubabel the Zoro o r Nazar of Babylon, a Nazarene and recoloniser of Jerusalem.<<Vide \"Isis Unveiled,\" i, p. 10; also ii, p. 128 .>> Pytha goras c laimed that all things were created b y Geometry and numbers, or as his follower Plato expresses it, \"God p erpetually Geometrises.\" Censorinus thus develops his doctrine of the \"Harm ony of the spheres\": \"Pythagoras asserted that t he whole world is m ade according to musical proportion, and that t he seven planets between h eaven and earth h ave an"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"harm onious motion and intervals, correspondent to the musical diastemes, and render various s ounds according to their several heights, so consonant that they m ake the most sweet melody, but t o us inaudible by reason of the greatness of the noise, which the narrow passage of our ear is not capable to receive.\" Our old Masonic MSS . allege that Jabal discovered the musical notes by listening to the sound of the ha mm ers of Tubal Cain, and tradition {125 } assigns the discovery to Pythagoras by the same chance. The Greeks mention the visit of a man of the name of Abaris from the Hyperborean regions; he appeared at Athens c arrying a bow and quiver, girt with a gilde d b elt, and a plaid round his body. He was a learned man, instructed in Greek, very judicious, and Toland shews him to have been a Druid from the Hebrides. Pythagoras had no reserve with h im, nor the Druid with h im, and they parted with mutual esteem. I t is s aid metaphorically that Abaris s hewed P ythagoras the sacred arrow w hich Apollo used against t he Cyclops by which we are to understand Druidical astronomy, and magic or in Celtic \"dry,\" t o which the Anglo - Saxons added craft, denominating Magic Drycraf t. Pythagorean Clubs or Schools were e stablished at Crotona, Sybaris, Metapontum, Tarentum, and other places in Magna Graecia; and Cicero says that he died at Metapontum. The dates assigned to his birth vary from 608 and 570 B.C., and of his death 497 to 472 B.C. The Philosopher Plato, who died at a great age in the year 347 B.C. was s o much attached to Geometry, which the old Masonic Constitutions tell us was the original name of Masonry, that he wrote over his s tudy: \"Let none e nter here who are ig norant of Geometry\"; in h is \"Republic\" he says that \"Geometry rightly treated is the knowledge of the e ternal\"; and in \"Timaeus\" he says, that Pythagoras first brought Geometry to perfection; but Herodotus and Iamblichus say that Geometry was perfected in Egypt, owing to the necessity of surveying their lands after the overflow of the Nile; that is it had to be applied to the practical purpose of landmeasuring, and one of the probable derivations of the word Mason may be deduced from this use of Geometry. The poet Chaucer, who was a Clerk of Works to the King and therefore in constant contact with Masons, uses the old word \"Mase\" to signify an artistic building, and \"to mase\" is to think out; and Krause observes that, in almost every tongue, m - t, m - s, met z, mess, masz, is used {126 } to define the boundaries of an object, and in general, to invent, to measure, to work according to measure. In Latin we have mansio, a day \u0000 s journey, and Macerieo, a boundary wall, hence our word mansion. The term Mase has no w passed out of use, but at the period when the word Macon arose was well understood. Our ancient MSS . distinctly state that in early Saxon times the word was not in use and the Craft was designated Geometry; we may therefore seek the origin of the word in the Teutonic. In the \"Somneri Di ctionarium Saxonico - Latino - Anglicum,\" Oxon. 1689 , we have a word which covers what we seek -- Massa, or \"Maca, par locius, censors, conjux, a peer, an equal, a companion, a mate.\" It is therefore a term equally applica ble e ither to the Society or the trade. The builders were Masons because they were Sociates and Fellows of Craft, and the trade was the same because the Sociates made and mated the stones to form a building. The word Massa, a table, a mate, indicates fel lowship."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Brother Wm. S. Rockville has hazarded a derivation from the Coptic \"Mai\" to love, and \"Son\" a brother, which is quite applicable philologically, and he points out that the hieroglyphic of the first word is a sickle, plough, or scythe, and of th e second a chisel, or a seal is used.<<\"Mis. Notes and Queries,\" xi, p. 2; also \"Freemason \u0000 s Mag.\" 1865 .>> Geometry was the chief qualification for the Arcane Schools, as well as for Masonry, and the following which Plato gives in the \"Philebos,\" and p e rhaps derives from an older source, appears also in the Masonic MSS .: \"All arts require Arithmetic, Mensuration, and Statics, all of which are comprehended in the Mathematical science, and are bounded b y the principles which it contains, for the distributi on of numbers, the variety of measures, and the difference of weights are known by this sc ience.\" But Proklos makes Geometry to be also the basis of religion, and confirm s what was s tated in our last chapter, for he says: -- \"The mathematical disciplines were invented b y the Pythagoreans, in order to be a reminiscence of divine {127 } concerns, at which through these, as SYMBOLS, they endeavour to arrive.\" Even at t he present day Geometry and its diagrams are the techn ical language of Architects by which they convey their ideas to each other, and which they have inh erited with the Craft of the ancient Masonic Society. It follows that architecture is the best school in which to study speculative geometry, and there must always have e xisted a close relatio nship b etween operative Masonry and Speculative Philosophy, based as the latter is, to a great extent, upon geometrical science. There must be a good reason why old Masonic MSS . couple all the sciences which go to form a liberal education; and though it m ay seem incongruous to couple gramm ar and logic, with qualifications necessary to build houses, we can give very ancient Greek evidence to prove its necessity and b earing. Amm onius Saccus s ays: \"For in general the e nd of theory is the beginn ing of practic e; and so reciprocally the end of practice the beginn ing of theory. Thus, for instance, an Architect, being ordered to build a house, says to himself, \u0000 I am ordered to build a house; that is to say a certain defence to protect against the rains and the he ats. But this cann ot be without a roof or covering. \u0000 \" From this point therefore he begins his theory. He proceeds and says, \"But there can be no roof if there be no walls; and there can be no walls without some foundations; nor can there be laid foundat ions without opening the e arth.\" At this point the theory is at an end. Hence, therefore, comm ences the practice or action. For, first, he opens the earth, then lays the foundation, then raises the walls, and lastly puts on the roof which is the e nd of the action or practice, as the beginn ing of the practice was the e nd of the theory. And thus also the philosopher does; being willing to form a demonstration h e says to himself: \"I am willing to speak concerning demonstration. But inasmuch as demonstrati on is a scientific s yllogism, it is impossible to say anything concerning it without first saying what is a syllogism; nor can {128 } w e learn what is s imply a syllogism without having first learned what is a proposition; for propositions are certain senten ces; and it is a collection of such sentences that form a syllogism; so that without knowing propositions it is impossible to learn what is a syllogism, because it is out of these that a syllogism is c ompounded. Further than this, it is impossible to know a proposition without knowing nouns and verbs out of which is composed every species of sentence, or to know nouns and verbs without knowing sounds articulate or simple words, inasmuch as each of these is a"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"sound articulate having a meaning. \u0000 \" The same w riter speaks of \"the practical and the speculative part of Philosophy.\" Plato in h is \"Republic,\" makes Socrates to say: \"It is indeed no contemptible matter, though a difficult one, to believe that t hrough these particular sciences (arithmetic, music, geo metry, and astronomy) the soul has an organ purified and enlightened, which is destroyed and b linded b y studies of other kinds; an organ better worth saving than a thousand eyes; inasmuch as truth becomes v isible through this alone.\" An important part o f the Mythologies of various peoples was founded upon TWO PILLARS, where the sciences were alleged to be written; and the old Masonic MSS . state that Herm es and P ythagoras respectively found the Pillars of stone and b rick or \"latres\" upon which the antedel uvian sciences had b een engraved. Iamblichus asserts that t hese two Pillars were preserved in the temple of Amen at Thebes, and P orphyrios, the Platonic philosopher, having addressed a letter of enquiry upon the Mysteries and their doctrine, to \"Anebo the Egyptian Prophet,\" probably of a fifth order of priests established b y the Ptolemies in a Synod, is thus answered b y Iamblichus in a letter entitled, \"The Reply of Ab - Amm on the Master, to the Letter of Porphyrios to Anebo\": -- \"Herm es, the patron of le arning, in ancient times, was rightly considered to be a god in whom the whole sacerdotal O rder participated. The One who presides over {129 } true knowledge is one, and the same, everywhere. Our ancestors dedicated to him their wise discoveries, and name d their r espective treatises \"Books of Herm es.\" . . . . It would not be becoming that Pythagoras, Platon, Demokritos, Eudoxes, and many other of the old Greeks, should have been able to receive instruction from the Sacred Scribes of their time when you, o ur own contemporary holding sentiments like theirs, are disappointed in your endeavour by those now living, and styled P ublic Teachers. . . . . But if you press an enquiry after the method of the Philosophers, we will adjudicate it according to the ancient \"Pillars of Herm es,\" which Platon and P ythagoras have already recognised and combined with their own philosophical maxims. . . . . The knowledge of the gods is inn ate and p ertains to the very substance of our being. . . . . From the beginn ing it was one w ith its own source, and was c o - existent with the inh erent impulse of the soul to the supreme goodness.\" There is altogether m uch ambiguity and uncertainty as to the nature of these \"Two Pillars,\" but it is evident from the foregoing, that they were much more than a mere record of the worldly arts. They probably stood for two very ancient traditional Pillars, used in the primitive Mysteries, which were copied in the \"Petroma\" of the temples of the various Mysteries of the world, from which the sacred law s were read to the Initiate, as in the two tablets of Moses in the Jewish law. There was an ancient Babylonian tradition that these Two Tablets were buried b y Xisithrus, the Chaldean Noah, beneath the foundation stone of the tower of Borsippa, or Babel.<< A.Q.C., v, pt. 2 -- \"Har - moad.\">> Many kings s ought for them in vain, until the time of Nabunahid, who professed, if we are to believe his inscription, to have discovered them. Josephus s ays that one of these Pillars existed in S yria, in h is days. What he saw w as probably a pillar recording some Egyptian conquest. Diodorus Siculus repeats a tradition that t he Egyptians attributed to Thoth or Herm es the discovery {130 } of geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, astrology, and the sciences; and as the \"method of the philosophers,\" referred to by Iamblichus, was to employ g eometrical symbols as a method of teaching Theosophy, the \"Pillars of Herm es\" would appear to cover such reference in the quotation."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" Manetho, the Egyptian priest who compiled the ann als of hi s order for the Ptolemies, says: \"The second Herm es, called Trismegistus, translated, or rather transcribed into vulgar alphabetical characters, what t he first Herm es had wrote in h ieroglyphical characters upon pillars of stone.\" Herm es is the Greek name for the Egyptian Thoth, and this s econd of the name is believed to have been a Royal scribe of Menes the first King of Egypt, the first Thoth was a primitive traditional prophet, and the name, as Iamblichus has told us, of a god of Revelation. The great Master of Geometry that followed P lato, after a lapse of about a century, was a Tyrian by birth of the name of Euclid, who o pened an Academy of the Sciences at Alexandria under the Ptolemies. He was beyond d oubt a Platonist, and d escribed as s uch by Porp hyrios in h is \"Life of Plotinos,\" a philosopher born at Lykopolis in Egypt, 205 A.D. The words of Porphyrios are thus translated: \"In the first class of the Platonists there were Euklides, Demokritos, and P roklinos who lived near Troy. . . . . Of those ph ilosophers, therefore, who were authors s ome produced nothing more than a collection and transcription of the remains of the ancients, as Euklides, Demokritos, and Proklinos.\" We see from this that Euclid d id no more than reproduce what had existed from a ncient times, and hence it is not without some show of authority that later scribes of the Masonic MSS . have substituted the name of Herm es for Euclid, as the author of the Constitutional Charges, and as a matter of fact Herm es was, in a sense, their remot e originator. At this distant era there were only five liberal arts and sciences, and the assimilation of these to the five parts of the Mysteries was s hewn in our last chapter. In the 11th century of our era these had b een increased to {131 } seven, in t wo divisions, designated the \"Trivium\" which comprised gramm ar, rhetoric, and logic, and the \"Quadrivium\" which included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. In what has gone before we have various illustrations of the use of the cross as a pre - C hristian symbol in the religious Mysteries, and in these minor Arcane Schools of philosophy the symbolic c ross is prominent. Aeschylus, the author of \"Prometheus Bound,\" relegates this Cabiric god to a similar punishment on Caucasus for stealing the fire of the gods with which to endow mankind, and he himself narrowly escaped d eath under a suspicion that he had revealed some of the mystic doctrine. Plato advances that the Logos, or second p erson of his trinity, had impressed himself upon the world in the shape of an {\"X\"}, or St. Andrew \u0000 s c ross, as it is now term ed; as this s ymbol is one of the form s used to express the union of two generative principles it may be Plato \u0000 s s ecret way of expressing that. The Indian Guilds s ay, as previously mentioned, tha t t he Divine Builder crucified his s on S urya (the Sun) upon h is Lathe which is the Svastica {Symbol: Swastika} cross. All the Guilds, both ancient and modern, in one of the higher degrees, has a symbolic c rucifixion at High XII. at noon, which is founded upon the laying of the Foundation stone of a Temple on the 5 P oints, by 3, 4, 5, angle. But it goes far beyond this, as there was everywhere an actual sacrifice of human life to ensure safety to the building; and the assertion, traditional, of course, is that it occurred at the e rection of Solomon \u0000 s temple, and it certainly had p lace in our old English churches even. The temple of Solomon was a 3 to 1 structure, 60 x 20 cubits, the pyramids have a square basis, and therefore a Coptic Guild would lay down a perfect square. The Mysteries were no more than a Guild, and had equally the same rite. Vitruvius gives the {\"X\"} cross as a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"canon of proportion of the human figure, the centre of the cross being the navel of the body. This was in Egypt \"where also o u r Lord was c rucified\" {132 } (Rev. xi. 8); a confession of Initiation, \"crucified b efore the sun\" as the Mystics s ay. Minucius Felix, a Christian, taunts the Romans themselves with the worship of wooden gods, and says: \"Your victorious trophies not only re present a cross, but a cross with a man upon it.\" Various writers of the Platonic sc hool treat of the \"Perfect Man\" in the light of embracing all the virtues which lead to happiness, but which are never found combined in one individual. It is in this i deal of a perfectly virtuous man that we must look for such works as the Egypto - Greek life of Pythagoras, the Greco - Roman life of Apollonius; and exemplified to the full in the Greco - Jewish life of Jesus of Nazareth. The 2nd and 3 rd Books of the \"Republic \" of Plato teach that goodness to be apparent must be stripped of all adventitious c ircumstances, and that a really g ood man will find so much opposition in the world that \"he will be scourged, torm ented, bound, his eyes put out, and d ie by crucifixion aft er he has endured all these e vils.\" Again, \"a good man will be torm ented, furiously treated, have his hands c ut off, his eyes put out, will be bound, condemned, and b urnt.\" Lactantius quotes Seneca a s using similar language. Grotius, f rom whom we take o ur translation, considers that Plato writes prophetically, but, after the allusions made in previous c hapters, we may be pardoned if we look upon them as applied to certain things in the Mysteries, which assigned a reason in the danger of making the Arcane doctrines too public. The ancient Sybils, or inspired p rophetesses of the Mysteries, have similar language. Au gustine<<De civ. Dei, lib. xviii, c. 23.>> thus quotes the Erythrean S ybil: \"He will fall i nto the hostile hands of the wicked; with poisonou s s pittle will they spit upon h im, on h is s acred b ack they will strike him; they will crown h im with a crown of thorns; they will give him gall for food, and vinegar to drink -- five form s of trial. The Veil of the temple will be rent, and at midday there will be a darkness of three hours, and he will die, {133 } repose in sleep, and then in joyful li ght he will come again as at first.\" One of these Sybils had the following Oracle to deliver: -- \"Then suddenly a sign for m ortal men shall be, When o ut of Egypt \u0000 s land a stone most fair shall come safeguarded.\" Celsus accuses the Christians of interpolating passages from these Oracles \"without understanding their m eaning,\" from which we gather that they had a mystical reference. The veil that is rent is that of the Sacred Curtain of Apollo, and Virgil has ascribed to his patron the coming g lories of the age of gold. In the temple of Philae in Egypt there is an old - time painting of a man laid upon a cruciform bier asleep, over him stand two persons wh o are pouring upon h is head water in which appears the sacred tau - cross, whilst the sun \u0000 s rays s trike upon h im; and it is evident t hat such an Initiate is represented b y a cube opened out as a Latin cross, the top square having a man \u0000 s head, in the same te mple. We mentioned this s pecies of crucifixion in our last chapter, where the Initiate was c arried into the lower crypt of the temple. Socrates Scholasticus in referring to crosses found in the temple of Serapis, when it was s acked b y the Christians, say s: \"The Christians c ontended that t he cross belonged to the Master, Jesus Christ, which they also which understood these rites"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"maintained; the Gentiles on the contrary maintaining that t he cross was comm on both to Jesus Christ and Serapis.\" An eminent Cat holic divine says that the cross is \"the hidden Mystery, a scandal to the Jews, and folly to the Gentiles, of which Paul writes.\" Foucart mentions a treatise by a disciple of Pythagoras entitled, \"The passing into the invisible world, or the Descent into Hades.\" In the ancient Mystery language of pre - Christian times, and with the Gnostics, and in the Arcane Discipline of the church, Chrestos meant a Disciple, whilst Christos was one anointed, purified, and accepted. Boeckhos, in \"Corpus Inscriptionem,\" shews that it was an epithet applied {134 } to the departed, or the saved and redeemed, of pre - Christian times, Aeschylus s peaks of the Manteumata Pythocresta, or oracles of the Pythoness, in which Chrestos becomes the e xpounder of Oracles. Justin Martyr, in h is Apology, speaks of Chrestians, and Lactantius (iv. c. 8) says that \"it is only through ignorance that men call themselves Christians, instead of Chrestians.\" As the Mysteries had a symbolic death so had the Minor Arcane Schools, but the language of the latter has a very realistic c haracter, and we will see what has been said on this s ubject; first quoting Herm ias in h is \"Comm entary on the Phaidros:\" \" The word GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - tau - upsilon (telete) or Initiation was s o denominated from rendering the soul perfect; the soul was therefore once perfect. But here it is divided, and is not able to energise wholly by itself. But it is necessary to know that Telete, Muesis, and Epopteia, differ from each other. Telete therefore is analogous to that which is preparatory to purifications. But Muesis, which is s o called from closing the e yes, is more divine. For to close the e yes in Initiation is no longer to receive by sense those divine Mysteries, but with the pure soul i tself, and Epopteia is to be established and b ecome a spectator of the Mysteries.\" Synesius in h is treatise on \"Providence,\" as translated b y Thomas Taylor, says: \"You also who have been initiated in those Mysteries in which there are two pairs of eyes, and it is requisite t hat t he pair which are beneath should b e closed, when the pair which are above them perceive, and when the pair above are closed, those which are below should b e opened.\" This means that the spiritual eyes must be used for spiritual things. Bishop Warb urton, in h is \"Divine Legation,\" quotes an ancient writer, preserved b y Stobaeus, as s aying: \"The mind is affected in death, just as it is in the Grand Mysteries, and word answers to word, as thing to thing, for GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - upsilon - tau - ep silon - iota - upsilon (teleuteiu) i s to die and GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - iota - sigma - theta - alpha - iota (teleisthai) i s to be initiated.\" By the word Grand is meant t he Greater Mysteries which resemble the Master Mason. {135 } Plutarch h as s ome passages whi ch strikingly illustrate the doctrines of the Mysteries and the relation of these to Ceres and Persephone. This writer says: \"Now of the deaths we die one makes man two out of three, and the other one out of two. The form er is in the region and jurisdict ion of Demeter, whence the name given in the Mysteries GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - iota - upsilon, resembling that given to death GR:tau - epsilon - lambda - epsilon - iota - tau - alpha - epsilon{?}. The Athenians also heretofore called the deceased sacred to Demeter. As to the other death it is in the Moon or region of Persephone.\" The first separation is into what he term s \"the Meadows of Hades,\" situate between the e arth and the moon, where the soul wanders for a more or less period, where it plucks the soul viole ntly from"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"the body, but Persephone mildly and in a long time disjoins the understanding from the soul\"; that is s eparates the higher and lower self which is the second death, \"as if they were returning from a wandering pilgrimage, or long exile, into their country, where they have a taste of joy, such as they principally receive who are initiated into sacred Mysteries, mixed with trouble, admiration, and each one \u0000 s proper and p eculiar hope.\" This of course refers to actual death, the \"three\" being body, so ul, and spirit, and the \"two\" soul and spirit. These quotations all apply rather to the State Mysteries than the Arcane Schools of Philosophy, but we have other passages. The following is found in the \"Au xiliaries\" of Porphyrios (printed b y Ficinus the restorer of the Platonic Academy at Rome in the 15th century): \"Hence there is a two - fold d eath, the one universally known, by which the body is liberated from the soul; the other peculiar to philosophers, by which the soul is liberated from the body; nor does the one at all follow the other.\" Celsus speaks of a Pagan priest who could voluntarily perform the separation of soul and b ody, \"and lay like one dead void of life and sense.\"<<\"Anatomy of Melancholy\" (Burton).>> The \"Phedon\" of Plato has s everal similar passages, of which, in order not t o tire the reader, we will take but one: \"Now w e have shewn that in {136 } order to trace the truth or purity of anything, we should lay aside the body and only employ the soul to examine the objects we pursue.\" Mr. Robert Brown, in h is \"Great Dionysiac Myth,\" says in allusion to the Hall of Arcane rites, or the \"sekos,\" a word literally meaning sheep - fold b ut which came to signify the interior of a temple: \"Here, deeply excited and agitated b y all they had gone t hrough, ready to believe anything, and everything, in that state of abstinence which is, or is s upposed to be, most favourable to the reception of supernatural displays, and their m inds more or less affected b y drugs, and their whole being perm eated with t he impression and expectation of the more - than - mortal, they were allowed to SEE .\" We have here to remember that the Mysteries required a long and p rotracted fast, and the passages that we have quoted state clearly enough that an ultra - natural state was produced. What in these times is c alled hypnotism, mesmerism, trance, was well known to the ancients. Proclos, quoting Clearchus \u0000 \"Treatise on S leep,\" mentions a wand with which the operator, upon gently striking a boy, drew his s oul a distance from his body, for the purpose of proving that the body is without sensation when the soul is taken away, and, by means of his rod, he again restored the soul to the body.<<Oli ver \u0000 s \"Hist. Landmarks.\" ii, p. 614 .>> The writings of the e arly Christian Fathers affor d much testimony of the phenomena, and the Benedictine ceremony of covering the newly received Monk with a funereal pall, equally with a certain Masonic ceremony, is an exoteric reference to it. It is related b y Hugh, a Monk of Saltery in Huntingdonshire, that a soldier of King Stephen of England visited \"St. Patrick \u0000 s Hole,\" in Donegal, and after a fast of nine days, as in the Mysteries, was laid in a kind of grave, where a view of Paradise was s hewn to him, the whole of which account reads like a paraphr ase of the descent of Aeneas into Tartarus and Elysium. It also resembles the relation in the Metamorphosis of Apuleius, {137 } of his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis and Serapis, and as the latter Mystery was introduced into the Christian Church, as the Arcane Discipline, and equally claimed supernatural appearances as a part of the faith, we need b e at no loss to account for these relations. The Druses of Lebanon, on the testimony of Professor A. L. Rawson, who is himself"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"an Initiate, require an in terval of fasting, of more or less length according to circumstances, with a total fast on the day of Initiation, by which regimen a species of Epopteia is produced which the Professor term s mental ill usion or sleep - waking<<L etter in \"Isis Unveiled,\" ii, p . 313 .>>. The same phenomena is found in the Yogi, or \"twice born,\" and k nown in certain Rites of the Dervishes. It is almost certain that certain rites of the Egyptians have passed to the Africans, and Heckethorn, and other writers, have shewn that ther e e xists on that Continent, and in other places where the race has c arried the Initiation, a society called the Almuseri, with secret rites s imilar to those of the Orphic and Cabiric Mysteries. The reception takes place once a year in a wood, and the cand idate is s upposed to die; at the appointed hour the Initiates s urround the Neophyte and chant funereal songs. He is then carried to a temple e rected for the purpose, and anointed with palm - oil; after forty days of this probation h e is supposed to have obt ained a new soul; and is greeted with h ymns of joy, and conducted home.<<\"Secret Societies,\" ii, p. 283 .>> We are inform ed that Freemasonic s igns have been answered b y the Kaffirs. Galen<<\"Dogm. Hipoc. et Platon,\" viii.>> may be quoted here as to the e xistence of this doctrine of a soul which may be separated from the body: \"The soul is an imm aterial substance, which h as a luciform , etherial body, for its first vehicle, by which as a medium it comm unicates with the gross etherial body.\" The Chevalier R amsay says: \"It appears that t he Platonists, Pythagoreans, Egyptians, Chaldeans, and all O rientals believed that souls had an etherial, aerial, and {138 } terrestrial vestment, or tabernacle; that the last named was put off by natural death, the second b y a supernatural death, and the other retained for ever.\" The mathematical discipline, by aiding thought concentration, was intended to serve a similar purpose to that of the Hindu Yogism and of the Dervishes. Plutarch in h is Symposiacs<<Vol. viii, 2.>> a scribes to Plato the words, \"God is constantly a Geometer,\" hence to imm erse oneself in Geometrical thought, is to think with the mind of God. All the Platonists taught that the gradations of the spiritual world were arranged in Geometrical order, hence i t is, \"a science that takes men off f rom sensible objects, and makes them apply themselves to the spiritual and eternal nature, as a view of epopteia of the Arcane of initiation into holy rites.\" Proklos makes this assertion of the Pythagoreans: \"They per ceived that t he whole of what is c alled Muethsis is reminiscence, not externally inserted in souls, in the same mann er as phantasms, from sensible objects, are impressed on the imagination; not adventitious like the knowledge resulting from opinion, but ex cited indeed from things apparent, and inwardly exerted from the reasoning power converted from itself. They likewise say that though reminiscence might be shewn from m any particulars, yet it was evinced in a most eminent mann er, as Platon also says, f rom the Mathematical discipline, for if any one, says he, is led to the diagrams he will, from them, easily prove that discipline is reminiscence.\" The science of Geometry was also used in a symbolical sense, for Socrates in the \"Gorgias,\" accusing Kallicl es of an intemperate life, says to him: \"You neglect Geometry and Geometric equality.\" Zenocrates refused a candidate for Discipleship, saying to him: \"Depart, for thou hast not the grip of philosophy.\" Of the nature of the SYMBOLS used in the Arcane S chools there is almost as little to be gathered in its books as is to be found in old Masonry, and they were e vidently {139 } \"close tyled.\" We may fairly seek what we do not know"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"respecting symbols, through what we do know of history, and to comprehend sy mbols we must study the old historical religions. The Masons, Rosicrucians, Templars, and Gnostics, all used the same class of symbols. The society of Druses in S yria, and the Sufi D ervishes of Persia a nd Turkey, admit themselves to follow the Platonic S chool, whether by inspiration from its writers or by descent from the old Mysteries, and from which each and all, in one form or another, derive their knowledge. We may also follow these religious s ymbols in the unchanged rites of India. The basis of t he Masonic Jewel of a Master in the Chair is an old Egyptian symbol, for Plutarch inform s us that a triangle whose base is 4, perpendicular 3, and hypothenuse of 5 p arts, the square of which is equal to the square of those sides c ontaining the right angle, was an important emblem in Egypt, as a symbol of nature. The base figured Osiris, the perpendicular Isis, and the hypothenuse Horus; the originating and receptive principles, and the offspring of the two. It was the standard of their m easures of extent, and was for m odern centuries the traditional method b y the application of which the stonemason tested the squareness of his plan (5 x 5 = 25; 4 x 4 and 3 x 3 = 25, the Guilds of both East and West employ the Rites to this day.) Iamblichus (i. ix.) says : \"Amongst those things which are e verywhere set forth in the sacred d ramas, some have a specific Arcane cause and higher m eaning; others preserve the image of some idea beyond, as nature the genatrix develops certain specific form ations from invisible pri nciples; others are introduced from the sentiment of veneration, or for the purpose of illustrating something or rendering it familiar. Some e nclose what is profitable to us, or in some way purify us, or set us free from our human frailties, or turn aside some other of the e vils that are likely to befall us.\" We have already referred to the Pythagorean sentiment {140 } that \"t he path of vice and virtue resembles the letter Y,\" and though the apothegm has been forgotten in Masonry, yet the \"Golden branch\" by which it was represented is still remembered. The letter {\"Y\"} is equally a symbol which the Chinese consecrated to the Deity. It has been suggested that as an emblem it is a square {symbol: a chevron with a right angle} placed over a plumb - rule, {sy mbol: vertical li ne}. Herm es Trismegistus, or the Thrice - greatest, describes God as \"an intelligible sphere, whose centre is everywhere, and circumference nowhere,\" and this language tends to confirm the remarks we have ventured as to the Two Pillars. Ph erekydes Syros, who had the e arly education of Pythagoras, in h is Hymn to Zeus, cited b y Kircher (\"Oed. Egyptae\") has the following noteworthy lines: -- \"Jove is a circle, triangle, and square, Centre, and line, and all things, -- before all.\" Plato in h is s eventh \"Epistle to Dion,\" says expressly that he never will write anything explicitly upon these sublime speculations, but that there are three things through which science, the fourth, is necessarily produced, the fifth establishes that which is known and true. \"Now take e ach of these desiring to learn what we have lately asserted, and think as follows c oncerning them all -- a circle is c alled something whose name is s o expressed. For that which everywhere is equally distant from the e xtremes to the centre is the definition of that which we signify by the name of a round or circumference and a circle."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"But the third is the circle which may be blotted out. But the fourth is sc ience, and intellect, and true opinion about these. And the whole of this again must be e stablished as one thing, which n either subsists in voice, nor in corporeal figures, but is inh erent in soul.\" We have here an example of the way in which Plato employs Geometry to convey instruction, but in h is s econd e pistle to Dion, he e mploys c oncentric circles to discourse upon the divine triplicity of Agathos, Logos, and P syche -- wisdom, mind, life -- Father, Word, Spirit. He says: \"You inform m e that the nature of the First has {141 } not been sufficiently reveale d to you. I must write to you in riddles, in order if my letter should miscarry, either by sea or land, the reader m ay not understand it. All things are round about the king of all things, all things exist for his s ake, and that is the cause of all excel lent things. Around the second are the things s econdary. Around the third are the third class of things. The human souls endeavour to learn the nature of these, looking for what is homogeneous with itself, and consequently imperfect, but in the King, an d in these others which I have mentioned, it is not such. . . . . The greatest precaution is to be observed not t o write, but t o learn by word of mouth, for it is hardly possible for what is written n ot to come abroad. For which reason I have written n oth ing upon such topics; no such books of mine exist, nor ever shall.\" Proklos in h is Comm entary upon this s ays: \"The Demiurgos or creator is triple, and the three Intellects are the three Kings, He who exists, He who possesses, He who beholds.\" Several wri ters give the following appropriate passage, on the authority of Suidas: \"Thulis King of Egypt, thus went to the Oracle of Serapis: \u0000 Thou who art the God of fire, and governest the course of the heavens, tell me the truth, was there e ver, or will there e ve r be, one so powerful as myself? \u0000 He was answered: \u0000 first God, then the Word, and the Spirit, all united in one. Go hence, O! mortal, whose life is always uncertain. \u0000 \" In going thence the priests c arried out the implied threat by cutting the throat of t he e gotistic Thulis. In the \"Ethical\" Fragments of Hierocles, who wrote towards the e nd of the second century and was a Pythagorean, the symbol of ten concentric c ircles is used to set forth our m oral duties, and we have seen that t he Chaldeans, Medes, and P ersians, considered seven concentric c ircles as a sacred symbol, whilst still more ancient races that we have mentioned are said to have used three such. Hierocles s ays: \"Each of us is, as it were circumscribed b y many concentric c ircles, some of whi ch are {142 } less, but others larger, and some comprehend, but others are comprehended, according to the different and unequal habitudes with respect t o each other. For the first and most proximate circle is that which everyone describes about his own min d as a centre, in which circle the body, and whatever is assumed for the sake of the body is c omprehended. For this is nearly the smallest circle, and almost touches the centre itself. The second from this, and which is at a greater distance from the cen tre, but comprehends the first circle, is that in which parents, brothers, wife and children are arranged. The third circle from the centre is that which contains uncles, aunts, grandfathers, grandmothers, and the children of brothers and sisters.\" He th en proceeds through six o ther circles: (4) relations, (5) the people, (6) tribes, (7) citizens, (8) villagers, (9) provincials, and concludes, (10) \"But t he outerm ost and greatest circle, and which comprehends all the other circles, is that of the whole hu man race.\" In sentiment nothing can be more Masonic than this, but Au gustine has a very"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"apposite allusion to the symbolic point within a circle, and he had at one time been a Gnostic. He says: \"As in a circle however large, there is a middle point, whith er all converge, called b y Geometricians the centre, and although the parts of the whole circumference may be divided inn umerably, yet is there no other point, save that one, from which all measure e qually, and which by a certain law of evenn ess hath the s overeignty over all. But if you leave this one point, whatever point you take, the greater number of lines you draw, the more everything is c onfused. So the soul is tossed to and fro by the very vastness of the things, and is c rushed b y a real destitutio n, in that its own n ature compels it everywhere to seek one object, and the multiplication suffers it not.\"<<Oli ver \u0000 s \"Symb. Dic.\" -- Art. Point. &c.>> The curious part of this is the involved verbiage, as if Au gustine had in h is mind, and sought t o hide the secret method of finding a true square by the centre. {143 } Lucian makes Cato to say that, \"God makes himself known to all the world; He fills up the whole circle of the universe, but makes his particular abode in the centre, which is the soul of th e just.\" Another m ode of illustrating this is used b y the Rosicrucian Paracelsus, who says: \"All numbers are multiples of one, all sciences c onverge to a comm on point, all wisdom comes out of one centre, and the number of wisdom is one. . . . . Those who love the luminous circle will be attracted to it, and their knowledge comes from God.\" Dionysius Thrax, an eminent gramm arian, is quoted b y Clemens Alexandrinus as s aying, that some converse, \"not only by speech but by symbols also.\" This implies that there was an understood signification attached to the symbols. The same writer inform s us that it was a custom of the Egyptians to hold a branch in the hand whilst in the act of adoration. Aristotle says that, \"He who bears the shocks of f ortune valian tly and demeans himself uprightly, is truly g ood, and of a square posture without reproof.\"<<\"Old York Lectures.\">> The Zoroastrian Oracle declares, \"the mind of the father decreed that all things s hould b e divided into three\"; which Plato geometrises thu s: \"God resembles a triangle which h as three e qual sides.\" Xenocrates, the friend of Plato, assigned the e qual triangle to gods, seeing that it is everywhere e qual; the scalene to man seeing that it is unequal in its s ides; the isosceles to daemons or tut elary spirits, because it is partly equal, and partly unequal in it properties, the daemons being placed b etween men and gods. Proklos s ays that, \"Knowledge has three degrees -- opinion, science, and illumination. The means, or instrument, of the first is reception, of the second dialectus, and of the third - intuition.\" Diodorus of Sicily term s the \"Sun\" the architect of all nature, and thus we symbolise the Master Mason by that emblem. The square was one of the sacred emblems borne by the Stolistos of the ancient {144 } Mysteries. In the real G uild Masonry Man is the living stone and the tools and emblems are used to bring him to due proportions as in the actual stone. But a very important symbol, philosophic and Masonic, and one which h as been comm on to the world in all time is the cube. Pythagoras is s aid to have taught that, \"the number eight or the octad is the first cube, that is to say, squared in all cases as a die; proceeding from its base the e ven n umber two; so is man four square or perfec t.\" Plato in h is \"Protagorus\" causes that character to address Socrates in a q uotation from Simonides, a man of Scio who flourished 556 B.C., \"It is v ery difficult to become truly virtuous, and to be in"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"virtue as a cube; that is to say that neither our ca rriage, our actions, or our thoughts, shall shake us, or even draw us from that state of mind.\" It is the cubical stone of the Rosy Cross, which \"sweats blood and water and suffers anguish of soul.\" The passages that we have quoted are a fair example o f the moral geometry of antiquity. Those from Plato, for example, indicate the use to be made of geometrical diagrams in teaching science and Theosophy; that from Hierocles the use made of them in teaching morals; and that from Au gustine may explain why a Master Mason may find his s ecrets by the centre. The quotation from Aristotle ought to remind a Mason of the day when h e stood at the north - east corner; and that from Simonides of what is required of him in order to become a perfect Ashlar, and the more especially as we have shewn that this c ube had the same signification in Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, and America, and that it is, therefore, one of the most primitive symbols. A Persian proverb is thus: -- \"O! square thyself for use; a stone that may Fit in the wall is not left in the way.\" The \"Regius\" Masonic MS. tells us, in the Master \u0000 s first Article, how he is to regulate his c onduct as a judge of work: \"And as a jugge stond upright, And then thou dost to bothe good ryght.\" Curiousl y enough the Egyptian {145 } \"Ritual of the Dead,\" quoted in our 2nd chapter, has a line symbolically identical. There are numerous references to Symbols which are both Platonic and Masonic in the works of our learned Brother the late George Oli ver, D.D. , but unfortunately he does not often give references that will enable us to verify them. All the foregoing quotations have been taken from non - Masonic works, and may therefore be considered wholly unbiassed. The following are probably equally reliable, and are chiefly assigned b y Oli ver to the Pythagoreans, from which school Plato accepted much of his teachings. The \"clasped hands\" was a Pythagorean symbol. The divine e ssence was represented b y a \"quadrangle\" or square, which implies order and regulari ty; it is found in Chinese books of great antiquity with the same meaning. The \"right - angle\" was the symbol of female deities, as Ceres, Vesta, Rhea. The \"pyramid,\" a valued symbol, referred to the divine triplicity. The \"cube\" was c onsidered b y the Her mesians as the symbol of truth, as the appearance is the same in every point of view. The \"double - triangles,\" \"single triangles,\" \"five - pointed star,\" \"cross,\" etc., have been used b y all nations, in all time, and in comm on with \"square and compasses,\" \"p lumb,\" \" square,\" \"t riangular - level,\" etc., have figured as alphabetical characters. The triple - tau {symbol of Triple - tau, like a \"T\" striking the cross - bar of an \"H\" from above} is given as the monogram of Herm es; and the letter P crossed, {symbol: \"P\" with a short horizontal line across the lower vertical} as the staff of Osiris. But the most widely spread, and most ancient of all symbols is the Svastica, Filfot, or Jain cross {Symbol: Swastika}, form ed of four squares joined at the e nds, derived from the primaeval centre, and Cabiric. The five Platonic bodies are Masonic s ymbols, and in ancient Arcane Schools were held to teach that t he world was made by God, \"in thought and not in time,\" and of the elements thus evolved, \"fire\" is a pyramid; \"earth\" a cube; \"air\" an octohedron; \"water\" an icosahedron; the \"sphere of the universe\" a dodecahedron. The"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"\"equilateral triangle,\" the \"square,\" and the \"equal hexagon\" were considered the most perfect geometrical diagrams, {146 } and it was pointed out by Pyth agoras that there e xist no o ther form s whose multiples are competent to occupy the whole space about a given centre; and which can only be e ffected b y six equilateral triangles, four squares, and three e qual hexagons. There are certain ancient symbols s ome of which h ave the appearance of Roman letters but are not really so, which are found sculptured on stones in Egypt and elsewhere, and found, in later times, in this c ountry as Masons \u0000 marks. The letter {\"Y\"} may be found p laced on a reversed triangle {symbol: inverted equilateral triangle with small \"Y\" hitting upper base}; we have the {X} cross; the reversed tau or level {\"T\" inverted}; and d oubled it may form a cross {+}. There are the masculine and feminine symbols {\"V\"} and {\"V\" inverted}, which u nited may form the {N} symbol, so o ften found as a Mason \u0000 s mark, the same symbol is found on pre - Christian coins of Persia, in various angles; the {\"V\" inverted} and {W}, the latter a double symbol; the {I} is phallic; the {\"V\" inverted} and {V} crossed or interlaced, as in the Masonic s quare and compasses. Another very ancient symbolic mark is two triangles {symbol: Two equilateral triangles, top inverted, lower upright and joined at vertices in center like an \"X\" with closed top an bottom} joined at the apex, which is s till a sacred symbol in Thibet, Turkey, and India. Our r eaders, who have carefully noted the symbols mentioned in our previous c hapters, will have perceived that whilst many of the Arcane e mblems have been continued in Free Masonry, thro ughout the centuries, others have been lost in the speculative system, but were preserved b y the Guild and also as Masons \u0000 marks; they must at one time have e nclosed a recondite doctrine, which was c omm on to both the sacerdotal, and art Colleges; and marks of this class, which go beyond mere monograms, admit of a mystic interpretation, which indicates a culte comm on to Theosophia a nd p hilosophic Geometry or Masonry; it happens that some of these symbols may be interpreted to contain the doctrine of the pre - existence of souls; the union of the spiritual and material nature in man, which enables him to live two lives -- the sensual and the spiritual, the Fall of Man as the Cabalists pretend b eing figured in the predominance {147 } of the form er over the latter. Other emblems have reference to the divinity, and an example of the Masonic mann er in which these may be made to convey instruction may be illustrated b y the e quilateral triangle. It has three points; a point has position only; a line has length only an d term inates in two points; three lines of equal length at equal angles form an equilateral triangle, or the primary figure in geometry, and represents the trinity in unity, or Deity pervading all space, creator of all things animate and inanimate; doubled it represents the perfect godhead, and the male and female energies of nature. Or again, a \"point\" is the beginn ing of any active duty, the flowing of which point generates a \"line;\" a line is therefore e ither reward, duty, pleasure, or profit. A \"right line\" is a duty perform ed and p ursued with constancy. The e xtension of a right line to generate a \"surface\" is therefore perfect duty. Better still i s a passage from Macrobius in h is \"Comm entary on Scipio \u0000 s Dream\": \"And as a line is generated from a poi nt, and p roceeds into length from an indivisable, so the soul, from its own point which is a monad, passes into the duad, which is its final extension.\" But the most remarkable of all the Arcane and architectural symbols is the vesica - pisces {symbol: an ellipse with major axis v ertical, two vertical li nes"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"issuing at top and b ottom}, it was in use until our days, and Brother Conder (a member of the Masons \u0000 Company) says that its form ation was the diagram by which old operative Masons tested their squares. Proklos repeatedly refers to this figure, which h e had seen in Egypt, and heard interpreted there; it often appears on temples, as well as modern churches, and is found especially on the throne of Osiris. In the Platonic s ystem it is s aid to have consti tuted the sign of Epopts, the open h and b eing united at the finger - ends and the wrists touching each other. We mentioned in our third chapter the affinity of Philosophy with the Mysteries of Serapis, and the Arcane Discipline of the Christians. The Ptole mies, who had the Jewish S criptures translated in the Septuagint, seem to have found a mode, or thought {149 } they had, in the establishment of a fifth order of prophets, of harm onising all faiths in the mysteries of Serapis, and Clement, of Alexandria, in form s us that the initiates of these Mysteries wore on their persons the mystic name I - ha - ho, the original of which appears to be IAO, which embodies the symbols of the two generative principles. It is further asserted that t he before - mentioned sign of Ep opts constituted that of the Arcane Discipline, coupled with the lettering of the word ICHTHUS, a fish, and the Pope \u0000 s ring is that of the Fisherm an. Oli ver, quoting Kerrich, says that the vesica - pisces is the great secret of church architecture, and the determ inator of all dimensions.<<\"Pythagorean Triangle\" (Hogg).>> It continues an equally important symbol amongst the Dervish sects. We will now pass on to the use in the Platonic s ystem of other symbols in which Masons are interested. Plato in h is P hilebos has a triad under the names of Bound, Infinite, and Mixed, and likewise a triad still more Masonic of Symm etry, Truth, and Beauty, which, he says, \"are seated in the Vestibule of the good.\" The Masonic pillars of Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, are an analogy, and the divine triad of Agathos, Logos, and P syche, if literally translated are a close approximation. He likewise prescribes the following moral qualities as essential in a student of Philosophy: -- \"He must have a good memory, learn with fac ility, be magnificent, magnanimous, and b e the friend and ally of Truth, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance; qualities which are equally made the e ssential points in a Freemason. Again, in the Phedon, which is a dialogue on the imm ortality of the soul, we find the following important passage, which h e adduces on the authority of the most ancient Mysteries: -- \"Wisdom is the only true and unalloyed coin, for which all others must be given in exchange, with that piece of money we purchase. . . . Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, and P rudence, or wisdom itself, are not exchanged for passions but cleanse us of them. And it is pretty evident {149 } that those who instituted the Purifications c alled b y us Teletes, i.e., perfect expiations, were persons of no contem ptible rank, but men of great genius, who, in the first ages, meant by such riddles to give us to know, that whoever enters the other world, without being Initiated and P urified, shall be hurled headlong into the vast abyss; and that whoever arrives there after due purgation and expiation shall be lodged in the apartments of the gods. For as the dispensors of these e xpiations s ay -- \u0000 There are many who bear the Thyrsus, but few that are possessed of the spirit of God. \u0000 Now those who are possessed, as I ta ke it, are the true Philosophers.\" So far Plato, and he may be put into o ther words -- \"Many are called b ut few are chosen.\" The Thyrsus here alluded to, as a badge of office in these Mysteries, was c arried b y the soldiers of Bacchus, Sabazios, or Dionys os; the Chevalier Ramsay says that it was twined with ivy, and very often h ad upon it a"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"cross, and he compares the Greek conception of Bacchus, as god of the vintage, with the description of Messiah as given in Isaiah and the Apocalypse. Porphyrios has a long description of the advantage of the four Cardinal virtues, but after the illustration of the Master Plato we may omit t his. Stobaeus s ays of them pretty much what Masonry tells us.<<\"Eccl. Ethio,\" p. 167 .>> The pagan Emperor Au relius Antoninus, \"c irca\" 145 A.D., has s everal passages on these virtues; in one he says: \"If any man should conceive certain things as being really g ood, such as Prudence, Temperance, Justice, Fortitude, he would not after endure to listen to anything which was not in h arm o ny with what is really g ood.\" We wonder how many Masons have this feeling. The doctrine of equality and b rotherly love, which form s the base of the Masonic Institution, may be paralleled in the Arcane Schools with such passages as the following: -- \"Al ypios,\" \"Tell me, O! Philosopher, is the rich man unjust, or the heir of the unjust! \"Iamblichus,\" {150 } \"That is not our m ethod of disputing, O! ill ustrious man; no o ne is c onsidered rich by us, even if he does possess external riches, unless he likewise has the virtues c haracteristic of a true philosopher.\" That is the virtues which h ave been already mentioned; and brotherly - love is often enforced, but in the \"Regius MS.\" of the old Masonic Constitutions there is a passage which states that the Stewards of the Hall are to serve one another, \"like sister and b rother,\" for which sentiment Platon \u0000 s \"Symposiom,\" or Banquet of Life, may be consulted. Demokritus expresses the gist of this work in a few admirable words: \"He who loves the goods of the soul will love things more divine, but he who loves the goods of its transient habitation will l ove things human.\" We may close this c hapter with a few hints as to the changes which Christianity forced upon the ancient schools. Iamblichus phrases a Pythagorean dogma thus: \"As the Lesser Mysteries are to be delivered b efore the Greater, thus also must discipline precede philosophy.\" If the Lesser gave the title of Mystae, the Greater gave that of Epoptae, and if the passage means anything it must be this, that s cience and art, represented b y Geometry, is the counterpart of the form er, whilst philosophy is in relationship with Epoptae. Hence after the break - up of the State - Mysteries, we see a succession of two schools, closely related to each other -- the Craftsm en, or art school, and the Gnostics who know. Ragon<<\"Orthodoxie Maconique,\" p. 44.>> says: \"Do we not know that the ancient Initiated P oets, when speaking of the foundation of a \"City\" meant thereby the e stablishment of a doctrine? Thus Neptune the god of reasoning, and Apollo the god of hidden things, presented themselves before Laomedon the father of Priam to help him to build the city of Troy, that is to say, to establish the Trojan religion.\" In other words to \"build a city\" is to establish a public culte, to \"build a temple\" is to found an Arcane School. The Mystae, or veiled, are they who see things as they appear; the Epoptae, or set {151 } apart, see things as they really are, that is they are Gnostics or knowing ones. There is a passage in the \"Prometheus\" of Aeschylus, which seems to correspond with the adventures of Aeneas that we have related; and to advise the god that he was to look for an Initiate who would give peace to humanity: \"To such labours look thou for no term ination to thy pangs till a god shall appear, as thy substitute, willing to go down to gloomy Hades and to the murky depths around Tartarus.\" Blavatsky observes, and we see no reason to disagree with h er views, that when the Hierophants of the Mysteries s aw that it was necess ary to rebuild the sinking speculative e difice, the \"Mystae\" had"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"comm itted to them the rebuilding of the \"Upper - temple,\" or exoteric part; whilst the \"Epoptae\" had the \"Lower - temple,\" the crypt or the e soteric portion; \"for such were their r espective appel lations in antiquity, and are to this day.\" Initiation was s poken of as a \"walking into the temple,\" and the \"cleaning\" or rebuilding of it referred to the body of an Initiate on h is s upreme trial. The misfortunes which befell the e stablishment of Pyth agoras at Crotono may possibly have had their origin in the jealousy of the State Mysteries, though the destruction of its building and its members is usually attributed to the anger of one Cylon who had b een refused admittance. It is evident, however, th at two centuries later the State Mysteries must have lost much of their exclusive power over the mind, when the Arcane Schools of Philosophy were perm itted without check to assume the e ntire role of their doctrines. The Emperor Galen, at a still l ater p eriod, gave perm ission to Plotinos, to build a city by the name of Platonopolis, where the Philosophical system was to be taught, but this does not appear to have been carried out. It is, however, quite clear that the State Mysteries and the Arcane School s taught the same truths, if in somewhat varied form s, and that t hese truths are e qually represented in Masonry, which is as far as we desire to go in this {152 } chapter. It is quite possible that there are some trifling resemblances between Platonism and Masonry, which may have been introduced at a modern date, but it is utterly impossible that this c an apply to the great mass of things which are in comm on, and we shall see more of this affinity, and in the ancient times of Masonry, as we proceed. Befo re the reader advances to the next chapter he will be pleased to note, and to remember in regard to all which follows, that t hese five chapters afford ample e vidence that t he original \"Mysteries\" had now culminated in \"three\" classes, but varying only in p rofession and techn ique, in the several systems viz.: 1, \"The Sacerdotal.\" The drama refined into a temporary trance death. 2, \"The Military.\" The original drama of a murdered god. These two classes were suppressed b y the Christian Emperors of Rome, bu t continued to be secretly practised b y what one writer term s \"strolling priests.\" The third class learned to \"close the lips,\" which in the Greek is the e quivalent of Mystery, and as Art was necessary to the Church they received p rotection. 3, \"The Arti zan.\" A version of the last - named; entering India, China, and Babylon from the North, and Greece, Phoenicia, and P alestine by way of Egypt, at t imes, in India, imparting the Yogism of the first class. Our Saxon ancestors for these adopted the term Guild, which implies c ontribution of money. {153 } CHAPTER VI. THE MYSTIC AND H ER METIC SCHOO LS IN C HRISTIAN TIMES. WITH the close of our last chapter Philosophy had b egun to play an important part upon the stage of ancient Mystery, and the old spiritual faith of Isis, Osiris and Horus, was becoming still more subtilised b y the restless Greek at Alexandria, under the rule of the Ptolemies. Here was established a new, or fifth order of priests with the title of Prophets, and the Mysteries of Isis, Serapis, and A nubis became the favourite Arcani. Ptolemy Philadelphus assembled a Council of Jews, alleged to be 70 in number, f or the purpose of translating their scriptures into Greek, which"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"version is yet known as the Septuagint. He also treated with Asoka in reg ard to the doctrine and p rogress of Buddhism.<<Erest de Bunsen.>> A wide e clectic school was to be e stablished, under which the e xisting faiths might be assimilated, and the secret and sublime Mysteries of the School were those of Serapis. How this s ucce eded may be gathered from a letter of Hadrian, Emperor 118 A.D., to the Consul Servianus, preserved b y Vopiscus<<\"Vita Saturnine.\">>, in which we find the following, of the Egyptians: \"They who worship Serapis are Christians, and such as are devoted to Ser apis c all themselves Bishops of Christ\" . . . . (\"another translation h as it\"): \"those who call themselves Bishops of Christ are vowed to Serapis; there is no ruler of the Jewish S ynagogue, no Samaritan, no priest of Christians, who is not an astrologer, a diviner, and a charlatan. Their Patriarch h imself when h e comes to Egypt is by some forced to adore {154 } Serapis, and b y others Christ. . . . . They have all but one God, Him the Christians worship, Him the Jews, Him all the Egyptians, and those of all other nations.\"<<\"Herodian \u0000 s History\" (J. Hart, 1749 ). p. 184 .>> Between the years 300 B.C. and 300 A.D. Alexandria was the seething cauldron whence mystic learning spread over the world: -- Mysteries, Cabala, Theurgy, Gnosticism, Alchemy, Astrology, an d even Christianity, for it is s aid that \"out of Egypt I have called my son.\" The philosophers term ed themselves Philalethians, or Lovers of Truth; and the numerous s ocieties which we shall mention in this c hapter have much interest, but we must mention t hem in the briefest possible mann er: in many cases s uccessions exist to this day. CABALISM. It is quite probable that this s ystem of interpreting the Jewish Scriptures was a part of the instruction of the Beni - Hanabiim, or sons of the Prophets, alluded to in \"Samuel.\" According to Clemens Alexandrinus these Colleges c onsisted of classes designated Sons and Masters, and he observes that there were Novices amongst the Levites, and that Converts were divided into Exotericii or proselytes of the gate, and Trinisecti or proselytes of the covenant -- Perfecti. We are inform ed b y the \"Book of Esdras,\"<<\"Esdras ii,\" c. xiv, 8>> that Ezra the Scribe dictated to five men, during a period of forty days, books to the number of 204 , of which 70 last written, were t o be hidden, or Apocryphal, and confined to the \"wise amongst the people.\" The gist of the Cabala is expressed in the words of Philo, who says that: \"The law of Moses is like to a living creature whose body is the literal sense, but the soul is the more i nward and hidden meaning, covered under the sense of the letter.\" The Mystery is divided into \"three veils,\" and is s aid to have been delivered b y Moses orally to the Levites and Elders, from whom it descended to the Rabbis. The two grand P illars of the temple of Solomon were important symbols, and Franck says that upon entering the first veil we are in the Vestibule; in the second the Holy - place; and in the {155 } third the Sanctum Sanctorum. The ten Sephiroths, which represent the descent of creation fr om the Divine, are also divided into three classes which remain an indivisible trinity. The first three express the intelligible first manifestations; the second triad the virtues or sensible world; the third, nature in its essence and active principles. As a system it admits of a perfect assimilation with the wisdom - religion of the old nations. It was prescribed in the \"Mercaba,\" and the Chaldean \"Book of Numbers,\" that the Neophyte was to be led to a secluded spot by an Ancient who whispered in h is ear the great secret. The \"Sepher Jezirah,\" which it is argued from astrological allusions therein to be as old as Abraham, says: \"Close"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"thy mouth lest thou should speak of this, and thy heart lest thou should think aloud; and if thy heart has escaped thee b ring it back to its place, for such is the object of our alliance.\" The European Jews had an association called the \"Order of Elijah,\" which is s aid to be mentioned in the \"Mishn a\" and \"Gemara,\" it had p asswords, signs, and countersigns, and is believed t o have been in existence in Poland and Saxony at a very early period.<<\"The Kneph\" (Mackenzie), i, p. 28.>> The Masonic Royal Arch Degree has drawn on the Cabala a nd Talmud, but periodical revisions have taken place. ESS ENES. This important mystic s ec t amongst t he Jews has puzzled historians. It may have struck out a new path from the Cabalistic road, but the extreme veneration of its members for the sun is more characteristic of Chaldea, and of the e xisting Yezids. Jewish critics believe that they a re the Assideans, Chasdim, or old b elievers allied with the Maccabees; they afterwards divided into two sects, or the practical, and contemplative members. Other writers c onsider that they were Egyptian priests, driven into Syria by the conquests of Camby ses of Persia, and Alexander the Great, and it is v ery probable that t his may be partly correct, and that t hey may have included Jesus ben Panther, a nephew of Queen S alome, who after studying Egyptian Theurgy, and p reaching to the people, {156 } w as procla imed for 40 d ays, and then stoned to death, and hung on a tree at Lyda, about the year 100 B.C. The Essenes are said to have recognised eight (some say ten) spiritual stages of ascent to beatitude; and they had, like the Pythagoreans, a system of degree s with a probationary period b etween each. Their doctrines were delivered orally and they took an oath of Secrecy, Chastity, and Justice in all their dealings. When addressing their Chiefs they stood with their right hand b elow their chin, and the left l et down by the side. As the Pythagoreans assembled in companies of ten, so also the Essenes c onsidered that t en made a lawful assembly for divine worship, but this resemblance may derive from still older societies. The Roman Collegia a nd English Guild Ma sonry were ruled b y tens and hundreds. Ernest de Bunsen, whom we mentioned in our second chapter, holds that amongst the Egyptian and Jewish Gnostics there was a twofold tradition which passed into Christianity, and that it had the doctrine of a spiritual development which transform ed them into \"living stones,\" hence denominated \"Banaim,\" or builders, that is of a bodily temple, and therefore they neglected the material temple of Jerusalem. A select class of the Essenes were term ed \"Therapeutae\" who wer e healers, and d welt in small cottages wherein was an inn er shrine used for contemplative purposes. They kept t he Sabbath, and, every seventh time seven, they had a special service with Mystic dances, such as we have referred to in the Mysteries. Philo s ays: \"They have impulses of heavenly love by which they kindle, in all, the e nthusiasm of the Corybantes, and the Bacchanalians, and are raised to that state of contemplation after which they aspire. This s ect had its rise in Alexandria, before the Jews w ere very numerous, and spread exceedingly throughout Egypt.\" Eusebius, the Christian h istorian, has s ome curious remarks on the sect. He says: \"Their doctrines are to be found among none but in the religion of Christians, according to the Gospel. Thei r m eetings and the separate {157 } places of the men and women at their m eetings, and the e xercises perform ed by them, are still i n use amongst us at the present day, equally at the festival of our Saviour \u0000 s passion . . . . it is highly probable that t he an cient"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Comm entaries which they have are the very writings of the Apostles, and probably some e xpositions of the ancient Prophets, such as are contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and many others of St. Paul \u0000 s Epistles.\" Josephus had p ersonal knowledge of the sect, and makes mention of Books which were kept secret, referring to the \"names of the Angels,\" which may mean powers or attributes, and reappearing in the Arcane Discipline. We must remember also in conn ection with Eusebius \u0000 mention of the Saviou r \u0000 s passion that the weeping for Adonis c ontinued in S yria down to the fourth century A.D. There can be no doubt t hat a Christianised form of the Mysteries was continued b y the Monks, and we have the testimony of the Fathers to this effect, but we might expect that these would vary in the country where they were practised; thus we might expect to find the influence of Adonis in S yria, of Serapis in Egypt, Dionysos and Bacchus in Greece and Rome, and throughout the Roman Empire the influence of the rites of Mythras with the before named. It would appear, however, that t here were branches of the Essenes, and Therapeutae, who became actual Christians -- as Nazarenes, Ebionites, and Nabatheans, and the first term is yet in use in the East to designate Chri stians, who first took that name at Antioch. Theodoret says: \"The Nazareens are Jews, honouring the anointed as a just man,\" and using the Evangel according to Peter, portions of which were discovered a short time ago in Egypt, and a litle later fragments of the \"Logia of the Lord.\" The Ebionites were a portion of the sect, and had amongst t hem r elatives of Jesus, and used the Gospel of Matthew, derived, it is believed, from the \"Logia;\" they dwelt in a region n ear the seat of the Adonisian Mysteries; the y looked upon Jesus as assuming his apostleship at the {158 } descent of the Holy Spirit, and that his Messiahship would b egin with h is s econd coming. The Nabatheans were followers of the Baptist in Lebanon, and the Books of this Sect yet exist in S yria. Marcion, who left Rome, about 140 A.D., would seem to have followed the Gospel of Luke. Eusebius, St. Jerome, and Epiphanius have asserted that t hese sects were branches of the Essenes, and there is no doubt that several of the sects, which were e ventuall y classed as Gnostic by the Church of Rome, proceeded from them.<<J ones \u0000 \"Ecc. History.\">> We will, for convenience, before proceeding with the Gnostics, take the secret system of Platonists who Christianised themselves. ARCANE DISCIPLINE. This s ystem was in vogue in the church of Christ between the first and fourth centuries of our era. For a clearer comprehension of the subject we must consider what has already been written in regard to the assimilation of Philosophy and the Mysteries, more e special ly the Serapian, and these to esoteric Christianity; that there is a great identity between these cann ot be doubted; nor that Arcane Christianity was the e ssential adoption of Serapian rites. Tertullian, Origen, Cyril, Theodoret, Gregory, Chrysostom, and others, all allude to these Arcane things, in the precise term s in which the Philosophers s poke of the Mysteries. Basileus s ays that t hey kept t heir doctrines s ecret, their preaching was public; that is, it was esoteric, and exoteric, as the Philosophers held the Mysteries to be. Cardinal J. H. Newman holds that the Arcanum was the introduction of Platonism into the church of Egypt, and he mentions that Amm onius Saccus and Origen were Catechists of the Discipline, and that when the form er established an eclectic sc hool of his own h e swore his disciples to secrecy. The historians are in doubt whether"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Amm onius forsook Christianity, or not, upon founding his School; but, in any case, such a man would give more than h e received. The grades of the System a re given by some writers as follows: -- Catecomonoi or learners; Pistoi or faithful; {159 } Photozomenoi, illuminated or baptised; Memuemenoi or initiated; and Teleioumenoi or perfected. But Bishop Warburton, quoting Casaubon in h is 16th exercise on the An nals of Baronius, gives the degrees as follows: -- Catharsis or purified; Myestis or initiated; and Teleosis or the e nd; but remember the relationship of \"telete\" t o death. Casaubon says, \"that which is c alled a symbol of faith is v arious in its kinds, an d they serve as tokens or tests, by which the faithful may recognise e ach other.\" Minucius Felix says that the Christians were known to each other by signs and tokens, which were a ready pass - port to friendship.<<\"Morals and Dogma\" (Pike), p. 547 .>> Rufi nus c ompared the use of pass - words to those given by a general to his arm y. Clemens s ays: \"Let the e ngraving upon your ring be e ither a dove, emblem of the Holy - spirit; a palm - branch, peace; an anchor, hope; or a ship runn ing, the church; or a fish.\" A F rench writer on Masonry, stated last century that a copy of the Secret Constitutions was in the possession of some Monks on Mount Athos, as late as 1751 , and that they were as old as 327 A.D.<<\"Mac. Adoniramite,\" i, p. 69.>> The church itself was divided into three portions; the Nave for the Catechumens, as was the Vestibule for initiates of the Lesser Mysteries; the Aisles for the Faithful; the Chancel for the Perfected. When the Catechumen h ad completed his probation, which was usually of two years, h e was apparently a Pistos or probationer, and had to fast for 21 days, as usual in the Mysteries; his s hoes were removed and all his c lothing with the e xception of an undergarm ent, and with a lighted taper in h is hand he was led into a room adjoining the c hurch. Prior to Baptism, the aspirant, with his hand raised aloft, and face to the west, or place of darkness, thrice renounced the devil and all his works; then with h is face to the e ast, or place of light, he thrice declared his belief in the doctrines he had b een taught, and his intention to remain a soldier of Christ. The Exorcist thrice breathed upon h im, in the name of Father, {160 } Son, and Holy - spirit, requiring all unclean spirits to depart from him. A prayer was offered that the e lement of wate r m ight be sanctified; and the operator breathed upon h im, in expression of the Holy - spirit. After this he was anointed with oil as a wrestler in the faith; his forehead was s igned with the cross, and salt t endered as emblem of divine wisdom; his ears we re touched with the word Ephphatha -- \"be opened,\" his eyes anointed with clay. He was plunged three times in the water, in the name of each person of the Trinity. He assumed a new name, and was c lothed in a pure white garm ent, and led amongst the Faithf ul; from whom he received the kiss of peace; but for seven days he had to go veiled. He could now attend service in the aisles as one of the Photozomenoi and was instructed in the full mystical meaning of the Lord \u0000 s prayer, which h e was enjoined to repeat thrice every night, as well he was instructed in the e soteric doctrines; this probably made him one of the Memuemenoi, that is those who are in the light. The High - mass of the Eucharist was usually celebrated at Easter, or the festival of darkness and resurrection. In the Jewish equivalent whilst the fully initiated p ronounced mentally the sacred name with the priest, the masses knew only the substituted word Adonai, chanted b y the assistants. In the Church, the Deacons brought water for the Ministers to wash their hands, and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"the kiss of peace was passed round from the priest, the men and women to each other r espectively. The priest offered thanks for the love represented b y the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ. Before e ntering the chance l the priest exclaimed: \"Holy things for holy persons, ye Catechumens go forth.\" Bread and wine were presented. Pliny states that in the Agapae, or Love feasts, all took a sacred oath to be faithful, reveal no secrets, do no wrong, nor steal, rob, violat e a trust, nor comm it any act of unchastity. The comm unicant was now one of the Teleioumenoi or Perfected. There are several points in {161 } this account that we have already related as ancient customs of the Mysteries. No explanation is given of the reason for a long fast, and as this account is but a mystic form of the present exoteric c eremony, we may feel a strong doubt whether it covers all that was done, in the various grades of becoming a Christian. The New Testament repeatedly admits that Jesu s had a secret or Mystical teaching, and something may be gathered from the Fathers. Clemens Alexandrinus, who wrote a century after Apostolic times, says: \"But it will be an image to recall the architype of him who was s truck with the Thyrsus . . . but w e profess not to explain secret things s ufficiently; far from it, but only to recall them to memory.\" Again h e says: \"And was it not this which the prophet meant, when h e ordered unleavened cakes to be made, intimating that t he truly sacred mystic word, r especting the unbegotten and his powers, ought to be concealed.\" Origen, whom Socrates in h is \"Ecclesiastical Hi story\" term s the \"Expositor of the mystical tradition of the Church,\" and flourished 185 - 252 A.D., taught t he pre - existence of souls, and on th e e volution of man in h is ascent to the divine source, he says:<<\"Contra Celsus,\" B. i, ch. 7.>> \"But that there should b e certain doctrines not made known to the multitude, which are (revealed) after the e xoteric ones have been taught, is not a peculiarit y of Christianity alone, but also o f philosophic s ystems, in which certain truths are exoteric and others esoteric. Some of the hearers of Pythagoras were content with h is \"ipse dixit,\" whilst others were taught in secret those doctrines which were not de emed fit to be comm unicated to profane and insufficiently prepared ears. Moreover all the Mysteries that are celebrated everywhere, throughout Greece, and b arbarous c ountries, although h eld in secret, have no discredit thrown upon them, so that it is in v ain that he e ndeavours to calumniate the secret doctrine of Christianity, seeing he does not correctly understand its nature.\" Again<<\"Ibid.\" B. viii, c. 8.>> \"He would have us believe that we and the {162 } interpreters of the Mysteries equally teach the d octrine of eternal punishments.\" Again,<<\"Ibid,\" B. iii, c. 60.>> \"Whoever is pure . . . . let him be boldly initiated into the Mysteries of Jesus, which properly are made known only to the holy and p ure. . . . . He who acts as Initiator according to the precepts of Jesus, will say to those who have been purified in h eart, \u0000 he whose soul has for a long time been conscious of no evil, and especially since he yielded himself to the healing of the Word, let such an one hear the doctrines which were spoken in private to his genuine Disciples. \u0000 \" Again,<<\"Pref. Gos. John .\">> \"To the literal minded we teach the Gospel in the historic way, preaching Christ Jesus and him crucified; but to the proficient, fired with love of the divine wisdom we impart the Logos.\" Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, says that: \"the truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason.\" Both the Mysteries and Arcane Christianity were clearly of opinion that more should not be given than the int ellect could understand."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" It is a moot point how far architectural symbolism was in use by this School, some writers maintain that all these sects used b uilding symbolism, and Christianity was s trong in the Roman Colleges of Artificers. Oli ver asserts t hat in the Catacombs of Rome, a cross was c onstructed of a square, level, and plumb - rule, in such mann er that, if touched, it fell to pieces, and the detected fraternity were supposed to be studying architecture. A representation of the temple of Solomon was found in these subterraneans. That t he learned of these times did not ignore the use of Masonic s ymbolism is v ery certain, and St. Paul term s himself a \"Master Builder,\" who was engaged in erecting the new church, numerous passages of the same charact er occur, hints at initiation, which would lead us to believe that there was a Masonic c haracter in the secret system of the Church. The apocryphal book called \"The Vision of Herm as\" compares the faithful to Perfect ashlars, \"of a true die or square,\" and the less {163 } holy to imperfect stones, and rough ashlars. In the so - called Apostolical Constitution, the church is c ompared to a ship, as it is in the Egyptian \"Ritual of the Dead,\" -- the Minister is Captain, the Deacons Mariners, the congregation are passengers. The Nave of the church is equally an allusion to the ark of the Mysteries. We have some inform ation upon the organisation of the Arcane Church in the \"Stromata\" of Clemens, in \"Degrees of Glory in Heaven corresponding with the dignities of the church below\"; but which is more fully explained b y Dionysius the Areopagite; equally based upon h eavenly and ecclesiastical hierarchies. In each it is 3 x 3 = 9 classes. In the first division we have Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; in the second, Dominions, Virtues, and P owers; in the third, Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. In the e arthly counterpart Jesus s tands in relation to it as does the heavenly Father to the celestial Hi erarchy. The first triplet is baptism, comm union, and consecrat ion of the chrism, representing purification, enlightening, and p erfecting. Second, the orders of Deacon, Priest, and Bishop. Third, Monks, Members, and Catechumens. Here we have the Exoteric, Esoteric, and Divine church. The Lectures of the Order of H arodim -- Rosy Cross, which claim a Culdee Masonic origin, speak of these matters; and the Christian Mysteries, equally with the Platonists, speak of hylics, sepulchres, and the dead, as applying to those who are buried in worldly matters and things of sen se. We have been more diffuse on this s ubject, for the reason that Christian churches c ould only have been built by Masons who possessed its arcanum. There are two accounts which indicate in this c ountry that either the history of the Arcane Discipline is not fully known, or in the other case that t he Culdees had inh erited a special Rite from their Druidical ancestors, a Rite which resembled that of the Mysteries of the Philosophers, and they should b e considered together. The first Culdees had b een Dr uids and St. Patrick is s aid to {164 } have been born at Dumbarton, and to have gone to Ireland in 432 A.D. St. Columba left Ireland with 12 companions in the 6th century, intending to found a Monastery at Icolmkil on an Island in the Hebrides. It was th ought necessary, the legend says, following a widely - spread b elief, that the structure should b e sanctified b y a living sacrifice, and Odrian offered himself for that purpose, and was buried alive; after a lapse of \"three days\" Columba thought he would lik e to have a look at his old friend, and uncovered him; upon which Odrian started up alive, and b egan h is experience: he had learned the truth in the other world, there was no fall of man, no personal Christ, no personal devil,"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"and no hell. The scandalised Columba ordered his friend to be covered up again, \"that he blab no more.\" This tale e nshrines s ome of the alleged heresies of the Culdees for there were many others. It is further explained b y the following account which we copy from Froissart, and Gou gh \u0000 s additions to Camden.<<\"Britann ia,\" iii, p. 641 .>> One Owen, or Tindal, a soldier of Stephen, King of England, repaired to the old Monastery of St. Patrick in Donegal, where was his \"Purgatory.\" He was prepared for his initiation by a nine days \u0000 fast on bread and water, but which Matthew Paris s ays was originally a fast of 21 d ays, and as this fast is reported b oth of the Mysteries and the Arcane Discipline, it serves to conn ect the three accounts. Each day a procession was made round the place, thre e times the first seven days, and six times on the e ighth, bathing each n ight in the lake, such processions and bathings being also a part of the ancient Mysteries. On the ninth day he observes a complete fast of 24 hours, with the e xception of a little w ater, and was then conducted to the Chapel, \"out of which all who enter do not return;\" there was a deep well at one e nd. He then laid d own in a sort of grave large enough to hold the body; the only light being from a single window of small dimensions, wh ich looked out upon a field and a {165 } hall. Here Owen was visited d uring the night by 15 p ersons, clothed in white, who warned him of the trials he would undergo. To these succeeded a troop of demons, who seemed to place him upon a burning pile, which he e xtinguished in the name of Christ. They then dragged him through scenes of torm ent, where the wicked suffer a variety of tortures, such as Virgil gives as c omm on to Tartarus. Standing proof against these horrors Owen is taken in h and b y two venerable persons, who favour him with a full view and d escription of Paradise, corresponding with that shown to Aeneas. After this Owen proceeds on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and after visiting the Holy Sepulchre, returns to Ireland and labours at erecting the Ab bey of Besmagoveisth. Trials were made of this c avern as late as the 15th century, as Froissart records that he had interviewed two soldiers, who had spent a night in the cave, but forgot their visions after leaving the place. GNOSTICS. These sects ar e ancient, and Christian Gnosticism sprang out of sects more ancient than themselves. The word means \"to know,\" in opposition to mere theory, and has deep significance, equally with Veda, Wizard, Witch, all meaning a class \"who know.\" An extraordinary ma n, of the first ages of the Church, was Apollonius of Tyana; Theurgic powers, and many wonderful things are recorded of him: he was an initiate of various Rites, and visited the Indian Gymnosophists, after which h e went about Greece reform ing the Mysteries . As the Catholic Church uses the term Gnostic he can scarcely be considered one of them, but he was born about the same date as the Gospel Jesus and lived to be 100 years of age. The first Gnostic \"of the Church\" was Simon Magus, a contemporary of the C hristian Apostles, who passed at Rome as \"a great power of God,\" t hat is an Aeon or Sephiroth, in the language of the Gnosis and Cabala. He was born at Gitta, in S amaria, and his Gnosis is c ouched in the symbolical language of the period. He was personal ly known to the Apostles, who {166 } clearly considered him a person to be reckoned with, although h e would seem to have looked upon them favourably, and mildly asked Cephas -- \"Pray for m e.\" Some of his enemies admit his honesty and single - mindedness. He had numerous disciples, and was deeply learned in Oriental, Greek, and Jewish culture, as well as Theurgy. As an anatomist, he wrote upon the circulation of the blood, and the physical system of the female. The handle"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"which h e gave to his enemies c onsis ted chiefly in this, that he reform ed and married a beautiful harlot, who repaid him with h er devotion, and whom he believed, whether r ightly or wrongly, to be a reincarnation of Helen of Troy, doomed to such rebirth for her ancient sin with Priam. Irenae us, who flourished in the second century, and was born 116 A.D., says that t he Simonians had a priesthood of the Mysteries, and that such \"Initiated p riests\" practised magic arts, and exorcisms. Simon h ad as disciples Menander, and Cerinthus, a Jewish Cab alist, and Dositheus was a contemporary; they looked upon the Creation in Genesis as c onsonant to the gestation of the foetus, and the temptation of Eve had a like characer, as well as the Garden of Eden. After this followed Saturninus of Antioch; Prodicu s, 120 A.D.; Valentinian, an Egyptian, 130 A.D.; Ptolemy, and Marcion, 136 A.D. A few details follow. \"Carpocratians.\" The founder of this Sect was Carpocrates of Alexandria. He would seem to have been a Disciple of Jehoshua ben Panther, previously m entioned, rather than the Gospel Jesus. It is not improbable that the older portions of the Jewish \"Sepher Toldoth Jeshu\" was a Gospel of Cabalistic Sects, and that Jesus ben Panther was an Essenian leader. The system of Carpocrates taught that Jesus der ived the Mysteries of his religion from the temple of Isis in Egypt, where he had studied for six years, and that he taught them to his Apostles, who transmitted them to Carpocrates. The sect used Theurgic incantations, and had grips, signs, and words; sy mbols and d egrees. His s on Epiphanes wrote {167 } a work on h is father \u0000 s s ystem, but died young. The sect is believed to have e ndured for some centuries. The Comte de Tromelin, in the Paris \"Initiation\" (Oct., 1902 ), says: -- \"Herm es has as s eat a cross between the four branches of which are written the four letters I.N.R.I., in that order. Is it not the grand Herm etic prediction of the Mages attendant on the Messiah?\" \"Cerenthians.\" These were apparently Essenian Gnostics, and made a distinction bet ween the e arthly Jesus and the Angel Messiah that united with the mortal man. Some leading Germ an S avants are now agreed that t he Apocalypse, from the 4th to 21st chapter, was the Gospel of the Sect, the remainder being of later date; in this they agree w ith the Presbyter Cajus of Rome, and Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria, who, according to Eusebius, attributed the book to Cerinthus. \"Marcians.\" Irenaeus gives an account of their ceremony of Initiation, but which the sect repudiated, but the nature of t hese details have some agreement with the modern Dervish sects; there is first a baptismal Invocation, a second to light, spirit, and life; followed b y one to \"angelic redemption,\" by which the Neophyte became united to his Angel, finally a form ula of \"res titution,\" or unity to the super - celestial power, to which the Neophyte responds in declaring his redemption by the name IAO. They g ave numbers to the Aeons. \"Basilideans.\" This s ect was founded b y Basilides of Alexandria, who was a disciple of Menand er, a pupil of Simon Magus; but Clemens s ays that he claimed to have received his esoteric doctrines from Glaucus, a disciple of the Apostle Peter. The system had three grades -- the material, intellectual, and spiritual; and they had two allegorical stat ues, the one male and the other female. A quinquenn ial silence, as in the Mysteries, was exacted from the Disciples; and the doctrine seems to have many points of resemblance to that of the Ophites. It ran on the lines of Jewish Cabalism with a successio n of Aeons, Emanations, and Sephiroth, over which an {168 } Archon, or Angelic -"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"prince presided. They taught that Simon of Cyrene took the place of Jesus at the Crucifixion. Basilides was s ucceeded b y his s on Isidorus, and they say that Matthias c omm unicat ed to them secret discourse, which being specially instructed, he heard from the Saviour.<<Hippolytus, Refutation of all Heresies.\">> \"Ophites.\" The Ophites were an organised fraternity early in the 2nd century as it is s aid to have numbered Valentinia n amongst its s upporters, but Clemens attributes its foundation to Eucrates at the beginn ing of our era. It was v ery Osirian or Serapian, with S emitic names for the Coptic ones. In the \"Ritual of the Dead,\" which is of incalculable antiquity, there are c ertain chapters which refer to secrets of Initiation, which the translators have not mastered, and which h ave reference to the passwords required b y the Guards of the heavenly temple or Amenti, from the aspiring soul, these are illustrated in the Ophite Ri tual. To some e xtent the doctrine corresponds with that of the Mendaens, or followers of John the Baptist. Symbols to represent purity, life, spirit, fire have to be shewn to the Guards. We may imagine such to be the cube, tau - cross, pentagon, or other symbols. \"The soul greets the first power saying: \u0000 I come from thence pure, a portion of the light of the son and father. \u0000 To prove this, the sign must be shewn, as well to every Archon, that the soul passes. To the principal Archon, Ildabaoth, is s aid, \u0000 Greatest and seventh Archon of the Logos, sub - Archon of the Spirit, the through - father - and son, I offer to thee perfect work in this figure, the sign of life. \u0000 The address to Jao is, - - \u0000 To thee I now offer just the same sign figured in the spirit. \u0000 Th en going to the Sabaoth, \u0000 Archon of the fifth perm ission, Lord Sabaoth, proclaimer of the law of the creation, perfected b y thy kindness, by the power of the most mighty fifth number, let me pass. See here the crime - clear sign of thy art, which h as been p assed b y all the previous Archons, in the form of this s ign, a body absolved b y fire. \u0000 After the soul has {169 } shewn this figure thrice it needs no further sign for the succeeding Archon, Aristophanes, but addresses him confidently, \u0000 Let me pass, thou se est one Initiated. \u0000 \"<<\"Originis Opera\" -- de la Rue, i, p. 54.>> These Seven Archons were represented in this System by animals -- Michael by a lion; Suriel by a bull; Raphael by a serpent; Gabriel by an eagle; Thoutabaoth by a bear; Eratsaoth by a dog; O uriel by an ass; these names being Cabalistic equivalents of the Archons, Origen n ames the rulers thus: Adonai (sun); Jao (moon); Eloi; (Jupiter); Sabao (Mars); Orai ( Venus); Astapohi ( Mercury); Ildabaoth (Saturn). Ophite, or serpent symbolism, is ancient as the world, and one of the sacred alphabets represented the writhing curves of serpents. \"Naasene.\" The Naasene were a branch of the Ophites, the name being derived from the Hebrew Naas, a serpent, and we have quoted the words of one of the sect in the last chapter.<<Vide \"A.Q.C.,\" iii, p. 60.>> \"Valentinians.\" The five Gnostic words GR:Zeta - Alpha - Mu - Alpha Omega Zeta - Zeta - Alpha Rho - Alpha - Chi Alpha - Mu - Alpha Omega Zeta - Alpha - Iota, are translated: \"The robe, the glorious robe of my strength,\" and ar e said to have been on the shining g arm ent of Jesus at his glorification; they are said to represent the five mystic powers of the reborn which become seven upon bodily death. Heraclian was a follower of this sc hool, and wrote about 170 A.D. a Comm entary upon the gospel of St. John \u0000 s opening words. \"Bardisanians.\" The founder of this s ect was Bardaisan, a man of noble descent born at Edessa 155 A.D., and d ied 233 A.D. He was author of an Arm enian h istory; a book on the Indian religions; a book of Hymn s; another on"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the Marcionites; Book of laws of the Countries, concerning fate, freewill, and nature. A most beautiful hymn of his s ymbolises the Gnostic Initiation. Professor A. Bevan term s it a \"Hymn of the Soul,\" but t he \"Theosophical Review,\" to which we are indebted for m any hints on Gnosticism, term s it the \"Hymn of the Robe of Glory.\" His antagonists brought these charges against him: -- (1) he denied the resurrection of the body; (2) he {170 } held the theory of a \"divine Mother,\" and a \"Father of life,\" as the origin of the \"Son of the living\"; in other words the Gnostic doctrine of the concealed Logoi; (4) he believed in a number of lesser gods, such as the seven who are said to surround the throne. The subjects appear in the poem m entioned as th e \"King of Kings,\" the \"Queen of the East,\" and the \"Brother next in rank\"; finally the lesser gods are the \"Kings who o bey the King of Kings.\" \"Manicheans.\" The most noted of the Gnostic s ects was the Manichees, whom Herder ranks as a sect of the Pers ian Magi. The founder is s aid to have been a pupil of Scythianus, an Arab of the purest morality, who was contemporary with the Christian Apostles; he studied the Egyptian Philosophy and composed four books designated Chapters, Mysteries, Treasures, and G ospel. A disciple of this man, named Ferbulio, assumed the name of Buddha, it may be to imply reincarnation, and d ying by accident, a widow w ith whom Ferbulio lodged, had a slave of the name of Cubricus educated, and gave him the four books, which h e took into Persia, where he asumed the name of Mani, which means c onversation; it is s aid that the King of Persia had him flayed alive with reeds.<<Vide \"Memoirs of Jacobinism\" -- Barruel.>> The e ntire tale looks like a fable of the e nemies of the sect. In addition to the class of Disciples, the sect had that of Au ditors, who were perm itted to hear the writings of Mani read and interpreted in a mystical form ; a custom we saw followed b y the Brahmins in dealing with the Warriors. The third grade was the Perf ect, or Elect, who were the priestly order of the sect. From these last were chosen the Magistri, or Council, who were 12 in n umber, as in the Culdee system, with a 13th as President. When a Manichee passed over to o rthodoxy in Rome, he was required to c urse his late associates in the following term s, which implies a reference to the Sun - god of the Mysteries: \"I curse those persons who say that Zarades, and Budas, {171 } and Christ, and Manichaes, and the Sun are all one and the same.\" The Sun, Urim, and Mani, being the saviour symbol, and the old Mystery - god, under various names, a Sunday festival was observed in March, when funereal rites were celebrated. On this occasion the altar was adorned with great magnificence, and a splendidly decorated p ulpit, ascended b y five steps, was erected, before which all prostrated themselves. This s ect, in comm on with all the other Gnostics, had secret form s of recognition; Au gustin says: \"signa, oris, manum et finus,\" which Barruel translates: \"three, that of the w ord, the gripe, and of the breast.\" Epiphanius, who had b een a member, professes to give the mode by which they tested strangers -- tickling the palm of the hand with the finger. Au gustine was at one time of his life a Manichee, but failing, f or some rea son, to o btain advancement, withdrew from the sect. Synesius, Bishop of Cyrene, and a pupil and life - long friend of the unfortunate Hypatia, who was torn to pieces by a Christian mob b efore the very altar, continued a Platonist to the last; and he bitte rly reproaches one of his friends for having lightly betrayed to uninitiated Au ditors a part of the Secret"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"doctrines of the Philosophers. The contest between the Roman Church and the Gnostics, broadly speaking, resolves itself into this: first, the histor ical Jesus, the Christ of the Church; and second, the ancient Crestos of the Serapian Culte, the good god, with a Spiritual Cristos to be developed within each Perfected Gnostic. The form er view w as that of Peter and the Judaising Christians; the latter t hat of Paul, Origen, and the British Culdees. The Arcane Discipline was the union of the two, in which the literal history was taught Exoterically, and the spiritual version Esoterically; in the e nd the Church sought to teach both Exoterically. \"Arcane Symbols.\" A number of the peculiar symbols of the various s ects have come down to us, but have not yet been properly classified b y any writer. 1. Those with {172 } a cock \u0000 s head upon the top, and the name Abraxas upon some of them: these may be Mythraic and Basilidean, as the cock was a Mythraic s ymbol; Abraxas is Basilidean. 2. Those with the head, or body of a lion, comm only inscribed \"Mythras.\" 3. Those with the figure or name of the Egyptian \"Serapis.\" 4. Those which h ave figures of sphynx, ape, sc arib, asp, ibis, goat, crocodile, vulture, etc., all Egyptian symbols. 5. Those which h ave human figures and the names Jao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, Basilidean, Ophite, and Jewish sects. 6. Those with a costly monument, and the word \"Abraxas,\" Basilidean a nd p erhaps Manichean. 7. One represented in the work of Chiffalet, which h as upon it 7 stars, and a larger one above them, together with a pair of compasses, a square, and other geometrical emblems, perhaps Cabiric. 8. One in the British Museum engraved by Brother Wm. Hutchinson in h is \"Spirit of Masonry;\" it is in the shape of an egg; on one side is a head which h e interprets as the Ancient of Days or Great - workman; on the other side, sun, moon, five - pointed star, and a serpent; it has an inscription whi ch he interprets: \"The e arth shall praise Thee, 1305 .\" 9. Representations of the eternal Father, with arm s c rossed on breast. 10. To these may be added numerous emblems from ancient gems, chiefly of Greek workmanship, some of which embrace Masonic s igns, some with Pelicans, crosses of all shapes, squares, triangles, circles, point within a circle, etc. The Gnostics had great respect for the number seven {symbol, upright equilateral triangle floating above square} because it results from adding the side vi ew of a square to those of a triangle, or the three principles and four elements, applied spiritually. In regard to the number seven we may quote Mr. T. Subba Row,<<\"Five Years of Theosophy.\">> who says: -- \"Algebraically the number of entities evolved fr om three primary causes is 2 cubed - 1 is 8 - 1=7. Thus the seven rays are e volved out of three primary coloured rays, and the three primary colours exist with the four secondary colours. Similarly the three primary entities, which brought man into existenc e, {173 } exist in h im with the four secondary arising from different combinations of the three primary entities.\" The real cause of the veneration of the Manichees for the reed, upon mats of which they affected to lie, is not very apparent, but it was e verywhere a sacred symbol. In the ancient Finn ish poem of the \"Kalevala\" the \"virgin Mother of the north - land\" conceives a heavenly child who is \"hidden in the reeds and rushes.\" The Hindu goddess Kartikeya was nourished amid reeds. Moses was saved in an ark of bulrushes; and a reed was put into the hand of Jesus, as a sceptre. As the plant grows upright out of water it may symbolise truth springing from sacred d octrine; but as the virgin mother is primal matter, that requires another key of interpretati on."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" The Gnostics adopted the Apostle John as their Patron; his s ymbol was the Eagle, or bird of the sun, which was the Sectarians \u0000 sacred emblem; it is found in Egypt at the foot of the tau cross, and now on the jewel of a Rosy - cross Mason. The Gnostic tokens were a sectarian version of the older pagan \"Tesserae hospitalis,\" on which was the head of Zeus, and under the Roman Empire there was the \"tesserae frumentaria,\" which entitled to a public distribution of grain.<<\"Notes and Queries\" (London, 14 Mc h., 1874 ).>> There was the white stone presented on Mythraic Initiation; and Clemens in h is \"Hortatory Address to the Heathen,\" appears to allude to both sign and p ass, and material token -- \"nam equidem nullo unquam periculo compellar, \"quae reticenda a c cepi hac ad p rofanos enuntiare.\" Again, \"Vel unius Liberi patris symm ystae qui adestis, \"scitis quid d ani conditum celetis et . . . \" t acite veneramini.\" There can be no doubt that the Arcane Discipline had them as tokens of preparation for the Supper of the Lord; many, if not all, the Catholic confraternities present a token which is generally worn under the clothes from a ribbon. Some of the tokens yet preserved b elonged to the Templars, and there are a q uantity of Abbey tokens, which are struck in lead or {174 } pewter with the cross on one side, and on the obverse a variety of designs. \"Esoteric Budhism.\" This living system has every appearance of great antiquity; its s ymbols are ideographs, interpretable in any language, and touch the Mysteries. I t has two divisions, theory and p ractice, or the active and contemplative of the Essenes. The doctrine of the \"heart,\" as opposed to the \"eye\"; the secret path as opposed to the \"open,\" and is the seal of truth,\" which leads to the growth of \"the tree of knowledge,\" or the \"dragon tree,\" which is the development of the \"higher self.\" The \"Secret heart\" has three halls, from which lead two Paths for the \"Listener\" and the \"Exerciser.\" The first is the four - fold Dhyana; the second is the seven n oble gates of virtue opened b y the \"golden keys\" of charity, harm ony, patience, worldly indifference, persistence, until finally the initiate arrives at the attainment of supreme wisdom, by travelling the paths of hearing and seeing. These paths may be compared with the seven Halls and Staircases of the Egyptian \"Ritual of the Dead.\" Similarly we have the \"seven stepped Ladder\" of the \"Golden Precepts,\" each step b eing an advance towards union with the divine, its rungs are of suffering and p ain, its s ides of love. To hear and see reaches the second stage of ascent, when the four senses blend, and p ass into the inn er sense; the fifth and sixth carry perfect renunciation and concentration of the \"higher self\"; on the seventh, \"thyself and mind are like twins upon a li ne,\" the \"star\" which is thy g oal burns over head.<<\"Voice of the Silence,\" transl. by H. P. Blavatsky.>> Thibet like Thebes denotes Sacred Ark, and p oints to the high table - land of Thibet as a centre of the Mysteries. \"Arcane Schools.\" The Gnostic Se cts, Neo - Platonists, and the Mysteries, descended d own the stream of time, with mutual forbearance and goodwill, until l ate on in the fourth century, when evil times c ome upon them. The Church was becoming powerful and intolerant, and there was no room le ft for the Mysteries of Mythras, {175 } Serapis, Bacchus, the Cabirs, Hirtha, Druids, or Gnostics; and the Church considered itself capable to absorb their teachings. The Emperors Valentinian, 372 ; Theodosius, 381 ; Theodosius II., 450 , all forbade the asse mblies of Gnostics, Platonists, and all other r eligious Mysteries, but this but led to greater secrecy and d isguise, for Psellus tells us"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that the Eleusinian Mysteries c ontinued to be practised at Athens in the 8th century, and were never entirely suppress ed. In the sixth century the Gnostics were put to the sword in Persia, but some embraced Islam, and transmitted their system amongst the Dervish sects. In 657 the Manichees had assumed the name of \"Paulicians,\" and it is s aid that in the course of thre e centuries one hundred thousand were put to death by the Romish Church, or at its instigation. The name of \"Cathari\" succeeded and implies, as in the Discipline, purity. Some took the name of \"Euckites,\" others \"Bogomiles,\" \"Albigensis,\" and later \"Lo llards,\" t ravelled over Europe, seeking proselytes, and continuing, either openly or secretly, until modern times. There was nothing offensive in the word Gnostic, it means knowing as opposed to believing. Clemens, in h is \"Stromata,\" uses the word in ort hdoxy thus: \"Happy are they who have e ntered into Gnostic holiness.\" Heckethorn says that in 1022 the Canons of Orleans were burnt for Manichaeism by King Robert; as Cathari they were persecuted in Italy 1150 - 1224 , and were compelled to perform their Rite s in woods and forests, like the Carbonari, and it is not improbable that t he latter whose Mysteries represent the passion of Christ, is one of their branches. \"A further impregnable e vidence of the derivation of Catharism from Manichaeism is furnished by the sacred thread and the garm ent which was worn by all the \"Perfect\" among the Cathari. This c ustom is too peculiar to have had an independent origin, and is manifestly the \"Kosti\" and \"Saddarah,\" the sacred thread and shirt the wearing of which was e ssential to all believers, and the use of which by both Zends and Brahmins s hows that its origin is to {176 } be traced to the prehistoric period, anterior to the separation of those branches of the Aryan family. Among Cathari the wearing of the thread and vestment, was what was known amongst t he Inquisitors as the \"haereticus indutus\" or \"vestitus,\" initiated into all the mysteries of the heresy.\"<<H. C. Lea, \"Hist. of Inquisition of the Middle Ages\" (i, p. 92). London, 1888 .>> This may be the origin of t hat consecrated Girdle, which was one of the charges brought against the Templars during their trials, 1311 - 13. \"Metempsychosis, and the pre - existence of the Soul was an integral part of the system.\"<<J . H. Blunt, \"Dict. of Sects and Heresies,\" London, 1891 .>> This statement is c onfirm ed in n umerous ways, and is even mystically stated in the Graal Poem of Wolfram von Eisenbach. The French writer Aroux quotes Pierre Cardinal the Troubadour, as to the veiled language of the Graal legend, which was of a n ature of the Culdee secret symbolism. He says: \"The ungent which heals all kinds of wounds, even the bites of the \"venemous reptiles,\" is in fact none other but the word of the gospel, so also the \"golden vessel\" in which it (the graal) is c ontained, ador ned with most precious s tones, is none other than the holy g rail i tself, or the book of the Gospels, as the Albigensis had adopted and translated it; the Golden book, the vessel containing the true light, visible only to the Initiated, to the Professors of the Gay Science.\" We shall add later some account of these sects. Early in the 12th century the celebrated St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux says of the Gnostics: \"If you ask them of their faith n othing can be more Christian like; if you observe their c onversation n othing can be more blameless, and what they speak they make good b y their actions. . . . . As to life and mann ers, he circumvents no man, overreaches no man, does v iolence to no man, he fasts much, eats not t he bread of idleness, but works wi th h is hands.\" Another"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Roman writer says that the \"Perfected\" were divided into Bishops, Major, and Minor brothers, and Deacons, and that these abstained from {177 } animal food, and from women. It is related of the Waldenses, who were a branch of the Alb igensis who may have preserved the Arcane Mysteries from their first reception of Christianity, that the Initiated assumed new names, and that when the Believer was on the point of death h e was perfected thus: \"They assembled in a dark room, closed on all sides, but illuminated b y a great number of lights affixed to the walls; then the new Candidate was placed in the centre, when the presiding officer of the sect laid a book (probably St. John \u0000 s Gospel) on h is head, and gave him the imposition of hands, at the same time reciting the Lord \u0000 s prayer; saying also: \u0000 Have pity on this imprisoned spirit. \u0000 \" The last a very Platonic form ula. Saccho says, in speaking of the 13th century: \"In many of the sects their secrets are by no means revealed.\" Limborchi says: \"They had also a peculiar m ann er of saluting each other, by embracing, putting their hands to both sides, and turning their heads three times to each shoulder, saying every time, \u0000 Praise the Lord. \u0000 \" Of the Waldenses, who followed P eter Waldo, who was prob ably a Waldense, it is s aid that \"t hose who are Perfect put in the upper part of the shoe, a Zabbata, a sort of escutcheon, as a sign, from which they are called Inzabbata.\" This s tatement, referring as it does to the 13th century, seems to amount only to this, that they wore sandals or wooden shoes. The Rev. Henry Stebbing (1834 ) says that in the 14th century Pope Honorius III. \"condemned to perpetual i nfamy the Cathari, Patarines, the Leonists, the Speronists, and the Arnoldists.\" VEHM GER ICHTE. Acc ording to Abbe Trithemius, who wrote his \"Polagraphia\" about the year 1500 , the Emperor Charlemagne instituted in 770 for Saxons of Westphalia, or the red earth, a Secret Tribunal, f or the suppression of paganism and b ad morals, \"with secret laws, private signs, and a form of oath. . . . . using amongst themselves c ertain cyphers and alphabets which are now lost.\" The original society was no doubt attached to the old pagan worship. A society very similar to the Holy Vehme was {178 } established at Castil e and Leon, in S pain, in the year 1245 , and d esignated the HER MANDAD. In the 1906 volume of Ars Quat. Cor. (page 31) I printed a paper on the Ritual of the Vehm Court of the year 1490 . In this Ritual the Free Count is s upposed to o ccupy the throne of Cha rlemagne, in the same way that the Master Mason is s upposed to o ccupy the throne of Solomon, but t he curious point is that, with a q uite different object in view, it has all the form ula of Guild Masonry. Bro. F. F. Schn itger inform s me that the three side s of his father \u0000 s house overlooked five of the old Friestules, or places of judgment, and that he has known people who participated in some of the last meetings of the Vehm; and his opinion is that Charlemagne, of whom hereafter we will say something as a builder, adapted the e xisting tribal jurisdiction to his ends, and that t he Secret Tribunal i s the jurisdiction of the ancient priests. The Association possesed two Courts -- an open one (offenes ding) and a secret one (Geheines Gerichte), and to the latt er the Free or Initiated were only admitted. Their laws and signs are partially known, their words absolutely, and their Oath exists in a dozen documents. ALCHEMISTS. The Alchemical Art is doubtless as old as other branches of science and is traceable in Egypt, China, and India, in the e arliest t imes. Modern writers on Chemistry assert that it was practised b y the Essenes and Cabalistic Jews. When it was s uppressed in Egypt it still li ved on in China,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"where the term s used correspond with those of the European Alchemists. In all countries it had three interpretations and three objects: the \"Alkahest\" or universal solvent; the \"Lapis,\" or stone or powder of transmutation; and the \"Elixir,\" or universal medicine. As a secret Mystery in which art and re ligion are combined it no doubt originated amongst a metallurgic people. Thus it is \"physical,\" as we have said; and \"psychological\" in its interpretation and as such allied to Gnosticism; and it is \"moral\" in its relation to humanity. It aimed, in this sense, at converting the \"lead\" of the body, and the \"silver\" {179 } of the soul, into the \"gold\" of the spirit, and it is this meaning that Aristotle employs it when h e says that all men h ave the Stone within them, and that its conversion is the labour of wise men. The Mystic Marriage of the Sun and Moon, in its s piritual and inoperative sense, is the Union of Soul and Spirit to form the Gnostic Crestos. The Herm etic s ystem united all nature inasmuch as \"that which is above is the same as that which is be low.\" When it descends to the mineral kingdom, and the vegetable, it finds in these the same three principles as in man, namely a visible body, a virtue or soul, and a spark of the spirit, term ed salt, sulphur, and mercury, a divine triad {Symbol: Fire}; whilst the four lower principles are e arth, air, fire, water, {symbol: a square}, but which in another phase represents the physical, psychic, mental, and spiritual plains of existence; which are again the fixed, unstable, and volatile. Professor Roberts Au stin, C.B., F.R.S., in a Lecture on Metals, says that the Alchemists \"recognised in metals the possession of attributes which closely resemble those of organisms . . . \" and that, \"the first Alchemists were Gnostics, and the old beliefs of Egypt are blend ed with those of Chaldea in the second and third centuries.\" Alchemy and Masonry were e arly subsidiary schools of the Mysteries. In its operations the Society held that as \"all things proceed from the Will of one,\" so all were again resolveable to firs t principles, and that metals might be separated, refined, and reunited; and they claimed that Moses was an Adept because he possessed the difficult process of reducing the golden calf to a powder. The \"Au rea,\" attributed to Herm es Trismegistus, is one of the oldest Arcane works on the subject, and couched in Egyptian S ymbolism. The writings of Athenagoras have tracers of Alchemy and the Emperor Caligula is said to have e xperimented with red arsenick. Thoelden says: \"Our ancestors united themselves again in the time of Valerius Diocletian in the year 284 A.D.\" However that may be, this worthy in the year 296 was engaged in burning Christians, {180 } Gnostics and Alchemists with zealous indiscrimination, and equally all works on Alchemy and the Secret Scie nces on which h e could lay his v ile hands. Colin MacKenzie<<\"Processes in Manufactures,\" London, 1825 .>> says that, we find Alchemists amongst t he Essenes, Cabalists, Manichaeans, the Herm its of Thebes, and the Gymnosophists of India. The Emperor Julian, who, though term ed the apostate, was one of the purest Emperors Rome e ver had, and apostate from the vices of men like Constantine, restored these Sciences. Zosimus the Panopolite has an express treatise on the \"divine art of making g old and silver.\" Ce drinus, 491 , gives an example of a Magician who professed Alchemy. Morienus, who was a Herm it at Rome, learned the art of Transmutation and the Elixir, from Adsar, who was an Alexandrian and a Christian, and afterwards taught it to Calid, the son of Gezid the Second, who was Sultan of Egypt about the year 725 A.D.; the works of Morienus were translated from Arabic into Latin in 1182 A.D.

During the dominion of the Moors in Spain, the Jews enjoyed consideration, and numbered many o f the most learned men of the time amongst t heir r ace; and p roportionately held in estimation. After the fall of the Moorish power the Jews were persecuted, and in the 14th and 15 th centuries under the name of \"Maranos,\" they met in great secrecy at Inn s, disguised, using g rips, signs, and p asswords; the temple of Solomon was bound to have its prominent place, but it is unlikely unless in the Arch ritual that the Society could have any conn ection with Masonry whose broad and liberal platform is opposed to the e xclusive nature of Judaism.<<Vide \"Freem. Mag.\", 1860 , iii, p. 416 .>> ISLAMITE MYSTICS. We have mentioned that Islamite Gnostics arose in Persia a t an early period; and they claim to be as old as the time of the Prophet. It is s aid that their ori gin is the \"Alli Allahis,\" a continuation of the old sect of Medo - Persian Magi. The Sects are term ed \"Tariks\" or Paths, for they are Pilgrims or travellers on the \"urug\" Or ascent, in which there are three \"ourouens\" -- the road, the stages, the goal. At this time we have numerous s ects of these Mystics, and it is c laimed that Ali, who according to the Persian sect was the lawful successor of Mohamed, founded them by bestowing some article of his c lothing when h e e stablished their orders; thus one sect claims to have received his \"Tailji\" or cap; another his \"Khirka\" or Mantle; another his \"Kemei\" or girdle; thus fixing a succession. \"Benai Ibraham.\" Every reading Mason is aware that {182 } from the time of the original of the \"Cooke\" MS. Constitution s, say A.D. 1400 , it has been handed d own that t he hunter King, Nimr od, was a Grand Master, and that Abraham, who is s aid to have fled from him, taught the Egyptians geometry. It is not worth while to attempt to refute the latter statement, as according t o Biblical chronology Abraham was not in Egypt until about 1925 B.C., but it would b e worth while to ascertain, if we could, what ancient writer, probably Oriental, is responsible for the Abrahamic origin of geometry in Egypt. I am aware, of what I have n ever yet seen mentioned b y any Masonic writer, that"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"amongst t he Moslems, throughout t he world, there is a very ancient Secret Society which claims to derive from the Koreish, or Guardians of the Kaaba, who were a superior Arab race and the descendants of I shmael, and of which Mohamm ed was a scion. In the 1st and 2 nd d egrees of this s ystem precisely the same assertions are made as in the MS. Constitutions of Masonry, whilst the 3rd d egree is devoted to the e rection of the Kaaba by Ibraham, Ismael, and Isaqu e, as the three presiding G.M.M. Sale, in h is \"Preliminary Observations\" to his translation of \"Al Koran\" gives a full account of the legend as to Abraham \u0000 s erection of a square temple similar to o ne destroyed in the deluge, the plans of which were e theria lly let down from Heaven on the prayer of Adam. I am inclined to give credit to the alleged great antiquity of these three degrees of the Sons of Ibraham, for two reasons, or rather three. In the first place Mohamm ed himself confirm s the basis of the leg end in treating of Abraham; in the second place the thirteenth century account of the e rection on \"Salvation Mount\" of the square temple of San Graal, the plans being similarly heaven designed, is admittedly, by the writer himself, taken from Moslem source s; and, in the third place, I believe, with Ashmole, that t he present system of Masonry was a thirteenth century reform of an older system. In 1872 the late Bro. Mackenzie organised the \"Order of Ishmael,\" of 36th Degree, the basis of which, he inform ed m e, {183 } he had from an Arab in Paris, and in 1884 I was myself in relation with Prince Moustafa ben Ismael, ex - Prime Minister of Tunis, then in Paris. But Mackenzie \u0000 s idea seems to have been that our Biblical legends were the transmission of the \"Order o f Ishmael,\" of which the \"Sons of Ibraham\" were a very ancient branch, or, as he term s it, the oldest secret society in the world. M. Edmond Demoulins in h is work \"Anglo - Saxon S uperiority,\" which h as created an imm ense sensation in France, says that in all the Oases, or Deserts, under Moslem r ule Secret Brotherhoods (Zalouahs) exist, and he quotes, in confirm ation, M. L. Ponsard on ancient Egypt and Chaldea in prehistoric times. He says: \"They have their passwords, their signs of recognition, and are ru led by an official hierarchy which starts from the Grand Master, or Khalif, and ends with such subaltern agents as the messengers, bann er - bearers, guards, etc. There are general assemblies for the purpose of receiving instructions from the Khalif, or for the initiation of fresh members, or again to promote the rising of the population against some interior, or exterior foe. This v ariety of patriotism inspired the societies which form erly occupied the two large Oases of Assyria and Egypt, at least, during the first part of their history, which extends over the time when, recently issued from the Desert, they still were under the more or less domination of the Brotherhoods and p riests of Amm on. Mahomet and his votaries also partook of this s pecies of patrio tism, and so did all the Societies started under the inspiration of Islam, whether in the Arabian Desert and the Sahara, or at their two extremities from Asia Minor to Spain.\" \"Brothers of Purity.\" This was an association of Arab p hilosophers s eated at Bosra in the 10th century. They had form s of Initiation, and they wrote many works, which were afterwards much studied b y the Spanish Jews.<<\"Royal Mas. Cyclo.,\" K. R. H. Mackenzie.>> \"House of Wisdom.\" The Tarik of the House of Wisdom was founded at Cairo and had seven Initiatory {184 } degrees. According to von Hamm er, who gives his Arabian authorities, Abdallah a Persian, living in the 9th century of the Christian era, accepted, what was the Gnostic doctrine, of the Aeons, or Sephiroths, or emanati ons of divinity, and applied the system to the successors"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"of the Prophet of Arabia, upholding Ismael as the founder of his \"Path,\" and one of his descendants as the Seventh Imaum. This man created \"Dais,\" or Missionaries, for the propagation of the system , and was s ucceeded b y his s on and grandson. One of the name of Karm ath brought the \"Path\" into repute. The Secret Institution was now seated at Cairo and term ed the \"Dar - al - hicmet,\" translated Tent of Skill, or House of Wisdom, and Assemblies were held twice a week, when all the members appeared clothed in white. The members were advanced gradually through a series of Seven degrees, over which presided a \"Dai - al - doat,\" or Missionary of Missionaries. Their then Chief, Hakem - bi - emir - Illah increased these degrees to nine and erected, in 1004 A.D., a stately building which h e abundantly furnished with mathematical instruments. In 1123 the Vizier Afdhal destroyed this building, but meetings c ontinued elsewhere. Corresponding with the seven (or nine) grades of the Society was a seven - fold gradation of officers: -- Sh eik, or Grand Master; Dai - el - Keber, or Deputy; Dai, or Master; Refik, or Fellow; Fedavie, or Agent; Lassik, or Aspirant; Muemini, or Believer. The Initiate was s uccessively taught that there had been 7 holy Imaums; that God had sent 7 Lawgivers, who in the interval of their appearance had each 7 Helpers, and that each of these had 12 Apostles. It would appear that in 1150 the Sultan of Egypt recognised the grades of the Society, for when a speci al rank was c reated for the learned Jewish physician Maimonides, it is added that \"t he e nlightened men of the kingdom were divided into seven grades, each occupying a corresponding position n ear the throne\";<<\"The Talmud,\" Polani, p. 226 .>> it is also a sl ight confirm ation of what we have said respecting the Spanish affinity with the Egyptian. {185 } Sir John Maundeville, of St. Albans, served with the Sultan about 1320 and would seem to have been h alf converted to Islam; he relates that t hey denied the cru cifixion of Jesus, and asserted that Judas was s ubstituted in h is place. \"Assassins.\" Before the year 1090 , one of the Dais of the House of Wisdom admitted an Aspirant of the name of Hassan S abah, who thus details his conversion: \"I had b een reared, li ke my fathers, in the doctrine of the 12 Imaums, but I made the acquaintance of an Ishmaelite Rafeek named Emir Dhareb, with whom I knit fast the bonds of friendship. My opinion was that the tenets of the Ishmaelites resembled those of the Philosophers an d that the Ruler of Egypt was a man who had b een initiated into them.\" Hassan goes on to relate that he finally g ave his fealty to a Dai named Moomen, set out for Egypt, and was met on the frontier by the Dai - al - Doat. Hassan saw that the failure of the \" House\" as a political Society arose from the lack of a fortress, and set about to remedy this defect. He obtained b y a cunn ing strategical purchase in the year 1090 the Castle of Alamoot. Here he founded the Society of \"Assassins\" in seven degrees, the C lass of Fedavees being those devoted to the main object, the killing of the e nemies of the order. At a later period the Society was dispersed, but yet exists in its s even degrees in India a nd other countries, under its old d esignation of \"Ishmaelites.\" DRUZES. About the same period as the foundation of the \"Assassins\" a Dai of the name of Hamsa prevailed upon the Druzes of Lebanon to accept t he Initiatory System of the House of Wisdom. These Syrian Mountaineers are a peculiar r ace who are probably of Phoenician descent; it is known that before the time of Hamsa they possessed secret Rites, Degrees, and modes of recognition.<<\"Vide Ars Quat. Cor.,\" iv, Smith.>> It was probably a phase of the Assyrian culte, such as is possessed b y the Yezids, who worsh ip sun,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"moon, and b ull, and have signs of recognition.<<Ibid, iv, Yarker.>> From the time of {186 } Hamsa they have remained faithful conservators of the organisation received from him. The Sect recognises s ix degrees of which the three first are typified by the \"three feet of the candlestick of the Inn er Sanctuary which h olds the five e lements,\" and these \"three feet\" are \"the holy application, the opening, the phantom,\" referring to man \u0000 s inn er and outer soul, and the body of matter. The Ignorant are pr esided over by the Akkals or wise, and these are of three higher grades, which represent more advanced principles and d evelopments. The members are sworn to absolute secrecy, and strictly observe their oath. They are known to have signs of recognition wh ich are comm on to Freemasonry.<<Ibid, iii.>> They also profess to have some tradition relative to assistance rendered at the building of Solomon \u0000 s temple, but this may only be one of their m odes of hoodwinking the Cowan. Blavatsky, who was an Initiate of the Sect, inform s us that the fundamental principles of Hamsa a re chastity, honesty, meekness, and mercy; and that its basis is the old Ophite Gnosticism, which, in the most ancient t imes, claimed imm ense antiquity as the builders of the Draconian stone e nclosures, scattered over the old world, and even America. The Society admits, like other Ishmaelite Mystics, an affinity with the Platonic philosophy, and festivals are held at which raisins and figs are e aten; which it is thought is one of the tests of membership; it reminds us that priest Cyril of Jerusalem<<\"Catech. Lec.,\" vi, 23.>> speaks of the \"detestable ceremony of the fig.\" The Aspirant before admission h as to undergo a long fast, which is entire on the last day, and a species of trance vision i s induced b efore the ceremony closes. \"Ainsarii.\" The Ishmaelite Sect continued to exist after the destruction of the stronghold of the Old Man of the Mountain, as the Chief of the Assassins was term ed. The most prominent of these is named the Ainsari i; they hold secret meetings for r eceptions and have signs, words, and a Catechism. Lyde, who has investigated this Sect, {187 } classes them with ancient Templars, and Modern Freemasons.<<\"The Asian Mystery,\" Rev. C. L. Lyde.>> \"Dervishes.\" The variou s \"Paths\" of the Dervishes are very ancient and spread from branches in Persia a nd Egypt. Though their r ites and d octrines vary from one another, the object of all i s s imilar to each other and to Magian and Indian Yogism, namely, Union with the Deity. We will take the \"Bektash\" as typical of the others. In the 15th century, Bektash of Bokhara, received his \"Mantle\" from Ahmed Yesevee, who claimed d escent from the father - in - law of Mohamed. On this he proceeded to establish a \"Path,\" consisting of seven n ominal, but four essential degrees. These are magical i n their nature, inasmuch as they aim at establishing an affinity between the Aspirant and the Sh eik, from whom he is led, through the founder, and the Prophet, to Allah. Their Initiatory ceremony is shortly as follows. After a year \u0000 s probation, during which the Aspirant is tested with false secrets a lamb is killed from which a cord is made for his neck, and a girdle of Initiation for his loins; he is led into a square chamber, and b etween two arm ed attendants, who present him as a slave who desires to know truth. He is led b y the cord round his neck, and one of the axes used, or carried b y these godfathers is in the writer \u0000 s possession, bearing on one side the name of Ali and the other that of Moham ed. He is then placed b efore a stone altar on which are twelve e scallops. The Sh eik, who is attended b y eleven others, grips the hand of the Aspirant in a peculiar way, and administers the oath of the order, which is equivalent to the Monkish vow"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"of pove rty, chastity, and obedience. He is then inform ed that death awaits him if he betrays his order; and he makes his profession in.the following form ula: \"Mohamed is my Rheper (guide); Ali i s my Murchid (director).\" The Sh eik then asks: \"Do you accept me as your Murchid?\" and upon an affirm ative reply adds: \"Then I accept you as my son.\" {188 } He is invested with a girdle, on which are three knots, and receives an alabaster stone as token. The sign of recognition is that of the first degree in Masonry. Th eir grace is c alled the \"Gulbend,\" or \"rose of fraternal love.\" Amongst t heir important symbols are the double triangles {Symbol: Hexagram} and two triangles joined at the apex {symbol, like an \"X\" but with the top and b ottom chevrons c losed to equilatera l triangles}. One of their m axims is, \"the man must die that the saint may be born.\"<<\"The Dervishes,\" J. P. Brown.>> As a Jewel they make use of a small marble cube with red spots to typify the blood of the martyred Ali. The Sects are not popular with the orthodox Turkish Mussulmans, but all branches s wear to devote themselves to the interests of their order or Path with body and soul. The Jewel of another branch, in possession of the writer, has at the top a small green stone, and suspended from this by three silver chains, is a large sized bloodstone, oval; and from this again is s uspended three other chains: the first three chains has two small silver discs , the second three has each a silver disc and two are double, in all making seven. The Mantle of the order has on each shoulder a representation of the Sword of Ali. Amongst t he imm ense number of operative Masons employed b y the Saracens, there must have been a large number of such Initiates, but it is not intended b y these details to absolutely identify Freemasonry with the Societies using the form ula; but t o shew the e xistence of certain ancient features in comm on with the Arcane Schools in various c hann els. Yet it is quite possible that t he original Roman ritual of the Guild may have been mod ified b y the addition of Solomonic legends preserved in the East, or on the other hand taken \"en bloc\" from the Jewish Guilds of Syria a nd Egypt, and the probability is that the Jews of Spain were in a position to hand on the Guild system, but we shall ent er into this later. TEMPLARS. The rule of the Templars resembled that of the Benedictines and Cistercians, and was drawn up b y {189 } Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, some short t ime after their establishment in 1118 . In it t he prelate term s them \"Valiant Maccabees\"; they were to wear on their clothing and horses neither gold nor silver; not to have more than three horses each, because, as he says, they could not rival \"the world renowned temple of Solomon,\" on the site of which they had acquired a residenc e. The reception was a strictly secret one, which gave rise in 1310 to a shameful persecution. Before admission to the Chapter the Aspirant was thrice cautioned as to the rigorous trials that he would have in becoming a member, and asked if he firm ly per sisted in h is demands to proceed, and if he responded in the affirm ative he was admitted to the Reception. In an old number of \"Blackwood \u0000 s Magazine\" appears what professes to be the burial service of a Templar, no authority is given, but we know no rea sons to deny its authenticity. It is a highly symbolical ceremony, at which the classes of Preceptors, Knights, and Servitors were present; and the Grand Master presided with an iron h amm er in h is hand, with which three knocks were struck upon an iron cro ss. The three classes had each an active part in the ceremony; and in answer to a q uestion of the Grand Master: \"Know ye for a"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"truth that our brother is dead, and ripe for the long sleep of the grave?\" A Serving - brother takes the hand of the corpse and a nswers: \"The flesh cleaves not to the bone, nor the skin unto the flesh, he is dead.\" After other questions seven knights advance to the corpse, and p lace their hands upon the head, eyes, face, mouth, heart, hand, and feet with a fervent blessing, and the corpse is then lowered into the grave.<<\"Vide Fre. Mag.,\" 1864 p . 205 ; \"Rosicrucian,\" 1876 . p. 75; A. Q. C., vi. The late Bro. Albert Pike revised the ceremony for the Kadosh burial service of the A. & A. Rite.>> It has been maintained b y von Hamm er, that the members of the Order were Initiates of the Cairo House of Wisdom, and the resemblance is peculiar, both had {190 } secret receptions, a similar government, and b oth used white and red in their clothing. That they had a secret reception is beyond d oubt, and one of their m axims was that \"secrecy is the soul of the order.\" Au thorities differ very much as to this s ecret reception; those who believe in the Gnostic heresy of the order, assert that such Initiation was adopted from the Saracens about year s 1250 - 70, and which added to their old Reception, a degree of Professed wherein the cross was trodden underfoot; a girdle was given to the Initiated; he was taught an Enlightened Deism, and made a disciple of John the Baptist. If there was s uch a ceremon y as indicated it would b e as a test of obedience. The third grade, it is s aid, was for high Officers; a symbolic Gnostic c ord was c onsecrated by the head of Baphometis, and p resented to be worn under the clothes. Blavatsky says that the Nazarians of Per sia have a tradition that they initiated the Templars.<<\"Isis Unveiled,\" p. 232 .>> The head here mentioned may allude to two words -- Baphe metios, or Baptism of Wisdom, and represent the head of John the Baptist; but de Quincey suggests that it is c abali stically composed in substituting B for P to refer to the Pope and Mahomet, whose tenets the later Rosicrucians designated \"blasphemies of the East and West.\" On the other hand the Secret Mysteries of the Templars are said to have been the Arcane Discipli ne, and to have referred to the faith of Christ. Philip le Bel, King of France, and P ope Clement V. combined in 1309 to suppress them, and in 1313 the latter dissolved them on the plea of Gnosticism, which would apply to any of these suppositions. Ther e was in the time of the plenitude of the Templars a peculiar Culdee legend travelling around term ed the \"Quest of the Sangrael;\" it was s upposed that there was a lost cup, which h ad contained the blood of the Saviour, that could only be found b y a chaste Knight who journeyed in search of it. It had, if found, various magical properties, oracular answers to enquiries c ould b e {191 } read thereon. Von Hamm er professes to read the \"Graal\" upon certain old offertory dishes which h e considers to have been Temp lar property, but his views have not been generally credited. There are yet certain ceremonies practised alluding to Joseph, Jesus, and Mary, said to have been of Culdee origin, that have a sober resemblance to the Quest. The Mystic tradition may hide th e old b lood b aptism of the Mysteries. Eugene Aroux speaks v ery positively of an Albigensian and Templar conn ection with the legend, which is supposed to have some basis in the Gospel of Nicodemus. San Marte takes the same view and lays s tress upon the us e by the Templars, at the Lord \u0000 s Supper of the opening words of St. John \u0000 s Gospel. The Rev. Baring Gould gives c redit to a Templar conn ection with the Mythos. Von Hamm er says the poem of Titurel is nothing but an allegory of the Society of Templars and i ts doctrine"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"and one with the Gnostic and Ophite symbols. This legend is a lengthy subject to write upon, but it is necessary to say something upon it. The origin of the Graal l egend is c urious, romantic, and ancient. The Persians have a legend of a go lden cup d iscovered in making the foundations of Persepolis which they named the \"Goblet of the Sun\"; we have also the Herm esian cup in the Poemander. There is also the Welsh legend of Peridur, which means \"Companion of the Bowl.\" Peridur enters a castle , and two young men enter a room, where he is s eated, with a lance from which falls three gouts of blood, which the company seeing set up a lamentation; then enter two damsels, with a charger in which is a head swimm ing in blood, and the company utter a pi ercing wail. The bowl here is the Cauldron of Ceridwen, and the blood is the three drops of her brew that conferred intuition. In Hanover there is s ome Templar conn ection with a charger and the head of John the Baptist, to be mentioned later. Taliesen \u0000 s poem of Bran the blessed mentions the bowl of Pheredur, which could restore the dead to life, \"but those who were restored to life by it were not t o speak lest t hey should {192 } divulge the mysteries of the vessel.\" Bran sails to the \"Island of Joy,\" wit h 39 Companions. M. Pauline de Paris mentions the \"Liber Gradalis\" of a British priest about 30 years after the death of Cadwallader. About t he year 717 the priest had a vision of Christ, and of Joseph of Arimethea, who brought t he cup to this country, with the blood of Christ. These legends admit their indebtedness to the Moslem legends, and there can be no doubt as to what that legend is; it refers to the e rection by Abraham of the Temple of Seth, which we refer to elsewhere, in which on the petiti on of Adam an etherial temple was let down in appearance to which Adam could direct his prayers. The more modern version of the legend was c ompiled about 1189 , under the title of \"Sir Coules del G rail,\" by Chretien de Troies. Saniber, prince of Cappado cia in the days of Vespasian, had three sons, who went eventually to Rome; and his great - great grandson Titur - el was the Graal King, and the pure and noble Knight. When dying the Graal King instructed his c hildren in the mystery, and the Knights had expla ined to them the symbols, ceremonies, and the powers of the 12 p recious s tones. Sh ortly after we have the version of Guyot de Provens, who had b een a monk with Bernard of Clairvaux, and visited Jerusalem about the year 1170 ; it was an elaborated version o f the preceding, which the author as well as Guy de Provens attributed to the Arabian astrologer and p hilosopher Flegantan. This was translated into Germ an about the year 1207 b y Wolfram von Eschenbach, and would b e known in 1248 when Conrad von Hochstett en laid the foundation stone of Cologne Cathedral. Later on another version was c ompleted b y Alfred von S charfenberg. In the oldest account Titurel builds the Graal temple, but in this last version it is Parsifal, grandson of Titurel, who is s elected to build a magnificent t emple upon a design miraculously shown on curtains of light, and upon a mount called \"Saviour \u0000 s Mount\" placed in the midst of a \"square\" wood, the temple {193 } itself was to be \"round,\" as are the Templar churches. The plan appears mi raculously upon a stone, and indicated an inn er Sanctuary to hold the Graal, which was to be guarded b y chaste Temple, or Templar Knights, for both these form s are used in different MSS . The groining of the roof was to shew a lamb holding a red cross bann er in its c laws (a Templar standard). The Lecterns were to have carved Apostles, Martyrs, Prophets, and their \"wise"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"saws\"; and in one of these MSS . England is named in conn ection with four crowns, four virgin martyrs, and their legends.<<\"Freem. Quart. Ma g.,\" 1853 ; also \"Canadian Craftsman,\" 1892 .>> Besides the Glastonbury legend of this cup and the account of the Romances of King Arthur, another claim is made for a Sapphire cup in the monastery of Richeneau, Lake Constance, founded b y Charles Martel in 7 25; there is also a third claim for a cup said to have been brought from the East by the Crusaders, and lodged at Genoa; it is now believed to be made of green glass. A Benedictine Monk of St. Werburgh in Chester, where the Polychronicon was c ompiled, o ften quoted in Guild MSS ., Hy. Bradshaw, who died in 1513 , has s ome very similar ideas wherein h e is describing the feast of King Ulpha given at the Abbey of Ely, when h is daughter Werburge took the veil. The tale also runs on the line of the old Masonic Constitutions. The tapestry of cloth of gold and arras. The story of Adam, of his wife Eve, and how they were deceived was \"goodly wrought.\" Cain and Abel making their offering. Tubal and Tubal Cain were pourtrayed, \"the inventours of Musike and Crafte .\" \"Noe and his s hyppe was made there curyously, Sendying forthe a raven which n ever came again, And how the dove returned with a branch h astily.\" Abraham was there on a mount t o o ffer up Isaac.

At the fea st which followed each spake freely: -- \"Knyghtes of theyr chivalry, of Crafts the comm on.\" The e vidence of Titurel speaks well for the Templars, yet it is possible that some of the Preceptories may have introduced Oriental Rites and Symbols. Von Hamm er, confirm ed b y Hallam and other writers, states that in various Preceptories their m ost secret place (crypt) contains indecent emblems sculptured, without particularly describing these. It may be said that one of these is a female figure holdin g in each h and a staff, at the head of one of which is the sun, and on the other the moon, whilst at her feet is the five - pointed star and other symbols. This is Basilidean in its c haracter and there are references to the Templars c onfirm ing a statement \" by Sun and Moon.\" Addison mentions a copper m edallion, intended to be worn around the neck b y"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"a chain, and which was found in France; it consists of the double e quilateral triangles interlaced, and enclosed within two circles, and in the centre is the lam b and b ann er of the Temple.

It had a bearded face with a woman \u0000 s body. In one hand it held the sun, in the other the moon, by chains.\" (Gould \u0000 s N. & Q. xi. p. 188 .) Von Hamm er m entions Templar churches at Erfurt, Schoengraben, and Prague, as c ontaining such emblems -- the square, level, triangle, compasses, compass es with quadrant, interlaced triangles, the flaming star, the Tau cross of Egypt. All such matter confirm s the charge of Gnosticism, but such decoration may be due to the Masons who erected the Churches; and the symbolism equally with the Reception of a T emplar have points of affinity. The Templars were large builders, and Jacques de Molay alleged the zeal of his order in decorating churches on the process against him, 1310 , hence the alleged conn ection of Templary and Freemasonry is bound to have a subst ratum of truth. A French version of the Compagnn onage asserts that, during a dispute, a section placed themselves under the patronage of Jacques de Molay, the Master who was roasted to death on an island in the Seine in 1314 b y the vicious sc oundrel Phili p le Bel. Nicolai, quoted in \"Acta Latamorum,\" asserts that in Italy are several churches form erly belonging to the Templars, which h ave preserved the name \"l \u0000 eglise de la Mason,\" as derived from the table Masa, a club, that is tyled b y a Mace or club; bu t Paciandi considers the derivation to be from Magione, as the places were used for residences; there are some such in France as well as Italy. Besides the symbols already mentioned an old writer of the name of Assemani mentions a shield, on which is the lamb, the cup, and two crossed torches. The last was a Mythraic s ymbol, and the chalice or cup was a comm on symbol of the order. They used the cross patee, the e quilimbed cross, the Latin cross, the patriarchal cross; in later times they adopted the Eagl e as a symbol. Recently a Lecture by Brother F. F. Schn itger has s hown that most {196 } of the Charges of 1310 are e xplicable, by an evil construction being placed on ceremonies in use by the Masonic branch of the order last century. There is a body in Fr ance of which Philip of Orleans was the Grand Master in 1705 , which claims to have continued the order;<<Vide Ars Quat. Cor., iv, Yarker.>> in Portugal it changed its name to Knights of Christ; in S cotland it preserved its name, owing to the wars that Bruc e was c onducting against England, and in Hungary it continued to exist in n ame. Frater Ladislas de Malczovich, of Budapesth, has made a study of Templar history, tracing them in their Standards, Badges, and Seals, and d ivides these into three periods: - - 1. The \"Beauseant,\" of black and white, was the standard of the Hospitallers of St. John before the institution of the Temple Order, and are moreover their colours. But on the grant of a Red Cross they assumed the \"Vexillum Belli,\" a white standard c harged with a red cross; and they then attached a secret Mystery to the old b lack and white standard, with a plain cross. In the third period they used the cross \"patee,\" in place of the plain cross."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" There were also three periods in the Seals. The fir st was two Knights on one horse. This is s uperseded b y the head of Christ crowned with thorns, and it has three stars placed triangularwise. The last Seal is found near the Order \u0000 s dissolution, and is a single - headed eagle with wings expanded, upon a hig h rock, and looking heaven - wards; at the top is a small cross \"patee\" and two stars. Of their crosses we find the following in use: -- the \"patee;\" the e longated cross; the patriarchal cross; also a plain equal - limbed cross with a lamb in the centre hol ding the red cross bann er. Arm orially, they used the crossed torches, a chalice, and the Agnus Dei upon a shield. There are various instances in S culpture which prove the importance of the Chalice symbol; in some cases Knights are represented as holdin g it aloft, and there is also a representation of two serving {197 } brethren with one arm r ound each other, whilst the right hand, in one figure, holds the chalice, and the other has a book under the arm , which is c onsidered to allude to it, and to be one with the Chalice of the Graal. 1st Period: \"Beauseant,\" Black and White. \"Seal\": Two Knights on one horse.

The French Templars adopted a Gospel called the \"Leviticon,\" which they alle ged was discovered in the Temple at Paris, with other things; and Heckethorn states that it was c omposed in the 15th century by a Greek Monk Nicephorus, who sought to combine Moslem tenets with Christianity. POETICAL GNOSTICISM, TROUBADO URS, G AY SCIENC E. The persecution of the e nlightened b y the Church of Rome necessitated various disguises by the Sectarians -- Poetical, Artistic, Theosophic and Herm etic -- and it could not be otherwise; humanity, in the abstract, seldom abandons that which it \"knows\" t o be true and takes s teps to transmit it t hrough the centuries: truth n ever dies. One of the modes employed was to speak, or write, in a language that will bear a double interpretation, the one intended for the ordinary hearer, and the other for the Initiate who had the Key of interpretation. Masonic MSS . term it t he arts of Logic and Rhetoric. This custom was undoubtedly prevalent in the most ancient times and Mythology, Cabalism, etc., are e xamples of it. Heckethorn mentions c ertain \"Knights of the Swan,\" who sang in this s peech in the e arly part of the 12th century, and the same writer observes that t he Minstrels and Troubadours of France were divided into four degrees. It is {198 } very probable that many of our own northern minstrels trans mitted from the time of the Culdees, who existed until the Templar persecutions, an anti - papal programm e, and were in the secrets of the Continental Minstrels in the time of Wycliffe, and later. The artistic participation in this propaganda is s hewn in th e way that the vices of clerics and monks are satirised b y stone and wood carvers; as in the representation of an ape carrying the Host; a nun in the lewd embrace of a monk; or a pope amongst the damned.<<Findel, \"Hist. Freem.\" >>"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" Gabriel Rossetti<<\"Dis q. on the anti - papal spirit which produced the Reform ation.\">> shews that the species of writing which we have named was introduced from the East by the Manichees, who passed it on to the Cathari, Albigensis, Ghibellines, and Templars, through whom it spre ad over Europe. Logic was c onsidered b y them the science of expressing thought in a subtle mann er. Many persecutions arose from this s pecies of writing, but the Papal Conclave at length determ ined to close its eyes, rather than make the allegory apparent to all the world. The reform ation liberated to the world various Mystic Societies. With the object of proving his v iews he quotes largely from Dante, Petrarch, Boccacio, and other poets and writers of the middle ages, and arrives at t he conclusion that there e xisted three principle branches of Sectaries, which indoctrinated their Disciples by a secret Initiation of seven or nine degrees, according to the Rite or Sect. The allegory used was often that of a journey, and to go o n a Pilgrimage to the temple of St. John signified to become a proselyte of the Templars; to go to St. James in Galicia was to be of the Albigensis; and St. Peter \u0000 s at Rome of the Ghibellines; the Albigensis, in alluding to the first named, expressed Faith; to the second Hope, and to the last Charity. We have an Oriental pilgrimage in Boccacio \u0000 s \"Filocopo,\" which means a young workman; seven Companions figure in this account; the names of four are already known to the Pilgrim and represent t he Cardinal {199 } virtues; the other three are unknown until he has accomplished his journey, or initiation, upon which it appears that they are Faith, Hope, and Charity; in allusion thus to the ancient ladder of the Mysteries of 3, 7, or 12 steps. The object was to found a Christian Jerusalem to rival Rome; and the allegory frequently alludes to the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the return of its people; the later Reform ers drew upon the same idea a s we will show. The writer has, however, gone over this more at length in an earlier book, and space does not admit of it here.<<\"Notes on S c. and Relg. Mysteries,\" 1872 .>> An acute and learned historian<<\"Philosophy of History,\" Fredk. von S chlegel, p. 456 >> takes a similar view, on the spirit of the age, and has the following, in which h e is alluding t o Freemasonry: \"As to the origin of this esoteric influence, the impartial historical enquirer cann ot doubt, whatever m otives or views s ome may have to deny the fact, or throw doubt on its authenticity, that the Order of Templars was the chann el by which t his s ociety, in its ancient and long preserved form , was introduced into the West. The religious Masonic s ymbols may be accounted for by the Solomonian traditions c onn ected with the very foundation of the Templars, and indeed the occasion of these symbols may be traced in other passages of holy writ, and in other parts of sacred history, and they may very well admit of a Christian interpretation. Traces of these symbols may be found in the monuments of the old Germ an architecture of the middle ages.\"<<\"Ph ilosophy of History,\" Fredk. von S chlegel, p. 456 >> Rossetti holds also that Barbarossa, Henry VII. and Frederick II., are the leading characters referred to in the double language of Dante \u0000 s works. The latter was the grandson of Frederick Barbarosso ( Red Beard) who died in S yria at t he head of 150 ,000 Crusaders. The Popes thrice e xcomm unicated the grandson, whom Matthew Paris term s the \"wonder of the world\" (\"Stupor Mundi et imm utator Mirabalis\"), and truly he was -- he was s uspected as a heretic even a Moslem, hereditary King of Sicily, he was the last Christian King of Jerusalem, the last who ruled {200 } the holy land, or wore a crown in the holy city; the most successful of the Crusaders s ince Godfrey de Bouillon, and"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"gained Jerusalem by policy; was excomm unicated for going there; excomm unicated for coming back; excomm unicated as a Sectarian, of which the Pope distinctly accuses him, and there is a fable of 1378 b y John of Florence, in which h e is named as a man \"fond of the \u0000 gentle language. \u0000 \" Ther e is no doubt it is this man whom in 1767 Morin mistook for Frederick II. of Prussia in the Rite of Heredom, which see later. We have said that the art of expressing things to bear a double meaning was taught as part of the \"Trivium,\" and Dante, who is thought to have been a lay Brother of the Templars himself tells Con Grande that t he \"Divine Comedy\" admits of four keys of interpretation -- literal, allegorical, moral, and mystical. He speaks of Christ as \"Him our Pelican,\" an Egyptian S ymbol of the So thic cycle, the bird b eing mystically said to fly every 1260 years to the altar of the Sun at Heliopolis, where it was c onsumed b y fire, and out of its own ashes restored to life. Ozanam, a Roman Catholic, considers the \"Divine Comedy\" to follow the same lines as an Initiation into the Mysteries of Egypt. Vecchioni, president of the Supreme Court at Naples, took the same view, and sought unsuccessfully, to print a book thereon, to prove that such Initiation h ad b een handed d own by philosophers and p oets, and that the \"Divine Comedy\" was arranged after the plan of a \"Teletes,\" ending in an \"Eposis,\" or divine vision. Loiseleur, a French writer, considers the teachings of the Sects as c losely conn ected with the Euchites, and b oth Cathari and Templars girdle d themselves with a white thread like the Hindu and P ersian Mystics. They made use also o f Symbolic ages, as is done to define degrees. Reghellini of Scio treats Dante as a Cabalist and Rosicrucian. King<<\"The Gnostics and their Remains.\">> quotes the 1 8th canto o f the \"Purgatory\" as \"replete with the profoundest symbolism which the Freemasons c laim for their own,\" to wit, the imperial {201 } eagle; the mystic ladder; the rose and cross; pelican; supper of the lamb; pillars of Faith, Hope, and Charity; sy mbolic c olours; letters and geometric figures, as point, circle, triangle, square; the trampling of crown and mitre under foot; the \"Vito Nuovo,\" and the \"Convito\" or Banquet being equally mystical. To these may be added the Invocation of Divine vengeance upon the destroyers of the Templars, and the choice of St. Bernard as the High priest.<<Vide \"Theos. Rev.,\" viii, Cath. Hill ard.>> It is not, however, the Masonry of the Guild, but that which h as been added thereto. Mrs. Cooper - Oakley has s ome pregnan t remarks upon the TROUBADO URS, who were the undoubted p oets of the Albigensian h eresy; and quotes Baret \u0000 s Paris work of 1867 as to the following Schools, all of which were again subdivided into groups: -- That of Aquitaine; of Au vergne; of Rodez; of Langu edoc; of Provence. Again classified as: -- The Gallant; the Historical; the Didactic; the Satirical; and the purely Theological. Again of the Mystical; the Herm etic. Aroux demonstrates that their \"Celestial Chivalry\" was derived from the \"Albigensian Go spel,\" whose Evangel was again derived from the Manichaean - Marcion tradition. These Albigensis were identical with the Cathari, and the Troubadours were the links bearing the secret teaching from one body to another. \"Thus one sees them taking every form by turns, artizans, colporteurs, pilgrims, weavers, colliers . . . . deprived of the right to speak they took to singing.\" Amongst the most illustrious of the Troubadours was Alphonso the Second, King of Arragon, 1162 - 96. Peter the Second of Arragon w as the principal ally of the Albigensis and Troubadours, and in 1213 p erished nobly in their cause at"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the Battle of Muret. Escaping from their burnt and b loody homes, not a few of them hastened to the Court of Arragon, where they were sure of protection. Says Ticknor, in h is \"Hist. Spanish Literature,\" London, 1849 : \"Religious romances were written....in the {202 } form of Allegories, like the \u0000 Celestial Chivalry, \u0000 the \u0000 Christian Chivalry, \u0000 the \u0000\u0006\u0005 night of the Bright Star \u0000 ; and the \u0000 Celestial Chivalry, \u0000 of Hieronimo de San Pedro (Valencia, 1554 ) uses s uch titles as (1) \u0000 The Root of the fragrant Rose, \u0000 and (2) \u0000 The Leaves of the Rose. \u0000 \" In the paths of the Dervishes the candidate is s aid to \"take the rose\" of the path. The basis of the Christian legend of the Graal i s s aid to be found in apocryphal gospel of Nicodemus, which was translated into Provencal verse, \"a Mystical G ospel\" in every sense, says Paulin Paris, who in referring to the MS. in the Vatican (of the Graal), further writes: \"This latter text was of great antiquity and evidently mystical, showing a profound k nowledge of the Apocryphal G ospel concerning the secret teachings of the Eucharist.\" Eugene Aroux thus s peaks of the grades of the Troubadours: \"Like the other Aspirants to the Sectaria n priesthood they went into seminaries or lodges to receive instruction; then h aving become deacons or squires, having undergone tests and given required p ledges, they were admitted to the rank of Perfect Knights, or Perfect Troubadours. Having thus gradu ated they started in the character of Missionaries or of Pilgrims of Love, as Dante says, sometimes undertaking long and d angerous journeys \" -- \"i.e.,\" as Wild or Errant Knights. (Aroux). ROSICRUCIANISM. In the 13th century we have traces of an organ ised b ody of men professedly Christian, who had organised themselves after the mann er of the Oriental Societies. The name with which we head this article had not then become prominent, but at a later period it became the generic title by which everything of the nature of Cabalism, Theosophy, Alchemy, Astrology, and Mysticism was designated. It is s tated in a Rosicrucian MS., lying at Cologne under the nom - de - plume of Omnis Moriar, that a Society term ed the Magical Union was established at this city in t he year 1115 . F. C. E. Weise mentions it<<\"Rosenkreutzer in seiner Blosse,\" -- Amdsterdam, 1786 .>> and gives {203 } the conditions for entering this body of \"Wise Men,\" the last and youngest possessors of the secrets of the ancients; the Initiates wore a t riangle as s ymbolising power, wisdom, and love. They had secret sciences, known only to the highest among them, called Mu - alpha - gamm a - omicron - sigma, Mage, or Wise Masters, able to do things that seemed supernatural. Traces of an organised b ody are to be found in the \"Rosary\" of Arnold d e Villanova, \"circa\" 1230 , inasmuch as the Cabalistic term of \"Sons of the Order\" is used. In the \"Theoria\" of Raymond Lulli \"circa\" 1322 there is a passage in which mention is made of a \"Societas Physicorum,\" and also o f a \"Rex Physicorum.\" Also in the \"Theatrum Chemicum Argentoratum,\" 1628 , a Count von Falkenstein, Prince Bishop of Treves in the 14th century, is term ed \"Most Illustrious and Serene Prince and father of Philosophers.\" Hence it would seem that besides the Moorish S chools which existed in S pain, there were similar associations amongst Christians. It is not difficult to account for the transmission of such Brotherhoods from ancient times, since the Cabalists and Gnostics s tudied the secret arts, and it is qu ite probable that t he persecutions to which these were subjected were prompted rather by alarm than any real abhorrence of their pretended heretical doctrine. A few of the more curious and important works may be mentioned here."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" The \"Romance of the Rose \" is an Initiative system in the Allegory of the Gay Science, in which the term Love is used Theosophically. Eliphas Levi says: \"It is the most curious literary and scientific work of the middle ages, it carries on the chain of the tradition of Initiatio n.\" Heckethorn h olds that, \"it divides the degrees into four and three, producing again the Mystic number seven . . . . it describes a castle surrounded b y a sevenfold wall, which is c overed with emblematical figures, and no o ne was admitted into the cast le who could not explain their m ysterious meaning.\" Amant is admitted into this beautiful garden, which is s urrounded b y walls on which is painted figures of 9 vices, such as hatred, envy, avarice, {204 } etc. Discourses take place between the ladies and gentles assembled, and at the close Amant appears as an arm ed Pilgrim, wearing a scarf and b earing on h is s houlders the usual burthen, with description of how he succeeded in introducing it through the wicket of the Tower, and \"gathers the roses,\" upon whi ch h e returns thanks to Venus, her son, and the nobles assembled. The work was begun by William de Lorris, about 1282 , as the Templars and other Orders are mentioned, and the e arly use of the word Macon appears in it. It was c ompleted b y Jean de Meung, a nd Geoffrey Chaucer translated it. Meung wrote also, \"The Treasure\" or seven articles of the faith, \"The Testament, the Codical,\" on life and Morals, also two poems, entitled, \"The Remonstrance of Nature to the wandering Alchemist,\" and \"The Reply of the Alchemist to Nature.\" Other Societies would seem to have abandoned art, and confined themselves, like the Dervish sects, to a Mysticism which aimed at \"uniting its members to God.\" Brother R. F. Gould relates that the famous Dominican John Tauler, who was born in 1290 and d ied in 1361 , established a Fraternity the members of which concealed their place of burial and recognised each other by secret signs. He was followed b y Nicholas of Basle, who had four companions, styling themselves \"Friends of God,\" in whom they sought to be \"wrapped up\"; these also had secret signs of recognition. The most noted Alchemist of this c entury was Nicholas Flamel, a poor scrivener of Paris, who, by the art, became e norm ously rich. He purchased for 2 florins in 1357 an ancient book b ound in brass, which appeared to be written on leaves made from the bark of trees, perhaps the papyrus; it was s ubscribed by \"Abraham the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levite, Astrologer, and P hilosopher.\" It had thrice 7 leaves, and every seventh l eaf was a picture, symbolising the Great Work. Flamel travelled about in search of some one who could aid him in interpreting the contents, and after m uch loss of time, trouble, and {205 } experiments, he succeeded in making g old. According to his own acc ount he bestowed the riches thus acquired in erecting and endowing 10 churches, 3 chapels, and 14 hospitals in Paris alone, and others in two o ther cities, besides aiding indigent families. He relates how in the Church of the Inn ocents, Rue St. Denis, Par is, he caused to be e rected \"Hieroglyphical Couvertures,\" of the art of transmutation, under veils of the \"Mysteries of our Salvation.\" We learn from a recent reprint that the Count de Cabrines told Borel, that the actual book of Abraham the Jew passed in to the possession of the celebrated Cardinal Richelieu.<<\"Nic. Flamel,\" Pref. Dr. W. W. Westcott (Fryar, Bath).>> In the possession of a Germ an gentleman, to whom we will refer later, there is a copy of an old MS. which claims to be of the year 1374 , th at mentions the \"Fraternitas Rosae Crucis,\" and it was in the year 1378 that the beginn ing of the Fraternity was attributed to Christian Rosenkreutz. Up to this period there"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"is a lack of the nature of Alchemical Symbolism, but the following is beyond doub t. Borel describes the house e rected at Montpelier, about the year 1450 by the celebrated French traveller and financier Jacques Cuer or Coeur. It was named \"La Loge,\" and Coeur is represented on the frieze with a \"trowel in h is hand.\" \" Three porches ma y there be seen in the form of a furnace; similar to those of Nicholas Flamel. On one there is, on one side, a \"sun\" all over fleur - de - lis, and on the other a full \"moon\" also covered with fleur - de - lis, and surrounded b y a hedge or crown as it were of tho rns, which seem to denote the solar and lunar stone arrived at perfection. On another portal is s een, on one side, a fruit - tree with branches of roses at its foot, and on the tree the arm s of Jacques Coeur. On the other is an escutcheon, and within it wh at would appear to represent t he chemic c haracter of the sun. On the third p ortal, which is in the midst, there is on one side a stag bearing a bann er, and having a collar of fleur - de - lis environed with a branch of a tree, to represent Mercury, {206 } or t he philosophical matter, which at the comm encement is v olatile and light as in the stag; on the other side is a shield of France supported b y two griffins.\" This s ymbolism has nothing in comm on with that of Flamel, who does not profess to have been an I nitiate, but one who having acquired some oral inform ation of the first agent of the work, acquired the art by experiments conducted b y himself with the aid of his wife; but on the other hand it is much in keeping with that of Abraham the Jew, and therefor e argues a great antiquity. The whole symbolism is s o equally Masonic and Alchemical that it would b e difficult to say definitely to which S ociety it belongs; both S ocieties seem to have a comm on transmission, the one as a building, the other as a Mystic Fraternity; the natural inference here, on this evidence, is that Coeur was a member of both S ocieties, and that he combined the symbols. Alchemically the Sun and Moon signify g old and silver; the chemic c haracter of the sun is a point within a circle; th e branch of a tree, said to represent Mercury, has nothing to define the species. It may be mentioned here that the Syrian Mysteries of Adonis represented the slain God as c hanged b y Venus into a red rose; and Theodoratus, Bishop of Cyrus in S yria, assert s that t he Gnostics deemed \"Ros\" to be a symbol of the Saviour; the Egyptians c onsidered the rose as a symbol of regeneration and love, and as the Latin word Rosa is derived from Ros, the dew, it has a relation with baptism; hence the rose - tree in Christia n symbolism is the image of the regenerated, whilst dew is the symbol of regeneration. In the Crypt of St. Sibald \u0000 s in Nuremberg, is a double triangle, interlaced with a circle, within which is a rose. Basil Valentine, who flourished at the same time a s Jacques Coeur, in h is \"Azoth Philosophorum,\" has a figure which is thus described: it represents a winged - globe on which is a triangle inside a square, upon which reposes a dragon; on the latter stands a human figure with two heads, and two hands; surrou nding the heads, one of {207 } w hich is male and the other female, are the sun, moon; and five stars; the hand on the male side holds a compass, that on the other a square. The symbolism here clearly alludes to the dual sexual nature of all metals. In \"Th e Triumphant Chariot of Antimony\" it is asserted that the Adept should b e capable of building his own furnaces. The most noted of the Alchemists after this date was Philippus Au reolus Theophrastus Bombast of Hohenh eim, who was born in 1493 , and d ied in 1541 , and there is a strong suspicion that it was from injuries inflicted b y his"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"enemies. Whilst travelling in the East he was taken prisoner by the Tartars, who treated him kindly, and the Khan sent him with h is s on to Constantinople; it is probable that he studied Magic in these regions. He had studied Magnetism and initiated medical treatment by mercury and opium. Franz Hartman, M.D., has s hewn the identity of his teaching with the Eastern Adepts of the Secret Doctrine. His philosophy divides man int o seven principles of the outer and inn er body; (1) the visible body; (2) the mumia, archaeus, or vital force; (3) the sideral body, which gradually dissolves; (4) the animal soul, comm on to all things; (5) the rational soul; (6) the aluech, or spiritual s oul; (7) new olympus, or divine spirit, which must be caught and b ound to the other principles if man is to become imm ortal. He fills the e lements with spirits of many kinds, and mentions the Flagae, who act as our guides and familiars, and instruct us in the sciences. He designates himself \"Monarch of Philosophers,\" and the \"Comte de Gabalis,\" a work of 1675 - 80 d efinitely states that he was elected \"Monarch\" of the Rosicrucian S ociety. We will now refer to a few Societies which seem to have been Cabal istic or Speculative rather than Alchemical, but with a tinge of the Sciences. Between the years 1400 to \"circa\" 1790 there e xisted at Lubeck a Guild called the \"Compass Brothers\" which met twice a year; their badge was a compass and sector suspended from a crowned letter \"C,\" over which was a radiated triangular plate; in {208 } 1485 they adopted chains c omposed of these e mblems united b y eagles \u0000 tails.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor., iii, p. 120 .>> About the year 1480 a Society was established at Rome under the name o f the \"Platonic Academy;\" it was a revival of the School of Plato, and the Hall i n which they met is s aid to contain Masonic emblems. Another Society, which may have sprung out of it, was the \"Brotherhood of the Trowel,\" at Florence. It was c omposed of e minent architects, sculptors, and p ainters, and continued until last century. There are some old d rawings in Paris which represent its members as Labourers, Assistants, and Masters; the latter appear with a trowel in their hands and a hamm er in their gird le; to the Labourers are assigned p ails, hods of mortar, the windlass, mallet, chisel, and rough ashlar. Their patron was St. Andrew, whose festival was c omm emorated ann ually by peculiar ceremonies allied to the old Mysteries, such as the descent into Had es through the jaws of a serpent.<<\"Freem. Mag.,\" 1868 , xvii, p. 131 .>> The celebrated Inigo Jones, to whom Anderson attributes quarterly meetings on the model of the Italian Schools, may possibly have known something of this Society. Pico de Mirandola a nd Reuchlin gave themselves to the study of Cabalism and Theurgy, as did the Abbe Trithemius who was the friend, instructor, and co - labourer of Cornelius Agrippa. Use was made at this period of a form of the Masonic c ypher in 9 chambers, with a Key which being dissected and triply dotted gave 27 letters. Trithemius attributes this to the ancients, and he gives numerous c yphers.<<Vide Barrett \u0000 s \"Magus.\">> Agrippa established in Paris and elsewhere a secret \"Theosophical Society\" with peculiar Rites of adm ission, and signs of recognition, and when h e was in London in 1510 as the guest of Dean Collet he e stablished a branch in that city. There is a letter of Landulph \u0000 s to Agrippa introducing a native of Nuremberg who was dwelling at Lyons, and whom he \"hope s may be found worthy to become one of the Brotherhood.\" Agrippa says, as to Alchemy, that he {209 } could tell many things were he not \"as one Initiated sworn to secrecy.\" Eirenaes Philalethes, whose real name is not certainly known, and who was author o f several Rosicrucian works, 1667 -"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"78, term s Agrippa \"Imperator\" of the Order. Agrippa distinctly states that outside operative Alchemy, which is v ain and fictitious when practised literally, there is another to be sought within man \u0000 s own self in the opera tion of the internal spirit.<<Vide Barrett \u0000 s \"Magus,\" p. 179 .>> There is a possibility that the well - known \"Charter of Cologne\" may have reference to these Brotherhoods; it professes to be signed in 1535 , by the representatives of 19 lodges, assembled at Cologne on the Rhine, and amongst these signatories are those of Coligny and Melancthon; these somewhat doubtful Lodges do not profess in the document to be operative, but to have sprung out of the Masonry dedicated to John , about the year 1440 . An Americ an writer attributes to John Bunyan the allegory of Initiation in h is \"Pilgrim \u0000 s Progress;\"<<\"American Freemn.,\" 1865 .>> it is not very satisfactory but Bunyan \u0000 s \"Solomon \u0000 s Temple Spiritualised\" was probably used in the 18th century, for Craft and Arch Lec tures. \"Rosy Cross.\" There are traces in 1484 of a Rosicrucian Order at Sleswick, in Denmark: \"Fraternitatus Rosarii Sleswicii condito, ann o, 1484 .\"<<\"A.Q.C.,\" v, p. 67.>> Early in the 17th century there are traces that the King was head of such an or der.<<Private Letter.>> Again, last century, such an order unconn ected with Freemasonry was patronised b y the King and seems to have consisted of seven degrees, according to the statement of an aged Danish physician to Colonel W. J. B. M \u0000 Leod Moore, who c onn ects it with the Arcane Discipline; though its imm ediate source will be the Order of Rosy Cross; and it will be sometime found that the peculiar aspect of Swedish Masonry is due to this old Danish S ystem. A Society term ed \"Militia Crucifera Evangelic a\" held a meeting at Lunenberg in 1571 ; and one Simon S tudion {210 } w rote a book in 1604 entitled \"Naometria,\" or Temple Measuring, or the Temple opened b y the key of David, referring mystically to the inn er and outer m an carried to the temple of the New J erusalem; the MS. refers to the Rose and Cross, and to the \"Militia Crucifera.\" A Society called the \"Friends of the Cross,\" existing in Holland, is s aid to have joined an operative Lodge of Freemasons before the year 1726 , when Count Spork, who had b een initiated therein, according to Brother Malczovich, established a Lodge in Au stria in that year, and a medal was s truck, of which one side represents the New Jerusalem.<<Vide \"A.Q.C.\">> In the year 1614 appeared anonymously a work entitled the \"Fame and Confession of the Rosy Cross.\" It relates the Eastern travels of a certain Christian Rosenkreutz, at the e nd of the 14th century, who was Initiated at Damascus into the Secret Wisdom of the Arabians, Chaldeans, and Gymnosophists; then after visiting Egyp t and Morocco, he returned to Germ any, where he e stablished a small fraternity, which was to be continued secretly for 120 years, each brother, before he died, to appoint his s uccessor. At the close of 120 years, that is about 1604 , some alterations were made in their temple of the Holy Spirit, when h is remains were found intact with the book T in h is hand. All the paraphernalia a nd instruments were there necessary to constitute the Order. The work inform s us that they had received the Order \"from the Ar abians. . . . The Eastern countries have been always famous for Magical and Secret Societies.\" Here the founder translated the book M (Marginal, \"Liber Mundi\") into good Latin. The \"Fame\" was to be translated into five languages, that even the unlearned might hope to belong to the Fraternity, \"the which should b e divided and p arted into certain degrees.\" They exacted"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"\"vows of silence and secrecy,\" and \"though they held out the Rose as a remote prize, they imposed the Cross on those who are e ntering.\" T he mention of a book which contains all that has yet been written in other books is s upposed {211 } by some writers (perhaps unn ecessarily) to refer to the Tarot. Another work, entitled, \"The Echo o f the Divinely Illuminated Fraternity of the R.C.,\" 1615 , asks the question whether the Gospel put an end to the secret tradition and answers it thus: \"By no means; Christ established a new College of Magic amongst his disciples, and the Greater Mysteries were revealed to St. John and St. Paul.\" This, Brother Findel points out, was a claim of the Carpocratian Gnostics. There e xists in the library of the University of Leyden a MS. by Michael Maier which sets forth that in 1570 the Society of the old Magical brethren or Wise Men was revived under the name of the Brethren of the Golden Rosy Cross. The \"Fame and Confession\" is usually attributed to J. V. Andrea, but Brother Dr. W. Wynn Westcott points out that though the two tracts may have been edited b y this author they are apparently of different eras. The \"Fa me\" shews no evidence of a divided Christianity, but ranks only against Mohamm edanism, whilst the \"Confession\" is Lutheran, and implies a post - reform ation date. Andrea is admittedly author of \"Christian Mythology,\" Strasburg, 1619 ; and \"Ehrenreich Hohen felder von Aister Haimb,\" 1623 , in which are the following lines, translated b y Brother F. F. Schn itger: -- \"And if we here below w ould learn, By compass, needle, square, and p lumb. We never m ust o \u0000 erlook the meet, Where with our God has measured us.\" Andrea employed himself in spreading a Society called the \"Christian Fraternity,\" no doubt a branch of the older Societies of the Cross, and lists of members are preserved b eyond the date of his death in 1654 .<<de Quincey.>> The Universities had their Scholastic oaths, Luther and Fludd mentions them, and they would seem to have had form al Rites, for the latter in h is \"Mosaicall Philosophy,\" 1659 (p. 31) {212 } repudiates \"any allegiance which I have by a ceremonial rite vowed unto Aristotle in my y outh.\" Michael Maier, who published his \"Silentia post Clamores,\" 1617 , says, \"Like the Pythagoreans and Egyptians the Rosicrucians exact vows of silence and secrecy. Ignorant men have treated the whole as a fiction; but t his has a risen from the five years \u0000 probation to which they subject even well qualified Novices before they are admitted to the higher Mysteries; within this period they are to learn h ow to govern their tongues.\" Maier published in the same year as this the \"de Vi ta Morte e t Resurectione\" of his friend Robert Fludd. There e xisted at the Hague in 1622 a Rosicrucian S ociety with branches in Amsterdam, Nuremberg, Hamburg, Danzig, Mantua, Venice, and Erfurt. \"The Brothers wore a black silk cord in the top b utton h o le; a MS. of last century says that this c ord was given to them after they had p romised, under oath, to be strangled with such a cord rather than break the silence imposed upon them. Their other sign is, that when they g o into company they all wear a blue ribbon, to which is attached a golden cross with a rose on it, and this they are given on being received into the Society. This they wear r ound their necks under their coats, so that not much of it is v isible; the golden cross hangs"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"down on the left side . The third sign is that on the top of the head they have a shaven place, about the size of a louis d \u0000 or, as you may see on myself; hence most of them wear a wig in order not to be recognised; they are moreover very devout and live very quietly. The four th sign is that on all high festivals, very early at sunrise, they leave their r esidence by the same door (\"i.e.,\" the East), and wave a small green flag. When another of them appears at a place where one lives, he goes to this s ame place, and there they enter into conversation, in order to recognise one another; for at t he beginn ing they do not t rust one another. Thus they have a certain \"Greeting,\" among themselves, which is as follows. The Stranger says to the man h e is v isiting, {213 } \u0000 Ave frater \u0000 ! t o which the other answers, \u0000\u0006\u0007 osae e t Au reae \u0000 ! Then the first says, \u0000 Crucis \u0000 ! They then, both together, say \u0000 Benedictus Deus Dominus Noster, qui Nobis dedit signum. \u0000 Then they have a large document to which the Imperator has affixed the secret seal.\" Th e M.S. from which this is taken is a part of the documents in possession of Mr. Karl \"Kisewetter,\" who is a grandson of the last Imperator and who says that the seal which the last Imperator used in office between 1764 - 1802 is of brass about the size of a mark. It consisted of a shield within a circle, on which was a cross, at the base of which was a conventional rose with five petals; at t he top, bottom, and sides was the letter \"C\" signifying, Crux Christi Corona Christianorum (the cross of Christ is the Christian \u0000 s Crown).<<\"The Sphynx,\" Leipzig.>> The English leader of the Rosicrucians was Dr. Robert Fludd, a deep student of the Cabala, Astrology, Alchemy, and Magic. He published at Leyden, in 1616 , his Rosicrucian \"Apologia,\" after a visit that Mai er paid to England. In 1629 appeared his \"Summ um Bonum,\" and \"Sophia Cum Moria Certamen,\" in which, in answer to Father Mersenn e as to where the Rosicrucians resided, he replies, -- \"In the house of God, where Christ is the Corner stone,\" a spiritual work , in which men are the \"living stones.\" He speaks in 1633 \"of the form erly so - called Rosicrucians who are now known as Sapientes, Sophoi, or Wise men,\" and impresses on the reader that it is \"under the type of an Architect they erect their House of Wisdom .\" There was a Mr. Flood who presented a copy of the Masonic MS. Charges to the Masons \u0000 Company of London, and as Robert Fludd died 8 th S eptember, 1637 , and resided for a long time near Masons \u0000 Hall he was probably a Mason<<Vide \"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" viii, p. 40 - 43.>> Maier (as quoted in Initiation) says that numerous s ocieties of Rosicrucians had arisen by the various interpretations placed upon their ancient symbols, and that the Society consisted of an outer and inn er circle to which last t he most {214 } es oteric part was c onfined, and there is much which would cause us to think that Fludd \u0000 s Society of the name was the Masonic Masters \u0000 Fraternity, known as the Harodim, and all Continental tradition of the High - grades, or Masters \u0000 grades, support this. Dr. John Dee, John Booker, William Lilly, and Father Backhouse are well known Occultists, but as Masons we are more interested in two men who were not only g iven to those pursuits, but were also well known Masons, Sir Robert Moray, who was made a Mason at New castle - on - Tyne in 1641 ; and Elias Ashmole, who was made at Warrington in 1646 . It is c onjectured that Thomas Vaughan, the author of many Rosicrucian works under the assumed name of Eugenius Philalethes, may have been accepted in 1641 , or thereabouts; he w as a friend of Ashmole, and the language of some parts of his works c orresponds with our Ritual; Moray also patronised him."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" Elias Ashmole in h is Diary makes s everal mentions of the \"Feasts of the Mathematicians and Astrologers,\" and under 1653 says that Father Backhouse, when at t he point of death, \"instructed him in syllables of the matter of the Philosopher \u0000 s Stone.\" In \"Theatrum Chemicum Britann icum,\" 1652 , he gives from the \"Breviary of Philosophy,\" the Oath of the Alchemists, which S ociety he says was divided into Sons, and Fathers: \"Will you with me to - morrow be content, Faithfully to receive the Blessed Sacrament, Upon the Oath that I ball heere you give, For ne gold, ne silver, so long as you live; Nei ther for love you beare towards your kinn e, Nor yet to no great man, preferm ent to wynn e, That you disclose the seacret I shall you teach, Neither by writing, nor by swift speech, But only to him, which you be sure, Hath ever searched after the seacrets of nature, To him you may reveal the seacrets of this art, Under the cover of Philosophie, before the world you depart.\" The symbolic tracing of the Rosicrucians was a Square {215 } Temple app roached b y seven steps, of which the four first represented the four elements, and the remaining three salt, sulphur, and mercury, the three great principles; here also we find the two Pillars of Herm es, the five - pointed star, sun and moon, compasses, squa re, and triangle. ILLUMINATI. This Society was founded 1 st May, 1776 , by Professor Weishaupt, of Ingoldstadt with the object of arriving at political power, and revolutionise religion and governments. It is only related to o ther Societies in so far as this that Weishaupt, Knigge, and Bode drew upon ancient mysticism for their Ritual, and induced their own members to spread themselves into the Masonic Lodges to influence the Society. Its grades were: -- 1st Degree Novice; 2nd Degree, Minerval; 3rd Deg ree, Minor Illuminee; 4th Degree, Major Illuminee; 5th Degree, Directing Illuminee -- Scottish Knight; 6th Degree, Epopt, or Priest. These were e ntitled the Lesser Mysteries, and had their \"Insinuators,\" and \"Scrutators,\" whose duties were to collect info rm ation from the members. 7th Degree, Regent; 8th Degree, Mage, or Philosopher; 9th Degree, King Man. These were the Greater Mysteries. The order used the Persian era of 620 A.D. Each Initiate had a characteristic name assigned, usually taken from clas sical li terature; and very much of their Ritual appears in the Abbe Barruel \u0000 s \"Memoirs of Jacobinism.\" Some of their Chapters s tudied Alchemy, and the Masonic Lodges equally dabbled in this Art, but we shall allude to it in our Chapter on the High Grades. Inn umerable Societies of Mystics exist in America, but we have no space e ven for their names, and must t herefore refer the reader to Vol. II. of \"The Rosicrucian,\" 1908 , by S. C. Gould, Manchester, N.H., U.S.A., under the head of \"Arcane Societies.\" SOCIETIES OF CHINA. There e xists amongst t he Chinese certain S ecret Societies which profess, in some measure, to continue a system of Brotherhood derived from ancient customs, and which may have arisen out of their ancient Guild life. The members are sw orn to support {216 } each other; to be of good"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"morals, and they have secret signs of recognition. The Initiation is c ouched in Symbolic Mystery and d ivided into degrees; its aim corresponds with other Societies of which we have already g iven particulars. \"The Thian - ti - Hwii,\" or Heaven - earth - league is ancient, and said to be traceable in 1674 . The Candidate before reception h as to answer 333 questions. \"The Triad Society.\" The Candidate, scantily clothed, is introduced into a darkened room, between two members, who lead him to the President, before whom he kneels. A knife is placed in h is right hand, and a living cock in h is left. In this position h e takes a very lengthy oath to aid his brethren even at the risk of his life; he is then directed to cut off the head of the cock; the blood being collected in a bowl, by a slight puncture it is mingled with h is own blood, and that of the three chiefs who o fficiate at the ceremony. He is then warned that death will be his own fate if he should b etray the Order. After this he is intrusted with the signs and tokens of recognition, which run in threes; as, to take up anything with three fingers. Generally speaking these Societies aim to continue an ancient Symbolical System, but have added p olitical aims, and are therefore discouraged. Scattered over the world are numerous s ocieties which are believed to continue the Mysteries of the Ancients, but we need not burthen our pages further with them. Heckethorne \u0000 s \"Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries\" may be consulted; and the subject will be partially referred to in our later chapters. \"Conclusion.\" In closing this c hapter we may point out that there was an undoubted conn ection between the Herm etic Societies and Freemasonry, apart from the similar ity of the symbols employed b y both. Basil Valentine is quoted as s aying that a man cann ot be called an Adept unless he can build his own reverberatory furnaces, in which is required the skill of a Mason and {217 } an expert geometrician.<<\"Briscoe \u0000 s Const itution,\" 1715 .>> Thomas Norton, 1477 , states that Masons were students of the Herm etic art; Paracelsus term s himself a Grand Master of Mechanical Secrets; \"The Wise Man \u0000 s Crown,\" of 1664 , equally asserts that the Masons were students of the Secret Scienc es, but we shall have to allude to these again. On the whole it would rather seem that Masons who desired to extend their learning sought Herm etic Initiations, but at a later period these latter m ade use of the Guild system of the form er, as a convenien t basis for their own views, and wants. But t he main issue of this c hapter is that whilst Masonry is a synonym of the Art branch of the Mysteries, the Arcane, Mystic, and Herm etic Schools transmitted the rites and d octrines of the Greater Mysteries though shorn of old splendour, until such times as Freemasonry reunited the two divisions, in what was techn ically term ed Ancient Masonry though itself of modern organisation. {218 }  ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"  FR EE MASONRY  CHAPTER VII. RE CAPITULATED PROO FS OF ANC IENT MASONRY. THE inform ation embodied in the foregoing pages might have been extended to a great length; and in giving so condensed an account the tastes of th e general reader have been consulted. Some recapitulation of the salient points may be advisable as a short preparation for the chapters upon Masonry which follow; by way of laying the foundation for the introduction of the Association of Geometry, Craft and Art, or what is now called Freemasonry, into England. Though Free Masonry, using this term to indicate a Brotherhood embracing religion, morality, symbols, and art, has passed under various names according to the language of the country in which it has existed, yet the most casual reader m ust have observed that the various Schools which we have described, as derived from a primitive system, had all the same e ssential Rites, and are in agreement with the Masonic System. The mere fact of the use of an organised system of esoteric Marks in architecture, in all time and in all countries, is itself proof of equal continuance of degrees, and ceremonial rites, in affinity with them; but we are not solely dependent upon this, and though the proofs of a conti nuation of a secret Society is naturally less prominent than in the case of a Church or a Sect, they are strong enough to remove all reasonable doubt on the subject. {219 } The e vidence which we have already adduced goes to shew that t he first Great Myst eries were, at the very least, a union of the traditions of religion and art. The various phenomena of life, the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, their effect on vegetable and animal li fe were carefully studied; astronomy and all those arts which are s o largely indebted to mathematics and geometry, were combined with Theosophia in the ancient Mysteries; and all the facts of physical science and art were e mbraced in their instruction. A widespread Ugro - Finn ic, or proto - Aryan, civilisation preceded the Aryan and Semitic developments, and it is even amongst the e arliest of these people that we can trace a system which combined tuition in religion and science and which corresponds in its essential features with Freemasonry. The Mongolian races of Thibet and China a fford us proof of this, equally with the \"Masters of Secrets,\" who left us above 8,000 years ago the ruins of Erech, Serpal, Eridu, and Babel on the plains of Sh inar. \"China.\" The primitive Indian Manu, whose e ra is s o remote that no date ca n be assigned, speaks of a written character composed of geometrical Symbols. We find in China a mongst a people who spread from Thibet at a remote period, and were contemporary with primitive Babylon, a system of operative and speculative Masonry of which the Kings, as was the case upon the plains of Sh inar, were the Grand Masters. One of the oldest words in the Chinese language is literally \"square and compasses;\" and the \"Skirret\" is an hieroglyphic; the altar was a \"cube.\" \" Aprons\" with \"emblems\" of o ffice were worn; and one of the most ancient books c ontains the \"square\" and \"plumb\" as jewels of office, which h ad to be returned on the death of a Monarch - ruler, whose e mblem was the \"hamm er.\" The Diety was designated \"First Builder,\""},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"and the Magistrate s Level men. At a later period, but still 3,000 years ago, the then Emperor has the \"circle\" and \"rule\" as his attributes, as the Egyptian Osiris had the \"Cubit.\" Coupled with this we have the doctrine of Universal {220 } Brotherhood, and the use of North - east, and South - west to indicate the beginn ing and end of any object in view. Confucius, Mencius, and other philosophers, equally apply the use of Masonic tools in their writings. In every sense of the word this s ystem is Freemasonry without its name, a nd traditional Jewish legend. Sir John Mandeville, in 1356 , mentions a coincidence with the Societies of the Essenes, Pythagoreans, and Ancient Masons. He says that the Khan of all Tartary before the e ruption into China, decreed that all men should be go verned b y Masters of tens, hundreds, and thousands. Moorcraft<<Quoted by Dr. Kenealy.>> says that when h e e ntered Thibet he was met by an officer of the Government named the \"Nerba\" and \"on the back of his habit, and on the right shoulder were sewn the sa w, adze, chisel, rule, and all the insignia of Freemasonry in Iron, the Symbols of a fraternity of which h e said he was a member.\" Japan 2,500 years ago had the Chinese Guilds introduced b y way of Korea. \"Egypt.\" The most ancient Memphis of Egypt has traces of this s ystem; in the use according to Diodorus of tools in the hieratic writing; in the use of the cubit - rule as an emblem of truth; in the building symbolism of the \"Ritual of the Dead,\" a book so o ld that 4,500 years ago, it could not be underst ood without a comm entary added to an older comm entary, that had b ecome unintelligible. The architect at this period, and 6 ,000 years ago, was a \"Royal Companion,\" and some of them m ated with Princesses. The Very Rev. C. W. Barnett, Dean of Capetown, says in a recent address, that he had himself seen, on buildings 3,000 years old, the square, triangle, circle, sun, moon, pentacle, and that t he e vidences of Masonry are found at Thebes Luxor, Philae, Abu Simbel, Osioot, Dendera, Carnac, and on other noted ar chaic ruins, as well as in the pitch dark recesses of the great pyramid; and that the Sphynx holds in its c olossal paws an exquisite small temple, which h as Masons \u0000 marks indented into the solid walls, roof, and monolithic c olumns. {221 } \"Babylon.\" An cient Babylon was allied in blood and religion with the two races that we have just mentioned. What we have not yet to record in S ymbols we find represented in their language. The e arliest Monarchs were term ed P at - te - shi, which is interpreted literally t o strike or anoint the foundation stone, and with the addition of tsi - ri is translated Sublime Master. Again the seven Cabiric gods, or eight with one slain by his brother - gods, are named P atecei, from Patasso, a hamm er, and though we need not go to Asgar d, which is believed to be near the Caspian, the God Thor has the hamm er for his weapon and the Svastica {Symbol: Swastika} for his emblem. There is s imilar proof that the first Kings and Viceroys were Masters of the builders, and p robably the designers, or at least superintended the e rection; and such edifices were consecrated with the Rites of Modern Masonry. The Kings are represented with a Maltese Cross worn from the neck. We seem to lose the Akkadian S ymbols of the Mason in the conquests of the Tent - dwelling Semites. The highest chamber of the tower of Borsippa or Babel was a perfect cube. Brother G. W. Speth, the late e minent Secretary of Lodge 2076 , has pointed out some interesting bearings which Cabiric emblems have upon modern Freemasonry. We have shewn that the most ancient style of building was term ed Cyclopean, of which the Cabiric Initiates were the Masters, and that it is a prehistoric s tyle e xisting"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"in all countries, runn ing in later times into level work and often cruciform in its plan. The Cabiri recognised seven ancient gods, of which three were Chiefs, and an eighth was s lain by the others. In Masonry whilst three rule a lodge, seven make it perfect, and the e ighth, or Initiated Candidate, is represented b y the slain god. There is a lso the comm on symbolism of a cube with 8 corners, which the Greek Cabiri term ed Eshmon, and the Phoenicians applied to Ouranos, or heaven, and as Esh is eight it equally represents the Ashlar.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" v, pt. 2.>> These Cabiri laid claim to be t he inventors of {222 } all the arts of life, including the smelting of metals, and were term ed Techn ites or Artificers. Aeschylus introduces Prometheus as a Cabiric god, inasmuch as amongst the arts that he taught mankind are the e rection of houses of bric k, the construction of ships, the invention of letters, and the art of digging g old and silver from the prolific earth, and of fabricating instruments for ornament and use; he is the Tubal - Cain of the Semites, and Greek Mythology condemns him to a cruel pu nishment on Caucasus, for stealing the fire of heaven to aid mankind. \"Greece.\" Primitive Greece was allied in its c ulte with the races already mentioned; and its early g ods were those of the Cabiri, and their buildings Cyclopean; early Greek culture i s found in tombs and p alaces 3,000 B.C. excavated b y Dr. Schliemann , and the contents of these tombs appear to ally the occupants with the Scythians. A long period of barbarous wars s ucceeded, attendant upon the invasion of the country by the Hellenes, an Aryan or Celto - Iranian people, spreading g eneral devastation. In Hellenic Mythology it is figured to us in wars with a race of giants, Titans whom Jupiter at length conquered and condemned to servile e mployment in the forges of Vulcan. Reduced to plain matter of fact, it is the war between the Aryan invaders, who invented the mythology, and the primitive inh abitants who worshipped the Cabiric gods, and were reduced to artistic labour for their conquerors. By this invasion the Cabiric Mythology became He llenised; in one direction the conquerors Aryanised the old myths that had grown up in the country, and in another direction they appear to have Grecianised the legends of Egypt and Phoenicia.<<Vide \"Origin of the Aryans,\" Isaac Taylor, M.A., LL.D.>> Fo r some centuries Greece sank into semi - barbarous desolation; its true civilisation was that of Egypt, whence culture passed through the Romans to Europe. Egyptian colonists with their religious mysteries s ettled at Argolis, the ancient seat of those Cyclo ps or Cabiri who built t he e norm ous walls of Tyrenes, and Mycenae, at a period too {223 } remote to be defined; their chief Inachas it is s aid lived 1976 B.C., and was s ucceeded b y his s on Phoroneus, whilst the deluge of Ogyg es, in Boetia, occurred 1796 B.C ., but it is probable that little reliance can be placed on these dates. To the new race is attributed the destruction of the older Cyclopean towns. At dates from three to four centuries later there e ntered Greece fresh colonies of Egyptians and Phoenici ans: Cecrops arrived in Attica from Sais, in Egypt, 1687 B.C.; assembled the well - disposed inh abitants, laid the foundation of Athens, and of that peculiar tribunal term ed the Areopagus. Cadmus s ettled with h is c olonies in Boetia 1594 B.C., and founded Th ebes; he brought with h im into Greece the Phoenician alphabet, which, originating in Egypt, form s the basis of our own alphabet. Danaus s ettled a new colony in Argolis 1586 B.C., which h ad previously been settled b y Egyptians, and to this year is also cre dited the deluge of Deucalion."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" \"India a nd Media.\" Primitive India a nd P roto - Media shared the same fate as ancient Greece; Aryans equally invaded these countries and reduced the ancient inh abitants. Egypt also received Colonies of the same race, and th e great pyramid is c onstructed upon the Mystic design of the temple of the realms of Osiris. The Aryan invaders of India established b ounds beyond which the artizan, as a third caste, was not allowed to proceed. Accordingly this third class, which was la rgely the prehistoric inh abitants of the country, continued Rites of their own, in which as we have seen, they used art Symbols and measurements to typify the truths of a religion, which differed only from that of the Brahmins and Maharajahs in the use of art instead of nature Symbols. The priests of Benares s ay that this Fraternity constructed all the marvellous works that are spread over the land. As in China, it was a Society of the Level and P lumb. \"Persia.\" The ancient Persians s ay that t heir r ul er Jemschid erected the Artizans into a class, though the country never accepted strict caste laws. This ideal king {224 } gave them laws which h e superintended, and allowed them to appoint a Chief or Grand Master to o versee them. Hence in strictly Aryan countries, governed b y firm caste laws, we have a triple set of Mysteries, those of the Brahmins, or Priests, with an intangible Diety; in the warrior Caste such Mysteries as those of Mythras, Bacchus and Serapis; and amongst the Artizans the Art, or Cabir ic gods. When an apprentice has c ompleted his time he applies to his Guild for his Freedom and makes the customary payment. A priest is c alled in and after prayers he receives the \"acolade\" from the Master of the Guild. The Rev. P. J. Oli ver Minos s a ys that he has traced 20 Masonic Landmarks to Hindu Rites; and that in Persian Mazan is a Sorcerer, -- a Scientist, and that \"Free\" may be the Sanscrit \"Pri\" to love as brethren, as distinct from slaves, the root \"vri\" or \"var\" to choose. Mazandun is land of sorcerers, scientists. As the caste system extended itself in India to different t rades, a Guild system arose, such as we had in old times in England. In India a t this day, each caste form s s uch a Guild, embracing the whole of that class, exercisin g an influence for the general advantage. Some of these lay claim to the \"twice born thread\" of the Brahmins. The deserving members are rewarded b y titles and offices, the undeserving are punished b y fines, or condemned to furnish a feast; the refractory suffer by temporary or perm anent caste deprivation. \"Aryan Greece.\" The origin of Classical G reek is Aryan, and was first introduced into Thessaly by the followers of the Mythical D eucalion, in three great tribes designated Hellenes. The Dorians are said to take their name from Doris, son of Helen; the Aeolians from another son Aeolus; and Ionians from a grandson Ion. It is noteworthy that it is after the recivilisation of Greece and the introduction of the Egyptian Mysteries that the method of build ing edifices of squared and level blocks in contradistinction to the polygonal and irregular style {225 } of the Cyclops, arises in that country; hence it would appear that either the Dionysian artificers must have superseded the Cabiri or instructed them. There are traces in India, Greece, Palestine, and other countries, of a gradual improvement, as exemplified b y the use of both styles in the same building, and there can scarcely be a doubt that the improvement came from the Aryan race. Ancient Greek wri ters identify the Pelasgi with the older style and attribute it to Assyrian introduction. The Etrurians were of the Pelasgic race, and their buildings are of the Cyclopean style, and from them we derive"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the Tuscan style of column; Varro mentions a traditi on that they conquered North Italy 1044 B.C. To the Aryan Greeks the solidity of Cyclopean Masonry, which went beyond their early Kings Inachides and the Oenostratus, could only be the work of giants, and similar views were held in other countries. It is from the tribes of Dorians and Ionians that we derive the Doric and Ionic s tyles, after follow the Corinthian and the Composite, as the developments of the three original G reek styles, with the Tuscan. But Isocrates justly says that t he Greeks borrowed t heir ideas, and the form s of their temples, f rom the Egyptians. It is known that t he Phoenicians often employed Egyptian architects; and it was from the form er that Solomon obtained his c hief workmen for the e rection of the temple of Jerusalem, and the st yle had p oints in comm on with that of Etruria, from which Rome derived much of its art. \"The Dionysiacs.\" There are three questions to be considered in reference to the application of the name Dionysius to the slain and resurrected sun - god of Greece. In the first place, Herodotus positively asserts that these Mysteries were derived from Egypt, it is c ertainly not the Cabiric v ersion. But Assyria had its God Dionisu, and the Aryan Greeks in some cases Hellenised the older Mythology. It therefore seems to be pretty evident that the Hierophants, who first organised the system, found it politic and expedient to use the Assyrian name in place of the {226 } Egyptian. It is s omewhat doubtful whether the Great Mysteries of Dionysos were practical Masons, as w ell as teachers of secret truths of a spiritual nature. The usually accepted statement is that the builders were Initiates into the Mysteries of Dionysos; but as these Mysteries, according to the savant Heeren, were allied with those of the warrior class of Persia a nd India, it is possible that there was a separate class of builders, as in India, under the designation of \"Dionysian Artificers,\" for though n either Egypt nor Greece were caste ridden, and the latter left the Aryan h ome before caste laws were promulgated, yet both in Egypt and Greece there was a custom of hereditary transmission of Art, as honourable in itself. The probability of the e vidence is that the Dionysiacs were an operative body who had their Initiated Masters or Chiefs appointed b y the Hierophants of the Mysteries, and who taught t hem and superintended their labours; and that they developed in Greece the method of building with flat, squared b locks. As the priests of the Mysteries in early times had the superintendence of the erect ion of their temples, they may have reserved the right of Initiating Masters; and the e cho o f this may be found in the old MSS ., which caused King Athelstan to grant a Master \u0000 s Charter in Witenagemote, which n ew body then proceeded to add \"points\" for the governance of subordinate workmen. We read that in the year 1263 B.C. the Council of Amphictyons built t he temple of Apollo, a combination of Architects two centuries before the time of Solomon. These Dionysiacs existed in Greece above 3,000 years ago; hence Cabiric art fell into abeyance, and b ecame a tradition. On the Ionic emigration they carried their art into Asia, and the e rection of the Temple of Heracles at Tyre has been attributed to them, and which h ad two Pillars, one of gold, the other of e merald. They were divided into Lodges under Masters, had emblematical Jewels, degrees, ceremonies, and tokens of recognition; {227 } they also admitted amateurs as Honorary members. They became a powerful body which exercised much political influence, and were incorporated as a Society of Architects by the Kings of Pergamos. At one time they were term ed Daedalidae, from Dedalus, the architect of Crete, and the Labyrinth, respecting"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"whom there is a myth which h as s ome analogy to Masonic legend; he is often represented with the square and compasses in h is hand, hence the Greeks fabled that he invented these working tools and that he was father of architecture in general; and was banished for m urdering a Fellow out of jealousy. Lord Bacon, in h is \"Wisdom of the Ancients,\" allegorises the legend as to Daedalus, coupled with the death of his s on Icarus by falling from a flying machine which h is father had invented; by the Labyrinth, he says, is typified Art in general. It is admitted that the Dionysiacs were a ttached to the Osirian legend; and one of the walls of Thebes has a representation of the Ark of Osiris, with a sprig of five branches, and the legend \"Osiris s prouts forth,\" being an analogue of the Jewish Ark, and the Rod which budded. A symbolic ladder had its place in the Greek Temples, and Aelian says that Pittacus of Mitylene introduced a ladder into the temples of his c ountry to imply \"the rise and fall in the vicissitudes of fortune, according to which the prosperous might be said to climb upwards; the unfortunate to descend.\" This is but t he e xoteric explanation of an esoteric s piritual Mystery. We mentioned in our third chapter a Mosaic table of a Masonic c haracter found at Pompeii. There can be no doubt that we have in the \"Book of Chronicles\" the Hebrew equivalents of the divisions of labour in the great building operations of other nations, these cann ot be a Hebrew invention, but equally represent t he organisations of Chaldea, Egypt, and India. We read (1) of Ish Chotzeb, or m en who hew at t he quarries; (2) G hiblim, stone cutters or artists; (3) Ish S abbal, or m en of burdens; (4) Bonai, the builders or setters; (5) Menatzchim, the comforters or foremen; (6) H arodim, rulers or princes, who {228 } superintended the whole levy. It may be noted t hat Gebal, where Solomon \u0000 s Masons wrought, was a seat of the Adonisian Mysteries, and that he was s aid to have been slain in Lebanon. Even the more ancient Job, according to o ur m odern translators, though said to be incorrect, may have had a knowledge of Masons \u0000 Marks, for he says: \"In the hands of all men h e (God) putteth a Mark, that every man may know His work.\" Solomon \u0000 s Temple was c ompleted in the year 1004 B.C. and the old York lectures taught that its erection occupied 7 years, 7 months and 7 days. Josephus, in h is treatise against Apion inform s us on the testimony of Menander, that Hiram r ebuilt the temple of Melcart -- the City King, which, if Herodotus is c orrect in h is data, must then h ave e xisted for over seventeen centuries. Hiram then aband oned old Tyre and took up his residence on the adjacent island, and encompassed the City square with h igh walls of cut stone. Hence the temple which Herodotus s aw w as that of Hiram then n ear six centuries old. The Talmud has a legend that Hiram was grant ed 600 years of Paradise for r eward, for the Cedars of Lebanon which h e supplied to the builders of the temple of Jerusalem, and the book \"Yalkutt\" which is a compilation from the \"Midrash,\" a word which means \"to gather together,\" says that Hiram built hi mself, in the midst of the sea, a paradise of seven h eavens (as was Babel), and that, for his great pride, Yod sent Nebuchadnezzer against him who destroyed his Paradise and cut him to pieces when h e was about 600 years old. \"Roman Collegia.\" In Rome t he Arts were e rected into Colleges by charter of Numa Pompilius, 703 B.C. The e arly architecture of Italy was Pelasgic, but Greece contributed much to its advance, and their Colleges of Artizans have such a close resemblance to the Dionysic s ystem that th e rule of one must have been the rule of the other. In point of fact Latin h istorians assert"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"distinctly that the founders of Numa \u0000 s Colleges were Greeks, which {229 } w ould lead us to suppose that Dionysian artificers were brought to reconstitute older sch ools. Zosimus inform s us that Numa was c reated P ontifex Maximus, and all his successors, and he derives the origin of the title, which may be translated Bridge - Master - General, f rom Thessalian Greeks who, before statues and temples began to be built by t hem, had images placed on a Bridge over the Peneus from which the Sacrificers were term ed Bridge - priests. It is c urious that the civil government had a similar constitution to the Masonic Colleges. At t he birth of the republic there were 3 tribes -- Sabi nes, Albines, and Strangers. Each was divided into ten Curies, these into Decuries, at the head of which were placed Curions, or Decurions, and above these 100 Centurie. Gradually, however, this gave way to an enlargement, the Umbrians were the most anci ent population and the Dacians, Thracians, and Italian Celts were Aryans, but not closely related to the Hellenes of Greece. It is believed that Numa was an Initiate of the Etruscan priests, and Salverte holds that he was acquainted with electricity and u sed it in h is rites. Herodian says that the Romans obtained from the Phrygians a statue of the \"Mother goddess,\" by representing that they were of the same blood through the colonies of Aeneas, 1270 B.C., when Troy was destroyed b y the confederate Greeks. The Roman form ula was that \"t hree form a College,\" but when form ed one might continue it. According to the Laws of the \"Twelve Tables,\" the Collegia had the right to make their own laws, and were also perm itted to form alliances amongst themselves. T hey were divided into \"Comm unities\"; had a comm on Arca or chest; elected their officers ann ually; accepted Honorary members as \"Patrons\"; had p riests, as there is mention of a \"Priest of the builders or artificers.\" They had emblems of office; signs of re cognition; many of the symbols used b y Freemasons, as, says Schauberg, the rough and p erfect cube, and they could d istinguish a {232 } brother by day as well as by night. Their Wardens ruled ten men, a custom which S ir C. Wren says was in use amongst the o ld Free - masons. The Comm unities or \"Maceriae\" were held secretly and in secluded rooms; generally met monthly; each member was bound b y oath to assist another; some of the Registers of Members are yet extant. Their officers were, a Magister, who presided over a hundred men and was elected for five years; Decurions or Wardens, each of whom presided over 10; Seniores or Elders; Scribe or Secretaries; Sacerdotes or priests; Tabularii or archivists; Erratoris or Messengers; Viatores or Serving brethren; Signi feri or Flagbearers. One inscription inform s us that t he Collegium held a yearly feast in ann iversary of its foundation. Throughout t he whole Roman Empire the Collegia were in active operation, and the \"Corpus Juris\" mentions amongst the Arts legally exi sting, and free from taxation, the architects, masons, stone cutters, painters, sculptors, carpenters, and ship and machine builders. We know the Collegia were e stablished in Britain, as last century an inscription was found in Chichester which says that the \"Collegium Fabrorum\" had erected a temple to Neptune and Minerva a nd the safety of the family of Claudius Caesar, \"circa\" 52 A.D. The great architect Vitruvius defined the art of Masonry, 2,000 years ago, as \"a science arising out of many other scienc es, and adorned with much and varied learning\"; he also shews us that t he Romans had a canon of proportion, which being a secret goes far to shew that he was an Initiated temple architect, and which canon is s till represented in"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"our Masonic Lodges by a tes sellated p avement.<<\"Ars Quat Cor.,\" viii, p. 99.>> Aristophanes, in one of his Comedies, introduces Meton, the astronomer, with rule and compasses in h is hands, preparing to lay out the plan of a new city.

There has recently been dug up at Rome, near the Triano, a glass bowl, upon which, on one side, is a square and above that t he blazing star or sun, and the letters J. N. Underneath the square are two pillars, standing upon a Mosaic pavement.<<\"Liberal Freemnson,\" 1888 .>> Mr. Toulmain S mith points out that contemporary with the Roman Collegia were the Greek \"Eranoi,\" or \"Thiasoi,\" numerous at Rhodes and P iraeus, and other parts. Their organisations had even a closer resemblance to Freemasonry than the Collegia. Although th e Celtic races of Britain h ad in early times many fine cities, and though the York Lectures s tate that Ebrank, Bladud, and Croseus were eminent as Masons, yet it is c onsidered that the Latin term \"Marus\" indicates that we had stone building from the Latins . This Ebrank is Ebroc, the great founder of York; Bladud founded Bath, and b rought from Athens four philosophers whom he located at Stamford; he is s aid to have been a great Mathematician, and having invented a flying machine fell from the temple of Apol lo o n the site of St. Paul \u0000 s, London, and was killed; Croseus will be Carausieus, once Emperor of Britain, and P atron of the Collegia. We mentioned in our last chapter the Benedictine Monk Henry Bradshaw, of St. Werberg Monastery, Chester, before 1513 . Speaking of that city he has the following lines: -- \"The founder of this c itie, as s aith Polychronicon, Was Leon Gaur, a myghte strong gy aunt, Which builded caves and d ongeons many a one, No goodlie buildyng, ne proper , ne pleasant, But King Leir a Britain fine and valiaunt, Was founder of Chester by pleausant buildyng, And was named Guar Leir by the King.\" \"Syria.\" It is not improbable that a Masonic School {232 } continued to exist in Pa lestine during the centuries: the Macabees were considerable builders. Recent discoveries in Jerusalem shew that stones of a remote, but uncertain, antiquity bear Masonic Marks, some of which are cut in the stone and others painted thereon in red; some of these marks are assumed to be Phoenician characters. In the Talmud, in \"Sabbath,\" 114 , it is s aid that \"t he wise - men are called builders because they are always engaged in the upbuilding of the world.\" The Essenes were called Bonaim or builders becaus e it was their duty to edify or build up the spiritual temple in the body.

To stand upon every point, and go o ver things at large, and to be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first authors of the story; but to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, is to be granted to him who will make an abridgement.\" Now although such passages as these, which are fairly comm on amongst Jewish and Christian writers, may not prove that the authors were Masons, as the term is now understood, it confirm s the belief of those writers who assert that the Arcane Schools of Christians did make use of building symbolism; and indicates moreover that the art of building, or m asoning, was one which the learned thought to be symbolically useful, and how much more then by the {233 } builders themselves, to whom it would recomm end itself so aptly. There e xists to - day a Jewish Guild at Assuan in Egypt which claims great antiquity, and p ractises Jewish Rites c onn ected with the building of the two first t emples, and for th at purpose meet ann ually at sunrise and labour till sunset. An Architect who is now out t here, and received initiation in Derbyshire, 1866 - 75, says that they practise the very same ceremonies which he there received. Of course in a Jewish Guild circumcis ion is necessary for reception. The native Copts have similar Guilds, but their ground d iagrams are designed for the square pyramid and not for a 3 to I temple like that at Jerusalem, but they assert that Solomon h ad his initiation from Pharaoh, to whom h e paid a great price. The triplicity of a pyramid is one of their symbols, as it is equally in the ancient Guilds of this c ountry and in the modern Royal Arch degree of Freemasonry. Of course in the building of the 1st temple Yah was the God of Jedediah; Baal of the King of Tyre; and On (which is both Egyptian and Greek, if not also Hindu) the god of Hiram the Abiv. Plato has a line which says \"Tell me of the God On, which was, is, and shall be,\" it is therefore the e quivalent of the tetragramm aton. Oli ver quotes in the like sense, Rev. i. 4: GR:Omicron Omicron Omega Ka - alpha - iota Omicron eta nu, Kappa - alpha - iota Omicron epsilon - rho - kappa - omicron - mu - xi - upsilon - omicron - sigma - - (\"God (On) is, and was, and is to come.\") We are told that Herod, King of J udea, employed 10 ,000 Masons besides Labourers, in rebuilding the temple of Zerrubabel; and it is quite certain that recollections of the temple of Solomon h ad not died out. It is even believed that, from the time of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews emigrated into Spain and were the founders and b uilders of Toledo, Seville, and Barcelona, besides other buildings in Bohemia; and the best time of their race was during the Moorish rule, when Oriental and Secret Societies were prevalent. The Journ al \"Israelite\" of 1860 contained a paper in reference to the e xistence in S pain of certain old legends {234 } in proof that the Jews emigrated thither in the days of the tyrann ical Rheoboam and of Adoniram \u0000 s journey thither to gather taxes and was s lain. T he writer says: \"It is a fact t hat t here are numerous tombstones with old Hebrew or Samaritan inscriptions in S eville or Toledo -- we cann ot positively say which of these two places -- and among them is one which bears the name of Adoniram the Collector of Solomon and his s on"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Rheoboam. . . .

Al Tanai Synagogue is of great antiquity, neither Greek or Gothic. The most ancient chronicle of Bohemia says that this building was found there when the founder of the city of Prague laid the first corner stone of it.\" There is an an cient Hebrew book, certainly 1,500 years old, entitled the \"Testament of Solomon,\" which gives a full account of the legions of daemons employed b y Solomon in the construction of the Temple, and the positions assigned them, but it is more than probable tha t t hese Talmudic legends originally referred to the 72 Suliemen of pre - human times, and were e ngrafted in Babylon upon the personality of the Israelite King. Sir Charles Lemon inform ed his P.G. Lodge in 1846 , that when visiting Poland he saw an ancient Je wish S ynagogue which was built 600 years B.C., where he found Masonic emblems now used b y the Fraternity.

The \"Mishn a,\" or oldest portion of the Jewish \"Talmud,\" preserves the measurements, and d etails, of the first t e mple, with its utensils, and, very recently, a representation of it was found in the Roman Catacombs. According to Josephus, Clemens, and Eusebius, each and all i ts details, were symbolical of the Universe. The third temple, or that of Herod, was destr oyed in the year 70, and the Emperor Hadrian erected in 136 a fourth temple upon its s ite which h e dedicated to Jupiter {235 } Capitolinus, and compelled the Jews to pay taxes for its maintenance. It is s aid in Hadrian \u0000 s time that there was a temple e recte d to Astarte which was destroyed at t he instigation of Helena, the mother of Constantine. In the 4th century many churches were e rected in Palestine, and the Emperor Justinian built a great number in that country. The Emperor Julian attempted to rebuil d on the site of Solomon \u0000 s temple, and there is a very curious account, which confirm s in a remarkable mann er the Rites of the Guild of Free Masons, namely -- that a Reed b elow the floor (about 10 feet) there was a vault which contained a pedestal, with th e plans, and the centre diagrams, and which is drawn upon to form the Arch degree in modern Freemasonry, and that this c entre had to be discovered on the e rection of the 2nd temple. An old writer r elates that when the Emperor \u0000 s labourers were set to clear away the rubbish they came upon a vaulted chamber into which one of the workmen was let down with a rope; he returned and reported that in the centre was a square pedestal surrounded with water, and p roduced a scroll which Nicephorus relates was a verse o f the Bible. The Guilds s ay that this was and is the first lines of Genesis, and that it was c arved over the Eastern entrance of the 1st t emple. Julian was obliged to desist from his intentions as Nicephorus s ays that fire broke out which destroyed his w orkmen. An older writer Philostorgius c irca 853 A.D. has the same account. It may be convenient to mention h ere the Holy - sepulchre at Jerusalem which led to the introduction of round churches into England; though the temples of the Greeks and Romans we re often circular, as was that of Venus in Cyprus mentioned b y Homer; that of Vesta a nd the Parthenon.

Maspero o pened the tomb of an architect, builder, and carver of inscriptions at Thebes, and with the mumm y was found a square, level, compasses, and other implements. At Tel - el - Amarna, 1500 B.C., Bek the hereditary successor of a line of Architects, term s himself the teacher of the King; and, as we have seen, the symbols and representations, however ancient, are more Masonic than in any other country. It is not, however, an unreasonable supposition to suppose that from 500 B.C. when the Persians had conquered the country, to be succeeded b y the Greeks and Romans, gradual changes took p lace, under this foreign influence, in the more ancient Corporations of Masons. The Roman Collegia may have modified Guild life of the more ancient native fraternity, and it is this explanation which must be placed upon the English tradition of the \"Charges of Euclid.\" Draper m entions the conquests of Alexander the Great as leading to the e stablishment of \"the mathemat ical and practical Schools of Alexandria, the true origin of science.\" When the \"Needle\" {237 } w hich Cleopatra had re - erected 22 B.C. came to be removed in 1880 , there was found at the base a peculiar arrangement of stones, which was held to symbolise a M asonic Lodge as now known; thus a portion was laid so as to form a square, on which rested a rough Ashlar, and a perfect Cube, also an oblong of the purest limestone carefully polished and without spot or flaw. We have e xpressed a decided opinion that t he origin of Free Masonry is to be found in the primitive system of a secret School which developed a Mystery in which n atural religion was taught in union with science and art, and that, before the divorce of the two, the great State Mysteries organised a better style of building with squared b locks, in other words the Osirian, Dionysian, or Bacchic Mysteries, which were a highly spiritualised faith, still more subtilised and spread b y Greek p hilosophers as the Mysteries of Serapis, a Gnostic pre - Christian system, which used the cross, and had all the characteristics essential for the faith \"before Christ came in the flesh.\" It is idle to suppose that the Ceremonial Rites of Masons were then absolutely uniform ; those of a Cabiric or Pelasgian civilisation could not be e ntirely uniform with those of the Aryanised Dionysiacs, yet such ceremonial rites existed b eyond d oubt, and each h ad their slain - god if the mode of his death was not quite uniform , and Initiates only had acted a part in the ceremony, nor need we have any doubt of the possibility of the transmission of such Rites, from the e arliest period, though we cann ot produce yearly minutes for it. What right have we to expect this? It means the violation of solemn oaths, perhaps death. Take the univers ality of laying a foundation stone, and we see that the modern ceremony"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"was exactly paralleled in ancient Babylon and Egypt. Even Job must have known something of it in h is desert home, for he says: \"Where was \u0000 t thou when I laid the foundation of the e art h? Who laid the corner stone thereof: when the morning stars s ang together and all the Sons of God shouted for joy.\" If a Rite which professed to date {238 } from Solomon \u0000 s temple e xisted in early times, as it probably did, it would b e amongst a small num ber of Jewish Masons, and a modification of the Phoenician Cabiric Mysteries, but we can leave this for the present. The Legend of the Origin of English Masonry which h as been h anded d own to us from the times of Edwin and Athelstan repeats a tradition w hich traces the Society to Egypt, and p articularises its derivation and organisation. It is c learly a legend which existed at the time, and there is no probable basis which would justify us in expressing a doubt that, as a legend, it had actual existence in Athelstan \u0000 s time, nor in going beyond it to invent a theory that the forerunn ers of the Society were at the building of Solomon \u0000 s temple, an assertion which is not there, and never intended to be there; and the absence of which is a good proof of the an tiquity of the account related. The Legend to which we refer m ay be inaccurate in some of its details; the name of Euclid, the e minent Geometrician, may have been inserted for Thoth or Herm es as the Greeks term ed the god of art; and we may be sure, that in the centuries through which the legend had p assed, before it reached the form of our oldest MSS ., it would b e modified in minor particulars; but we may be well persuaded that it contains a basis of truth, as it would b e a likely Legend to be handed d ow n by Romans and Romanised Britons who worked b y Euclid \u0000 s traditions, and onward through Culdee monks who taught t he rules of handicraft to the people at York, and other places, practised the teaching of the Mysteries of Serapis in the Arcane Discipline of the Church, and even superintended, built, and laboured with their own h ands at t he e rection of their churches and monasteries. This tradition alleges that Egypt finding her people to be generating a too numerous population of well - born youths, for whom it was difficult t o find suitable e mployment, sought anxiously for a remedy. A proclamation was made, and Euclid an Initiate of Serapis, of the Platonic Academy, and it may even be of the Colleges {239 } of Builders, undertook to provide a remedy. For th is purpose he accepted these Lords \u0000 sons, and taught them Geometry \"as the most honest art of all,\" and when they were capable proceeded to o rganise them into a Brotherhood, and give them a \"Charge,\" which examination will shew to agree in all essential po ints with the Roman Collegia. There may be something in the alleged Grand Mastership of Euclid, who is s aid in Anderson \u0000 s \"Constitutions\" of Masonry to have acted as the architect of some noble e difices in Egypt, but it is more probable that he owes the r ank assigned to him from his eminence as a Geometrician, about 276 B.C., and it is noteworthy that in the old Masonic MSS . it is not claimed for Masonry that it was exclusively a society of Sculptors and Stone - cutters but embraced all arts that work b y the rules of Geometry. There is good reason to accept judiciously this alleged Alexandrian descent of Masonry into England. We are told that the original builders of St. Mark \u0000 s at Venice were Alexandrian refugees, and, it may be, the style of the palace of the Doge, which is c alled Moorish but is not so. The Byzantine style was probably Alexandrian, and when the Saracens took Egypt the Artists were dispersed over Persia, Greece, and Europe."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" In the light of what has preceded, the traditional legend resolv es itself broadly into this: that besides the great State Mysteries, but derived from them, there were minor schools of Philosophers, and Colleges of the Arts and Sciences, all with special, but similar, ceremonies of their own, and that Euclid held a prom inent position in all these. Further that the Masonic association was of Greco - Roman introduction into England, a genealogy which attaches itself to the divine Father, Mother, and Son of old Egypt. Nor was Art itself in Egypt confined, in its practice to mere Artisans, for there were sacred images which could only be wrought by the priests of the Mysteries. Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, has a peculiar passage (\"Calvit.\"), in which h e writes: \"The prophets or hierophants, {240 } w ho had b een Initiated i nto the Mysteries, did not perm it t he comm on workmen to form idols or images of the gods, but t hey descended themselves into the sacred caves, where they have concealed coffers, containing certain spheres, upon which they construct their image secretly, an d without the knowledge of the people, who despise simple and natural things, and wish for prodigies and fables.\" We see from - this that there was a Craft secret and symbolism known only to the priests, and that like the \"Four crowned Martyrs,\" of Christia n Masonry, they were capable of practical sculpture. The \"sacred caves\" were the Crypts of their temples; and the word translated \"sphere\" is indefinite, f or there are yet drawings to be found in Egypt which shew that the \"Canon of proportion\" was a chequ ered tracing even from the time of the very ancient 5th dynasty. The primitive canon divided the human figure into 19 squares, of which the head occupied 3 squares, the pubis began at 9 1 /2, and the knee - joint at 6th square from the bottom one. A seated figure occupied 15 squares; but the proportions varied in the course of ages.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" (W. H. Rylands). vi.>> The learned Dr. Stukeley was of opinion that t he Isaic Tablet of Cardinal Bembo<<Pub. by Dr. W. W. Westcott.>> was a tracing - board of th e Egyptian Mysteries, a temple spread out in plane, and that it could b e divided into Porch, Sanctum, and Sanctorum. In the time of Euclid one of the most beautiful buildings in all Egypt was in progress and d edicated to the divine Triad, namely, the re - erection, on its ancient site, of the temple of Philae, which was begun about 300 B.C. and continued for two centuries. Mr. James Ferguson thus eulogises it: \"No Gothic architect, in h is wildest moments, ever played so freely with h is lines and dimension s, and none, it must be added, ever produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this. It combines all the variety of Gothic art, with the massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style.\" In it are nine sculptured tablets {241 } on the wall which pourt ray the death, resurrection, ascension, and d eification of the god to whose honour it was erected. The most sacred oath a Copt could swear was, \"By Him that sleeps at Philae, and b y Him that sitteth upon the throne.\" The Mysteries of the god continued to be celebrated in this temple until about 450 A.D., after which it was probably used for Christian worship.<<\"Egypt,\" Wm. Oxley.>> Another building of great extent was erected b y Ptolemy Philadelphus as a temple of Serapis, the Greco - Egyptian triad in a n Eclectic form . It was the most magnificent temple then in existence, and had numerous s ubterraneous passages and caverns, artificially constructed for the Rites of the Mysteries. It contained a library said to consist of all known books in 700 ,000 volu mes; a library destroyed b y the Moslems in 638 A.D. It was partially destroyed"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"previously by the Christians when emblems of a cruciform character were exposed. The steady advance of Christianity, developing into a ferocious intolerance, necessitated even greater secrecy in the celebration of the Mysteries, followed b y persecutions of the Initiates by the later Emperors, made it essential to reorganise them under other names, with the assumption of a humble disguise. It is in this way that we renew our ac quaintance with them in the Colleges of Art, and in the Gnostic and Occult fraternities. So far as this c ountry is c oncerned we know nothing from documents of a Masonry dating from Solomon \u0000 s temple until after the Crusades, when the Constitution believe d to have been sanctioned b y King Athelstan gradually underwent a change. To advance an opinion amongst well read p eople, that all Craft Masonry must necessarily date from Solomon \u0000 s temple, can only raise a smile. The building was erected b y Phoenicians and p artly of wood, and its magnificence is no doubt greatly exaggerated in the Talmud; and the Jews, with a special G od for their own race, were unpopular with all other nations; and far m ore e xtensive and magnificent buildings, {242 } of which the ruins e xist to this day, are found in Egypt, India, and the Americas. It is, however, a curious thing, in regard to Solomonian legends, that t here seems to have existed amongst the oldest proto - Aryan races, we have knowledge of, a dynasty of Solymi, or Sulieman, entitled Kings; and it has also been discovered amongst the ruins of Babylon as the name of a God of these ancient people, whilst the real name of King Solomon was Jedediah, or the beloved of Jah. It is therefore possible that t he title may have been pre historically known in some Cabiric Rites, and that Ouranos, Ur, Urim, has been corrupted to Hurim, or Hiram Abif, and p erpetuated from the building of the 2nd Temple; for we may assume that the graphic form of the legend has been the gradual growth of cent uries, though perpetuated as a drama in the Mediaeval G uilds, and when the Talmud and the Koran tells us that Solomon employed troops of daemons to erect the temple we may feel sure that t he Talmud is drawing upon the pre - human Suliemen, or Kings of the Ji ns or Afreets. There can be no doubt that the e arly Christian Monks found amongst their skilled Masons c ertain form s of reception, or Mysteries, similar to, if not identical, with those which h ad d escended to themselves as heirs of the Epoptia of these Mysteries. It suited some of these Monks to transform the Serapian S un - god into Jesus, in obedience to the prevailing policy of the church; whilst it pleased others, whether Jews, Christians, or Moslems, matters little, to substitute Hiram; these Rites wo uld also vary in different countries, and at different eras; hence sects of Masons arose, and, as we shall see later, have come down to o ur own days. When we first began to examine the ancient MSS . of the Masonic Craft, of which the result will be found in these pages, we scarcely expected to find more than chance coincidence between Masonry and the Arcane Colleges, but the resemblances which we have before us in Rites, Symbols, and Organisation, will admit of no such general {243 } explanation. It must be clear to the most superficial thinker that there is far m ore in the Masonic MSS . and the Rites than they have yet been credited with, for their whole tenor proves the intimate affinity which existed, even in the most ancient times, between all the Arcan e Schools of knowledge. This is equally apparent whether we seek it in the Egyptian Constitution of Athelstan, which inform s us it was originally a Craft for the study of Geometry, and which therefore implies a Society equally"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"speculative and operative; o r in the Semitic Constitution which came into England later; for such a distinction only shews the transmission of certain rites, with the same aim, through two different chann els; the one a continuous type of that Speculative Masonry which erected the gre at Pyramid to represent the Egyptian \u0000 s faith in the soul \u0000 s future destiny; the other of that Chaldean faith symbolised in the tower of Borsippa; somewhat opposed as Rites, but one in general aim; two systems pointing respectively to Egypt and Babylon. In this chapter we have leant rather to the Greco - Egyptian than the Semitic v iew, but when we reach Anglo - Norm an times of the Masonic Guilds we shall see much change in this respect and that a close conn ection with Palestine introduced new legends and their c oncomitant Rites. {244 }  CHAPTER VIII.  MASONRY IN SAXON ENGLAND. DURING the period embraced in this heading, which includes British times, all the manual arts were Clerical professions in so far as this, that t he Monks acted as teachers and d irectors of lay associations, more or less attached to the Monasteries. Architecture was exercised under the shadow of the church, and M. Blanqui in writing of the French Monasteries observes that \"t hey were the true origin of industrial Corporations; their birth confounds itself with the Convents where the work was arranged; it is thence that serving with the Franks liberty and industry, long enslaved b y the Romans, goes out free to establish itself in the bosom of the towns of the middle ages.\" Nor is this all, from the e arliest t imes of Christianity a comm unity of interests, and of knowledge and art, was maintained b y means of Couriers journeying to and fro throughout t he world, amongst t he whole Christian Fra ternity, which may account for the sudden and widespread adoption, of particular styles, in countries distant from each other. There is no doubt that, even in Druidical times, the Romans organised in the chief cities of this c ountry Colleges of Artifice rs on the Latin model, although the Britons were themselves, at the time, noble architects. These Colleges were continued b y Romanised Britons after the withdrawal of the Roman troops near the middle period of the fifth century, and though the wars with t he Saxons must have greatly retarded the labours of the societies, the Saxons interfered but little with city life, {245 } contenting themselves with rural affairs. We may therefore conclude that the Art - fraternities were continued, even if influenced by t he Clergy and b y such Guild life as the Saxons may have brought over with them. Arranmore has s ome ancient fortresses. One of these, built 2,000 years ago, had walls 220 feet long, 20 feet high, and 18 to 20 feet thick, and is built on a cliff hundreds of feet sheer to the sea; three sets of massive walls s urround the largest fort."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" As we have remarked the \"Articles and P oints\" of the Masonic MSS . are in agreement with the \"Corpus Juris\" of the Collegia, which again are found in an Egypto - Greek source . As the Clergy were the builders of their Churches, the chief Monks and Bishops figure in the Constitutions of the Grand Lodge, prepared in 1723 , as Grand Masters of the Fraternity; and it must at least be admitted that Anderson was half correct, and t here is little of any other m ode by which the matter can be treated in this c hapter; for Art was an Oath - bound Society the property of those who had learned Art by an Apprenticeship. There are numerous Roman remains in this c ountry of buildings which we re erected d uring the occupation of the island b y the Latin troops; and amongst these are to be found many interesting particulars in York, London, Chichester, St. Albans, but scattered over the whole island. Newcastle was in ancient times a place of grea t importance, and the Romans had a military station in the place by A.D. 78, and a bridge was built over the river to conn ect it and Gateshead and named the \"Pons\" Aelii. The Roman foundations were eventually occupied b y Monks, for we learn that when Aldw in, with two Monks, travelled from Gloucester in 1194 to restore the religious foundations, the place was known as Monkchester; and the mother church of St. Nicholas is s aid to have been erected upon a Roman temple; and St. Mary \u0000 s Church at Gateshead is s a id to be as old, if not older. {246 } Pandon, now a part of Newcastle, was peopled b y Saxons, and was a Royal residence before 654 A.D. Didron<<\"Ichn ography,\" i, p. 456 .>> gives a Latin sculpture, of the first ages, on which is represented a pair of cal lipers, compasses, square, skirret, level, maul, chisel, and p en or stylus; an ordinary set - square is often found as an amulet on Egyptian mumm ies. With the e xception of the first and last these comprise the symbolic tools of a Free - mason, and though the plumb rule, 24 inch gauge, which is an old Egyptian emblem of Truth and of Thoth, the perfect Ashlar, a symbol everywhere as ancient as Man, are lacking, these are found on other Roman remains, with many other emblems, and Masons \u0000 Marks of which mention h a s already been made. In Masonic history special mention is made of Verulam, out of the Roman remains of which S t. Albans was built, and, it is s aid that the town was walled round b y Alban the Martyr. It is a legend which may have been taken from some M onastic history by a Masonic lodge of the 13th century in that place. Chichester had a College of Roman Artisans that erected a temple circa 46 - 52 A.D., and Masons \u0000 Marks are found in the remains of the city. In the year 114 Marius the British Pendragon, so named as the military chief of the great golden Dragon - standard of Britain, executed a treaty with Tacitus by which Roman law w as to be recognised in such towns as might become Municipia or colonies; and the garrisons of York, Chester, and Bangor were to be recruited from British Volunteers; as Rome strengthened herself Christianity was tolerated, but Druidism was prohibited. A quantity of Roman coins was found in the South - basin at Chichester in 1819 , and three with the following emblems: Nerva 96 A,D ., two joined hands, and \"concordia execretus,\" encircling. Hadrian, 117 A.D., moon and seven stars. Antonius Pius, 138 A.D., two joined hands, two ears of corn, \"Cos III.\"<<\"Freemasonry in Havant,\" 892 a, Thos.

There was discovered at Toft Green in 1770 b eneath the foundation of a Roman temple of brickwork a stone with this inscription, \"Deo sancto Serapi Templvm asolo fecit Cl. Hieronymianus leg. vi. vic.\" -- \"This temple, sacred t o the god Serapis, was erected, from the ground, by Claudius Hieronymianus, Lieutenant of the sixth conquering legion.\" On each side of the inscription are two identical ornaments which it is difficult to describe, each is of three circles with a rod, or straight line drawn through them; the other is a peculiar trisula having in its c entre a star of six points; at the bottom is a circle with an eight - pointed star in the centre, and in that a point. There was also found in Micklegate in 1747 a piece of scu lpture said to represent Mythras s acrificing a bull; and in 1638 was found an altar erected to Jupiter by the Prefect Marcianus. A semi - subterranean temple of Mythras was discovered in 1822 at Housesteads in Northumberland, containing an Altar dedicated i n 235 A.D., and there are other remains in Chesterholm and Rutchester in the same county; at the latter place is a recess hewn out of the solid rock, called the giant \u0000 s grave, measuring 12 X 4 1 /2 b y 2 feet deep. At one e nd is a hole; this s eems to resemb le \"St. Patrick \u0000 s hole,\" in Donegal. Several altars have been found in Cumberland and Westmorland d edicated to Baalcadris. \"Acta Latamorum\" and Rebold give a very probable e xplanation of the Masonic Legend of Verulam. Carausius caused himself to be e lec ted and p roclaimed Emperor of Britain by the {248 } Chann el Fleet in 284 A.D., and b raved all the e fforts of Diocletian to dethrone him. He renewed the privileges of the Collegia in their entirety as these had been much curtailed in the course of centuries , and is therefore supposed to have appointed Albanus as his Inspector. An inscription to Carausius was found at Carlisle in 1894 , and his c oins are numerous. He was assassinated at York in 295 A.D., and Constantius Chlorus took up his residence there, a nd confirm ed the privileges of the Guilds or Collegia. Brother Gil es F. Yates s tates that an old MS. of the life of St. Alban, the proto - martyr, in British characters was found in the tenth century, and Matthew Paris refers to a book of great antiquity as existing in the Monastery of St. Albans. Britain h ad clearly attained architectural distinction in the time of Carausius and was able to send competent men to instruct the Gauls, for Eumenius, the panegyrist of Maximium, congratulates the Emperor on be half of the city of Au tin, which h e inform s us was renovated b y architects from this c ountry, in the following words: \"It has been well stored with Artificers s ince your victories over the Britains, \"whose provinces abound with them,\" and now by their work manship the city of Au tin rises in splendour by rebuilding their ancient houses, the e rection of public works, and the instauration of temples.

Welsh h istorians assert that Christianity was accepted in a National Council held b y King Lucius A.D. 155 , when the Archdruids of Evroc, Lud, and Leon, became Archbishops and the Chief Druids of 28 cities became bishops. It is {249 } further asserted that of the British captives c arried to Rome, Claudia a nd P udens are addressed by name in the Gospel. King Lucius is s aid to have been educated at Rome by St. Timo theus, the son of Claudia, to have been proclaimed King in the year 125 , and to have been baptised b y Timotheus 155 A.D.; after which h e proceeded to erect churches at Winchester; Llandaff; St. Peter \u0000 s, London; and St. Martin \u0000 s, Canterbury; the faith was t hen styled Regius Domus, or Royal house. British h istory says that at t his time there were in existence 59 magnificent cities, and numberless handsome residences. Of Monasteries the Triads s ay: There are three perpetual Choirs in the Isle of Britain -- G reat Bangor, Caer - Salog (Salisbury), Avillon (Gl astonbury); the first named was munificently endowed b y King Lucius; it covered a square of five miles, had 10,000 teachers, and every g raduate had to learn some profession, art, or business. Minucius Felix comm ents upon the absence of temples and altars amongst t he Christians of the 3rd century, and of the uselessness of such works in h onour of an all embracing Deity, and then says: \"Is it not far better to consecrate to the Deity a temple in our heart and s pirit?\" It was not until about the year 270 that Christians were allowed to assemble in buildings of their own at Rome, and these appear to have been first erected in imitation of the \"Scholae\" or Lodge rooms, of the artizans, but in Britain there was but one year \u0000 s persecution of the Christians, when S ocrates, Archbishop of York, the Bishop of St. Albans, and others lost their lives. About the year 300 church was erected at Verulam over the martyred b ody of St. Alban, which Bede says was a handsome struc ture; and Tann er says that t here was a church at Winchester, dedicated to Amphibalus who converted him. There was an Archbishop of York at t his time, for Eborius in the year 3I4 attended the Council of Arles in Gaul and is described as \"Episcopus de civit ate Eboracum Provincia Brit.\" The same Council was attended b y Restitus of {250 } London, and Adifius of Caerleon on Usk, which is Lincoln. These Christian Britains -- monks, priests, and b ishops, were known as Culdees, servants of God; they established Monasteries and Churches in various parts of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and there is no doubt that many of them were converts from the Druidical faith; in these countries they opened Colleges, and Schools where handicrafts, arts, sciences, and religion were taught to the people. Their faith was heretical according to the standard which the Church of Rome had adopted after the succession of Constantine, and they were what Cardinal J. H. Newman term s Platonising Christians, or of the e soteric Ar cane Discipline. They believed in the imm ortality of the soul, but not in the Jewish doctrine of a resurrection of the material body, which was the teaching of Judaising Christians. They are also accused of denying the e xistence of a personal devil, and the personality of Jesus, in which case they were Gnostics, but the reader m ay refer back to the subject in Chapter VI.

This mission founded the Abbey of Luxeville, and others in Fra nce and Italy. In England their principal seat was York, in Wales Bangor, in Ireland Donegal, in S cotland the Hebrides. Those Masons who possess intuition, and the faculty of reading between the lines of such writers as we have quoted, will perceive that Philosophy found it essential, and safe, to openly embrace Christianity, whilst secretly conform ing {251 } to their old ideals, had it been n ecessary we could have given plain proof of this. Even Eusebius s ays: \"In order to render Christianity more accept able to the Gentiles, the priests adopted the e xterior vestments and ornaments used in the Pagan culte.\" Philosophy thus s ecured the survival of its s ecrets, hence we find the 12 sons of Jacob assimilated to the Zodiacal signs; and much Gnostic symbolism is found in church architecture -- lions, serpents, and things to be named in due course. The Rev. W. L. Alexander in writing upon \"Iona\" says that whilst the Roman arm ies were harrying the Druids at Anglesea there was a College of them in the Scottish islands s ituated 56 Degrees 59 \u0000 N.L. designated \"lnn is - nan - Druid - neach\" -- the Isle of the Druids -- and that that priesthood p revailed over all the other islands until the year 563 - 4 when Colum or Columba a rrived with 12 companions who were continued in t hat number till after ages. It is s aid that there e xisted there certain Druidical priests who professed to be Christians in the hope of inducing Columb to withdraw, and after the settlement of Columb and his friends, the island b egan to he known as \"li - ch olum - chille\" -- the island of Columbus \u0000 Cell, corrupted to Icolmkill, and we have also \"li - shona\" -- the holy island, corrupted to Iona. We may now say something in reference to the construction of their churches. Prior to the 5th century, all Christia n churches were after the model of the ancient t emples of Egypt divided into three parts, and which corresponded with the secret or esoteric doctrine; and we need have no doubt that t he e mblematical significance of the architecture was a \"close tyled\" Myst ery of the Initiated b uilders, and that as in the ancient temples, they were built t o symbolise a spiritual doctrine, which ordinary Christians were unacquainted with. The first part, or \"Ante - temple,\" was for the Catechumens, disciples, and p enitents; th e second p art or Nave was for the lay members and the faithful; the third p art or \"Sanctuary\" was a semi - circular r ecess with an arched roof, raised above {252 } the floor by steps; it represents the Sanctuary of the ancient gods, open only to the priests; within it was the throne of the Bishop which was usually veiled, and p laced b esides it were smaller thrones for the Clergy; in the centre of this most holy place was the altar. In Gothic buildings, of a later date, this part is c alled the \"Chancel\" and wa s s eparated b y a \"Rood - screen\" of carved wood or other m aterial; and it is remarkable that the carvers, at t imes, took great liberties with the Monks and p riests, in the representation of their vices. There is even much recondite symbolism to be found on the outer walls of such buildings.

In regard to early erections, a small church of rough stone was raised at Peranzabulae in Cornwall about t he year 400 b y the Culdee Pirau an Irish saint, o ver whose tomb was found an equilimbed cross of the Greek form , when the building was disinterred in 1835 , after having been covered over for ten centuries. Thong Castle in Lincolnshire was erected for the Saxons about the year 450 , it must have been a Br itish labour. A church of stone was erected at Candida Casa, by the Culdee bishop Ninian 488 A.D.; and Matthew of Westminster tells us that the British King Au relius Ambrosius, who slew the Saxon Hengist at Conisborough in 466 , repaired the churches, trav elling to and fro for that purpose, and sent for Cementarii or Masons, and Lignarii, or Carpenters. Legends s tate that he e rected Stonehenge with blocks brought from Ireland b y the e ngineering skill of Merlin, and that both h imself and his brother Uther t he Pendragon were buried within its c ircle (but Norm an Lockyer examining it as a Planetarium, dates it, by the Sun, at 1680 B.C.); he defeated Hengist \u0000 s s ons at York in 490 . In 524 Arthur son of Uther, defeated the Saxons, and at {253 } Christmas of that y ear he held a Council at York to consider ecclesiastical affairs, and methods were taken to restore the churches and the ruined p laces at York, which h ad b een occasioned b y his wars to expel the Saxons. Though Arthur the Pendragon is alleged to have been buried at Glastonbury the legends of the Prince seem to belong chiefly to Cumberland and the adjacent parts, which form ed the Kingdom of the Strathclyde Britains; the names used in the Romances of his Round Table and in the conn ected tales, are Cambrian, a nd Blase of Northumberland is s aid to have registered his doings. Denton says that near St. Cuthbert \u0000 s Church, Carlisle, in Cumberland, \"stood an ancient building called Arthur \u0000 s c hamber, taken to be part of the mansion h ouse of Arthur, the son of Uter Pe ndragon, of memorable note for his worthiness in the time of antient Kings.\"<<Quoted in \"Hist. Cumb.\" by Wm. Hutchinson, 1794 . ii, p. 606 .>> The Prince was no doubt a Romanised Briton, though h is name does not belong to the Celtic language, and that he wa s a real person who strove to unite the British Christians against the Saxons is beyond serious question. The allegorical history of the Round - table, and the Knights \u0000 \"Quest of the Sangrael,\" or cup of the blood of Christ, is s upposed to refer, in mystic term s, to Culdee rites; and in spite of the e fforts of Rome the Culdee culte continued to exist in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland d own to the Norm an conquest, and, in places, until l ong afterwards. At Caerleon on Usk were two churches, and an impor tant Culdee \"College of two hundred Philosophers learned in Astronomy, and in all the sciences and the arts.\" It is more than probable that the peculiarities of the Culdee system arose from the e ngraftation of Druidical beliefs upon the Christian faith. Many learned writers have sought to derive Free Masonry both from a Druidical and Culdee e stablishment. The latter is not at all i mprobable for one of the branches. The following may be pointed out at random: -- The custom of symbolising Craft officers by the sun and moon; for the Arch {254 } Druid b ore the sun and crescent moon on h is head d ress, whilst the Bard was designated by the crescent moon, equally the tonsure of a Culdee Monk went from ear to ear, in crescent, as opposed to the coronial tonsure of the Romans.

About the year 561 Columba a nd twelve companions left Ireland to build the Monastery of Icolmkill, and Masonic legend assigns the lectures of the Mastership of Harodim to this Monastery; they founded Colleges at Govan and Kilwinn ing; and Aidan, one of the twelve, established the original Abbey of Melrose. The fraternity had other establishments in S cot land; at Abernethy; St. Serf in Lochleven; Dunkeld; St. Andrews; Moneymusk in Aberdeenshire; Dunblane; Dunferm line; and Aberdeen. Their establishment at Brechin h as left a cylinder or Round Tower of unknown date. At each side of the western entrance, nea r an ancient gateway, is c arved in relief an elephant having the feet of a lion and a horse. Brother R. Tytler, M.D., in a paper read b efore the Antiquarian S ociety of Scotland,<<Vide \"Freem.

Above this c arving is an apparently later crucifixion scene with two Monks. It is s aid that during the life of Columba 100 monasteries were e rected, and the Irish claim to have sent arc hitects to Britain some centuries before this time. The voyage of Bran, son of Febal (a MS. of 1100 ), to the Island of Joy, or the Land of the Living, is attributed to Adamnan, Abbot of Ionia, who died in 703 ; it mentions {255 } nine grades of heaven in three steps, and that a fiery circle surrounds the land of the blessed. The throne is a canopied chair with four columns of precious s tones, and b eneath it are seven glassen walls. The sect in England had seats at Lindisfarne, York, and Ripon. Mr. Gra nt Allen in h is Anglo - Saxon Britain (1884 ) says: \"It is possible that the families of Craftsmen may at first have been Romanised Welsh inh abitants of the cities, for all the older towns -- London, Canterbury, York, Lincoln, and Rochester -- were almost cer tainly inh abited without interruption from the Roman period onward.\" The Roman law, and therefore the Guilds or Collegia, never became e xtinct in any place where the Romans had once had a footing. They entered Germ any with the sack of Rome by the Goths , a country unconquered b y arm s. Alaric II. of the Wisegoths, 484 - 507 , comm issioned Roman Jurists to compile a code on the basis of the Lex Theodosii which was adopted b y all G aul.

A third compilation of Roman law called the Burgundian \"Lex Romano\" was promulgated about t he year 520 b y Sigmund.<<\"Arm inius,\" Thos. Smith, F.S.A..

They venerated the Four crowned Martyrs, and were divided into Scolia or Apprentices; Laborerium, operii or those who did the actual work; the Opera or Fabbrica, or the Magistri who de signed and taught the others.

Sh e also quotes an inscribed stone of 712 to shew that they had then Magistri and Discipula under a Gastaldo o r Grand Master and that the same term s were kept up in Lombardy, amongst Free Masons, until the 15th century, and it is known that St. William, Abbot of Benigne in Dij on, a L ombard by birth, brought in h is c ountrymen to build his monastery, and that Richard II., Duke of Norm andy, employed this architect for 20 years in like work.<<The \"Cathedral Builders,\" Leader Scott, 1899 , London.>> It is not so difficult to conn ect Freema sonry with the Collegia, the difficulty lies in attributing Jewish traditions to the Collegia, and we say on the e vidence of the oldest charges that such traditions had no existence in S axon times. \"In this darkness which extended over all Italy, only o ne small lamp remained alight, making a bright spark in the vast Italian Necropolis. It was from the \"Magistri Comacini.\" Their r espective names are unknown, their individual works unspecialised, but t he breath of their spirit might be felt all through t hose centuries, and their name collectively is legion. We may safely say that of all the {257 } w orks of art between 800 and 1000 , the greater and b etter part are due to that brotherhood -- always faithful and often secret -- of the \u0000 Magistri Comacini. \u0000 \" ( J. A. Llorente, \"Hist. of the Inquisition;\" London 1826 . \"I. Maestri Comacini;\" Milano 1893 .) The conquest of Rome, by the Teutonic nations, led to a great extension of the Christian Monasteries, during the 5th and 6 th centuries, and these were usually placed in quiet or inaccessible situations, the better to escape from the tumults of the times. Here libraries were e stablished and the ancient learning found a resting place. This led to the cultivation of the Mystical and the spiritual in man, and it may be observed that the term Mystic is derived from the rank of Mystae in the Mysteries, even as the term \"Mystery\" was adopted b y trade Guilds to mean their art, and \"closed lips.\" Stowe says that in the 7th or 8th century the walls of London were reb uilt by Benedictine Monks brought from Birkenh ead. The founder of this brotherhood was St. Benedict, born at Nursia in Umbria a bout A.D. 480 ; he went to Monte Cassino, 530 , afterwards the centre of his order, and there composed his rule, which entered Eng land b etween the 6th and 7 th century. Archdeacon Prescott says: \"The finest Abbeys, and nearly all the Cathedrals, belonged to the order.\" About the year 597 Au gustine came over to England from the Church of the Quatuor Coronati at Rome. His instructi on from Pope Gregory was: \"Destroy"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"the idols, never the temples; sprinkle them with h oly water, place in them relics, and let the nations worship in the places accustomed.\" He is s aid to have brought over Roman Masons, and a further number in the year 601 ; he died in 605 . It has been supposed that he built t he Church of the Four crowned Martyrs at Canterbury, which is mentioned casually by Bede in 619 . This introduction of Masons from Rome is usually taken to prove that t he building fraternities had b eco me e xtinct in this c ountry, but it does no such thing. There was no doubt a scarcity {258 } of capable men amongst the Saxons for the work which the Romish S aint had in view, but we cann ot altogether rely upon the good faith of their historians, nor are we at all j ustified in assuming that t he native British Masons, Carpenters, and the building fraternities derived from the Romano - heathen population were e xtinct, and we have proofs to the contrary in the Culdee e rections of St. Peter at York in 626 , and in the Culdee e stablishment at Lindisfarne in the year 634 b y Aidan, a Monk of Icolmkill i n Iona; and in the \"Holy Island\" St. Cuthbert was interred b efore the City of Durham existed. There lies, behind, the fact that Rome considered all British Christianity as heretical, and all the successors of Au gustine followed his role, with the unsuccessful object of wholly destroying Culdee influence. Bede inform s us that the British Christians refused either to live, or eat, with the Au gustinians, and they replied t o a demand for obedience: \"We owe obedience only to God, and after God to o ur venerable head, the Bishop of Caerleon - on - Uske.\" Bede complains also that Monasteries had b een established b y laymen with themselves as Abbots, whilst still continuing married r elations with their wives, a Culdee custom, sanctioned b y example of Bishop Synesius. He says also that a Martyrium of the \"four blessed Coronati\" existed at Canterbury 619 - 24. The British Pendragons s eem to have kept t he Saxons in check, but t hey were able to destroy Bangor in the year 607 . Deira was s trongly reinforced b y Angles from the Saxon coast, and King Edwin solicited from his friend Caswallon, the British Pendragon, that he might assume the regal crown as Bretwalda, but Caswallon refused his sanction, on the ground that there was \"one sole crown of Britain.\" Kemble says that, \"The Saxons neither took possession of the towns, nor gave themselves the trouble of destroying them.\" The Heptarchial princelings and their villagers were Pagans, and exercised b ut small i nfluence. Pope Boniface IV. is c redited with the grant {259 } of privileges in 614 to those architects who had the e rection of sacred b uildings. In 616 Ethelbert King of Kent built the Church of St. Peter, and St. Paul, at Canterbur y, upon the site of a small church erected b y the e arly Britains; also the church of St. Andrew in Rochester; and he is thought to have restored St. Paul \u0000 s in London, erected on the site of a temple to Diana, though other writers suppose it to have been bu ilt within the area of what was the Roman Pretorian Camp in the time of Constantine. Siebert King of the West Saxons, in 630 , built the Monastery of Westminster, on the site of a Temple to Apollo, and it was repaired in the next century by Offa King of Me rcia. About the middle of this c entury, say 650 , an Irish saint of the name of Bega established a small Nunn ery at the place now called St. Bees in Cumberland, then a British port, and a church was erected afterwards in h er honour. The Romans had a tem ple at Teignmouth, and here an important Priory was erected. In the reign of Edwin over Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumbria, circa 626 , a wooden edifice was erected here, similar to Aidan \u0000 s Church at"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Lindisfarne, and was followed b y a church of stone e rect ed b y his s uccessor St. Oswald, circa 663 . After it had b een destroyed b y the Danes, it was restored b y Ecgfrid, in the 15th year of whose reign the neighbouring church at Jarrow w as dedicated, and which, with that of Wearm outh, is in the diocese of Hexha m. In the year 675 , Benedict Biscop is s aid to have brought over from France skilled Masons to erect t he Monastery at Jarrow. At t he same date Wilfrid founded Ripon, Hexham, and Ely, bringing Masons from Rome or Italy and France. King Ina a lso rebuilt Glastonbury; and William of Malmesbury inform s us that it possessed a sapphire of inestimable value, perhaps the origin of the legend of the Graal cup. The same writer says: \"In the pavement are stones designedly laid in triangles and squares, and fixed with lead, under which if I believe some sacred enigma to be e nshrined I do no injustice to {260 } religion\"; he also alludes to two pyramidical structures in the churchyard. Anglo - Saxon building, sometimes of wood, and then of stone, continued upon thei r gradual conversion to Christianity. In 643 Kenweath of Wessex \"bade timber the old Minster of Winchester.\" In 654 \"Botulf began to build a Monastery at Icambo\" (Boston). In 657 , Penda of Mercia a nd Oswin of Northumbria built a Monastery at Medeshamste de (Peterborough). Oswin built six in Deira. In 669 Echbert of Kent gave \"Reculver to Bass, the Mass - priest, to build a Monastery.\" In 669 St. Ethelreda \"began the Monastery at Ely.\" Before 735 , religious houses existed at Lastringham, Melrose, Lindisf arne, Whithern, Bardney, Gilli ng, Bury, Ripon, Chertsey, Barking, Abercorn, Selsey, Redbridge, Aldingham, Towcester, Hackness, and several other places. The Irish Monks were active abroad; in 582 St. Peter \u0000 s Convent at Salzburg was erected b y Rudbert. Ab out 610 , convents at Costnitz and Au gsburg erected b y Edumban. About 606 , convents at Regenburg under Rudbert. About 740 , convents at Eichstadt under the Irish monk Wildwald. As to military architecture we read that Edward, the father of Athelstan, had twenty fortresses between Colchester, Manchester, and Chester. Why then should we dispute the e xistence of such Guilds as are shadowed in our ancient Masonic MSS .? Professor Freeman says that St. Mary le Wigford Church was built by Coleswegan. Aelfred , brother of Ecfrid King of Northumberland, sojourned in Ireland to acquire from the Monks the learning of the period, and on the death of Ecfrid, in 685 , he was recalled to succeed him, but it is v ery doubtful whether the Britons recognised these Saxons a s Kings, until Egbert became Bretwalda in the year 824 . In 690 Theodore, Bishop of Canterbury, erected King \u0000 s School in that city. In 716 Ethelbald b uilt Croyland in Lincolnshire. Of this period a series of drawings exist amongst the Cottonian MSS . in t he British Museum, and have been engraved for the \"Freemasons \u0000 Magazine,\" scenes in the {261 } life of St. Guthlac; one of these represents him in the act of building his c hapel. The Saint is hoisting up material to a Mason who is laying a stone at the top of the building; near the Saint is a stone - cutter who is hewing the stone into shape with an axe. We shall see later that a chisel was used in Norm an times, and soon after a claw - adze. Although the Arch h ad its origin in h igh antiquity, and is s aid to h ave been found in Babylonian remains near 10,000 years old, preference was given in early English church architecture to the straight lintel of the Pagan temples, then Arches followed, but it was not until the 10th century that vaulted roofs c ame into use, and soon spread over the whole of Europe. As early as the 8th century the English Monk, St. Boniface or Winifrid, established in Germ any a special class of Monks for the practice of"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"building, with the grades of Operarii or Craftsmen, and Magistri operum or Masters of Work. Some of these acted as designers, others as painters or sculptors, others wrought in gold and silver embroidery, and others were Cementarii or Stone Masons: occasionally it was necessary to employ laymen under their superintendence.<<\" Ludwig Steiglitz,\" quoted b y Mackey.>> The church of York, erected in 626 , was damaged b y fire in 741 , and Archbishop Egbert began a new church. About t he year 793 Offa King of Mercia erected the Monastery of St. Albans near the old Roman Verulam, and in the Cottonian Library is a picture, also engraved for the \"Freemasons \u0000 Magazine,\" shewing him in the act of giving instructions to his Master Mason, who has the square and compasses in h and; a Mason on the top is using a plumb - rule, whilst another is s e tting a stone; below are two Masons s quaring stones with an axe. These drawings are by Matthew of Paris about the year 1250 . Offa before beginn ing this work made a journey to Rome by way of France, and Brother C. C. Howard, of Picton, supposes that he br ought Masons thence for his work. At Lyminge in Kent there is an old church built upon a {262 } Roman Basilica by Saxon Masons; it is noteworthy as having an old Roman sun - dial built into the south wall of the Nave by St. Dunstan circa 965 . It may be note d here that in recent times a bronze square and compasses were dug up at Corfu, along with coins and vessels of the 8th and 9 th centuries. The Romans s eem not to have had a settlement at Durham, and we do not hear of the place during the time of the Sax on Heptarchy. The Bishop \u0000 s See was founded at Lindisfarne as early as 635 . In 883 the Bishop and his c lergy took up their abode at the Roman Chester - le - Street, where they remained with the body of St. Cuthbert until 995 , when the Danes c aused them to tak e up their wanderings with the body of that Saint. In 999 Aldune the Bishop caused the Cathedral to be e rected, and ere 90 years had p assed this s mall edifice gave place to the present stately fabric. During all this period the Saxons had a Guild syste m in full operation; and the old laws of Alfred, Ina, and Athelstan reproduce still older laws acknowledging the Guilds. The old Brito - Roman cities must have continued their Guilds during these centuries, even whilst the Saxons were making laws on the sub ject, and establishing new ones on the old lines. The laws of Ina, 688 - 725 , touch upon the liability of a Guild, in the case of killing a thief. In 824 England had absorbed Britain and Saxon under Egbert, and the latter had become the ruling element. Th ese Guilds exacted an Oath of secrecy for the preservation of trade \"Mysteries,\" and obedience to the laws. The Judicia Civitatis were ordinances to preserve the social li fe of Guilds, of the time of Athelstan. A law of Edgar, 959 - 75, ordains that \"every priest for increase of knowledge shall diligently learn some handicraft,\" but this was only enforcing old Culdee customs. There is s aid to be a letter of the 9th century, written by Eric of Au xerre to Charles the Bald of France, in praise of certain Iris h philosophers, who, as \"servants of the wise Solomon,\" were visiting France under the King \u0000 s protection, who \"for {263 } the instruction of his c ountrymen,\" attracted thither Greeks and Irishmen. This probably refers to the e rection of Aixe - la - Chapelle by his grandfather Charlemagne. It was introduced into the Irish Masonic Calendar by the late Brother Michael Furnivall, and has c reated an impression that t here e xisted in Ireland at t his period some Society analogous to the Sons of Solomon in France, whic h we shall mention shortly."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"St. Werberg at Chester is s aid to be e rected on the site of a Saxon Church as old as 845 . About the year 850 Ethelwolf, King and Bretwalda, is s aid to have e mployed St. Swithin to repair the pious houses. The Danes burnt Cr oyland Monastery in 874 and slew Abbot Theodore at the altar steps. Alfred the Great, about 872 , fortified and rebuilt many towns, and founded the University of Oxford. In 865 , and again in 870 , the Priory of Teignmouth, where the Nuns of Hartlepool had taken refuge, was destroyed b y the Danes and again rebuilt. It is c ertain that in these times, a large number of timber structures were erected; it was a style of building which admitted of rough stone and rubble work, and was equally comm on both in Eng land and France. This is probably the reason why our ancient \"Constitutions\" state, as they do, that the original designation of the Fraternity was Geometry, which was as necessary in buildings of wood as of stone, and is s ome e vidence of the antiquity of these ancient MSS . An authority maintains that later erections of stone, by the Saxons, were influenced b y this s tyle, as in the use of stone buttresses in imitation of timber beams, and in window balustres or pillars made to imitate work turned in a lat he.<<\"Freems. Mag.,\" J. F. Parker, F.S.A., 1861 . iv, p. 183 .>> Doubtless many of the churches burnt by the Danes were of wood, and rebuilt of stone. In Constantinople, and the East generally, wooden structures continue, and are preferred to stone. In the year 915 Sigebert, King of the East Angles, began the e rection of the University of Cambridge, which was c ompleted b y Ethelward the brother of King Edward {264 } the e lder. This latter erected many considerable works and fortifications, repairing, says Holinshed, in 920 , the city of Manchester, defaced by the wars of the Danes. He was s ucceeded b y his elder, but illegitimate, son, Athelstan, who is s aid in the oldest MS. Constitution to have \"built himself churches of great honour, wherein to worship h is God with all his might.\" Anderson says that Athelstan rebuilt Exeter, repaired the old Culdee church at York, and also built many castles in the old Northumbrian Kingdom to check the Danes; also the Abbey of St. John at Beverley; and Melton Abbey in Do rsetshire. If for the advancement and improvement of architecture this King granted an actual charter to York, he would naturally do the same to Winchester, in which city he fixed his royal residence; and there we find architecture flourishing. Few Saxon specimens of architecture now exist; there is the tower of Earl \u0000 s Barton Church, Lincolnshire; Sempling in S ussex; St. Michael \u0000 s in Oxford. A fine specimen of military architecture of the period is Castle Rushen in Man. It is believed to have been beg un by King Orry and completed b y his s on Guthred, circa 960 ; it resembles s o closely one at Elsinore in Denmark that they are both supposed to be by the same architect. The one in Man is built of the limestone of the district, and is in a state of perfect preservation; the elements have had no effect upon the stone, owing to a hard, glass - like glaze, admitting of a high polish, from which it may be inferred that t he military architects were acquainted with some chemical secrets that remain a secret to this day. In 942 Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury began the restoration of his Cathedral; it was afterwards much injured b y the Danes in 1011 , and King Canute ordered its restoration; again it suffered b y fire in 1043 . In the time of Ethelworth and St. Dunsta n, who was a Benedictine Monk, Anderson says, 26"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"pious houses were e rected, and under Edgar 48 p ious houses. Between 963 - 84, {265 } Ethelwold, Bishop of Winchester, erected 40 Monasteries, and is styled the \"Constructor,\" of his Cathedral church. Edgar, i n 969 , at t he instance of Dunstan, repaired Westminster Abbey church. In 974 , Ednoth, a Monk of Winchester, superintended the e rection of Romsay Abbey church. From 977 - 81, Aelfric, Abbot of Malmesbury, is s aid to have been skilful in architecture. The re is a charter of King Aethelred of the year 994 which describes the Deity in Masonic term s as \"Governor of the bright pole and Architect of the great ethereal design . . . . of the world, unexpressibly placing in order the Fabric.\" Another of King Canute uses the same preface.<<Thorpe \u0000 s \"English Charters,\" 1865 .>> The paucity of Anglo - Saxon remains prevents our dealing largely with their Masonic Symbolism. There is, however, a bronze seal of Aelfric Duke of Mercia, 992 , with the legend \"{+} Zigillum Ael frici {symbol, a \"T\" above two \" \b \u0000 s\" abutted to form a crossed - pair of chevrons, one chevron inverted.},\" t hus placing the cross, and the square and compasses in juxtaposition.<<\"Freem. Mag.,\" I855 , p. 509 .>> De Caumont mentions a sarcophagus, of this pe riod, which bears a cross within a circle, and two levels placed sideways. With the close of the year 1000 A.D. a great impulse was given to church building, as a feeling prevailed that this year would see the e nd of the world. When the panic had p asse d the Christian n ations in thankfulness began building. The Danes had caused great havoc in this c ountry, and especially at York, and had even revived heathen rites, which Canute proclaimed in the year 1030 . There is no reason to suppose that these wars extinguished the building fraternities, and Canute in 1020 erected a stone Minster at Assingdon, and also repaired the Minsters throughout England, as we are inform ed b y William of Malmesbury. Leofric Earl of Coventry, circa 1050 , built the Abbey of that City and 12 p ious houses. King Edward the Confessor rebuilt Westminster Abbey, devoting to the work a tenth of all his s ubstance. Of this reign there was a curious inscription at Kirkdale, W.R. Yorkshire, which says that Orin, son of Gemel, rebuilt the { 266 } church; Chelittle was architect, assisted b y Howard and Brand the Priest. Yorkshire being strong in the Danish element, Mason \u0000 s Marks are often Runic letters. Remains of Saxon architecture yet exist in the churches of Jarrow; Monkwearm outh (both B iscop \u0000 s 681 ); at Repton, Co. Derby (875 ); Ripon, Hexham, York (in Crypts); Earls Barton, and Barnick, Co. Northampton; Barton on Humber; Sompting, Co. Sussex; Caversfield; Deerhurst, Brixworth, etc. It is well known that the Tower of Babel was one of the most ancient traditions of Masonry, and there is an old Saxon MS. which represents it in course of erection with the Saxon pick, and on the top step of a very tall l adder is the Master Mason giving the hailing sign of a Craftsman yet used, whilst behind hi m, on the same level, is the angel with drawn sword; a copy of it in Cassells \u0000 History of England, of the year 1901 , can readily be e xamined. It is s aid that the keep of Arundel Castle dates from Saxon times, but the chief entrance is a fine Norm an doorwa y. Mr. James Ferguson says that in these times the working bands of Masons served under Bishop, Abbot, or Priest, and this c ontinued d own to the 13th century. In travelling from one place to another their costume was a short black, or grey, tunic open at the sides, to which a gorget, or cowl or hood was attached; round the waist was a leathern girdle from which depended a short,"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"heavy sword, and a leathern satchel. Over the tunic they wore a black scapulary, similar to that worn by the priests, which t hey tucked up under the girdle when working. They had large straw or felt hats; tight leather breeches, and long boots. Attached to the Monasteries were \"Oblali,\" who were usually received as Monks, acted as s erving brothers of the Masons, and whose cost ume was s imilar to the travelling Masons, but without the cowl. Owing to the fact that modern Free Masonry has always looked to the North of England as its Mecca, inasmuch so that last century its s ystem was denominated \"Ancient\" York Masonry in opposit ion to the Grand {267 } Lodge of England organised in 1717 , which was term ed \"Modern,\" we will retrace a little in respect to this division of the old Saxon Heptarchy, which bore the name of Deira, and extended from Humber to Forth, save the Western h alf wh ich was the Kingdom of the Stratchclyde Britons. It was these two portions which continued to form the centre of Culdee influence, the capital of Deira being York, and the centre of Ancient Masonry. The city of York p ossesses numerous remains of the Ro man occupation, which the e arly Christians c onverted to the use of the Church. The Monastery of the Begging Friars is known to have been a temple dedicated to the Egyptian Serapis, and we have already mentioned the inscription to Serapis discovered at Tof t Green in 1770 . In this City the British Legionaries, on the death of Constantius Chlorus, raised his s on Constantine, surnamed the Great, on their shields, and p roclaimed him Emperor 25th July, 306 . The Culdee King Arthur is believed to have occupied a nd repaired it in 522 . It is c onsidered that t he Crypt of York Minster affords evidence of the progress of Masonry from Brito - Roman times to Saxon occupation. The Crypt has a Mosaic pavement of blue and white tiles, laid after the form used in the 1st Degree of Masonry; it shews the sites of three stone altars and such triplication was of Egyptian derivation; but these stone altars are also said to have had seats which were used b y the Master and his Wardens who met here, after the mann er r elated b y Syn esius of the Priests of Egypt, as a sacred and secret place, during the construction of the e difice. It is known that the Craft occasionally met in this Crypt during last century, and the alleged Masonic custom of meeting in Crypts elsewhere is no doubt f ounded in fact. As the Christian worship at York was of Culdee origin, so the veneration paid to Mistletoe was derived from the Druids. The learned Brother Dr. Wm. Stukeley has this passage in h is \"Medallic History of Carducius\": \"The {268 } custom is s till preserved, and lately at York on the e ve of Christmas Day they carry mistletoe to the high altar of the Cathedral and p roclaim a public and universal li berty, pardon, and freedom to all sorts of inferior and even wicked people at the gates of the city towards the four quarters of heaven.\" It follows from what we have seen that the Roman Collegia a nd the Mysteries of Serapis existed side by side at York, and amongst the members of these it is no improbable thing to suppose -- after the close conn ecti on which we have shewn to have e xisted in Egypt -- that there were Brito - Romish Christians who established the Culdee fraternities at York, before the days of Constantius Chlorus, about 2 1 /2 centuries before King Arthur was in possession of the city, and that t hese Culdees influenced the Masonic Collegia, and the same remark equally applies to o ther cities of the time; and though there is no absolute proof that York was the first centre of Culdee influence in the North, yet everything lends itself to that supposition. Every circumstance gives weight"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"to the statements of the old Northern Constitutions of Masonry, that, as Associates in Geometry, it was of Greco - Roman derivation from Egypt; and that when it was thought fit t o reorganise the Fraternity of Art isans, the Craft produced MSS . in Greek, Latin, and British, which it is s aid were \"found to be all one \"; and through this descent we reach those Sodalites which studied in Symbols, Geometry, Science, and Theosophy in their home at Alexandria. When we examine the MSS . which embody the ancient Laws of Freemasonry we find that t heir historical statements and organisation are as much in agreement as their ceremonies were, with the Arcane and Mystic sc hools. Nor is this to be wondered at since the Culdee M onks were e qually Serapians, Christians, and the Schoolmasters who taught science and religion to the people. As the Colleges of Artisans, which were introduced b y the Romans as early as 46 A.D., ceased to exist in the lapse {269 } of years, if ever they d id cease to exist, which is v ery improbable, the members became attached to the Culdee Monasteries and transmitted, through this alliance, their traditional art secrets, and as the priests had their own version of the ancient Mysteries, they understood tha t which the Masonic MSS . imply. It is an h istorical fact that the e arly Culdee priests were sometimes educated in Rome, and that they were converted Druidical Initiates; generally speaking it must have been so. Toland says that in Ireland, Columba, the follower of St. Patrick, converted the Druidical Sanctuaries into Christian Monasteries.<<Toland, i, 1726 , p. 8.>> He also provides us with a theory to explain the preservation of the Masonic Constitutions in rhyme in this, that with the absorption of Dr uidism, which was prohibited b y Rome, into Christianity, it was found necessary to frame new Regulations for the Bards and Minstrels. Accordingly in 537 an assembly was held at Drumcat in modern Londonderry, at which was present the King Amm erius, Aidus K ing of Scotland, and the Culdee Columba, when it was resolved that, f or the preservation of learning, the Kings and every Lord of a Cantred or Hundred, should have a Bard, and that schools s hould b e e ndowed under the supervision of the Arch - poet of the Ki ng.<<\"Ibid,\" p. 4.>> Thierry<<\"Norm an Conquest.\">> states that when Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland, circa 1138 , form ed part of Scotland, the Anglo - Saxon traditions were preserved b y the Minstrels, and that from thence the old English poetry, although obsolete in places inh abited b y the Norm ans, again made itself heard in a later age. The oldest version of the Constitutional Charges is in poetical form , and was first printed b y Mr. James Orchard Halliwell, who considers it to be a copy writt en in the latter part of the 14th century. Recently a copy has been printed in fine facsimile, with a most valuable Comm entary by Brother Robert Freke Gould, P.M. 2076 , who conferred upon it its present name of \"Regius MS.\" He {270 } adduces s trong eviden ce for our belief that this v ersion of Masonry may have been patronised b y the Culdee Monks of York, and that t he system actually dates from the time of Edwin King of Deira, who was c onverted to Christianity in the year 626 and for whose baptism a small ch urch or Oratory was c onstructed of wood, completed b y St. Oswald in 642 , and repaired b y Bishop Wilfrid in 669 . The Culdee Alcuin, surnamed Flaccus and also Albinus, was engaged with Eanbald under Aldbhert, who became Archbishop, in the rebuilding of Yo rk Minster of stone between the years 760 and 780 . Alcuin and Eanbald made"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"some journeys to the continent together, and on one occasion at least to Rome, between the years 762 and 766 , in search of books and other knowledge, and it was in the year 766 - 7 t hat Aldbhert became Archbishop, and converted Alcuin from a Layman into an ordained Deacon. Two years before his death in 788 the Archbishop created Eanbald Coadjutor Bishop, and gave to Alcuin the charge of his sc hools, and the now renowned library. W hen Alcuin went to France and b ecame the friend and tutor of Charlemagne it would seem that French Masonry would interlace with that of the North of England. Charlemagne was c rowned a King in the year 754 , hut his father King Pepin lived until 768 ; and wh en Alcuin speaks, as he does, \"of the temple at Aachen which is being constructed b y the art of the most wise Solomon,\" he is paying a compliment to his friend Charlemagne; and again in h is treatise \"De animae ratione\" for the King \u0000 s c ousin Gundrede he als o compares him for wisdom to Solomon. Hence it seems to be possible that Alcuin might have some knowledge of a Solomonian Masonry, and the Moslems then were, or had been, occupying the South of France. It is a curious fact that the receptions into the Ve hm, founded b y Charlemagne, embraces all the salient points of Masonic reception, though the aims of the two Societies were so dissimilar; {271 } and this must be considered in estimating Germ an Masonic receptions. The ancient Monasteries possessed a \"bo ok of gestures,\" by which they could converse by signs. The Trappists in Africa use it at this day. The Masons of old seem to have had a knowledge of this. We have e very just reason to believe that a Masonic organisation was thus early in existence, a nd that it was ratified and sanctioned b y King Athelstan, who now ruled all England from Winchester to Edwinsburg, now called Edinburgh; and who visited York in the year 933 , and again in 937 , conferring great privileges upon Beverley and Ripon of which S a xon charters, in rhyme, are produced; he also enriched the Coldei, as they are then term ed at York, where they were acting as the priests of St. Peter \u0000 s, and where they continued until they were relegated to St. Leonard \u0000 s Hospital by the Bastard to make ro om for Norm an clerics at St. Peter \u0000 s. According to this poetical Constitution, Athelstan, in order to remedy divers defects which existed in the organisation of Craft Geometry or Masonry, invited all the Men of Craft to come to him with their Council: -- \"Asemble thenn e he cowthe let make, Of dyvers lordes yn h ere state, Dukys, Erlys, and b arnes also, Knyzthys, squyers, and mony mo, And the grete burges of that syte, They were there al le yn h ere degree.\" The details of this poetical MS. is c onfirm ed b y a prose copy attached to a more modern h istorical version in a MS. written before the year 1450 , and which is known to have been in possession of Grand Master Payne in 1721 , and which was first printed in 1868 b y Brother Matthew Cooke and is hence term ed the \"Cooke MS.\" A very precise e xamination of this MS. has been made by Brother G. W. Speth in a Comm entary which h e has issued with a facsimile, as well as the MS. itself, in book fo rm bound in oak - boards, which Brother W. J. Hughan {272 } has justly described as a \"gem.\" Brother Speth h as c learly"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"demonstrated that this MS. is a copy made about 1450 b y a later writer than the original compiler. The first part is a Preface drawn by th e author from various histories, Masonic traditions and charges, and is of a later period than the Saxon Charges. To this Preface has been attached an actual copy of the most ancient \"Book of the Charges.\" With some slight differences; which we will note from time to time, the poetical \"Regius MS.,\" and the closing \"Book of Charges\" of the \"Cooke MS.\" are in substantial agreement, and either m ight well be the original of the other. The prose version of the composition of Athelstan \u0000 s Assembly is not so o r nate as that of the poetical, but inform s us that \"for grete defaut founde amongst Masons\" he ordained \"bi his c ounsellers and other greter lordys of the londe, bi comyn assent,\" a certain rule. A number of such old MSS . tells us that Athelstan granted a charter to hold such Assembly to his s on Edwin, and although Athelstan h ad no son of the name, he had a younger brother Edwin, whom he is accused, on very insufficient evidence, of having caused to be drowned in 933 ; Mabillon says, on equally doubtful evid ence, that this Edwin was received into the Benedictine Monastery of Bath in 944 <<\"Ann als of the Order of St. Benedict,\" Paris, 1703 .>> It has been recently held b y Brother R. F. Gould, in a paper of 1892 upon the nature of the Masonic General Assemblie s that it may refer, not to a grant of their own Masonic right of Assembly by Athelstan, but t o the Saxon Court - leets, Sh ire - motes, Folc - motes, or Hundred Courts of the Sh eriffs. The author of this theory g rounds it chiefly upon that part of the MSS ., whi ch we have already quoted, in regard to the great Lords form ing part of the Masonic Assembly. But such argument can amount t o no more than this, that t he writers of these documents attribute the grant of the right of Masonic Assembly by Athelstan at a mee ting of the Witenagemote; and that t he Masonic Assemblies were held, or supposed to be held, {273 } in similar form to the Folcomtes, and they were in fact, a Court of this nature, confined strictly to Masonic affairs. Probably Athelstan sanctioned the Mas ters \u0000 \"Articles\" in a Council of Nobles, and the Masonic Council added the \"Points\" t o govern Craftsmen. The nature of the Constitutions, thus alleged to be sanctioned, describe an organisation which is out of harm ony with what we might expect to find in Norm an times, or at any period to which we might assign it after the 12th century. The Athelstan grant of Masonic Assembly was held for admitting Fellows, and P assing Masters, whilst, on the other hand, the French Masons had their \"Masters \u0000 Fraternities\" to which n one were admited without much difficulty. It has also been suggested b y Brothers Speth, Rylands, and Begemann that the Masonic Assemblies may have been h eld on the same day as the Witenagemote to assure an appeal to the Sh eriff if necessary. In regard to the origin of the poetical Constitution which is term ed the \"Regius MS.,\" there is good reason for believing that it was handed d own in rhyme in the Kingdom of Northumbria until i t was c omm itted to writing in some other part of England; and th at it was intended for a Guild or Assembly of Speculative brethren consisting of Artisans of all descriptions c onn ected with buildings, and admitting Clerics and Esquires; for m oral addresses s uited to all these classes are strung together in the same MS. Dr. Begemann considers from the language that t he copy was made in North Chester, Hereford, or Worcestershire. In other words, it is addressed to, and for, an Assembly similar to the imitation made by our present Grand Lodges. Charters of privileges were given by the Norm an Bishops of Durham, to a class of people, who must have"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"long existed, called \"Hali - werkfolc\"; for the name being Saxon they were clearly pre - Norm an work folk. The late Brother William Hutchinson, of Barnard Castle, tells us that, in 17 75, he had several Charters alluding to these people, and gives the preamble of one, granted about 1100 b y the then Bishop of Durham, {274 } w hich is addressed to both \"Franci et Hali - werk folc.\" This writer believes that t he class were Speculative Masons, and he instances a branch conn ected with the old Culdee Sh rine of St. Cuthbert, and if his v iews were accepted, it would give good grounds on which to assume the conn ection of this fraternity with the poem. It is worthy of note that t he Culdee system e xisted in S cotland for some centuries after the Norm an Conquest, nor does it t hen seem to have been extinct in Ireland. The continuation of the name of the Templars in S cotland ages after its s uppression in France, is probably owing to the continuance of Culdee heresy. The Monastery of Brechin, as Mr. Cosmo Inn es points out, existed in the time of David I., the promoter of Royal Burghs, 1123 - 53, and that after the e rection of the Episcopal See, the old Culdee Convent became the electoral chapter of the ne w Bishopric; the Abbot of Brechin was s ecularised, and transmitted to his c hildren the lands which h is predecessors had held for the church; and one of these, in the time of William the Lion, made a grant of lands to the monks at Arbroath.<<Quoted in Abbot t \u0000 s \"Eccl. Surnames,\" 1871 .>> Now the seal of Arbroath h as a design which h as been taken to refer to the secret Initiation of the Culdees: a priest stands before an altar with a long staff in h is right hand, upon the upper part of which is \"IO,\" t he top f orm ing a cross; before the altar kneels a scantily clothed man with something in h is hand, he might be swearing upon a relic; three other persons are present, of whom two are brandishing swords. An antagonistic theory is that the seal represents the murde r of Thomas a Beckett. All we will say here is that it is a very fair r epresentation of the form er view, and a very poor one of the latter; and that, in consonance with the times, it may have a double meaning. Sir James Dalrymple says that the Culdees ke pt themselves together in S cotland until the beginn ing of the 14th century, and resisted the whole power of the primacy. \"Constitutional Charges.\" We will now make a slight {275 } examination of what we will call the Athelstan Constitution, as it appear s in the Regius MS., at times quoting the version of the Cooke MS. The form er includes much ornate comm ent, which is given more soberly in the latter, but essentially the two documents are one. Both consist of two series of Charges for \"two Classes,\" and a final ordinance. These, in both MSS ., are preceded b y a simple history of the mode in which Euclid organised the fraternity in Egypt, and the regulations by which Athelstan ensured a more perfect system. The first series of Charges in the Regius MS. a re 15, called ARTICLES, and concern the duties of a MASTER to his Prentices, Fellows, and their Lords or employers. The second series of Charges are called P OINTS, and arrange the duties of CRAFTSMEN to their Master and to each other. In the Cooke MS. th ese \"Articles and P oints\" have e xactly the same bearing but are e ach divided into 9 in place of 15. The closing part of the Regius MS. is headed \"Other Ordinances,\" and refers to the grant of a right of Assembly by Athelstan and the duties it had to disch arge; but a comparison with the Cooke MS. might suggest t hat t his portion is misplaced and should p recede the Articles and P oints, though in another point of view it might be taken to be a later addition, and to prove the much greater"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"antiquity of the \"Reg ius,\" as having a history settled b efore the grant of the Assembly. In the Cooke MS. the last thing is Charges to \"New Men that never were charged b efore,\" which looks like a more ancient form of the Points, but in the Regius MS. this part constitutes the closing Points of a Craftsman, and is concluded in a very characteristic way. It personates Athelstan h imself, and is held to have the very ring of the original grant; and is a record of that King \u0000 s assent to.all that has been related: -- \"T hese Statutes that y have hyr y fonde, Y chulle they ben h olde throuzh my londe, For the worshe of my rygolte That y have by my dygnyte.\" {276 } Athelstan built several castles in Northumberland, and there yet exis ts a family of the name of Roddam of Roddam who claim their lands under the following Charter, and there is actually no greater improbability in the one than in the other: -- <<Burke \u0000 s \"Landed Gentry,\" 1848 .>>  \"I Konig Athelstane,  giffe heir to Paulane,  Oddiam and Roddam,  als gude and als fair,  als ever ye mine ware,  ann yair to witness Maud my wife.\" Following the Regius Constitu tion we have a later section devoted to moral duties and etiquette. It begins with the legend of the \"Quatuor Coronati,\" four \"holy martyrs that in this Craft were of great honour,\" Masons and sculptors of the best. The church legend relates that t hey we re Christians who were employed in sculpture, and always wrought with prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, after signing with the cross, and their skill was s o great that the Philosophers attributed it t o the mysterious words of art magic. Dioclet ian gave them the option of worshipping the Pagan gods, which they refused to do, and were put to death circa 290 , and the Catholic Church canonised them as the \"Four Crowned Martyrs.\" After this they came to be acknowledged as Patrons of the building tra des, and as s uch are found in the Strasburg, English, Lombard, and other Constitutions. They are respectively represented with axe, hamm er, mallet, compasses and square; sometimes wearing crowns; at times a dog is represented with them. Attached to the Regius Constitutions are two o ther documents intended to complete the instruction in moral duties, begun in the legend just related; the first of them is equally found in a MS. entitled \"Instruction to Parish Priests,\" and concerns behaviour at church; th e closing part of this portion is found in another MS. term ed \"Urbanitatis,\" and refers to the general behaviour of {277 } young persons, whether Artisans or Esquires; MSS . of these two latter portions, as old as 1450 are found separately, but their actual origin is unknown, and it is s upposed that they may have had Norm an originals. The motto o f William of Wykeham was \"Mann ers makyth man,\" and line 726 has \"Gode maneres maken a mon.\" Between the legend of the Four Martyrs and the other documents is a port ion which h as the appearance of being imperfect, but which"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"refers to the building of Babylon and Euclid \u0000 s tuition in the seven liberal arts and sciences; it is a part of the matter form ing the Preface to the \"Book of Charges\" in the Cooke MS., so that it i s possible there was a MS., now lost, from which the writers of these two documents respectively copied additions. In any case both these MSS . are but copies of older documents, both h ave many imperfections attributable to the copyists, and which prove th at t hey were but copyists. In both MSS . again, these Constitutions c learly prove that t here was a recognised Euclid Charge, who is term ed \"Englet\" in the prose copy; that these Charges were ratified b y Athelstan; and the value which the ancient Masons a ttached to these Charges is proved b y the general agreement which exists between two diverse documents, treated in a dissimilar m ann er, and no doubt used in parts distant from each other. Both documents equally allude to Masters as a degree of the General or Heptarchial, or provincial Assembly, both assert t hat a Congregation might be made e very y ear or third year, as they would; there is mention also o f Elders, and the \"principal of the gathering \"; and b oth equally profess to give the Laws as transmitted from Egypt, and sanctioned b y Athelstan. The Regius MS., 12th Point, says that at these Assemblies: -- \"Ther schul be maystrys and felows also, And other grete lordes many mo; Ther schal be the Scheref of that con tre And also the meyer of that syte, Knyztes and sqwyres ther schul be, And other alderm en, as ye schul se.\" {278 } The prose MS. has it, \"if need b e, the Scheriffe of the countie, or the Mayer of the Cyte, or Alderm a n of the towne in which the congregacon is holden schall be felaw and sociat of the Master of the congregacon in h elpe of him agenst rebelles.\" That is the Sh eriff and Mayor were to be called to support t he Master \u0000 s authority. This prose version also men tions the \"Maister who is principal of the gadering.\" Also, that \" Congregacons sc holde be maide by \"Maisters\" of all \"Maisters Masons\" and \"Felaus\" in the foresaide art. And so at such congregacons thei that be mad Masters sc hall be e xamined of the Artic uls after written and b e ransakyed whether thei be abull and k unn ynge to the profyte of the lordys them to serue and to the honour of the forsaide art.\" From this it is c lear, and we shall see it more plainly as we proceed, that after the accepted Fello w had d eveloped his architectural knowledge it was the province of the Congregation, Assembly, or Chapter, to examine into his competency for Mastership, to swear him to his s pecial \"Articles,\" and, according to traditional custom, to Pass him by a ceremon y which gave him certain signs, tokens, and words, which enabled him to prove his c apacity wherever his travels might carry him. That is to say, not actually to Install him a Master of Work, but to enable him, as was the main object of such Tokens, to she w that he was a Passed Master; for the Assembly considered it to be its duty to see that t he Craft and Art of Masonry was not dishonoured b y ignorant pretenders. In actual practice, both in this c ountry and on the continent, the Master had to execute an a pproved task, or piece of work, or \"Master piece,\" as evidence of his ability. In London in 1356 there was a dispute of such n ature"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"between two classes of Masons, when the very authorities c ited in these Constitutions, namely, the Alderm en, Sh eriffs, &c., arranged the difficulty by a law that any Mason taking work in contract should b ring \"Six o r four ancient men of his trade,\" to testify to his ability to complete it. In the laws of the Haupt Hutte of Strasburg, {279 ) which though of the 15th century mus t reproduce much older laws, and which resemble our own, it is enacted that they might be altered b y \"three or four\" masters of work, when met together in Chapter; and we find that a Craftsman or Fellow, who served b ut five years in place of the English se ven, could not be made a Parlirer or Foreman until as a Journeyman h e had made one year \u0000 s tour of the country, in order to increase his proficiency. Such duties the Regius MS. gives in Norm an - French as \"Cure,\" and later they are designated Wardens \u0000 duties ; in Guild Rites s worn officers. It would seem from what has passed that originally the Fellows and Masters met t ogether in Assembly, but t he time came when the Masters met by themselves quarterly, as Findel shows in regard to Germ any, whilst the Fellow s met monthly. There the Masters \u0000 Fraternities were presided over by an \"Old Master,\" and the Fellows by an \"Old Fellow.\" In addition to what has been described it was in the power of the General Assembly to o verlook the Liberal Art of Masonry, regulat e it, reward merit, and punish irregularities. It would also appoint officers until the next \"Gathering,\" and fix contributions. Brother R. F. Gould has disinterred an old 16 th century reference to the Guild of Minstrels, which alleges that they had met ann ually at Beverley, for that purpose, from the day \u0000 s of King Athelstan; the similar claims of Masons may be valid, though we have access at present to no records, to prove that the Masonic Assembly met ann ually at York, or elsewhere, beyond what we find in the Laws of the government, and the assertions of old Masonic MSS . In the Regius MS. we have the following account of the divisions of the Society by Euclid: -- \"Mayster y - called so schulde he be.\" For: -- \"To hym tha t was herre yn this degre That he schulde teche the symplyst of wytte.\" Again: -- \"Uchon schulle calle others felows by cuthe, For cause they come of ladyes burthe.\" {280 } Now the Cooke MS. had not to acco mm odate itself to the metre, and may be supposed to give the same thing in closer conform ity to the original document. Speaking of the Constitution granted b y Enclid to Egyptians it says: \"Bi a serteyn time they were not all ili ke abull to take of the for seyd art. Wherefore the foresayde Maister Englet ordeynet t hei (that) were passing of conynge scholde be passing honoured. And \u0000 ded to call the conynge Maister for to enform e the lesse of counynge Maisters of the wiche were called Masters of nobilitie of wytte and conynge of that art. Nevertheless thei comm anded that thei that were lass of witte scholde not be called seruantes nor sozette but felaus ffor nobilite of their gentylle blode.\" We learn at least from this that a \"dual\" system was instituted , which finds its equivalent in the lesser and greater Mysteries, for what we find similar in"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Rites, between these bodies, extends to o rganisation, and we see it composed of the noble or Knowing Masters, and the less knowing. Fellows -- craftsmen, or jour neymen -- and we begin to see why the Masters \u0000 Articles make mention only of that rank, and the Craftsmens \u0000 Points apply only to those subordinate to the Masters. The two MSS . distinctly tell us that both the Masters and the Prentices were to term the Cra ftsmen their Fellows. It is evident t hat t he Apprentices had no call to the Assembly, but we shall soon see what t heir status actually was. They may possibly have been sworn in private Lodges of journeymen, and certainly for about 2 1 /2 centuries it has been considered that the Charge of the prose MS. to \"New Men that never were sworn before,\" referred to them. The two MSS . are again in entire conform ity in the following Regius extract. The first Article of the Masters \u0000 orders s ays: -- \"Th e Mayster Mason must be ful securly, Both steadfast, trusty, and trewe, Hyt schal him never then arewe, And p ay thy felows after the coste.\" {281 } But the 6th Article distinctly specifies \"three\" grades of payment: -- \"That the Mayster do the lord no pregedysse, To take of the lord for his \"prenfysse,\" Als much as hys \"felows\" don in all vysse, For yn that Craft they ben ful perfyt, So ys not he ze mowe sen hyt.\" The Article, however, goes on to enact that the Master m ay g ive a \"deserving Apprentice\" higher wages than a less perfect one. Such an one was no doubt at times accepted in the Assembly before the e xpiry of his s even years; and there was a simi lar custom in the Arcane Schools, for Iamblichus (ci., vi., p. 22) tells us it was a custom of the Pythagoreans that \"t he Novitiate of five years was abridged to those who attained sooner to perfection.\" It is yet a custom in some countries that when an A pprentice applies to be made a Fellow Freemason, he requests \"augmentation of salary.\" We will now follow on to that class of Masons who had not been passed as Masters, or who were e mployed under a Master of Work. These rules are called \"Points\" and he re also the poetical and p rose MSS . are in perfect accord. They enforce Brotherly - love as fully as did the ancient Society of Pythagoras. The first Point says: -- \"That whoso wol conn e thys c raft and come to astate, He must love wel G od, and holy church algate, And his Master also, that he hys wythe, Whether it be in fieid or frythe, And thy felows thou love also.\" The third P oint enjoins s ecrecy in regard to all he may see or hear: -- \"The prevyste of the Chamber tell he no mon,"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" Ny y n the logge whatsoever they done, Whatsever thou heryst, or syste him do, Tell it no mon, whersever thou go, The cownsel of halle, and zeke of bowre, Kepe hyt wel to gret honoure.\" {282 } The fourth Point is as c onclusive as to degrees as was the Masters \u0000 Articles: -- \"Ny no pregedysse he schal not do, To hys \"Mayster,\" ny his \"fellosw\" also, And thazth the \"prentis\" be under awe.\" The seventh Point is a law ag ainst unchaste conduct with a Master \u0000 s wife, daughter, sister, or concubine, which we mention h ere because it assigns a penalty, which confirm s what we have said, that a deserving Apprentice might be made free of his c raft before the e xpiry of seven years, and in this c ase it implies a secret or traditional regulation; for the crime specified the penalty is: -- \"The payne thereof let hyt be ser, That he be prentes full seven zer.\" The e ighth Point alludes to the duty of a Cure or Warden: -- \"A true medyater thou most nede be, To thy Mayster and thy felows fre.\" The ninth Point concerns Stewards of \"our halle,\" and has evident reference to the Charges of Euclid with which the MS. comm ences: -- \"Lovelyche to serven uchon othur, As thawgh they were syster and b rother.\" The later Points are not numbered as s uch in the prose MS., but follow its ninth Point as unn umbered laws. The 12th is of \"gret Royalte,\" and at the Assembly: -- \"Ther schul be Maystrys and felows also, And other grete lordes many mo.\" The fourteenth Point tells us that the Fellow had to be sworn. As the Assembly had two series of laws for Masters and Fellows, it is quite e vident that they had authority over two ranks, besides the Apprentice; and hence the Grand Lodge of England from its revival in 1717 , down to 1725 , claimed like power over the degrees of Masters and Fellows, thus treating the majority of the subordinate bodies as if Appren tice Lodges. This 14th Point says: -- \"A good trewe oathe he must there swere, To hys Mayster and hys felows that ben there.\" {283 } "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The fifteenth Point is a Penal law made against t he rebellious and these Statutes c lose with a c onfirm ation, claiming to be that of Athelstan. Now although it must be admitted that t hese ancient Constitutions are exoteric in character, and d o not make it a part of their business to settle the work of degrees, in their esoteric aspect, which it lef t to the ancient traditional mode; yet what does appear is in perfect affinity to a similar system of degrees such as we possess, and with oaths, ceremonials, and secrets for these. As there was an examination, ending in an Oath, there must of necessity h ave been some ceremony, and in its proper place we will give e vidence much older than this c opy, that the Craft had its s ecrets, signs, and watchwords and a president whom they swore to o bey. Certificates were not in use at this early date, and in comm on with the Arcane Schools these secrets did d uty for a certificate, and p roved as well the degree of skill a Mason possessed; in more ancient times s uch Rites and symbolic instruction h ad a higher value than a mere form ula by which to recognise e ach other. Apart from trade secrets there was another reason for great secrecy as to Masonic Rites in the fact that whilst the Christian Emperors of Rome were destroying the Arcane Schools and hounding them to death, the protection of the Masonic art was necessary to the glorification of the Church -- and each sought to protect themselves. There is no doubt that these ancient traditional Rites, which were originally the type of an ancient religion, would vary with circumstances, the convenience of time and p lace, a nd the members of the Lodge. In the very early times of the Society, the Apprentice had no ceremony, until, with time, he merited to become a Fellow. The e soteric Ritual of the Assembly was then dual, but there is evidence in modern times that the Appren tice was s worn to a Charge. In very extensive buildings where the Lodge was numerous, -- and we read of some e mbracing from hundreds to thousands of workmen; the {284 } Apprentice would b e sworn, and the chief Master \u0000 s Fellows would come to include two di visions: Some who had b een Passed as \"Noble Masters\" would take e mployment on such works as Journeymen, and we should thus find in the same Lodge, sworn Fellows, and Masters, under a sole Worshipful Master of Work, or the system we have to - day in our Lodge s, but without the ancient techn ical knowledge. Though these Constitutions had other legends tacked on to them in Norm an times, and to which we shall refer in our next chapter, the Anglo - Saxon Masons must have considered them as the time - imm emorial Char ter of their privileges, even down to the 14th century. They were the authority under which they continued to hold Assemblies, the e xistence of which is v ouched b y the laws which the State made to suppress them. We have seen that t he meetings were held u nder a president, who had p ower to swear Freed - Apprentices or Passed Fellows, and in due course to examine and p ass these as Masters if fully competent. Besides the tokens by which they could p rove their rank, they had a system of Marks to indicate their property and workmanship; it is alleged there was even a double system, evidenced in this, that as a Stone Cutter possessed a Mark for his work, and the Master one for his approval; traces are claimed to exist where, at a later period, the stone - cutter \u0000 s M ark comes to be used as the Master \u0000 s s ymbol of approbation. Brother Chetwode Crawley, LL.D., draws attention to this, that during the centuries when the Masonic Association was in full operation, Arabic numerals and therefore modern arithmetic was unknown , and calculations c ould only be made by aid"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"of the Roman n otation; hence the traditions and secret rules of geometry were all i mportant t o the Craft, and made it essential that Masons s hould b e geometers. Mr. Cox finds that t he design or tracing - boards o f various old buildings are grounded upon the five - pointed Star of Freemasonry, and on the Pythagorean problem of a modern past - Master, with its ratio o f 3, 4, {285 } 5, or the multiples thereof as 6, 8, IO, and this was especially a Guild secret of constru ction. The MSS . upon which we have been comm enting represent the best days of the Saxon Craft; with the Norm an Conquest came over French Masons in large numbers; and we may see between the lines, a subtle struggle between antagonistic s ystems, and p ossi bly much of the secrecy of Masonry that existed throughout the centuries down to 1717 , may be owing to this; and to the fact that the Saxon Mason was assigned a subordinate position. There can be no doubt t hat at t he comparative late date when these two M SS . were written there were Masons in various parts who still clung to the Athelstan constitution. On the other hand the Anglo - Norm an Kings, 1350 - 60, were passing Ordinances and laws, against \" all alliances, covines, congregations, chapters, ordinances an d oaths,\" amongst Masons and other artisans. These laws were e ndorsed b y others in 1368 , 1378 , 1414 , and 1423 . They seem, however, to have affected very little the Masonic Assemblies, and in 1425 a law was passed to specially prohibit Masons from assembl ing in Chapters; even this law remained a dead letter on the Statute book; but it is from about this period that t he Saxon system passes entirely into disuse. In this c ontest between the alleged Saxon right of Assembly, and the objections of the Anglo - Nor man rulers to meetings held without a Charter, we see the necessity that existed for the Masons to submit their Constitutional Charges to the reigning Sovereigns, as they had b een comm anded b y Athelstan to do, from King to King; indeed Acts were passed in 1389 and 1439 ordering the officers of Guilds and Fraternities to show their Patents to the neighbouring Justices for their approval, but it does not seem clear whether other is meant than the Chartered Livery Companies. It has been previously mentioned that in these two priceless documents which h ave all the marks of a genuine Saxon transmission, there is not one word which leads us to suppose that the members of the Society thus {286 } form ed had an idea that t heir forefathers had wrought at t he buildin g of Solomon \u0000 s temple; and it is impossible to suppose that if the ceremonies then in use had referred to such a circumstance all reference thereto would have been omitted from the Constitution. The language in which these documents are couched is Chris tian, of a liberal but perfectly orthodox cast. Christian churches c ould only be symbolically constructed, with Christian symbolism, by Masons practising Christian Rites, and the priests would have been ready enough to burn any Mason that supported the Ta lmud; we have an instance of this intolerance in the destruction of the Templars in the year 1310 - 13. This is a q uestion of simple historical fact in which we need have no bias either one way or the other. All Masonic tradition is opposed to uniform ity o f Rites, and in France, from the earliest t imes, we find three opposing schools whose ceremonies may be broadly classed as Trinitarian and Monotheistic rites. When we consider that t he Masons of pre - conquest t imes were not subordinated to those of Franc e, we should not expect uniform Rites in the two"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"countries and when we e xamine the MSS . of the form er and the latter it is c lear that such did not exist. In France itself no such uniform ity existed; coming down side by side, shrouded in secrecy for centur ies, there e xisted three sections denominated the \"Compagnonage\" form ed of artizans generally and not confined to Masons, and it is altogether an error to suppose that the most ancient Saxon fraternity was c onfined to workers in stone, they included all me n who used Geometry in their trade, as the MSS . themselves inform us. Besides these, at an early period, probably much earlier but at least co - eval with the Norm an conquest of England, there e xisted in France Master \u0000 s fraternities of an essentially Christ ian character attached to some church, and to the support of which Fellows and Apprentices had to contribute. As a Sodality the Council of Rouen in 1189 , and of Avignon {287 } 1326 , recorded their disapprobation, against their signs, their oaths, and their obedience to a President. The English laws of the Norm an Kings followed this prohibition, Scotland followed suit, and it is not improbable that this c ircumstance led to the chartering of Livery Companies in England, and Incorporations in S cotland. \"Th e French S ects.\" The three divisions of the French Compagnonage became chiefly journeymen, and for a period of over 500 years were in mutual dissension, and at times even at actual war, when many lives were lost. These are, were, and still are, -- (1) th e \"Children of Master Jacques,\" which is represented in Anglo - Saxon Christian Masonry; (2) the \"Sons of Solomon,\" classed with our present system; and it is quite possible they may derive a Semitic s ystem from Spain in very early times for the Moslems were in possession in the South until Martel expelled them; (3) the \"Children of Father Sonbise \"who were chiefly Carpenters, as many of the most early builders must have been, and whose name is s upposed to have some affinity with S abazios, one of the names of Bacchus or Dionysos. Each of these Sections had their own peculiar ceremonies in which is the drama of an assassination, all somewhat similar but apparently arranged in such mann er as to cast odium on their opponents. One peculiarity is that t he Members assume the name of some animal, and b ranches are known as wolves, werewolves, dogs, foxes, which reminds us of the masks of criminals worn in the religious Mysteries of Greece and Egypt, and we saw that the sun was c ompared to a wolf in the Mysteries of B acchus. Brother Gould has expressed an opinion that t he Carpenters were the oldest association, the followers of Jacques the town association, and the Sons of Solomon the privileged corporations that set out from the Monasteries, after the crusades, when architecture became a lay occupation. It is perhaps as probable, though n ot irreconcilable with thls v iew, that the sects arose out of the successive developments of civil, sacred, and military architecture. Brother {288 } F. F. Schn itger expresses an opi nion that the Masons belonging to a \"Domus\" (civil) were unfree; those attached to the Castle of a Lord would b e \"glebae proscripti\" (military); and that it would only be the travelling church Masons (sacred), free to work anywhere that would b e actual Fre e Masons, and that t hese would b e likely to have different ceremonies, even if the two first - named were allowed any. The probabilities are e xceeding strong in France for the transmission of old Roman Rites, and the Fraternities would seem to possess tra ditions or customs comm on to the Gnostics and Saracens. Like the Manichees they reverence the reed and like the Dervish sects they allege the receipt of a Charge by the act of receiving some particular garm ent of the Master; thus one received his Cap,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ano ther his Mantle, and a third his girdle; the same is alleged in the Moslem sects. It is a rite or claim that has the appearance of derivation, though possibly from an ancient comm on source, and would scarcely arise accidentally. In the legend of Master Jacques, that personage is s lain by the followers of Soubise. The \"Sons of Solomon\" have a relation in regard to the death of Hiram, or Adoniram the collector of tribute to Solomon and Rheoboam, who was s lain by the incensed p eople, and the account relat es that his body was found b y a dog; this s ect claims a direct Charge from King Solomon and admits all religions without question in contradistinction to the other sects which require their m embers to be orthodox. Perdiguer says of its Initiation, that \"i n it are crimes and p unishments.\" In reference to the cause of the ill feeling between the sects the legends v ary. One account carries back this hostility to a period when a section placed themselves under the patronage of Jacques de Molay, Grand Maste r of Templars 1308 - 1310 , and imm ediately before the destruction of that Order by Philip le Bel. Another account attributes these dissensions to the time of a Jacques Molar, who is s aid to be the builder in 1402 of {289 } the towers of Orleans Cathedral; th e Sons of Solomon refused to labour with the children of Jacques, struck work and fled, and the strong arm of the law had to be requisitioned. It looks like the quarrels of an ordinary trade - union whether occurring in 1308 or 1402 . If the Jacques Molar v ersion is historical it is possible that some of the Sons of Solomon may have left t hat Society and joined an already existing fraternity of Jacques, thus adding a building programm e to the many already represented in that fraternity. The traditions would seem to possess the same reliability as our own Masonic legends; and the one tends to prove the antiquity of the other; for as the Compagnonage and English Masonry, have e ach their ceremonies, degrees, oaths, and tokens of recognition, they have had a der ivation in comm on, for there has been n o alliance between the two at any period. In regard to Rites the \"Children of Master Jacques\" admit only Roman Catholics, and say that they \"accept Jacques as their m ortal father and Christ as their spiritual fathe r,\" and adopt the sensible maxim that \"whilst Solomon founded them, other m en modified them and that they live under the laws of these last.\" We have e ndeavoured, however imperfectly, to shew w hat Anglo - Saxon Masonry was, and consider this s ystem to assim ilate with it; and we must bear in mind that the Continent was much indebted to this c ountry at one time, thus Diocletian sent Artists from Britain to Gaul, Columban journeyed to Burgundy, Alcuin of York to the Court of Charlemagne, St. Boniface to Germ any . The \"first step\" is term ed Attendant or Affiliate, and corresponds to o ur Apprentice, he is a young workman, protected and looked after, but considered to be outside any Mystic Rites as was the Saxon Apprentice. The \"second step\" is term ed Received C ompanion; which is equivalent to the term accepted and the Fellow of the Saxon Assemblies, he has c ertain secrets and takes part in a dramatic c eremony of the assassination and b urial with lamentations as in the old Mysteries, of Master {290 } Jacques, whos e corpse was discovered supported by reeds. It is practically a disguised d rama of the betrayal of Christ. The \"third step\" probably points to a time prior to the e stablishment of Masters \u0000 Fraternities, and corresponds with the Passed Masters and Harodim of the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Guilds; it is term ed Finished Companion, in which the Aspirant passes through a dramatic representation of the passion of Christ, and this c eremony, as was doubtless the case in old times in England, rendered and still renders, its possessor eligib le for offices of dignity and honour; and may be classed with the Noble, Knowing, or Worshipful Master which form ed the chief rank of the Saxon congregations, save those who had b een the \"Maister who is principal of the gadering.\" It is c urious that the n ames s hould agree so closely with those of the Persian Magi, in the time of Cyrus, which were in translation, -- Disciple, Master, Complete Master. Two o ther circumstances point in the same direction for the descent of this branch of the Society, namely t he use of the reed, and of some article of clothing to confirm a \"Charge;\" both the Manichees and the Dervish sects are descendants of the Persian Magi. This c eremony in the grade of Accepted Companion represents the heroic and p re - Christian anti - type; an d as s uch is parallel with the Pedestal point of Harodim - Rosy Cross, where the Candidate is led up a pinn acle and sees a word that is prophetical of what is given in the degree of Finished Companion which is the e xplanation and complement of the anti - type. English Masonry has lost much by the refinements of the learned, or by those who \"imagined themselves to be learned,\" and in any case it is easy for such to influence the ignorant. The French h ave lacked this in the several sects, and have therefore tra nsmitted what they received without understanding it. So have English S tone Masons. There is a peculiar system of salutation called the Guilbrette, two meet, cross their wands and embrace; it has its analogue in all G uilds both East and West. {291 } Th e legends as to the schism, though old and in writing now, are of course traditional, and cann ot be unconditionally accepted. We learn something of what their ceremonies c onsisted 250 years ago, as the Doctors of the Sorbonn e examined some traitorous memb ers between 1648 - 50, and accused the Compagnonage of profaning the Mystery of Christ \u0000 s passion and d eath, of baptising in derision, of taking new names, using secret watchwords, obligating to mutual assistance \"with other accursed ceremonies.\"<<Vide Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Freemasonry.\">> Much of thls we have seen was c omm on to the Arcane Discipline of the church, and the Charges read very similar to those made by the Fathers when they desired to have the Ancient Mysteries s uppressed; in the same spirit they have d estroyed all li terature that made against themselves and their acts. Almost t he same thing might be said b y a fanatic and fool against the old Ancient degrees of Harodim - Rosy Cross in this c ountry: and it is v ery noteworthy and \"very suggestive\" that the ancient oath of the English Rosy Cross has a penalty, alluding to the Saviour \u0000 s death which is absolutely identical with the highest grade of this French fraternity of Jacques. The French \"Fendeurs,\" or Charcoal burners, resemble so closely those describe d by the priests in 1650 , that there can be no doubt both h ave the same comm on origin; the Fendeur Initiation carry their legends back to remote times, and claim a Scottish origin; possibly it points to a Culdee or other sectarian derivation thence. \"Th e Salute.\" Most of the Mystic Sects which derive from what we term the Arcane Schools, seem to have a \"Salute\" by way of recognition, that is, a phrase by way of \"Salutation,\" and this is probably what Brito - Saxon Masonry possessed, before Semitic legends and Hebrew w ords were introduced in Norm an times. This \"Greeting\" went with the \"Word\" until i t was abandoned"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"last century. A Christian system that had no allusion to Solomon \u0000 s temple would have the \"Greeting,\" and is therefore probably one of the most ancient parts of our Rites. {292 } Brother J. G. Findel in h is \"History of Freemasonry\" professes to give the Catechism in use amongst the Masons of the Haupt Hutte of Strasburg, which term ed their Assemblies Chapters, after the usage of the Benedictines . In the strict sense of the term what is c alled \"Words\" in this ritual is a Greeting. The questioner asks: -- \"How many words has a Mason? Seven. Q. What are they? God b less all honourable conduct; God b less all honourable knowledge; God bless the hon ourable Craft of Masonry; God b less the honourable Master; God bless the honourable foreman; God b less the honourable Fraternity; God grant honourable preferm ent to all Masons here, and in all places by sea a nd land.\" We have here seven prayers easily rem embered; and the following passwords were e licited b y the Questioner: -- \"Kaiser Carl II.; Anton Hieronymus; Walkan.\" The two last are supposed to be corrupted from Adoniram, and Tubal Cain, the last named, it may be, through Vulcan. Professor Robison, w ho wrote upon Germ an Masonry last century, expresses an opinion that an Apprentice received an additional word with each year of his labour. During last century there still remained old members of the Strasburg Constitution, though it had then lost all it s influence, and there is an interesting statement recorded on the authority of Mr. Vogel, an old operative Mason, who is reported to have said, in 1785 , that t he Germ an Masons c onsisted of three classes: -- \"The Letter Masons,\" or those made by Certificat e; \"The Salute Masons,\" or those who used a form of Salutation similar to that just quoted; and \"the Freemasons,\" who he says, \"are the richest, but they work b y our word and we by theirs;\"<<Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Freemasonry,\" ii, p. 312 ; also Findel \u0000 s \"Hist. Fre em.\">> which implies that he was a \"Salute\" Mason, and that the \"Greeting,\" and the \"Word\" were originally the marks of two distinct sects but had come to be united. Another writer states, on the authority of a newly received Freemason, who was a member o f the Haupt Hutte systems, that t he grip was the same in both societies. {293 } We may dismiss the \"Certificate\" Mason in a few w ords; in England it corresponds with trade Freedom granted b y Municipal bodies from the time of Queen Elizabeth to o ur own da ys. Our oldest Catechisms not only include a triplicate \"Greeting\" but the \"Word\" system, but we need not give this until i ts proper date, and on the e vidence we have given it may be assumed, that in the ancient Masonry of this c ountry the \"Salute\" was th e \"Word,\" and that upon it was engrafted certain Hebrew w ords. As the Saxon system was a Christian one, no doubt its c hief grade, or Master \u0000 s Fraternity, has descended to us in the degrees of Harod and the Harodim - Rosy Cross, translated b y the French Rose - croix o f Heredom, Templar, etc., f or all these grades are very similar; and its transmission is equally probable with the known transmission for centuries, of the Christ - like ceremonies of the French fraternity of Jacques, but this we will again refer to in a chapter on the high - grades. \"Conclusion.\" As we have observed several times, but may again repeat, the drama of the Mysteries was of a spiritual nature designed to teach h ow man might so conduct his earthly pilgrimage as to arrive at imm ortal li fe , and the Initiate during the instruction personated a god who was s lain and rose again from the dead. It is not difficult to comprehend how such a symbolic death and rebirth was transform ed into the drama of the career of the Saviour of fallen"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"man. Such a Rite is in entire accord with what we know of the Culdee Monks and Masons, who were at York when King Athelstan granted them a Charter, whilst Hiramism is in discord thereto. We may summ arise the details of this chapter in a few w ords; they point t o th e derivation of a system of trade Mysteries introduced b y Greco - Romans into Britain from an Egyptian source; modified into o rthodox Christianity by Culdees who had similar r econdite Mysteries of a spiritual type, and who taught and d irected the Guilds of A rtizans during the whole Saxon period; our next Chapter will i ndicate a system in consonance with the French \"Sons of Solomon.\" {294 }   CHAPTER IX.  MASONRY IN N ORMAN ENGLAND. WE made mention in our last Chapter of a series of Masonic legends which are, in some measure, historically opposed to the old Saxon Constitutions. These first appear in written documents of about 1450 A.D., but as these are copies of still older MSS ., may well date into the 12 th century in this c ountry. There are two o ld MSS . the laws of which differ in essential points: in the e lder or \"Cooke MS.\" t hose legends which imply a Semitic origin and actually represent our present Craft Rites, form the Preface, or Comm entary, to an actual Saxon Charge; whilst t he later, or \"Wm. Watson MS,\" is a copy of a much older document, and itself over two centuries old, is c omplete in itself, with a modified series of charges: the second p art might belong to a \"Guild\" which h ad a traditional pr eference to a Saxon Constitution, and the first t o a later compiler, one who had accepted the Norm an system, and its Rites. We will endeavour in this Chapter to supply such reliable inform ation, as c an be gathered, to account for the legends s uperimposed upon the older. It is in Norm an times, adding French details, that this matter shews itself, and as there is yet no established view on the subject, it may be e xamined in various aspects. In the first place these legends may have been fixed in France b y the conquests which the Saracens made in that country; or 2ndly, they may have reached that country through the Moorish conquests in S pain; or 3rdly, and a probable view, they might have been brought {295 } from the East, by those Masons who returned in t he train of the Crusaders; lastly, but upon this we place small credence, some of our able critics have held that the Oriental legends are collected from books of general history by the first compiler of this version of the Charges, though admitting that t he author had old Masonic Charges to guide him. A very elaborate paper, which may be classed with the first of these views, has been written by Brother C. C. Howard, of Picton, New Zealand, and he relies upon the fact that this new Charge draws its insp iration from Roman Verulam and the e rection of St. Albans by Offa, King of Mercia, circa 793 , and that one Namas Graecus, under various s pellings, is given as the teacher of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Masonry in France. Offa is s upposed, by Brother Howard, to have brought Masons fr om Nismes, or Nimes, in S outhern France, for the purpose in view, hence the derivation of Namas Graecus. A theory such as that of Brother Howard would well account for all that is peculiar in this Constitution. The present Nimes is a very ancient Greco - Roman town, and has perfect remains of the work of their architects; moreover it was for two centuries in the hands of the Saracens, until Charles Martel, who was the traditional patron of French Masons and the Hamm er of the Saracens, drove them out of th at town, and may then h ave appointed a Duke or prince to rule it. The \"Cooke MS\" like the Strasburg Statutes s peak of Charles II., but this is an error, and it is noteworthy that the \"Charges of David and Solomon,\" are invariably united with the French pa tronage, proving that we derive these Masonic v iews from French sources. At whatever date these Constitutions first appeared in this c ountry they eventually superseded the English version. The Saracens were large builders in the East, and even the Maus oleum of Theodric of Ravenn a, erected in the 6th century, is c onsidered b y de Vogue to be the work of Syrian Masons brought forward b y Byzantines. It is {296 } said that about the year 693 they assembled 12 ,000 stonecutters to build the great Alamya a t Dam ascus.<<Condes \"Arabs in S pain.\">> The Tulun Mosque at Cairo which was built in the 9th century, has all the main features of Gothic styles, and the same race e rected numerous magnificent works in S pain. Gibbon inform s us that between 813 - 33 the Moors br ought into Spain all the literature which they could obtain in Constantinople, and that between 912 - 61 the most celebrated architects were invited from thence. We learn from a catalogue of the Escuriel li brary that they possessed 70 p ublic libraries, and that the MSS . handed d own includes translations from Greek and Latin and Arabic writers on philosophy, philology, jurisprudence, theology, mysticism, talismans, divination, agriculture, and other arts. They g ave us astronomy, alchemy, arithmetic, algebra, Greek p hilosophy, paper - making, the pendulum, the mariners \u0000 compass, and our first notions of chivalry, and arm ed - fraternities. Whether they g ave us Gothic architecture may be doubtful but the durability of their own buildings is astounding, and Cordova, the seat of empire, covered a space 24 miles by 6 miles, even in the 8th and 9 th centuries, and was filled with magnificent palaces and p ublic edifices. Roger Bacon probably derived gunpowder through their interm ediary. It is possible that Syrian frat ernities of Masons c ontinued to exist until i ts invasion by the Saracens, and they themselves, as we have seen, had secret fraternities analogous to Freemasonry, and as the Koran accepts the history of the Jewish Patriarchs s uch a system as we now possess is in accord with their feelings, and might possibly be acceptable to a French fraternity who were Christians and had d erived b uilding instructions from a Moslem r ace. If the Saracenic theory in regard to Nismes is inadmissable, or the derivation of the F rench Charges under Norm an introduction, when the system had consolidated under the \"Sons of Solomon;\" there are two o ther views we may notice. The possibility of a derivation from the {297 } Spanish Moors; or through the Crusaders who returned from Palest ine after erecting endless works with the assistance of the native Masons. Neither of these two views will account fully for the fact that the \"Constitutions\" of the period of this Chapter conn ect the Charges of David and Solomon with the Namas Graecus \"w ho had b een at the building of Solomon \u0000 s temple,\" with Charles Martel, or even Charles II. But"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"this is not a great difficulty, for Namas does not appear until circa 1525 , and was always a trouble to the Copyists, sometimes he is Namas, at others he is Aym on, or the man with a Greek name, and on one occasion h e is Grenaeus. Again building, in Europe, was a clerical art down to the 12th century and laymen were subject to them; but the religion of the Saracens was of a different cast, and admitted from the v ery first, of the continuance of independent schools of Architecture attached to no Sh eik - ul - Islam, Mollah, or Dervish. On the whole we seem to be led b y these considerations to the Norm an - French introduction into this c ountry of a species of Masonic rule s, rites, and legends which existed in S outhern France, and which were still further influenced in the 13th century by Masons from the East; but the reader can judge of this upon reading all the facts. When Abdur - Rahman built the great Mosque of Cordova in the short space of ten years, he said, -- \"Let us raise to Allah a Jamm a Musjid which shall surpass the temple raised b y Sulieman h imself at Jerusalem.\" This is the oldest comparison which we have of Solomon \u0000 s erection as c ompared with mediaeval erect ions, and coming from a Moslem is eminently suggestive. Some 30 years ago Bro. Viner Bedolphe brought forward some cogent arguments to prove that t hough our Craft Masonry had b een derived from the Roman Colleges the 3rd Degree of Modern Masonry had b een a dded, in its s econd half, by Moslems. But as a matter of fact t he e xisting Jewish Guilds have a ceremony from which our Modern 3rd Degree is derived through the ancient Guilds, and it is quite possible that t he work {298 } men of Abdur - Rahman found it of o ld d ate in S pain, as we shall see later; and that a Guild of them was employed at Cordova. Mecca has had for ages a semi - Masonic Society which claims its derivation from the Koreish who were Guardians of the Kaaba; namely, the Benai Ibraham. For some hun dreds of years our Constitutions have asserted that Nimr od was a Grand Master and gave the Masons a Charge which we still follow. Its first degree is the \"Builders of Babylon,\" and is directed against Nimr od and his idols, and against idolatry in general . Its second d egree is the \"Brothers of the Pyramids,\" and teaches, as do o ur own Constitutions, that Abraham taught the Egyptians geometry, and the mode of building the pyramids. The third d egree is \"Builders of the Kaaba,\" in which the three Grand Mast er Masons Ibrahim, Ishmael, and Isaque, erect the first Kaaba, on the foundations of the temple e rected b y Seth on the plans of his father Adam. At the completion of the Kaaba, the twelve chiefs or Assistants of the \"three\" Grand Masters are created P rinc es of Arabia. The Society was clearly ancient in A.D. 600 as al Koran alludes to the legendary basis on which it is form ed. There is a very interesting French romance of the 12th century by Huon de Villeneuve which seems to have a bearing upon the name s of our old Masonic MSS ., or at least on a corrupt version of them; and which moreover comm emorates the Masonic death of a person who is s upposed to have battled with the Saracens in France and P alestine. Either the work may veil legends of the Compagnon age, or, with less probability, these latter m ay have drawn something from it. This romance is entitled \"Les Qualre Fils Aymon.\" Charlemagne returns v ictorious from a long and b loody war against t he Saracens in Easter, 768 , and has to listen to accusatio ns against Prince Aymon of the Ardenn es, for failing to perform his fealty in n ot warring against t he Saracens. Charlemagne has as c olleagues Solomon of Bretagne, and his trusty"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"friend the Duke of Naismes. Renaud, Allard, Guichard, and {299 } Richard, the \"four sons of Aymon,\" depart from the Court in quest of adventure. They defeat Bourgons the Saracen chief before Bordeaux, cause him to become a Christian, and after that restore Yon, King of Aquitaine, to his throne; Renaud marries his daughter Laura a nd erects the Castle of Montauban. Yon fears the anger of Charlemagne, persuades the four Aymons to solicit his grace, and they set out \"with olive branches in their hands,\" but are treacherously waylaid b y their enemies, and would have been slain but for the arrival of their cousin Maugis, and the \"cyprus was c hanged for the palm.\" Richard is taken prisoner, and condemned to death, but Maugis disguises himself as a Pilgrim, hangs the executioner, carries off Richard, and also the golden crown and sceptre of Charlemagne, who thereupon resolves to attack Montauban. After a due amount of battles, peace is restored on condition that Renaud d eparts on a pilgrimage to Palestine. On arrival there he is s urprised to meet Maugis, and between them they restore th e old Christian King of Jerusalem to the throne. After an interval Renaud is recalled to France and on h is arrival finds his wife dead of grief, as well as his aged father Aymon and his mother. His old antagonists -- Naismes, Oger, and Roland have been s lain at Ronciveux. Five years later Charlemagne visits Aix - la - Chapel, with the three brothers Aymon and their two nephews, and the following is a literal translation of what occurred: \" \u0000 Hollo! says the Emperor, to a good woman, what means this c rowd? \u0000 The peasant answered, -- \u0000 I come from the village of Crosne, where died two days ago a holy herm it who was tall and strong as a giant. He proposed to assist t he Masons to construct at Cologne the Church of St. Peter; he manoeuvred so well that the others who were jealous of his ability, killed him in the night time whilst he slept, and threw his body into the Rhine, but it floated, covered with light. On the arrival of the bishop the body was exposed in the Nave, with uncovered face that it might be recognis ed. Behold what it is that draws the {300 } crowd. \u0000 \" The Emperor approached and b eheld Renaud of Montauban, and the three Aymons, and two sons of Renaud, mingled their tears over the corpse. Then the bishop said: -- Console yourselves! H e for whom you g rieve has c onquered the imm ortal palm.\" The Emperor ordered \"a magnificent funeral and a rich tomb.\" In the translation of Caxton it is the bishop who does this and also Canonises him as \"St. Renaude the Marter.\" In the time of Charlemagne, and even muc h later, there e xisted a great number of pre - Christian and Gnostic rites, and the Emperor is c redited with reform ing, or establishing, in S axony, the country of Aymon, whose memory was held in great veneration even down to the 19th century, a secret frater nity for the suppression of Paganism, which h as most of the form s of Modern Freemasonry. Hargrave Jenn ings holds that the fleur - de - lis may be traced through the bees of Charlemagne to the Scarab of Egypt, and is again found on the Tiaras of the gods of Eg ypt and Chaldea. After the Culdee Alcuin h ad assisted in building the Church of St. Peter at York, he went over to France, and b ecame a great favourite at Court, having the instruction of the Emperor himself whom he term s a builder \"by the Art of the Most Wise Solomon,\" who made him an Abbot. Apart from the significance of this romance in a Masonic s ense, which appears to have drawn on existing Masonry, there are some peculiar correspondences. The body of Osiris was thrown into the Nile, that of Renaud i nto the Rhine. The address of the bishop to the mourners is almost identical with that of the old Hierophants to the mourners for the slain sun - god. As"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"before stated the \"branch\" varied in the Mysteries, as the e rica, the ivy, the palm, the laurel, the g olden - bough. As in the case of the substituted victim for Richard the Moslems held that a substitute was made for Jesus. The romance confuses the time of Charlemagne, if we accept it literally, with that of a Christian King of Jerusalem, as the Masonic M SS . confuse the date of Charles of France with an apocryphal Aymon who was at t he building {301 } of Solomon \u0000 s temple. Possibly the Masons c onfused the Temple of Solomon with that existing one which Cardinal Vitry and Maundeville inform us was \"called the Temple of Solomon to distinguish the temple of the Chivalry from that of Christ;\" t hey allude of course to the house of the Knights Templars. These legends may well represent some ancient t radition, and we know not what MSS . have perished d uring the centu ries. A curiously veiled p agan Mythology may be traced in Paris; comparing St. Denis to Dionysos. The death of St. Denis takes place on Montmartre, that of Dionysos on Mount Parnassus; the remains of Denis are collected b y holy women who consign them wit h lamentations to a tomb over which the beautiful Abbey was erected; but he rises from his tomb like Dionysos, and replacing his s evered head walks away. Over the southern gate of the Abbey is also sculptured a sprig of the vine laden with grapes which wa s a Dionysian symbol, and at the feet of the Saint, in other parts, the panther is represented, whose skin was in use in the Rites of the Mysteries. Other attempts to identify Namas Graecus may be given. Brother Robert H. Murdock, Major R.A., considers that this person is the Marcus Graecus from whose MS. Bacon admits in \"De Nullitate Magiae,\" 1216 , that he derived the composition of gunpowder. There is one old MS. in the e arly days of the Grand Lodge that has adopted this v iew. Here again we run agai nst the Saracens, for Duten shews that the Brahmins were acquainted with powder from whom it passed to the Lulli or Gypsies of Babylon, the Greeks and Saracens, and it is thought to have been used b y the Arabs at the siege of Mecca in 690 ; again Peter Mexi a shews that in 1343 the Moors used explosive shells against Alphonso XII. of Castile, and a little later the Gypsies were e xpert in making the heavy g uns. Very little is known of Marcus Graecus but early in the 9th century his writings are, erroneously, supposed to be mentioned b y the Arabian physician Mesue.<<The \"Cyclo. of\" Eph. Chambers, art. \"Gunpowder.\">> {302 } The acceptance of Marcus of gunpowder notoriety as identical with Namas or Marcus of Masonic notoriety, necessitates one of two suppositions: (1) either he was the instructor, or believed to be so, of Charles Martel in Military erections; or (2) the fraternity of Masons had a branch devoted to the study of Alchemy and the hidden things of nature and science: much might he said in its favor, but unless there was s ome MS. of a much earlier date that mentions Namas or Marcus, and is missing, the introduction is probably only of the 16th century when Masons were actually Students of Masonry and the secret sciences. Another theory has been propounde d b y Brother Klein, F.R.S., the e minent P.M. of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge, namely that Haroun al Raschid \u0000 s s on the Caliph al Mamun is \"the man with a Greek name.\" He shews that in the time of this Caliph the books of Euclid were translated into Arabic fo r the Colleges of Cordova, and it was not until the 12th century that Abelard of Bath rendered them into Latin. The original G reek MS. was lost for 700 years when it was found b y Simon Grynaeus, a Suabian and co - labourer of Melancthon and Luther. In 1530 he gave the MS. to the world,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"and we actually find that in some of our MSS . Graecus is transform ed into Green, Grenenois, Grenus, Graneus. Caxton printed the \"Four Sons of Aymon\" in the 15th century, and we find some scribes transform ing Namas into Aymon . Here we have a later attempt to identify the personality mentioned; he was a man of whom nobody knew anything, and each scribe sought to develop his own idea, if he had any. Charlemagne was a contemporary of the Haroun al Raschid here mentioned who s ent him a sapphire ornament and chain by his ambassador. Green in h is \"Sh ort History of the English People\" (London, 1876 ) says: -- \"A Jewish medical school seems to have e xisted at Oxford; Abelard of Bath brought back a knowledge of Mathematics from Co rdova; Roger Bacon h imself studied under the English Rabbis\" (page {303 } 83). Bacon h imself writes: \"I have caused youths to be instructed in languages, geometry, arithmetic, the construction of tables and instruments, and many needful things besides.\" T he great work of this mendicant Friar of the Order of St. Francis, the \"Opus Majus,\" is a reform of the methods of philosophy: \"But from gramm ar he passes to mathematics, from m athematics to experimental philosophy. Under the name of Mathematics was enclo sed all the physical science of the time.\" It is beyond d oubt that after the Norm an conquest in 1066 the predominant genius of Masonry was French; the oversight and the design were French, the labour Anglo - Saxon; but t he latter were strong enough as s he wn, by an eminent architect, to transmit their own style in combination with that of the French. It must also be borne in mind that if the English towns have some claims to Roman succession, that feature is doubly strong in France, even to the language. Long after the conquest of the country by the Franks, and even until modern times, the people were allowed to continue Roman laws, privileges, colleges, and Guilds; pure Roman architecture e xists to this day, and notably at Nimes. Lodges, though n ot perha ps under that name, must have e xisted from the e arliest times, for we find that in the 12th century, the Craft was divided into three divisions; we may even say four, for besides the Passed Masters Associations, there were Apprentices, Companions or Journe ymen, and p erpetual Companions, or a class who were neither allowed to take an Apprentice, or to begin business as Masters; that is they could employ themselves only on inferior work. The e minent historian of Masonry, Brother R. F. Gould, shews this, and also that the so - called \"Fraternities\" of France were the Masters \u0000 Associations, but t hat t he Companions and Apprentices had to contribute to the funds that were necessary for their maintenance. The qualification n ecessary to o btain Membership of this Ass ociation was the e xecution of a Master - piece, which was made as expensive as possible, {304 } in order to keep d own the number of Masters. It will be seen at once that t his is a very different organisation to the Constitution of the Assemblies of our last Chapter, and the reader m ust keep this distinction in mind, as well as the fact that there came over to this c ountry a class of men impressed with these discordant views. It would extend far beyond the scope of this book to give more than a very slight account of the numerous Abbeys, Monasteries, Churches and Castles which were e rected after the Norm an conquest; it is, however, necessary, in our inquiry after the Speculative e lement, to say something of these, and of the persons who erected them. Doctor James Anderson states that King William the Bastard employed Gundulf, bishop of Rochester, and Earl Roger de"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Montgomery in building, or extending, the Tower of London, Castles of Dover, Exeter, Winchester, Warwick, Hereford, Stafford, York, Durham, Newcas tle, also Battle Abbey, St. Saviour \u0000 s in S outhwark, and ninety other pious houses; whilst others built forty two such, and five cathedrals. Battle Abbey was in building 1067 - 90, the architect being a Norm an Monk who was a noted arrow - head maker and theref ore named William the Faber, or Smith. Between 1070 - 1130 Canterbury Cathedral was in course of erection. In 1076 Archbishop Thomas began the re - erection of the Cathedral of York, which h ad p reviously been burnt in contest with the Norm ans. Between 1079 - 93, Winchester Cathedral was in progress. The White or Square tower on the Thames is of this period and Jenn ings mentions one of the main pillars which h as a valute on one side, and a horn on the other, which h e considers to have the same significance as the two pillars of Solomon \u0000 s temple, that is s ymbolising male and female. It is evident that Masons must have now been in great demand and that whether Saxon or Norm an were sure of employment; the following are of interest, and as we meet with any particu lars, which h ave a distinct bearing upon the Masonic organisation, we will give them. {305 } The New Castle, whence the name of that town is taken, was built by a son of the Bastard, and thenceforth became, as in Roman times, a place of great strength, a nd also the chief home of the Monastic Orders, for Benedictines, Au gustinians, Carm elites, Franciscans, Hospitallers of St. John , and Nuns all built houses here, and their conventual buildings within its walls, and many an Hospitium for wayfarers, many Gui lds, and many a chapel of black, white and grey Friars were founded. The Percys had a town residence here in the narrow street called the Close. In 1074 Lincoln Cathedral was begun by Remgius Foschamp, the Norm an Bishop, who had it ready for consecrati on in 8 years. It was destroyed b y fire in 1141 , but Bishop Alexander r estored it t o more than its form er beauty. Where the Castle now stands existed an ancient fortress which the Bastard converted into a Norm an stronghold. In 1077 Robert the Cementar ius, or Mason, had a grant of lands in reward for his s kill i n restoring St. Albans; and we may find in this c ircumstance the origin of the St. Alban Charge combined with that of Charles Martel and David and Solomon; including the Norm an fiction that St. A lban h ad for his Masonic instructor St. Amphabel out of France. We say fiction because Britain at that day sent Masons to Gaul. In Yorkshire a Godifried the Master - builder witnesses the Whitby Charter of Uchtred, the son of Gospatric. These are Danish names and the Marks of Yorkshire Masons, in this and the following century, are strong in the use of letters of the Runic or Scandinavian alphabet. Baldwin, Abbot of St. Edmund \u0000 s began a church in 1066 which was consecrated in 1095 . Herm ann us the Monk , compares it in magnificence to Solomon \u0000 s temple, which is the first Masonic reference we have to that structure, and in Norm an times. Paine Peverell, a bastard son of the King, built a small round church at Cambridge which was c onsecrated in {306 } 110 1, this form being a model of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. He also began a castle in Derbyshire, on a peak inaccessible on three sides one of which overlooks the Peak Cavern, which Faber supposes was used in the Druidical Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" A round church was erected at t his period in Northampton, probably by Simon de St. Luz. An ancient sun - dial is built into its walls; the tooling of the building is Saxon chevron style, in contradistinction from the Norm an diagonal axe work. There is a curiously mysti c monument at Brent Pelham to Piers Sh onke, who died in 1086 . Weever calls it \"a stone whereon is figured a man, and about him an eagle, a lion, and a bull, having all wings, and an angell as if they would represent the four evangelists; under the feet of the man is a cross fleuree.\" We must not hastily confound these e mblems with the present quartering in the Arm s of Freemasons. During the reign of Rufus the great palace of Westminster was built, and thirty pious houses. In 1089 the King laid the fou ndation of St. Mary \u0000 s Abbey at York. In the same year the Bishop of Hereford laid the foundation of the Gothic c athedral at Gloucester, and it was c onsecrated in 1100 . In 1093 William of Karilipho, Bishop of Durham, laid the foundation of his c athedral, in the presence of Malcolm King of Scots and P rior Turgot. Surtees s ays that it \"was on a plan which h e had b rought with h im from France.\" In the same year the church of the old Culdee settlement of Lindisfarne was erected, and Edward, a monk of Durham, acted as architect. In 1093 Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, sent for Anselme, Abbot of Bec, \"by his conseile to build the Abbey of St. Werberg at Chester.\" It contains an old p ulpit of black oak which is full of heraldic c arving which h as been mistaken fo r Masonic emblems.<<Past Grand b laster Smith, U.S.A.>> It was in this Monastery {307 } that Ralph Higden compiled the Polychronicon, a history often referred to in the \"Cooke MS.\" The work of Durham Cathedral was c ontinued b y Bishop Ranulf de Flambard f rom 1104 and completed b efore the year 1129 . Under Bishop William de Carilofe the grant which Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland, had made to the See of Durham was c onfirm ed, of the Priory of Teignmouth to the Church of Jarrow, which was built by Benedict B iscop in 689 and of Wearm outh 8 years later. Also Robert de Mowbray brought monks from St. Albans to rebuild the Priory Church, which was c ompleted in 1110 . Anything conn ected with these Northern provinces is Masonically important, for Northumberland and Durham had many Operative Lodges long prior to the G.L. of 1717 , and any legitimacy which that body can h ave it owes to those Northern Lodges, which eventually joined its ranks. Northumberland is s tudded with fortified p iles or towers and fortified vic arages which must have given much employment t o Masons. Elsden possessed one of these and also two folc - mote hills, where in old time, justice was administered in the open air, as in the Vehm of Westphalia, dating back one thousand years. Oswold the go od Bishop of Salisbury built t he Church of St. Nicholas at Newcastle about the year 1004 . In 1115 Henry I. made grants to the Canons regular of Carlisle. Many parts of the Church of St. Andrew are e arlier than S t. Nicholas, but its erection is of later d ate. The Church of St. Mary, Beverley, is s upposed to have had upon its s ite, a Chapel of Ease dedicated to St. Martin by Archbishop Thurston, of York, between 1114 - 42; it is c ertain, however, that it was c onstituted a Vicarage of St. Mary in 1325 . The Nave was built about 1450 , and consists of six bays and seven clerestory windows, but in 1530 the upper part of the central tower fell"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"upon the Nave with much loss of life. Its pillar was erected b y the Guild of Minstrels, which like that of the Masons, claimed to date from Saxon times; it has upon the fluted {308 } cornishes five figures of the Minstrels with their instruments, of which only two respectively with guitar and p ipe are intact; and stands on the north side facing the pulpit. The \"Misere\" sta lls in the chancel are of the 15th century, with carved b as reliefs under the seats; one of these represents a \"fox\" shot t hrough the body with a woodman \u0000 s arrow, and a \"monkey\" approaching with a bottle of physic. In regard to symbolism Brother George Oli ver, D.D., mentions an old church at Chester, which h e does not name, containing the double e quilateral triangles; also the same in the window of Lichfield Cathedral. Mr. Goodwin states that the triple triangles interlaced may be seen in the tower of a church in S ussex. We are now approaching the period of the Crusades, and it may be noticed that Cluny and other great French Abbeys are usually considered the centres of action whence proceeded the builders that accompanied the arm ies of the cross to Pal estine. Here an enorm ous number of buildings were e rected, between 1148 - 89, in which Europeans directed native workmen, and in which the form er learned a lighter style of architecture which resulted in pointed Gothic; a style which h ad early existence in the East, for Professor T. Hayter Lewis points out that the 9th century Mosque at Tulun in Cairo has every arch pointed, every pier squared, and every capital enriched with leaf ornament; this style the returned Masons began to construct and superintend in the West. Mr. Wyatt Papworth mentions that a Bishop of Utrecht in 1199 obtained the \"Arcanum Magisterium\" in laying the foundation of a church, and that he was slain by a Master Mason whose son h ad b etrayed the secret to the Bishop. About this time wa s begun the old church at Brownsover, near Rugby; when it was restored in 1876 two skeletons were found under the north and south walls, in spaces c ut out of the solid clay, and covered over with the oakblocks of two carpenters \u0000 benches. A similar discove ry was made in Holsworthy parish church in 1885 ; {309 } in this c ase the skeleton h ad a mass of mortar over the mouth, and the stones were huddled about the corpse as if to hastily cover it over. There is no doubt that in this and many other cases the vict ims were buried alive as a sacrifice.<<\"Builders \u0000\u0001\u0007 ites and Ceremonies,\" G. W Speth, 1894 .>> They are instances in proof of a widespread and ancient belief of a living sacrifice being necessary. King Henry I., 1100 - 35, built t he palaces of Woodstock an d Oxford, and fourteen pious houses, whilst others built one hundred such, besides c astles and mansions. The Bishop of Durham confirm ed and granted p rivileges to the Hali - werk - folc who would b e Saxon artificers. In 1113 Joffred, Abbot of Croyland, laid the foundation of that Abbey; about 22 stones were laid b y Patrons, who gave money or lands. Arnold is described as \"a lay brother, of the art of Masonry a most scientific Master.\" About this time, or a little e arlier, the seven Liberal Arts and Science s are designated the \"Trivium\" and \"Quadrivium,\" and the Chronicler gives us the following illustration of the first division: -- \"During this time Odo read lessons in \"Gramm ar\" to the younger sort, Terrick Logic to the e lder students at noon; and William \"Rhetoric\" in the afternoon; whilst Gil bert preached every Sunday, in different churches, in French and Latin against t he Jews, and on h oliday evenings explained the Scriptures to the learned and clergy.\" In Essex \u0000 s Bibliotheca Topographia, 1783 (vol. iv. ) we find it stated that the builders of"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"this portion cut rudely at the west end of the south aisle, a pair of compasses, a lewis, and two circular figures, which, he supposes, are intended for sun and moon; in 1427 , however, there were repairs in progress , not of this part, but in the west and north aisles. This Abbey possessed a library of 900 b ooks, and save that Joffrid, or Gil bert, exhibited so much animosity against the Jews, is so consonant with the first part of the \"Cooke MS.\" that we might have t aken it as a proof that the Semitic Rites existed in 1113 . They probably did in France and p arts of Spain. The bronze candelabrum of {310 } Gloucester was made in 1115 , and has the double triangles and much other Masonic s ymbolism; it is of Byzantine desi gn and approximates to o ld Egyptian work and symbolism. King Stephen, 1135 - 54, employed Gil bert de Clare to build four Abbeys, two Nunn eries, and the Church of St. Stephen at Westminster, whilst others built about ninety pious houses. Jesus College at Cambridge was founded in this reign, and a very remarkable church was erected at Adel near Leeds. It is recorded of a soldier of King Stephen, named Owen or Tyndal, that he received a species of religious Initiation at the Culdee Monastery in Donegal, pla ced in a \"pastos\" of the cell; he then went on a pilgrimage to the Holy - land, and on h is return, as has been recorded of Renaud of Montauban, assisted in building the Abbey of Bosmagovsich. The Marks of Birkenh ead P riory of this date have been collected a nd p rinted b y Brother W. H. Rylands, also those of St. John \u0000 s Church in Chester, the Cathedral, Chester, and the walls, some of which are Roman work.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" 1894 .>> In 1147 Henry de Lacy laid the foundation of Kirkstall Abbey in Yorkshire; i t is of pointed Gothic. Roche Abbey was built between this date and 1186 , and these two are believed to be by the same architect. Rivaulx and Fountains Abbey were begun in 1199 and 1200 . At this time Adam, a Monk of Fountains Abbey, and p reviously of Wh itby, was c elebrated for his knowledge of Gothic architecture, and officiated at the building of the Abbeys of Meux, Woburn, and Kirkstede; it is not said whether he was lay or cleric. York Cathedral was again destroyed b y fire in 1137 , and Archbishop Rog er began to re - erect it in 1154 . In Norm andy the Guilds were travelling about like those of England and were of importance in 1145 , and had a Guild union when they went to Chartres. At this time Huges, Archbishop of Rouen, wrote to Theodric of Amiens i nform ing him that numerous organised companies {311 } of Masons resorted thither under the headship of a Chief designated P rince, and that the same companies on their r eturn are reported b y Haimon, Abbe of St. Pierre sur Dive, to have restored a great numbe r of churches in Rouen. The Priory of St. Mary in Furness was c omm enced b y Benedictines from Savigney. In 1179 the Priory of Lann ercost was founded b y Robert de Vallibus, Baron of Gill esland. Bishop Hugh de Pudsey rebuilt t he Norm an Castle of Durham, dating from 1092 to 1174 . Between 1153 - 94 this Prelate was the great Transitional Builder of the north, and he began the e rection of a new church at Darlington in 1180 on the site of an old Saxon one. The great Hall of the Castle of Durham was the work o f Bishop Hadfield in the reign of Richard III. on an older Norm an one. Henry II. between 1154 - 89 b uilt ten pious houses, whilst others built one hundred such. It is the e ra of the advent of the \"transitional G othic.\" In the first year of this King \u0000 s r eign, 1155 , the \"Poor Fellow Soldiers of Jesus Christ, and of the Temple of Solomon,\" began to build their Temple in Fleet Street, London, and continued at work till 1190 . It is a round church in pointed"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Gothic to which a rectangular one was added later. By Papal Bull of 1162 these Knights were declared free of all tithes and imposts in respect of their movables and imm ovables, and their serving brethren h ad like favours, indulgences, and Apostolic blessings. James of Vitry says that they had a very spac ious house in Jerusalem, which was known as the Temple of Solomon to distinguish the Temple of the Chivalry from the Temple of the Lord. In the Rule which Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux, drew up for them, he speaks of the poverty of the Knights, and says of their house that it could not rival the \"world renowned temple of Solomon\"; in chapter xxx ., he again speaks of the poverty of the house of God, and of the temple of Solomon.\" As a fraternity he designates them \"valiant Maccabees.\" Sir John Maundeville v isited the house, and {312 } speaks of it in 1356 thus: \"Near the temple [of Christ] on the south is the Temple of Solomon, which is v ery fair and well polished, and in that temple dwell the Knights of the Temple, called Templars, and that was the foundatio n of their order, so that Knights dwelt there, and Canons Regular in the temple of our Lord.\" As Masonic s ymbolism is found in their Preceptories, this would b e a chann el from which to deduce both our Solomonic legends, and the alleged Papal bulls, which Sir William Dugdale asserted were granted to travelling Freemasons; but this v iew has never m et with favour from Masonic historians, who aim chiefly at writing things agreeable to their patrons and rulers. Brother Oli ver states that t he high altar has the double triangles, at any rate these appear on the modern embroidered cover; there is the anchor of the Virgin, also the Beauseant of black and white, which Vitry interprets that they are fair to their friends but black to their enemies, but Jenn ings s ays: \"This grandly mystic bann er is Gnostic, and refers to the mystic Egyptian apothegm that light proceeded from darkness.\" He further m entions these symbols in the spandrels of the arches of the long church -- the Beauseant; paschal lamb on a red cross; the lamb with the red cross s tandard triple cloven; a prolonged cross issuing out of a crescent moon, having a star on each side. The arches abound with stars, from which issue wavy or crooked flames; the winged horse, white, on a red field, is one of their badges. He adds that there is a wealth of meaning in every curve of the tombs, which appear in the circular portion. Ireland has many works erected d uring this period, and Mr. Street says of them: \"I find in these buildings the most unmistakable traces of their having been erected b y the same men, who were e ngaged at the same time, in England and Wales.\" The same remark will apply to Scotland. The ancient Preceptory of the Temple at Paris c ontained (says \"Atlanta\" xi. p. 337 ) \"24 columns of silver { 313 } w hich supported the audience chamber of the Grand Master, and the Chapel hall paved in Mosaic and enriched b y woodwork of cedar of Lebanon, contained sixty huge vauses of gold.\" The fortress was partially destroyed in 1779 . Batissier in h is Elemen ts of Archaeology (Paris, 1843 ), says that the name \"Magister de Lapidibus v ivis\" was given in the middle ages to the Chief artist of a confraternity -- Master of living stones. Or the person was s imply term ed \"Magister Lapidum,\" and he refers on both the se points to some statutes of the Corporation of Sculptors quoted b y Father de la Valle. For the origin of the first of these term s c onsult the Apocryphal books of Herm as, but the term has more in it than appears on the surface, for in Guild ceremonial th e candidate had to undergo the same treatment as the stone, wrought from the rough to the perfect. Amateurs were received, for the 1260 \"Charte Octroyie\" is quoted b y"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"the Bishop of Bale thus: \"The same conditions apply to those who do not belong the \"Meti er,\" and who desire to enter the Fraternity.\" A Priory of the Clunic order of Monks was founded in 1161 at Dudley by Gervase Pagnel, and they had others at Lewes, Castleacre, and Berm ondsey. A fire having occurred at Canterbury, Gervasius, a Benedict ine Monk, in 1174 , consulted \"French and English Artificers,\" who disagreed in regard to the repair of the structure. The account which Gervaise gives is highly interesting and instructing. The work was given to William of Sens, \"a man active, ready, and skillfull both in \u0000 wood and stone. \u0000 \" \" He delivered models for shaping the stones, to the sculptors\"; he reconstructed the choir and made two rows, of five pillars on each side; but in the fifth year he was s o injured b y the fall of his scaffold that he h ad to appoint as deputy a young Monk \"as Overseer of the Masons.\" When h e found it necessary to return to France the Masons were left to the oversight of William the Englishman, a man \"small i n body, but in workmanship of many kinds acute and {314 } honest .\" The Nave was c ompleted in 1180 , and Gervaise inform s us that in the old structure e verything was plain and wrought \" with an axe,\" but in the new exquisitely \"sculptured with a chisel.\" We gather two points of inform ation from this account of 1160 ; f irst we have the inform ation that William of Sens issued \"Models\" to the workmen, which explains a law of the Masonic MSS . that no Master should give \"mould\" or rule to o ne not a member of the Society; we see, in the second p lace, that the chisel was s uper seding the axe. We will also mention h ere that t here is Charter evidence of this c entury, that Christian the Mason, and Lambert the Marble Mason h ad lands from the Bishop of Durham for services rendered. The fall of Jerusalem in 1187 b rought back from th e East many artisans to the West, whose influence is traceable in the e arly pointed style, or as it is term ed the \"Lancet,\" or \"Early English.\" A noteworthy movement, which extended to o ther countries had p lace in France at this period. A shepherd of t he name of Benezet conceived the idea of building a bridge over the Rhone at Avignon; the bishop supported his sc heme and superintended its erection between 1171 - 88. Upon Benezet \u0000 s death, in 1184 , Pope Clement III. canonised him, and sanctioned a new Frat ernity of Freres Pontives -- bridge builders. In 1189 , Fitz Alwine, Mayor of London, held his first assize, from which we learn that the Master Carpenters and Masons of the City were to be sworn n ot to prejudice the ancient rights ordained of the e state s of the City. Between 1189 - 1204 Bishop Lacey was engaged in adding to Winchester Cathedral. There are references worthy of note in S cotland at this time. In 1190 Bishop Jocelyne obtained a Charter from William the Lion to establish a \"Fraternity\" t o assist in raising funds wherewith to erect t he Cathedral of Glasgow; it is supposed to imply the e xistence of a band of travelling Masons. The same bishop undertook the e rection of the Abbey of Kilwinn ing. The Templar {315 } Preceptory of Redd - Abbey Ste ad was erected at the same time, and an ancient Lodge of Masons existed here last century. In the reign of John , 1200 - 16, about forty pious houses were e rected. Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, about 1200 , wrought with h is own h ands at the choir and transept of the Cathedral, the designs being by Gaufrids de Noires, \"constructor ecclesiae.\" The Masons \u0000 Marks are numerous; and it is asserted"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"by Brother Emr a Holmes that, from the central tower, may be seen three large figures of a monk, a nun, and an angel, each displaying one of the signs of the three degrees of Masonry. The Cathedral has also an ancient stained glass window, which h as the double triangles in four out of six spaces, an engraving of which appears in the \"Historical Landmarks\" of Brother George Ol iver. Brother Fort asserts that the Masons of the middle ages must have received their techn ical education from the Priories, and that a tendency continually reveals itself to use the abstruse problems of Geometry as the basis of philosophical speculation s, thus blending the visible theorems with unseen operations of the spirit. He considers that t he building operations of the Masons were canvassed in the Lodge and worked out mathematically, the plan of the building serving as the basis of instruction. T hese views mean in two words that Masonry in all times was Operative and Speculative, but t he identical system prevails to - day in some still existing Stone Masons \u0000 Guilds. In 1202 Godfrey de Lucy, Bishop of Winchester, form ed a \"Fraternity\" for repairin g his c hurch during the five years ensuing. There is nothing to disclose the nature of these Fraternities; it may mean n o more than a comm ittee for collecting the means, possibly the Masters \u0000 Fraternities of the French may have given the idea. At this pe riod Gil bert de Eversolde was labouring at St. Albans \u0000 Abbey, as the architect, and Hugh de Goldcliffe is c alled a deceitful workman. In 1204 the Abbey of Beaulieu in Hants was founded b y King John , and {316 } Durandus, a Master employed on the Cathedral o f Rouen, came over to it by request. In 1209 London Bridge, which was begun by Peter de Colchurch, was completed. There is a slab, of this period, in the transept of Marton Church, W.R. Yorkshire, which h as upon it a Calvary cross, a cross - hilted sword, and a Mason \u0000 s s quare and level, pointing to the union of arm s, religion, and art. In 1212 a. second Assize was held in London by Mayor Fitz Alwyne, when owing to a great fire it was thought necessary to fix the wages. At this time a horse or cow could be bought for four shillings. Masons were granted 3d . per day with food, or 4 1 /2d. without; Labourers had 1 1 /2d. or 3d.; cutters of free - stone 2 1 /2d. or 4d.; the term s used are \"Cementarii,\" and \"Sculptores lapidam Liberorum.\" John died in 1216 , and M atthew of Paris, and others, write his epitaph: \"Who mourns, or shall ever m ourn, the death of King John \"; \"Hell, with all its pollutions, is polluted b y the soul of John .\" (i. 288 ) In the reign of Henry III., 1216 - 72, thirty - two pious houses were e rec ted, and the Templars built t heir Domus Dei at Dover. The beginn ing of this King \u0000 s reign is the period when Laymen, emancipating themselves from the Monasteries, come to the front as builders, and leaders of working Masons. It is also the comm encement of a more highly finished style of pointed Gothic introduced b y the Masons who returned from Palestine. During this reign flourished the celebrated Friar Roger Bacon, who, as member of a sworn fraternity, gave himself to the investigation of the hidden thin gs of nature and science. In the reign of Henry III. the Monks of Teignmouth raised a masterpiece of architecture in their new conventual church, which they completed b y 1220 , and were e ngaged in constant contention with the claims to jurisdiction of th e Bishops of Durham; and then followed d isputes with the burgesses of Newcastle, owing to the Monks fostering the trade of North Sh ields. The Prior \u0000 s officers were in the habit of meeting those of the comm on {317 } law on the hill"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"of Gateshead, or beneath a spreading oak in Northumberland, when they came to hold assizes in Newcastle. In 1220 the foundation of Salisbury Cathedral was laid b y Bishop P oore; Robert was Master Mason, and Helias de Berham, one of the Canons, employed himself on the structure. Its base is the Patriarchal cross, its erection occupied 38 years, and it is the only Gothic c athedral in England b uilt in one style of architecture. The five - pointed star is found in the tracery of the arcades, and heads of 32 windows, and the e quilater al triangle is the basic design of the parapet. In 1220 P eter, Bishop of Winchester, levelled the footstone of Solomon \u0000 s porch in Westminster Abbey. He is the same person as Peter de Rupibus, a native of Poictiers, who served with Coeur de Lion in Palest ine, and was knighted b y him, created Bishop of Winchester in 1204 , Chief Justice in 1214 , went on a Pilgrimage to Palestine and returned in 1231 . Amongst his architectural labours is a Dominican convent in Winchester; the Abbey of Pitchfield; part of Net ley Abbey; a pious house at Joppa; and the Domus Dei in Portsmouth. He died in 1238 , and his effigy, which is a recumbent figure in Winchester Cathedral, has the right hand on the left breast, and his left hand clasping a book.<<Ars Quat. Cor.>> From 1 233 - 57 the \"Close Rolls\" give numerous details of the King \u0000 s Masons who were e mployed at Guildford, Woodstock, and Westminster. In 1253 the King had consultations with Masons, \"Franci et Angli.\" It is also the period of origin of the \"Geometrical\" style. There is a document of 1258 which, though French, has an important bearing on English Masonic legends, referring amongst other things to Charles Martel, and which, though traditional, was accepted as s ufficient t o secure important freedoms. In this ye ar Stephen Boileau, Provost of the Corporation of Paris, compiled a code of \"Regulations c oncerning the arts and trades of Paris, {318 } based upon the Statements of the Masters of Guilds,\" and amongst these we find the following in regard to the Masons, wh ich gives them a double title to the term \"Free,\" for they were free - stone cutters and free of certain duties: xxi. The Masons (\"Macons\") and p lasterers are obliged to do guard duty, and p ay taxes, and render such other services as the other citizens of P aris owe to their King. xxii. The Mortar - Makers are free of guard d uty, as also every stone - cutter since the time of Charles Martel, as the ancients (\"Prudolmes\" or wise men) have heard, from father to son.\" The question arises here whether Masons and se tters, who, were not free of duty, though cutters and sculptors were, use the term Carolus Secundus in England as a claim for the Masons and Setters. The Prudomes were the Wardens under the \"Master who rules the Craft,\" and we are further told that this M aster had taken h is oath of service at the Palace, and afterwards before the Provost of Paris. It is also said that, after six years \u0000 service the Apprentice appeared b efore \"the Master who keeps the Craft,\" in order to swear \"by the Saints,\" to conform to Craft usage. He thus became a Journeyman, or Companion, but could not become a Master, and undertake the e ntire e rection of a building, until he had completed such a \"Master - Piece\" as was appointed him, and which entailed much outlay; but if this was Pas sed he became a member of the \"Masters \u0000 Fraternity.\" The difference between the Saxon and the French custom appears to be this: that whilst in the form er case the acceptance of a Master rested with the same Assembly as that to which the Journeyman belonge d, in the latter case the Masters \u0000 Fraternity was now a separate body, with independent laws."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The custom of Montpelier, according to documents printed b y Brother R. F. Gould, would seem to have developed somewhat differently. Here, after an Apprentice ha d served three years, he was placed for another four years to serve as a Journeyman, under a Master. At the e nd of this period he might present his Master - piece, and if it was approved he took the oath to {319 } the Provosts and only such sworn Master was perm itted to erect a building from the basement; but it was allowable for a Journeyman to undertake small repairs. Thus as c ity customs v aried confusion must at times have arisen in journeying abroad. There is mention in 1287 , when the Cathedral of Upsal a in Sweden was begun, that Etienn e de Bonn euill took with h im from Paris \"ten Master Masons and ten Apprentices\"; possibly some of the Masters or some of the Apprentices, were what we call Fellows, but there is nothing to warrant any classification. It i s important to shew the secret nature and the import of the French organisation, and Fraternities, and we quote the following from Brother J. G. Findel \u0000 s \"History of Freemasonry\": -- \"The \"Fraternities\" existing as early as the year 1189 were prohibited b y the Council of Rouen (\"cap.\" 25); and the same was most clearly expressed at the Council of Avignon in the year 1326 , where (\"cap.\" 37) it is s aid that the members of the Fraternity met ann ually, bound themselves by oath mutually to love and assist each o ther, wore a costume, had certain well known and characteristic s igns and countersigns, and chose a president (\"Majorem\") whom they promised to o bey.\" Nothing very vile in this. In 1242 P rior Melsonby made additions to Durham Cathedral, and others were made by Bishop Farnh am before 1247 , and b y Prior Hoghton about 1290 . At Newcastle the church of All Saints was founded b efore 1296 , and that of St. John in the same century. The church of St. Nicholas was rebuilt in the 14th century, but the present tow er only dates from the time of Henry VI. Clavel says that the seal of Erwin de Steinbach, Chief Master of Cologne, 1275 , bears the square and compasses with the letter G. Turning to the North of England we find that at York in 1171 , 1127 , 1241 , and 129 1, the choir, south transept, and nave of the Minster were e ither completed or in course of erection, and the workmanship is infinitely superior to later portions of the building. In 1270 the new church of {320 } the Abbey of St. Mary in York was begun by the Abbot Simon de Warwick, who was s eated in a chair with a trowel in h is hand and the whole convent standing around him. There is also a Deed of 1277 with the seal of Walter Dixi, Cementarius, de Bernewelle, which conveys lands to his s on Lawrence; the legend is \"S. Walter le Masun,\" surrounding a hamm er between a half - moon and a five - pointed star. In this s ame year, 1277 , Pope Nicholas II. is c redited with letters patent to the Masons c onfirm ing the freedoms and p rivileges, said to have been granted b y Boniface IV. in 614 ; if such a Bull was issued, it has escaped discovery in recent times. In these somewhat dry building details it will have been n oticed that references are made to French designers, and to consultation with French and English Masons, and with this enorm ous amount of building there must necessarily have been a constant importation of French Masons, with the introduction of French customs. On the symbolism of this period there are some interesting particulars in the \"Rationale\" of Bi shop Durandus, who died in 1296 . The \"tiles\" signify the protectors of the church; the \"winding - staircase\" \" imitated from Solomon \u0000 s"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"temple\" t he hidden knowledge; the \"stones\" are the faithful, those at t he corners being most holy; the \"cement\" is c harity; the \"squared stones\" holy and pure have unequal burdens to bear; the \"foundation\" is faith; the \"roof\" charity; the \"door\" obedience; the \"pavement\" humility; the four \"side walls\" justice, fortitude, temperance, prudence; hence the Apocalypse saith \"the city lieth four square.\"<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" x, p. 60.>> The custom is Hindu, French, British. In a paper r ecently read b efore one of the learned Societies Professor T. Hayter Lewis has s hewn that the builders of the e arly \"Pointed Gothic \"of the 13th c entury were of a different school to those who preceded them in the 12th century; he shews that t he Masons \u0000 marks, the style, and the methods of tooling the stones, differ from the older work, and whilst the older was wrought with diagonal tooling, the lat er was upright {321 } w ith a claw adze. He traces these changes in methods and marks through Palestine to Phoenicia. This new style, he considers, was brought into this c ountry by Masons who had learned it amongst t he Saracens, and though Masons \u0000 marks we re in use in this country long before they were now further developed on the Eastern system.<<\"Ibid,\" iii, also v, p. 296 >> There is as well tangible e vidence of the presence of Oriental Masons in this c ountry; two wooden effigies, said to be of the time of the Crusades, were form erly in the Manor house of Wooburn in Buckinghamshire, of which drawings were shewn to the Society of Antiquaries in 1814 , and have recently been engraved in \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum.\"<<\"Ibid,\" viii. 1895 .>> These e ffigies are li fe size, one represents an old man with quadrant and staff, the other a young man with square and compasses, and \"the attire, headdress, and even features, indicate Asiatic originals.\" It has been thought t hat t he Moorish Alhambra a t Grenada indicates the presence of Persian Masons, and we find the translator of Tasso \u0000 s \"Jerusalem Delivered\" in every case substitutes the word Macon for Mohamm ed, but this is only a provincial abbreviation for Maometto. Though supported in a superior m ann er, the theory of Professor Hayter Lewis is not new to Freemasonry, as in the 17th century Sir Wm. Dugdale, Sir Chris. Wren, and others fix upon the reign of King Henry III. as the period when the Society of Freemasons was introduced into England b y Travelling Masons, prot ected b y Papal Bulls, and Wren is s aid to have added his belief that pointed Gothic was of Saracenic origin, and that the bands resided in Huts near the erection upon which they were working, and had a Warden over every ten men. But Elias Ashmole held tha t whilst such a reorganisation actually took p lace, it was upon a Roman foundation. Dugdale probably derived his v iews from some monastic document, or tradition, whilst Ashmole as a Mason, with better inform ation followed the old MS. Constitutions, as we {322 } have done in these chapters. Brother Gould is of opinion that the alleged Bulls were given to the Benedictines and other m onkish fraternities who were builders, and that they only apply to Masons as members, or lay brothers of the Monasteries; and, we may add, Templars. It must be clear to all who have e yes to see, that with this importation into England of the foreign element a new series of legends were e ngrafted upon.the original simple account of the old English Masons. Such are the Charges o f Nimr od, of David and Solomon, and of Charles Martel, and though we have no MSS . of this period to confirm us, there is no doubt that they are of this period; equally we have no contemporary text of the Charges by which the newly imported Masons were rule d. The inform ation already g iven enables us to see"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"that there was a difference both in legends and laws between the two elements and that it was a sectarian difference. English MSS ., of more modern date, refer to \"Books of Charges,\" where those of Nimr od, of Solomon, of St. Alban, and of Athelstan are included, and if they actually existed, as we see no reason to doubt, they were of this c entury. Moreover the references to Carolus Secundus, or to Charles Martel, must be of this period (though there can be no doubt that this refers to Carolus Magnus or Charlemagne) as s mall i mportations of French Masons in S axon times would not have influenced the older legends, nor stood a chance of adoption by the English. In regard to the laws by which the French Mas ons were governed, we are, however, inform ed in the more modem MSS . that they differed b ut little, or \"were found all one\" with the Roman, British, and Saxon Charges. It is v ery evident that the e arly foreign element had a Charge of their own referring to Nimr od, David, Solomon, and Charles of France, applicable to their own ceremonies, and that in England, they united therewith the \"Charges\" of Euclid, St. Alban, and Athelstan in a heterogeneous mann er; and these are found in two, or m ore, MSS . to which w e refer {323 } later, as having been approved b y King Henry VI., and afterwards made the general law. There is one piece of evidence which might enable us to settle certain difficult points if we could rely upon it. Professor Marks, a learned Jew, has s tated that he saw in one of the public libraries of this c ountry a Comm entary upon the Koran of the 14th century, written in the Arabic language, with Hebrew characters, referring according to his v iew, to Free Masonry, and which contained an anagramm atica l sentence of which each line has one of the letters M. O. C. H., and which h e reads: \"We have found our Lord Hiram\" (Chiram); but the Dervish S ects have a similar phrase, which would read: \"We have found in our Lord rest\" (Kerim, or Cherim). We must ther efore hold our m inds in reserve until the book has been re - found and examined. In any case it seems to add a link to the chain of evidence as to the Oriental origin of \"our present Rites.\" We may feel assured that the Masons who returned from the Holy - la nd were of a class c alculated to make a marked impression on the Society. The word to which the foregoing alludes, in modern Arabic, might be translated \"Child of the Strong one.\" Several modern writers, both Masons and non - Masons, hold to the opinion th at t here were two Artists at t he building of Solomon \u0000 s temple: Huram the Abiv, who began the work, and Hiram the son, who completed what his father had to leave undone. Succoth, where the brass ornaments for the Temple were cast, signifies Booths or Lodge s, and Isaradatha means s orrow or trouble.<<Vide \"Light from the Lebanon Lodge.\" Joel Nash.>> Josephus s ays that Hiram was s on of a woman of the tribe of Napthali, and that his father was Ur of the Israelites. The account that we have of him, in the Bib le, is that he was expert in dyeing, and in working in gold, and in brass; which makes him a chemist and metallurgist, rather than a Mason. There were many Arts in which the ancients were our superiors. A very important {324 } lecture on this point has re cently appeared from the pen of the Rev. Bro. M. Rosenbaum. After this long digression we will return to architecture in general. Mr. Wyatt Papworth points out t he use of the term Ingeniator, in various documents, between 1160 - 1300 referring to castles repaired or constructed. Some of these were undoubtedly Architects and not Engineers, whose duties were the construction of warlike machines; and though gunpowder had not yet come"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"into use in this c ountry, the conn ection with Masoning might, at a later p eriod, lead to the introduction of Marcus Graecus into o ur MSS . In the reign of Edward I., 1272 - 1307 , Merton College in Oxford, the cathedral of Norwich and twenty pious houses were founded; the noble Gothic s tyle had reached its c limax. Between 1291 - 4 several crosses were e rected; and there are mentions of Masons who were e mployed b y the King, some items of expense refer to timber, \"to make a Lodge for Master Michael and his Masons.\" Peter de Cavalini designed the \"Eleanor Crosses;\" the one in Cheapsi de was begun by Richard d e Crumble, and completed b y Roger de Crumble; it was of three stories, decorated with Niches having Statues executed b y Alexander le Imaginator. A still more beautiful one was the Charing Cross. From 1290 - 1300 West Kirkby Church was building, and the Marks are recorded b y Brother Rylands, as well as those of Eastham, and Sefton Churches.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" vii.>> In 1300 Henry the Monk, surnamed Lathom, Latomus, -- Mason or Stone - cutter, rebuilt part of the Abbey of Evesham. In 1 303 the Mayor and 24 Alderm en of London, made ordinances for the regulation of the Carpenters, Masons and labourers; the Mayor was Gregory de Rokeslie, and the Mazounes Mestres, or Master Masons, and Master Carpenters are mentioned, in conjunction with the ir servants. From 1308 - 26 William Boyden was employed in erecting The Chapel of the Virgin at the Abbey of St. Albans. {325 } In the reign of Edward II., 1307 - 27, Exeter and Oriel Colleges in Oxford, Clare Hall in Cambridge, and eight pious houses were built. During this King \u0000 s reign we have the advent of the \"Curvilinear,\" or \"Decorated\" style, which h eld its ground for near a century. In 1313 the Knights Templars were suppressed with great brutality in France; in England their property was c onfiscate d to the Knights of St. John , their leading Preceptories being at London, Warwick, Walsden, Lincoln, Lindsey, Bollingbroke, Widine, Agerstone, York, Temple - Sowerby, Cambridge, etc.; they were distributed throughout the Monasteries, or joined the Knights of St. John ; those of York had lenient t reatment by Archbishop Greenfield, and were relegated to St. Mary \u0000 s adjacent to the Culdee hospital of St. Leonard. Their Lay brethren, amongst whom would b e a numerous body of Masons, were liberated; a circumstance f rom which might spring more than a traditional conn ection. Some of the Knights returned to Lay occupations, and even married to the great ann oyance of the Pope. In Scotland the Knights, aided in their aims by the wars between that country and England, re tained their Preceptories and though they seem to have united with the Order of St. John in 1465 they were as often distinguished b y one name as the other. The Burg - laws of Stirling have the following in 1405 , -- \"Na Templar sall i ntromet with any merchan dise or gudes pertaining to the gilde, be buying and selling, within or without t heir awn lands, but giff he be ane gilde brother.\"<<\"Freem. Mag.\" xvi, p. 31.>> Thus implying that t he Knights had actual membership with the Guilds. The Templars, at the li ke date (1460 ) are mentioned in Hungary.<<Malczovich -- \"Ars Quat, Cor.\" Yarker. Also 1904 , p. 240 .>> In Portugal their inn ocence of the charges brought against them was accepted, but to please the Pope their name was c hanged to Knights of Christ. In an old Hungarian town, where the Templars once were, the Arm s are a wheel on which is the Baptist \u0000 s head on a charger. {326 } "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" A bishop of Durham, circa 1295 - 1300 named Beke had required more than the accustomed military service from the tenants of St. Cu thbert, who pleaded the privileges of \"Haly - werk folc, not to march beyond the Tees or Tyne,\" and Surtees explains that \"Halywerk folc or holywork p eople, whose business, to wit, was to defend the holy body of St. Cuthbert, in lieu of all other service\"<<\" Hist. Durham, Genl.\" xxx iii.>>, are here alluded to, but of Culdee original the term implied an art origin. Sir James Dalrymple, speaking of Scotland, says, -- \"The Culdees c ontinued till the beginn ing of the 14th century, up to which time they contended for their ancient rights, not only in opposition to the whole power of the primacy, but the additional support of papal authority.\" Noted Lodges exist from old times at Culdee seats, such as Kilwinn ing, Melrose, Aberdeen, and as the period when this was s hewn was that of the suppression of the Templars, and the Scotch generally never allowed themselves to be Pope - ridden, we have one reason why the name of Templar was c ontinued in that country. There was everywhere a growing discontent against the Church o f Rome secretly indicated, even in the art of the Masonic Sodalities. Isaac Disraeli alludes to it in h is \"Curiosities of Literature.\" In h is Chapter entitled, \"Expression of Suppressed Opinion,\" he states that sculptors, and illuminators, shared these o pinions, which the multitude dare not express, but which the designers embodied in their work. Wolfius, in 1300 mentions, as in the Abbey of Fulda, the picture of a wolf in a Monk \u0000 s c owl preaching to a flock of sheep, and the legend, \"God is my witness, h ow I long for you all in my bowels.\" A cushion was found in an old Abbey, on which was embroidered a fox preaching to a flock of geese, each with a rosary in its mouth. On the stone work and columns of the great church at Argentine, as old as 1300 , were sculptured wolves, bears, f oxes, and other animals c arrying holy - water, crucifixes, and tapers, and other things more indelicate. In a magnificent {327 } illuminated Chronicle of Froissart is inscribed several similar subjects, -- a wolf in a Monk \u0000 s c owl s tretching out its paw to bless a cock; a fox dropping beads which a cock is picking up. In other cases a Pope (we hope Clement V.) is being thrust by devils into a cauldron, and Cardinals are roasting on spits. He adds that, at a later period, the Reform ation produced numerous pictures of the same class in which each party satirised the other. Over the e ntrance to the Church of St. Genevieve, says James Grant in \"Captain of the Guard\" (ch. xxx iii.), at Bomm el is the sculpture of mitred cat preaching to twelve little mice. There is a somewhat indecent carving at Stratford upon Avon. The Incorporated Society of Science, Letters, and Art, in its Journal of January, 1902 , contains a paper by Mr. T. Tindall Wildbridge upon the ideographic ornamentation of Gothic buildings. He observes that there were Masons who possessed the tradition of ancient symbolic form ula, and that whilst the Olympic Mythology is almost ignored, the \"Subject being (by them) derived from the Zodiacal system,\" and it is, he observes, that t his symbolisation, often satirical, holds place on equal term s with the acknowledged church emblems. He instances s ome of these at Oxford and elsewhere, one of which is the symbol of Horus in h is s hell, and in a second instance reproduced as a \"fox\" with a bottle of holy water. The altar of the Church of Doberan in Mecklenburg exhibits the priests grinding dogmas out of a mill. In 1322 Alan de Walsingham r estored Ely, himself plann ing and working at the building.

Of this period there is a stone - coffin lid at Thornton Abbey in Lincolnshire, which {328 } has upon it a shafted floriated Greek cross, and b esides the shaft a square -- r eligion and art united; a similar one occurs at Blidworth in Northamptonshire having upon it a square and axe. At Halsall in Lancashire is a three - step cross on one side of which is a square, and on the other an ordinary set - square. There is also in Linc oln Cathedral a gravestone of this century representing Ricardus de Gaynisburg, Cementarius, or Mason, on each side of whom is a trowel, and a square. Chartres Cathedral in France has a window containing the working tools of masons. Mr. Wyatt Papworth ob serves that at the e nd of the 13th century, and b eginn ing of the 14th, there is mention of the \"Magister Cementarii\" and his Socii, or Fellows. There is documentary evidence of the term Freemason in 1376 , and it may have been in use at an earlier date. B rother F. F. Schn itger argues, on the e vidence of a Nuremberg work of 1558 , that t he prefix indicates a free art, as sc ulpture, which the ancients s ay that handicraft is not, but t hat t he form er is, \"the use of the square and compasses artistically.\"<<Vide \"Ars Quat.

Speth advocated, with a little hesitancy, that as the travelling Masons moved about they adopted the term \"Free\" to indicate that they were outside, or free \"from,\" any Guild b ut t hat established under their o wn \"Constitution.\" It does not, necessarily follow, however, that the term \"Free\" had everywhere the same import.<<\"Ibid\" vii.>> \"Scotland\" has many important documents. The Chevalier Ramsay, in h is Paris Oration of 1737 , states that James, Lord Stewa rd of Scotland, in 1286 held a Lodge at Kilwinn ing and initiated the Earls of Gloucester and Ulster into Freemasonry. What authority there is for this s tatement no o ne now knows, but Tytler in h is History of Scotland shows that these two Earls were presen t at a meeting of the adherents of Robert Bruce at Turnbury Castle, which is about 30 miles west of Kilwinn ing Abbey, and were concerting plans for the vindication of his c laims to the Scottish throne. {329 } The rebuilding of Melrose Abbey in S cotland w as begun in 1326 under King Robert the Bruce, who seems to have been a protector of the Templars. There is a legend in regard to a window w hich is s aid to have been wrought by an Apprentice who was s lain by his Master out of jealousy, and the same myth ap plies to similar work in other countries. The structure is full of recondite symbolism both within and without; the Chapel is interpreted to represent the human body in all i ts parts; in S ymbols there is a pelican feeding its young, and the phoenix rising from its ashes. It contains a later inscription on the lintel of the turret stairs, as follows, and there are others of like import: -- \"Sa gays ye compass royn aboute, Truith and laute do but doute, Behold to ye hende q.

The older of the two inscriptions refers to a John Moray who died 1476 , a Mason but also Keeper of Newark Castle in 1467 ; and whose son Patrick had the same status until 1490 . The e pitaph of th e second of the name is thus read: -- <<\"lbid\" v, p. 227 ; also ix, p. 172 >> \"John Morow sum tym callit - gu Melros and P aslay of was I and b orn in Parysse Nyddysdayll and of Galway, certainly an h ad in kepyng Pray to God, and Mari baith. a ll Mason work of Sant An - And sweet Sant Tohn to keep this droys ye hye Kyrk, of Glas - haly kirk fra Skailh.\" This John Moray had grants of lands from James IV. in 1490 and 1497 , was Sh eriff of Selkirk 1501 , and assassinated on h is way to the Sh eriff \u0000 s Court in 1510 . In the reign of Edward III., 1327 - 77, we are told b y Anderson that Lodges were many and frequent, and that great men were Masons, the King patronising the arts {330 } and sciences. He says that it is implicitly implied, in an o ld record, \"that in the glorious reign of King Edward III., when Lodges were many and frequent, the Grand Master with h is Wardens, at the head of Grand Lodge, with consent of the Lords of the Realm, then generally Free - masons, ordained -- That for the futu re, at the making or admission of a brother, the Constitutions s hall be read and the Charges hereunto ann exed.\" Such specific statement is not at present known and is doubtless a paraphrase of the existing MSS . The King founded the Abbey of Eastminster, and others built many stately mansions and about t hirty pious houses, in spite of all the expensive wars of this reign. The south transept of Gloucester Cathedral was begun about the year 1330 , and is traditionally said to be by \"John Goure, who built C amden Church and Gloster Towre.\" He is believed to be represented in a monument, of which an engraving appears in \"Ars Quatuor\" (vol. ii.); it is in form of a Mason \u0000 s s quare, and the builder is represented as if supporting it; his arm is in the position o f hailing his Fellows; below the man \u0000 s effigy is a budget of tools. Until a recent restoration of the ancient Church of the Dominicans in Limerick, there was, on the gable e nd, the half length figure of a person in Monkish dress; the right hand was c lutch ing the heart, and the left arm , kept close to the side, was raised with the palm outward, index and second finger r aised.<<\"The Kneph.\" C.

These laws are, however, rather directed agains t Journeymen, Apprentices, and labourers, and, in any case, from their r epetition at long intervals, had little e ffect upon the Masonic Assemblies. A much more important bearing upon the Masonic organisation is a record of 1356 . At t his period there wa s a dispute in existence between the \"Layer Masons or Setters,\" and the \"Mason squarers.\" Six members of each class appeared b efore the Mayor, Sh eriff, and Alderm en of the city of London, to have their organisation defined in order that the disputes, whic h h ad arisen between them m ight be adjusted, \"because that their trades had not been regulated b y the folks of their trade in such form as other trades are.\" That is, they had not yet been so regulated in the city of London. Amongst these representatives of the Mason squarers was Henry Yeveley; the \"Free - masons\" as opposed to the \"Layer Masons,\" who were perhaps derived from the ancient body of the Kingdom, who would suffer in status by French importations, and would p refer, elsewhere, the Saxon Constitut ion. The Mayor, after consultation with these two sections, drew up a code of ten rules, which appears in full i n \"Gould \u0000 s History of Freemasonry,\" and which virtually allowed the two bodies identical privileges, {332 } and rules, mutually with a seven yea rs Apprenticeship. In either case a Master, taking any work in gross, was to bring 6 or 4 \"sworn\" men of the \"Ancients\" of his trade, to prove his ability and to act as his s ureties; and they were to be ruled b y sworn Overseers. Twelve Masters were sworn , which virtually united b oth bodies, and made a uniform r ule for both, thus establishing the London Company of Masons. Such a union of the Christian Masonry of York and the Semitic Masonry of the Norm ans, coupled with the grant of Royal Charters to the M asters, might lead to the recognition of the Rites of the Harodim - Rosy Cross as the unification of the two, which it actually is. It is quite probable that this judicious action of the Mayor saved London a repetition of the disturbances which occurred in France amongst the sects of the Compagnonage. In the middle of the 14th century Ranulf Higden h ad compiled his \"Polychronicon\" in the Benedictine Monastery of St. Werberg, Chester, which is here noted as it constituted the authority for all the Masonic Charges as to Jabal, Jubal, Tubal, and Naamah; Nimr od and his c ousin Ashur, the two pillars of Enoch, the origin of Geometry, etc., and which introduced into the Saxon Charge by the author of the \"Cooke MS.,\" whoever that may have been, became the basis of all the later Charges which h ave come down to us. It is quite probable that the old 17 th century Lodge, of which Randle Holmes was a member, dates from the e arliest period of Norm an architecture in Chester, if not beyond; its prior antiquity is proved b y the fact that it had in the 17th century ceased to have any practical object in relation to architecture. The ancient Scotch Lodges in most cases advance such claims. This era was the beginn ing of the \"Rectilinear\" or \"Perpendicular\" style of architec ture, which continued in vogue down to 1550 From 1349 works were in progress at Windsor, and John de Spoulee, Master stone - cutter to whom"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Anderson h as given the title of \"Master of the {333 } Ghiblim,\" t hough in Ashmole \u0000 s \"Order of the Garter\" the term used is Stone - cutter, had p ower given him to impress Masons; he rebuilt St. George \u0000 s Chapel where the King instituted the Order of the Garter in 1350 . In 1356 William of Wykeham, who was made Bishop of Winchester in 1367 , was appointed Surveyor, and in 1359 C hief Warden and Surveyor of various c astles, and employed 400 Free - Masons at Windsor. In 1360 the King impressed 360 Masons at his own wages, and attempts were made to punish those who left work, and this is the year in which the Statute law w as passed ag ainst all alliances, covines, and oaths, so that the one may have influenced the other. About this year William Edington, Bishop of Winchester, erected a very beautiful church at Edington. In 1362 writs were issued for the King \u0000 s works to impress 302 Mas ons and d elvers of stone, and the counties of York, Devon, and Salop were to furnish 60 men each. These arbitrary proceedings of the King have an explanatory bearing upon both the Statute laws and the Masonic Charges. In 1365 Henry Yeveley, already refer red to as a Mason - cutter, was director of the work of St. Stephen \u0000 s Chapel, now the House of Parliament, and according to Anderson is \"called at first, in the old Records, the King \u0000 s Free Mason\"; he built for the King the London Charter - house, King \u0000 s Hall in Cambridge, and Queensborough Castle. In 1370 William de Wynn esford, Cementarius, was s ent beyond sea to retain divers Masons for the service of the King. In 1375 , Robert a Barnh am at the head of 250 Free Masons c ompleted St George \u0000 s great Hall; and Si mon Langham, Abbot of Westminster, repaired the body of that cathedral. In Prior Fossour \u0000 s time, 1341 - 74, the great West window of Durham Cathedral was placed, and the Altar - screen finished in 1380 to which Lord Neville of Raby contributed 600 marks. Green, in h is \"History of the English People,\" has s ome remarks on the English Guilds which we may run over here. He says that \"Frank - Pledge,\" and the \"Frith - Guild\" {334 } sprang out of kinship and were recognised b oth by Alfred and Athelstan. The Mercha nt Guild of London sprang out of various Guilds in the city which were united into o ne by Athelstan. But this led to a Craft Guild struggle, for their Wardens had the Inspection of all work d one, all tools used and everything necessary for the good of the ir several trades. Apart from the Masons who had their own records, not mentioned b y Green, the first to secure royal sanction was the weavers who had their charter from Henry I., though the contest went on during the reign of John , for the control of tra de in the 11th century had b egun to pass from the Merchant Guild to those of the Craft. It may also be added that the Masons had b egun to pass from Monastic control and were becoming secularised. A constant struggle was taking place between the \"Prudhomm es,\" or Wise, and the Comm une; those Craftsmen who were unenfranchised united in secret Frith - guilds and Mobs arose, but t he open contest did not begin until 1261 , when the Craftsmen invaded the Town - mote, set aside the Alderm en and chose Thomas Fitz Thoma s for their Mayor. The contest continued until the time of Edward III., who himself joined the Guild of Arm ourers. Charters had now been granted to every trade, and their ordinances duly enrolled in the Mayor \u0000 s Court, and d istinctive Liveries assumed. G reen adds that t he wealthier citizens now finding their power broken sought to regain their old influence by enrolling themselves as members of the Trade - guilds (p. 189 - 95)."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" With the e xception of the Masons \u0000 Guild at York, which was c ontinuously employe d on the Minster, and other churches in York, and as these sent Guilds to o ther distant parts which ceased to exist when their work was done, it is impossible to trace old Guilds in perm anency. When they had completed their labours they would report to Yo rk, and as workmen were required elsewhere, a Guild with the proper complement of Apprentices, Fellows, and P assed Masters would b e sent there. In some cases, in small towns, a remnant would remain in perm anence, and {335 } it is to such as these that we o we a special Charge distinct from that of the General Assembly. In 1377 the Guilds of London were reconstituted and b ecame known as \"Livery Companies,\" from their special Livery or dress. In place of \"Guild,\" we now have \"Crafts and Mysteries,\" and for \"Alderm en,\" the Masters or Wardens. The Masons had sent 4 members and the Free Masons 2 members to the Municipal Council, but an old list shews that this distinction h ad b een done away with and an erasure is made to credit the delegates as \"Masons.\" The oath of the Wardens is preserved; they swore, well and truly to Oversee the Craft of Masonry, to o bserve its rules, and to bring all defaulters before the Chamberlain of the City; to spare no man for favour, nor grieve any man for hate; to comm it neither extortion n or wrong, nor in anything to be against the peace of the King or city. The Oath concludes, as in the French form ula before mentioned, \"So help you God and all Syntes.\" The title of the London Company of Masons, at this time, was \"The Craft and Fellowship of Masons.\" The \"Court Rolls\" of the Manor of Long Benynton, county of Lincoln, the lord b eing Thomas of Woodstock, the youngest son of Edward III., has John Playster and John Freemason in this year.<<\"Coleman \u0000 s Catalogue,\" 1882 , xviii, No. 15 0.>> The Charters of City Companies of Masons was c learly a legalised usurpation of the Saxon right of Assembly, and modelled upon the older \"Fraternities\" of France; where such City Companies were chartered the result might be the withdrawal of the Master s into the Livery, leading to the continuation of the Assembly by journeymen and amateurs. To put t he question in other words, some Assemblies may have become Livery Companies, whilst York, and other northern towns, continued the ancient right of Masonic Assembly; and in regard to this the views of Brother Speth that the Masonic Assembly, and the Charges belonging thereto, is a claim that they were free \"from\" the Guilds is worthy of close consideration. Brother Gould {336 } has mentioned several instances where Journeymen attempted to establish Guilds for their own enjoyment and p rotection, but were speedily suppressed b y the Masters; in 1387 three Cordwainers had b een promised a Papal brief for this purpose, but only obtained the privilege of the London p rison of Newgate; a similar attempt of the Journeymen S addlers was s uppressed in 1396 ; the same befel the Journeymen Tailors in 1415 ; also the Journeymen Guild of St. George at Coventry in 1427 . Unfortunately all the documents of the London Company of Mas ons prior to 1620 have been lost, or we should have had valuable inform ation as to the working of that Guild. Brother Edward Conder has shewn that the Company at the e arliest period of its records had a speculative Lodge meeting at its hall, which was not confined to Masons by profession; and that a Master \u0000 s grade such as is s poken of in the \"Regius\" and \"Cooke\" MSS . was the appanage of the Fellowship, by which \"accepted\" or non - operatives became qualified for the rank of Liverymen and Assistants who compo sed the"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"governing Council, and thus the e soteric or symbolic branch was allied with the e xoteric one on the Council. We will now return, in a few notes, to works in progress at this period. In the reign of Richard II., 1377 - 99, about fifteen pious hous es were built. Between 1380 - 86 the building of the new College, in Oxford, was accomplished b y William of Wykeham; the Wardens and Fellows, 14th April, 1386 , made solemn entrance, marching in procession with the cross borne before them and chanting Litanie s. Between 1387 - 93 the same architect founded Winchester College; it contains the arm s of the Architect, which h ave a peculiarity worthy of notice; they are -- two chevronels or carpenters \u0000 couples between three roses; motto, Mann ers makyth man. It is pr obably but a coincidence that if we reverse a Master Mason \u0000 s apron, it is a copy of the arm s of Wykeham, whilst the motto, as previously noted, is found in the \"Regius\" MS., and in a book on etiquette styled \"Urbanitatis,\" of which it is {337 } possible he may have been author. His Master Mason was William de Wynn esford, mentioned here in 1370 , and his portrait as William Wynfor, \"lathomus,\" appears in stained glass, with that of the Master Carpenter, and Dominus Simon Membury, Supervisor or Clerk of the Wo rks. In the old Masonic Charges there is a law that no Fellow shall go into the town at night, without a Fellow to bear him company, as witness of his good conduct; and Brother F. Compton Price, who has executed the beautiful facsimiles of Masonic MSS ., p oints out that Wykeham had the same law for the Monks and Canons, who were prohibited from going abroad without leave of the Prior, and without a Companion. From 1389 - 91 the celebrated p oet Geoffrey Chaucer, was Clerk of the Works over the King \u0000 s Masons , and it is possible that our old Charges may have had some influence upon h is poetical works. Romsey Abbey has a pillar in the south aisle, upon the capital of which is sc ulptured certain figures s upposed to represent the Dedicators of the Church; it has a trowel and a large square said to contain the words: \"Rohert me fecit.\" Between the years 1389 - 91 two very beautiful churches were e rected, one at t he village of Sh ottesbrook in Berkshire, and the other at Winn ington in Beds, but the \"Perpendicular \"st yle had not reached these places. St. Michael \u0000 s Church in Coventry was c ompleted in 1395 ; St. Nicholas in Lynn , 1400 ; the Collegiate Church in Manchester was in progress, and it has been supposed the builders met at the adjacent \"Seven Stars,\" a very anci ent hostelry. Works were in constant progress at York from 1349 - 99, and even down to 1520 . In the year 1352 , the Chapter of the Minster issued regulations for the Masons employed, which are interesting in themselves, and indicate to us various particul ars which shew how carefully old Masonic c ustoms have been handed d own to us. It would b e an error to suppose that such Lodges as are described herein were the York Assembly; that body was an ann ual Assembly drawn from all the Masons within a wide circle. {338 } Such Lodges might possibly receive Apprentices. The document from which we quote the following particulars is part of the \"Fabric Rolls,\" printed b y the Surtees \u0000 Society: 1352 , \"The first and second Masons, who are Masters of the same, and the Car penters,\" took an oath to carry out these regulations. After work, between May and Au gust, breakfast was to last half an h our, \"and then the aforesaid Masters, or one of them, shall knock upon the door of the lodge, and forthwith all shall go to their wor k.\" After dinn er they shall sleep within their lodge, and when the Vicars have come from the Canons \u0000 dinn er table, the Master Mason,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"or his s ubstitute, shall cause them to rise and come to their work. Then they were to work from the first bell for Vesper s, and then drink within the lodge until the third b ell of St. Mary \u0000 s Abbey called le longe bell. \"The aforesaid two Master Masons and Carpenters of the Fabric s hall be present at each drinking time, and these shall notify to the Keeper of the Fabric, and to the Controller thereof, all failures and absences.\" In 1370 the Dean and Chapter issued another Code of regulations under which n one were allowed to go away above a mile, under penalty of a fine. A new w orkman was to be tested for a week, and if \"h e is foundyn conisant of his werke, be recayde ye comm une assent of ye Mayster, and ye Keper of ye werke and of ye Mastyr Masoun, shall swere upon ye boke yet he shall trewle ande bysili at his poure, for out anye mann er gylary, fayntis, outher desayte, ha ld, and k epe holy, all ye poyntes of ys forsayde ordinance in all thynges yt him touches or m ay touche, fra tyme yt he be recavyde.\" In this s ame year Master Robert de Patryngton, and 12 Masons appeared and received Articles to this tenor: - \"Lords, if it be your wyles, we grant for to stand at our workes trewly, and at our power.\" In the following y ear we find that this Master had under him 35 Masons and Apprentices, 18 labourers, and the church found them Livery of tunics, aprons, gloves, and clogs. {33 9} In 1389 the Masters and Wardens of Guilds were ordered b y the Crown to make a return of their laws, oaths, feasts, meetings, and if they possessed charters to produce them, and the e xistence of both social and Craft Guilds is admitted b y issue of se parate writs. A body such as the London Fellowship of Masons, says Bro. R. F. Gould, would not be affected b y such writs, for it had the governance of the London Craft, and Anderson expresses an opinion, in 1723 , that its members had first been received a ccording to well - known Masonic form s. Masons in many parts, who had no Charters, would no doubt be affected b y the Writs of 1389 , and it is v ery probable that the order m ay have led to the compilation of a series of Constitutional Charges, which were, aga in and again, recopied and handed d own to us in later MSS .; but it is c lear that such scribes did not hesitate, at any time, to introduce supposed improvements of their own. Whether or not such a recompilation originated thus, the laws of the country shew that Assemblies c ontinued to be held d own to the 15th century, and Masonic documents prove their later continuance, and the variations in the MSS . lead us to believe that if there were Masons who preferred a Norm an French Charge, there were others who pre ferred their ancient Saxon privilege of a right of Assembly to o bligate Fellows, and p ass Masters, and we will give particulars of two such documents s hortly, both of which embrace legends of this date. We will now say a little upon the Symbolism of the time both English and Foreign. Dr. Inman, of Liverpool<<\"Ancient Faiths in Ancient Names.\", has the following: -- \"The ancient parish church of Bebington, Cheshire, has not only the solar wheel, the spikes of which term inate in the phallic triad, as one of the adornments of the reredos, but abounds with deltas, acorns, Maltese crosses, enfolding triangles, and Virgins who, like the ancient Isis, are crowned with the inverted crescent, the chaplet being still further adorned with the {340 } seven planets.\" A very interesting series of Marks, cut between 1120 - 1534 has been collected b y Brother Rylands.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" 1894 .>> At Great Waltham there are some well carved p anel heads of open seats, the tops of which in triplicated form contain the five - poin ted star, with a ball i n the centre. The"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"pavement of Westminster Abbey contains the double triangle, each angle containing a small one, whilst three triangles s eparated appear in the centre. During last century certain leaden medals designated \"Moralli\" were disinterred at Dover, and b elieved to be travelling tokens from one Monastery to another, ensuring welcome, some bore a five - pointed star, others had a dot at each angle, and the letter G i n the centre.<<\"Feem. Mag.,\" 1863 , viii, p. 86.>> Masons as a necessity were travellers, and could not carry work to their shop. The Rev. Bro. A. F. A. Woodford, whose ability as a Masonic authority is unquestioned, has s everal times s tated in print that there was found in the Minster Yard in York an ancient t oken or seal, undoubtedly of the 14th century, which h ad upon it words only known to Masons and Hiramites. By a Statute of Henry VI. (1406 ) the Liverymen of Guilds were perm itted to wear girdles of silk, embroidered with silver and gold. The date to the Wil l of John Cadeby is indecipherable, but earlier than 1451 , as one of the persons mentioned in it died in that year. Bro. G. F. Fort in h is treatise on builders \u0000 marks quotes Matthew of Arras and P eter Arler, whose images in the Cathedral of Prague, of the end of the 14th century, wear in the form er case his mark on a keystone \"set in a semi - circle,\" depending from a broad b and of blue, and P eter Arler \u0000 s is a perfect square. A Guild Mason would say that the Mark of Matthew of Arras proves him to have belon ged to an \"Arch\" Guild, though blue is a Craft colour. The inventory of the Will here named of John Cadeby, of Beverley, Mason, has mention of several Zonas, which though literally g irdles, may be interpreted Aprons: -- {341 } One silk zona, green and red, silver m ounted, weight 17 oz., 32s. 8d. One silk zona, silver m ounted, with leaves and ivy, weighs 7 1 /4 oz., 40s. 8d. One silk zona, silver m ounted, with Roses, weighs 9 3 /4 oz., 16s. 3d One damaged silk zona, silver m ounted, with letters B and I in the middle, weight . . . . One zona, of mixture, silvered, ornamented with stars, 3s One zona, of black and green silk, weight 3 oz., 3s The Girdle, then an article of clothing in general use, was appropriate to a Master. The foreign churches of the 14th century are e qually suggestive in Symbolism comm on to Masonry. The dome of Wurtzburg, in front of the chamber of the dead, has two columns, which are supposed to date from 104 o but may be later; on one is the letters IAC - HION, and BO O - Z. There is an old church in Hanover which was building from 1284 - 1350 , and which contains the circle, double triangles, and p entagon; in this c hurch is also a statue of St. George with the red cross, and one of St. James the Pilgrim; at one time it pos sessed a charger with the Baptist \u0000 s head; an inscription says: \"The fire was a sore thorn to Stoics and Hebrews,\" which a Chronicle of 1695 refers to the fact of the burning of the Templars, 1310 - 3, a remark which would seem to imply a belief that these Kn ights were guilty of Monotheistic heresy. Hargrave Jenn ings s ays that in old representations of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the sun and moon, with other emblems, are placed respectively on the two porches. The Church of Doberan h as many doub le triangles, placed in a significant mann er; three vine - leaves united b y a cord, and symbolic c yphers; there is also a painting in the same church, in which the Apostles are represented in"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Masonic attitudes.<<\"Hist. Freem.\" J. G. Findel.>> Fort asserts t hat in one of the churches of Florence are life size figures in Masonic attitudes. Many paintings of the old Masters are said to {342 } exhibit similar characteristics. The Church of Santa Croce, Florence, over the main portal has a figure of Christ, hold ing in the hand a perfect square; he it was who told P eter that \"upon this s tone (\"petra\") I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" Clavel states that the figure of Christ in the Church of St. Denis has the hand p laced in a position well known to Freemasons; at t he beginn ing of this c hapter we gave other inform ation h ereon. The Abbey Church of St. Owen in Rouen begun in 1318 , and completed b y Alexander Berneval, who died in 1440 and was buried in the church, has a legen d in regard to a very fine Rose - window w hich is identical with that of Melrose; the five - pointed star appears in the stone tracery, and Murray says that there is a tradition that it was made by an Apprentice whom Berneval, the Master m ason, slew out of jea lousy because he had surpassed himself. Other edifices at Rouen contain the pentagon. This general identity of Symbolism in various c ountries tends to prove a secret understanding amongst all Masons as to its meaning, and a similar Initiation of the buil ders everywhere, which as they travelled about ensured a brotherly welcome. Victor Hugo in h is novel of \"Notre Dame\" says that \"t here is an intimate conn ection between architecture and the Herm etic philosophy.\" He further alleges an alchemical symbolis m in the sculpture attributed to Bishop William of Parys in the great Portal; he also instances the Virgins with their lamps turned d own, and those turned up; the opening of the book (of philosophy); some naked figures at the foot of Mary; one with wings o n the heels (Mercury); the Sower; Job (the philosopher \u0000 s s tone, tortured to become perfect); a dragon with its tail i n a bath from which rises s moke and a king \u0000 s head, demons and dragon \u0000 s head; and Abraham offering his s on Isaac. In the reign of Henry I V., 1399 - 1413 , six pious houses were built; the Londoners erected their Guild Hall, and the King founded Battle Abbey in Sh rewsbury, and afterwards that of Fotheringay. In 1399 Hugh de Hedon {343 } had employed at York 28 Masons; but fuller inform ation wil l be found in the \"Fabric Rolls.\" In the reign of Henry V., 1413 - 22, eight pious houses were built, and the King rebuilt the palace, and the Abbey of Sh een, under the direction of Henry Chichley, Archbishop of Canterbury. At York, \"our dred lord the Ki ng\" had, in 1416 , given them William de Colchester from Westminster Abbey; the appointment must have been an unpopular one, for, in the third year of his Mastership, certain stone - cutters assaulted and d id grievously injure him and his assistant; the work continued here down to 1520 . Cattrick Bridge was constructed in 1413 , and the three Masons were to have a gown \"according to their degree,\" but t his will mean employment rank. Cattrick Church was begun in 1421 , and the Masons were to have \"a Luge of tre, \" with four rooms of \"syelles,\" and of two \"henforkes.\" The reign of Henry VI. lasted from 1422 - 61, and he was an infant upon h is succession. It is tolerably certain that in h is reign the Masons were dabblers in the Herm etic sc iences. During the time of Henry IV. Alchemy was made felony, by an act of 1404 , which continued in force during the reign of Henry V. Henry VI. took the art under his protection and obtained the consent of Parliament, empowering three Lancashire gentlemen, \"lovers of truth and"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"haters of deception,\" to practise the art.<<\"Vide Scientific and Relig. Mysteries.\" Yarker. 1872 . p. 62.>> An Act of Parliament was passed in 1425 alleging that by the \"yearly congregations and confederacies of the Masons in their general Chapters assem bled,\" the good effect of the Statutes of labourers was v iolated and p rohibited all such meetings; no effect was given to this act, and it remained a dead letter on the Statute book until the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when it passed into o blivion, being an nulled b y other Acts. In 1424 P rior Wessington repaired the tower of Durham Cathedral, and spent 1,454 P ounds of the money of the time. In 1426 the Masons erecting Walberswick steeple were {344 } to be provided with a house to work in, to eat and d ri nk, and to lie in and to make \"mete\" in, to be built near the place of working. In 1427 , William of Warm ington began the rebuilding of the western tower of Croyland Abbey, and the vaulting with stone of the north aisle; his memorial stone, which h as been engraved in \"Ars Quatuor\"<<\"A.Q.C.\" v, p. 146 .>>, represents him as holding a square in h is right hand, and a pair of compasses in h is left; there are other Masonic symbols c arved here, for which consult t he reference under the date 1113 . There was a Lodg e of Masons attached to the Priory of Canterbury at this time; as the Register of William Molash, in 1429 , mentions Thomas Stapylton, the Master, John Morys the Custos, or Warden, both of whom r ank as Esquires; and 16 Masons; all receive their livery, or c lothing. Chichley also had livery, and these e xtracts prove that Christ Church Convent had a considerable body of Masons working at the building. St. Mary \u0000 s Church, Bury, was begun 1424 . In the contract with Horwood for building the Nave of Fotheringa y Church in 1434 it is enacted, \"that if the two said letters, or any of them, be noght profitable ne suffisant workmen for the lordys availle, then by oversight of Master Masons of the countie, they shall be denyd.\" If Horwood d id not fulfill his engagem ents, \"he shall yielde his body to prison at my lordy \u0000 s will (D uke of York), and all his moveable goods and heritages be at my said lordy \u0000 s disposition and ordinance.\" In 1439 the Abbot of St. Edmundsbury contracts with John Wood for the restoration of th e great bell tower, \"in all manere of things that longe to Free - masonry, and to have borde for himself as a gentleman, and his s ervant as a yeoman, and thereby two robys, one for himselfe after a gentleman \u0000 s livery.\"<<\"Archaelogia,\" xxiii, p. 331 .>> Southw old Church was begun 1440 . In 1436 an Act was passed which required the Masters, Wardens, people of the Guilds, fraternities, and other companies incorporate, to produce their letters Patent to the Justices and others, where such Guilds and fraternities {345 } be, for their approval. This Act is directed against such bodies making their own laws, and it mentions the Chief Master as distinct from the Masons under him. It is a very valid supposition that it was this c ircumstance which led to the productio n of the Masonic Constitution for the sanction of the King, as s everal old copies known last century assert t hat it was. It has been suggested that the King \u0000 s Master Mason of our large cities might be the head of the Masonic Assemblies to whom the rest we re responsible. There is a Catechism purporting to be the e xamination of a Freemason by Henry VI., which admits Occult studies; it was given to the world last century under the name of the antiquaries Leland and John Locke, and though possibly a forgery , in its present shape may have been the actual Catechism of some lodge given to these studies. There, is, however, ancient and genuine"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"testimony to the practice of Alchemy by the Masons. We instanced in our Chapter (VI.) on the Herm etic Schools, the nat ure of the Symbolism of Jacques Coeur, 1450 and that of Basil Valentine. Whatever uncertainty there may be about t his there is none in the fact t hat Thomas Norton classes the Free Masons by name as giving themselves to Alchemical studies. One Richard Car ter in this year 1476 , had granted him a license to practise Alchemy. During this reign Wainfleet, Bishop of Winchester, and Archbishop Chichley superintended the e rection of various buildings in Oxford, Cambridge, and others built twelve pious houses. Fuller says of King \u0000 s College in Cambridge, founded b y Henry VI., in 1441 , that it is \"one of the rarest fabrics in Christendom.\" Churches begun, St. Mary \u0000 s Redcliffe, 1440 ; Tattershall 1455 . In S cotland William St. Clair built Roslyn Chapel in 1445 , and Mr. James Ferguson considers that the builders were from North S pain. Within it is a very beautiful Pillar called the Prentice \u0000 s Pillar, to which a legend is attached which says that whilst t he Master went t o Rome for instruction, an Apprentice comple ted the work in h is {346 } absence and that out of envy at seeing the beauty of the workmanship he slew the Apprentice by a blow on the forehead. Three heads are shewn in the Chapel as representing those of the Master, the Apprentice, and the widowed Mothe r, but it has been suggested that they may equally represent Joseph, Jesus, and Mary, in their application to the Rites of Harodim - Rosy Cross. A similar Apprentice legend is attached to Cologne, Strasburg, Rouen, Melrose, Lincoln, and to o ther places, and though it has a distinct esoteric reference e asily understood b y all Masons, may possibly be carried forward to an Asiatic s uperstition that a building intended to endure must be cemented b y the sacrifice of life. Brother Speth is of opinion that in addi tion to a foundation - sacrifice, previously mentioned, there was a completion - sacrifice made at t he crowning of the e difice, and that it was a custom obtaining amongst t he Teutonic and other r aces, of which h e gives many examples. Two documents, actually copied at this period, deserve ample reference here; one is the \"Cooke MS.,\" written about 1450 ; and of the other there are several duplicates, the \"Wm. Watson MS.,\" which we shall take as our r eference; the duplicates being the \"Heade MS.,\" dated 1675 ; a nother is quoted b y Dr. Plot in 1686 , and Dr. James Anderson, between 1723 - 38 had seen a copy. Bro. Dr. W. W. Begemann h as investigated the \"Cooke MS.,\" and considers that it is c opied from one about the year 1410 , whilst the second p art or book of Charge s is much earlier, by at least a century; the Preface being compiled in a west Midland County. Upon the \"Watson MS., a valuable Comm entary by Brother C. C.

The chronology has been disarranged apparently by adding the Euclid Charge in a document t o which it does not belong. The introduction into the Albanus legend of Amphibulus with Charges from France, betrays the work of an Anglo - Norm an, for Britain supplied France with Artisans at that remote period.

In reference to the Alban legend he supposes that Amphibalus may be a later gloss; and that the Saxon text might be accomm odated thus, -- \"the good rule of Masonry was destroyed until the time of Knight Athelstan (a worthy son of King Edward), and he brought t he land into good rest and p eace, and he (Athelstan) loved Masons more than h is father.\" The Edwin legend thus arising by substitution of the short Edwd. of the father.

Architecture is s aid to have been much n eglected d uring the 17 years of the Wars of the Roses, but in the reign of {351 } Edward IV., 1461 - 83, the walls of London were rebuilt, and seven pious houses erected. Wakefield Church, Yorkshire, was begun in 1470 ; St. Stephen \u0000 s, Bristol, same year; Blithborough Church, Suffolk, was c ompleted in 1472 ,; St. Laurence, Norwich, in the same year; S waffham, Norfolk, 1474 ; St. Mary \u0000 s, Oxford, and St. Mary \u0000 s, Cambridge, in 1478 ; Long Melford, Suffolk, 1481 . Heswell Church tower, Cheshire, was in course of erection, and its Masons \u0000 Marks were printed in 1894 b y Brother Rylands. The King in 1475 expres ses general disapprobation against \"t he giving of livries, signs, tokens, retainers of indenture, promises, oaths, and writings,\" and this is about the date when the \"original\" of the \"Watson MS.\" was made. John Islip, Abbot of Westminster, finished the r epair of the Abbey in 1483 . In 1472 \"the hole Craft and Felawship of Masons\" had coat arm our granted, -- \"sable, a chevron argent engrailed, between three castles, garnished with doors and windows of the field, on the chevron a compass, sable. Crest, -- A castle triple towered as in the arm s.\" The oldest motto, -- God is our guide, which later gave place to this, -- In the Lord is all our trust. With slight differences the Lodges generally adopted these arm s. Brother Conder inform s us that t he Company, at one time, possessed the Constitutions of the Fellowship, presented to them in the Mayorality of John Brown in 1481 ; these were the laws of their own body as a Company, but are now lost. \"Germ any.\" It is known that the Emperor Rudolph I. even in the year 1275 , authorised an Order of Masons, whilst Pope Nicholas III. in the year 1278 granted to the Brotherhood of Stonemasons at Strasburg, a letter of Indulgence which was renewed b y all his s uccessors down to Benedict XII. in 1340 . The oldest order of Germ an Masons arises in 1397 , next follow the so - called Vienn a witnesses of 1412 , 1434 , 1435 . Then the Strasburg Order of Lodges in 1464 ; that of Torgau 1462 , and finally 16 d ifferent orders on to 1500 , and the following centuries, for Spiers, Regensburg , Saxony, Altenburg, Strassburg, {352 } Oesterrich, and Ungarn. (\"Geschichte der Freimaurerei in Oesterreich und Ungarn,\" Ludwig Abafi, Budapest, 1890 - 1). The Germ an statutes of Ratisbon 1459 and of Strasburg 1464 , confirm ed b y the Emperor Maximilian I. o n the 1st May, 1498 , are but a more ornate version of those of England.

A book was published b y Veldener in Holland in 1486 which is s aid to contain symbolism of Craft and Egyptian Initiation. The book of Ludwig Abafi says of Bohemia a nd Hungary that they had other Mystic Brotherhoods \"Die Bruder von Reif und Hamm er\" -- Brothers of the Circle and Hamm er. \"Die Hackbruderschaft\" -- Brotherhood of the Hatchett. \"Die Freund vom Kreuz\" -- Friends of the Cross, which spread to Netherlands and were still holding meetings in 1785 in Wallachia, Transylvania, and other places. {353 } The Torgau Ordinanc es of 1462 indicate clearly the Germ an qualification for granting a Mark, enacting, in Article 94, that no Fellow shall qualify if he \"has not served his time or has bought his Mark, and not honestly earned it.\" By Article 25, at his Freedom he demanded a Mark from his Workmaster, and had to make a payment for the service of God. Article 12 enacts that if any one comm uned with a harlot he should retire from the Lodge, \"so far as one may cast a gavel.\" Of the reign of Richard III., 1483 - 5, nothing notew orthy is recorded. In the reign of Henry VII., 1485 - 1509 , various royal works were in progress, and about six pious houses were built. Reginald Bray, raised the middle chapel of Windsor, and rebuilt t he palace of Richmond. The Savoy was converted into a hospital, and in 1500 the Knights of St. John elected the King as Protector. In 1495 the law forbade the giving of liveries, signs, tokens, etc., being an official enforcement of the Complaint made to the Star Chamber in 1475 . Various minor works we re in progress which we need not particularise here; we may mention that John Hylmer and William Virtue contracted, in 1507 for the groined roofing of St. George \u0000 s Chapel at Windsor; and in 1509 Robert Jenyns, Robert Virtue, and John Lobins, are styled \"Ye King \u0000 s III Mr. Masons.\" The palace of Sh een was rebuilt after the fire of 1500 in the Burgundian style. Additions were made to Windsor, also to Hundsden, Bridewell, and Newhall or Beaulieu in Essex."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, began the pa lace of Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, but went to the scaffold b efore completion. The King in 1544 gave a Patent to John of Padua a s \"designer of his Majesty \u0000 s buildings,\" and a noted engineer, and Gothic architect, -- Sir Richard Lea, was employed as a Master Mason, and had a grant of the Manor of Topwell i n Hertfordshire. The Church of St. Mary at Beverley -- already mentioned {354 } -- was rebuilt, in the reign of Henry VIII. It has upon the 6th Pillar: \"This pillar m ade the Minstrels.\" The city usua lly had five officials of this c haracter; the Chief Minstrel had a long loose coat trimm ed with fur, and the costume of the others was a yellow jacket, long brown h ose, blue belts, and a heavy g old chain round the neck. A new style in domestic architect ure term ed the Tudor had arisen and is s aid to be Burgundian. The Rev. Wm. Benh am says that Richard IlI. left an illegitimate son, 16 years of age at his father \u0000 s death, who got his living as a Mason, and was buried in Eastwell, Kent, thus recorded: -- \"R ichard Plantagenet was buried the 22nd d ay of December ut Supra\" (1650 ), so that he must have been 81 years of age. Drake (Eboracum p. 117 ) states that he was knighted b y his father at York. The reign of Henry VIII., 1509 - 47, was more remarkable for ot her things than Masonry, Charles Dickens disposes of the King as a blot of blood and grease on the page of English h istory. Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell built several great works, -- Hampton Court, Whitehall, Trinity College in Oxford, the College of Ipswich, St James \u0000 Palace, Christ \u0000 s Hospital in London, Esher in Surrey, and Greenwich Castle. Lord Au dley built Magdalen College, and Au dley - end. In 1512 the \"Master of Works\" at Christ \u0000 s Church College in Oxford was Nicholas Townley, a priest. In 1 520 York Minster was c ompleted, and at the e rection of St. Michael le Belfry, 1526 , the Master Mason was John Freeman with 13 Masons, 2 Apprentices, 1 Intailer, and 17 labourers. In 1530 the London \"Craft and Fellowship of Masons,\" adopted the title of \"C ompany of Freemasons.\" There was in building at t his date, and at t he period of the Reform ation: -- St. James \u0000 Church, Bury; Lavenh am, Suffolk, Bidston Church tower, the Marks of which were collected in 1894 <<\"Ars Quat.

Of this {355 } century there is in Winchester Cathedral, a carved stone of the Freemasons \u0000 Arm s, and containing also the square, level, and compasses.<<\" Ibid,\" i.>> Brother H. R. Sh aw points out in the \"Bann er,\" some interesting symbolism in the pavement of Printing - house Square, London, which would b e of value, had it been shewn to be ancient. The manager of the \"Times\" told him the site was that of o ld Blackfriars \u0000 Monastery, and, after the Reform ation, of the King \u0000 s printing - house. The square is s lightly oblong and d ivided with granite cubes, by diagonally crossed lines, so as to form four triangles, each of which h as a circle of cubes and in the ce ntre an emblem: in the e ast is a \"cross,\" or it may be a pair of diagonals; in the west is a five - pointed star.<<\"Freemason.\" 7 Sep., 1594 .>> An interesting find was made in digging a drain, near Arreton, in the Isle of Wight, in 1856 , -- a basin of a spe cies of bell - metal, which h as on the outside of the base the double triangles, a tau cross within three circles, and at each of the six o uter angles a star, and a seventh in the Centre, near the Cross.<<\"Freem.

As practical symbols they typified arithmetic and geometry, and were treated as the standpoints of all created matter. It is s omewhat remarkable that an ancient emblem of the theological trinity of Egypt, the tri angle with an eye in it, passed into the Christian Church, and is yet used as an emblem in the Oriental churches. It was c arved in 1173 on the Sarcophagus of Bishop Eusebius who was interred at Mount Athos, we have also seen it upon an old Arm enian sword. The regulations of the Masons and other Crafts for {356 } the City of Norwich are given in the 1903 volume of \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum.\" The Corporation possessed a \"Book of Customs\" from the 13th or 14th century. The Bailiff and some 12 to 24 members of each Craft had the e xamination, with power to levy fines, of the Craft guilds. All apprentices were to be indentured for seven years, and some of the 15th century are preserved. The Smith \u0000 s Craft was at this period united with the Masons, and some re gulations were made in 1469 because of faults \"used b y the Masons to the dishonour of their Craft,\" and it is stated in 1491 that no Masters or Wardens had b een sworn to make search for defective work. An Apprentice roll from 1512 is preserved and there a re lists of Wardens until the middle of the 18th century. In the Mystery plays they had to perform the part of \"Abel and Cain.\" Each member paid an ann ual penn y to the priest of the Chapel of St. John who \"sang for the prosperity of the brethren who are alive, and the souls of those departed.\" Some changes took p lace at the dissolution of Guilds in 1548 b ut the \"feasts\" and \"fellowships,\" and the priest \u0000 s s alary, were continued. In 1572 rules for the Masons are drawn in the \"Assembly Book,\" and the Lime burners are included, with the fines each h ad to pay for various faults. The Masons were to assemble e very y ear with their two Wardens and headmen, and were to elect 12, 11, 10, 9, or 8 of the members, and these had to elect new Wardens, headman, a beadal l, ann ually, and fines are imposed for not attending meetings, when summ oned b y the latter. If necessary the fines were recoverable by distress, half of which went to the town and half to the Society. These regulations do not differ very materially eithe r from the London Livery Companies, or the Scottish Incorporated Masters, nor from the trade Incorporations granted b y the Bishop of Durham. There is no doubt such bodies had usually a Speculative Lodge held of them, as at London and as at Newcastle in 15 81. In other cases s uch assemblies granted an ann ual comm ission, say of five, to Initiate. {357 } \"Scotland.\" We will now hark b ack a little to examine the system which prevailed in S cotland; it embraces the features of the English Livery Companies an d the French Fraternities of Masters, with a much stricter control over its members than the English Companies found it convenient t o enforce; and probably, at a later period, and even to this day through the Grand Lodge, may have had an influence upon the English S ociety of Free Masons, though the term Mason is always used in S cotland. There is no doubt that at an early period Scotland had its Masonic Assemblies,but early in the 15th century, a cause was at work which modified the Assemblies, by withdrawi ng the Masters into bodies, similarly to the English Companies. A Statute was passed in the reign of James I., 1424 , empowering handicraftsmen to elect a \"Wise Man of the Craft\" as \"Dekyn or Kirk Master;\" and it was found necessary to bring Craftsmen from France, Flanders, Spain, Holland, and England; the reason"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"assigned b eing that all Scottish Men of Craft had b een slain in the wars. The powers granted were obnoxious and abolished 2 years later. There followed upon this the constitution of Masters \u0000 Inco rporations granted b y \"Seal of Cause,\" upon a petition to the Lord p rovost and town Council. The Masons, Wrights, and Weavers received their Charter in 1475 , which would confirm their older self - made regulations; the Hamm erm en in 1475 ; Butchers, 1488 ; Cor dwainers, 1489 . The members of these Incorporations had to contribute \"a weekly penn y,\" to support the altar and p riest, equally a custom of the French Masters \u0000 Fraternities. Trial - pieces, \"essays,\" or examinations, equally with France, were e xacted upon application for admission to the Masters \u0000 Incorporations. On opening and closing the meeting prayer was offered up b y the Deacon, as the Master was term ed. An oath was required which embraced secrecy, obedience to their own and the Burgh laws, and to th e Deacon of their own trade, and also to a higher Officer that began to be constituted in various towns, namely the {358 } Deacon Convener, loyalty to the King and the whole Craft. The \"Convenery\" was established somewhat later than the \"Incorporations,\" the object being to unite the whole of the trades or Arts of a town under one head and Assembly, composed of the Deacons or Masters of the various \"Incorporations;\" t hese e lected their own president or \"Convener\" t hus providing a supreme central authority . We thus s ee the gradual transform ation of the primitive Assemblies into \"Lodges\" of Apprentices and Journeymen; \"Incorporations\" of Masters; \"Conveneries\" of all trades; which were recruited b y an accepted trial - piece; the private Lodges being held in subjection to the Masters - Fraternity initiated b y \"Seal of Cause.\" These various bodies never lost their legal status, and the Incorporations of the Masons and Wrights exist to this day; but many of the private Lodges, which were subject, or subordinate to them, went under the Grand Lodge of Scotland when it was established in 1736 .<<\"Vide Ars Quat. Cor.\" ii, p. 160 ; also v, p. 126 .>> It form s no part of our labours to give a history of Scottish Masonry, but some inform ation is necessary in regard to cou ntries other than England. The Burgh records of Aberdeen afford evidence from 1483 - 1555 , that t he Craft dealings with their employers, without reference to esoteric Lodge work, resembled that of the 14th century Freemasons employed in York Minster. In 1483 the Masons at work are \"obligated b e the faith of thare bodies,\" and there is mention of the Luge. In 1484 it was ordered that the Craftsmen \"bear their tokens\" on their breasts on Candlemas day; in 1496 that every Craft have their standard. In 1498 Matheu Wricht agreed \"be his hand ophaldin to make good service in the luge,\" also \"that Nicol Masone and Dauid Wricht oblist thame be the fathis of thar bodies, the gret aith sworne to remain at Sand Nicholes werk in the luge. . . . . to be leil and truv e in all points.\" In 1532 a \"Seal {359 } of Cause,\" established a Masters \u0000 Incorporation; and in 1555 it was ordered that \"thair be na craftsman made fre man to use his c raft except he haf seruit a Prentis under one maister three yeiris, and he found suffi cient and qualified in his Craft t o be one Maister.\" How are we to read this? After serving an apprenticeship he had to be made free of his Lodge, and could only become a Master and a Member of the \"Incorporation,\" after an \"essay.\" It is an instance of the loose language so o ften found in Masonic documents, by which we are necessarily led away in reasoning upon Masonic rites and laws. A law of the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Incorporation was in force in 1587 that Journeymen and P rentices, though n ot members of the Society, were to be e ntered in the books of their Craft, whilst apprentices were to be e ntered in the books of the Town, to enable them to obtain the rights of Freedom of Craft, as free Burgesses. It seems like a side blow at the Lodges, and the same custom was in forc e in the chief towns of England. In 1599 a Convenery of all the trades was established, and their rules of 1641 enact that all Indentures between Masters and P rentices s hall be presented to the Town Clerk, within 21 d ays, for r egistry. Of course all this legislation, and the foundation of special bodies for the Masters, must have affected the status and p osition of the Scottish Lodges materially, and the same in England where Lodges were e stablished in towns in which there was a Chartered Livery Company. Powers which h ad b een granted 1424 were restored 1555 . A Dicreet Arbitral was issued b y James VI. in 1580 b y which the Council consists of: \"The auld P ro - \"vost, four auld Baillies, the Dean of Guild, and Treasurer \"of the next year preceding, and thre e other Merchants \"to be chosen to them, and also to consist of eight \"Craftsmen thereof, six Deacons, and the other Crafts - \"men, mak, and in the hail, the said Council eighteen persons.\" Regulations follow as to the form of Apprenticeship. In 1590 the s ame King, 25 Septr., appointed P atrick Copeland of Udaucht \"Warden and Justice\" of {360 } the Masons, but in 1601 - 2 the Freemen Maisons request t he St. Clairs to procure from the King the office of Patron and Judge, and the document having perished b y fire, the Lodges c onfirm it in 1628 . In 1598 and 1599 William Schaw, \"Maister of Wark\" to King James, granted Constitutions to Edinburgh and Kilwinn ing districts, and p erhaps also to Stirling and others at these dates; these have already been mentioned. The re is a tomb in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood of the year 1543 upon which is a stepped - cross; on one side of it is a compass and some other emblem beneath, on the other side a square and b elow that a square - headed gavel. In Glasgow Cathedral, on the inside of a stone window - sill of the south side of the choir and carved over the date 1556 , is an eye, crescent moon, three stars, hand p ointing a finger, ladder of five steps, square and compasses; these were pointed out by Brother W. P. Buchan who casts doubt, we think unn ecessarily, upon the date given.<<\"Freem. Mag.,\" 1869 (engraved).>> It may be noticed here, that the Lodge of Mary \u0000 s Chapel, Edinburgh, has minutes from 1599 , and was old then, and that these minutes, those of the Incorporation, and those of the Convenery are independent of each other, and confirm what we have stated, and which we shall refer to more fully. In the year 1543 the Castle of Wark in Northumberland, was repaired b y an Italian of the name of Archan. Soon after 1549 the Wark Lodge sent a contingent Guild to Haddington, which afterwards went on to Aitchinson \u0000 s Haven, and St. John \u0000 s Kilwinn ing Lodge, at Haddington, claims to be an offshoot of the Wark Lodge.<<\"Some old Scot.

In Danver \u0000 s \"Portugese in India\" is an engraved p ortrait, of which there is a copy in the British Museum, representing Pr ince Henrique, surnamed the Navigator, in the upper left hand corner of which is the level, square, plumb - line and weight, and open compasses: it was printed about 1620 b y Simon van de Paes. In S ebastian Munster \u0000 s \"Cosmography,\" printed in 1554 , is the square and compasses in which is the letter G as a marginal ornament. \"The Enemie of Idleness,\" by W. F. (Wm. Fleetwood), London, 1578 , mentions a work on architecture and the science of building by Baptista Leo, a Florentine, and his \"Secrete and hid d is cipline.\" The compilation of this Chapter is much indebted to the collections of the late E. W. Sh aw, and Mr. Wyatt Papworth, also to the Histories of Anderson and Gould, and the various papers of \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum.\" The particulars, though inte resting in themselves, relate rather to the Craft in its operative and exoteric aspect; but they also shew the nature of the speculative and esoteric Symbolism, the plan of the Societies \u0000 organisation, the nature of an esoteric ritual, the fact that Assemb lies c ontinued to be held; and that all things of the period of this Chapter point to a perfect conform ity with what is known of Guild Masonry, and its imitation in the Free Masonry of to - day. The Statute law and the chartering of Livery Companies or Mast ers \u0000 Fraternities, seems to have gradually shorn the Assemblies of much of {362 } their prestige and p rivileges, and contributed to make the more e xtensive Assemblies s tationary town Lodges, with a modified Constitution. The abandonment of Gothic Art about 1550 , and the death of the operative Masters of that Art about 1580 accomplished the rest and left Free Masonry what it was in 1700 . The Gothic \"arcanum\" had d ied out; its Lodges had b ecome mere social clubs; but a counter m ovement was in progress under Inigo Jones to restore the \"arcanum\" of the Classical architecture of Italy. We cann ot conclude better than with the following quotation from Robert Fabian \u0000 s \"Concordance of Histories,\" which appeared in 1516 (Pynson). The writer was Sh eriff and Alderm an of London, 1493 - 1502 ; and d ied about 1511 , but his book was not printed until 1516 b y Pynson. The following is from his prologue of 28 Stanzas of which this is the 5th and 6 th. He may have been a member of the Mason \u0000 s Company: -- \"And I, like the Prentice that heweth the rought stone, And b ringeth it to square, with h ard strokes and many, That the Master after, may it oeur gone And p rynte therein h is figures and his s tory, And so to work after his propornary That it may appear, to all that shall it see, A thynge right parfyte, and well in eche degree; So have I now sette oute this rude worke, As rough as the stone that comen to the square,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":" That the learnede and the studyed Clerke, May it oeur polysshe, and clene do it pare, Flowyrsshe it with eloquence, whereof it is bare, And frame it to o rdre that yt is out of joynt, That it with old authors may g ree in every poynt.\" We will only add that we think that this Chapter clearly proves that there was engrafted upon the simple Anglo - Saxon Constitution of Masonry a series of Semitic legends, and their compliment in the Free - Masonic c eremonies, which entered this c ountry from the East in {363 } Anglo - Norm an times, with an improved style of building, of Saracenic origin. Whence England d erived its Semitic c eremonies of Free Masonry is not very definite but circumstances point very clearly to a direct importation from Palestine, extend ed b y French Masons who came over from time to time and it is in that country that we find the e arliest allusion to the Solomonic legends, and it is evidenced in this Chapter that these legends were introduced into the older Saxon Charges from that country . {364 }   CHAPTER X .  FREE - MASONRY IN MOD ER N TIMES. THE pretensions that Dr. James Anderson h as made for the Grand Masterships of numerous Bishops, Priests, and Monks, should not be passed over with a shrug of contempt. Ages after architecture had b een relieved from Monkish tramm els the great architects were mainly Clerics, who have left their marks upon the soil of England. We have mentioned many such in our last Chapter, and these stand out promine ntly: -- Peter Bishop of Winchester, 1220 ; Edington and Wykeham, both Bishops 1364 ; the work of the latter, some author observes, is s tamped with a genius, almost a style in itself; Prior Bolton, in conjunction with S ir Reginald Bray, 1503 ; and Cardinal Wo lsey was a most accomplished architect, as is proved b y all the buildings with which h e was conn ected. It has been aptly said that, \"the Classic s tyles are the prose of architecture, Gothic its poetry; the Classic its s peech, and Gothic its s ong.\" The pe riod of this Chapter is the \"Renaissance Style,\" which arose in Rome, and spread to this c ountry. The change of style was in part a matter of taste, and in part a matter of vanity as with the affectation of classical learning it became the fashion to trea t t he brilliant Gothic as a barbarous s tyle. The Gothic fraternity laboured in bands or guilds, travelling about, and disappearing when their work was accomplished, and each man left his individual stamp upon the work: as each part of a Gothic edifice sup ports both itself and some other part, so the Free Masonic bands s upported each other. Under the Renaissance {365 } each building bears the stamp of one man, and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"the architect came into being with the loss of the old Sodalities. With the Reform ation we ha ve the decay of Catholic s ymbolism, and the loss of it to the modern Freemason. With the Renaissance we find this s ymbolism, as a part of Catholic doctrine in the old times, carried into the e rection of private buildings, and we have castles and mansions built on a cruciform basis; or in the form of variously shaped triangles; and in the shape of letters of the Roman Alphabet. It is s aid that John Thorpe, who erected many mansions in the Elizabethan style was a pupil of John of Padua. But it is to the It alian masters of the 17th century that we owe the preservation of the Rites of Guild Masonry. The period which we have now reached in Freemasonry exhibits an organisation which somewhat diverges from its ancient Constitution; f or reasons assigned in our last Chapter. The ARTICLES and P OINTS of a Master and Fellow have become combined in one code, in a new series of Constitutional Charges dating from about t he Reform ation. York was now universally recognised as the primary seat of Masonic Assembly and L ondon may have acquiesced in this from the fact that the Oversight of Masonry rested with the Company of Freemasons known to date from the time of Edward III., though it had a Speculative Lodge attached to which amateurs, and others for the Livery, were ad mitted. Au thorities are not quite agreed as to the original date to which we may carry back the numerous c opies of Masonic MSS . that we possess, but there seems not the slightest reason to doubt that all our m odern Guild Charges are derived from an abri dgement of the \"Cooke and Watson MSS .,\" which h ad b ecome too lengthy for general use in the Lodges, and with its reduction in length was associated other changes brought about by the circumstances of the times. Of this new Constitution some 70 copied have come down to us dating between 1560 - 1700 , and most of them no doubt have been the {366 } Official Copies of Masters of Lodges. They are all verbal departures from some one abridged copy, made perhaps about t he years 1535 - 45, but in what locality there is nothing to shew. They usually begin with an invocation to the Trinity, and are addressed to the \"Good Brethren and Fellows.\" The Euclid Charge which is the sole feature of the primitive Saxon Charge, is c ondensed as in the \"Watson MS.,\" to o rdain a dul y Passed Master or a Master of Work, and which, in the e soteric work of a Lodge, is s omewhat equivalent to the Installation of a Master; but which would be inapplicable to a large Provincial Assembly, met to receive Fellows, and p ass Masters, as arranged f or in the Athelstan Constitution. The new MS. also agrees with the present ritualistic s ystem, as it brings into prominence the Charges of David and Solomon, and the assistance of Hiram of Tyre. The Laws begin with a \"General Charge to all Masons,\" colle cted out of the oldest Articles and P oints, and then follows a \"Charge to Masters and Fellows.\" Where an \"Article\" of the Master has been copied out of the oldest MSS . the word Fellow usually follows it, as if with the intention of claiming that a Fellow in a Lodge was equally a Master. Usually the distance assigned, within which attendance at the Assembly is c ompulsory is 50 miles, which gives 100 miles diameter in a circle round a comm on centre. All these later Charges are the basis of the esoteric rec eptions then, and still i n use. These later Constitutions are in main agreement with the \"Watson MS.\" and the Preface to the \"Cooke MS.,\" which state that the great Patron of Masonry in France was Charles II., the Karl II. of the Germ an Catechism, and t he grandson"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"of Charlemagne, respecting which we volunteered some remarks in our last chapter. But in the later MSS ., however the correction h as been reached, a return h as been made to Charles Martel, who, though only Regent of France, was the accepted P at ron of stonecutters in France before the 13th century. Possibly {367 } \"secundus\" was a Germ an error either for Magnus or for Martel and obtained credence in England. The instructor of Martel has a name that has puzzled most Masonic \u0000 scribes, as he appear s in endless form s, amongst others, Naymus Grecus, Manus Graecus, Mamongetus, Namus Grenaeus, etc., and he had wrought at the building of Solomon \u0000 s temple with Amm on, Aymon, Anon, etc. It is possible that t he origin of the name was from Nimes in Southern France, then from Namus to Marcus Graecus, a philosopher of the 8th or 9th century it is s upposed, though n ot heard of till the 13th century, and when in the 16th century the name was disfigured b eyond recognition, and Caxton h ad p rinted the \"Four Sons of Aymon,\" which contains a Masonic legend, that Aymon was adopted. The name Aymon was used in baptism as Cornelius Agrippa gave it to his firstborn son. Simon Greynaeus also o btained countenance from his eminence as a Geometrician. Brother Schn itger, in h is Comm entary upon the MS. Charges printed b y the Newcastle College of Rosicrucians in 1893 , suggests that the difficulty in regard to Namus labouring at Solomon \u0000 s temple and then instructing Charles Martel may be got over by reading it t hat he was one \"wh o had b een at t he buildings of Solomon \u0000 s temple,\" that is had visited the site. All these later Constitutions preserve the relations as to Herm es, Pythagoras, and Euclid, and we cann ot admit that the Masons who recognised these personages as, in some sort , their predecessors, were ignorant of the sublime spiritual geometry which underlaid their ancient philosophy. It is probable that in time we may adopt a theory developed in a paper before the Quatuor Coronati Lodge 2076 b y Bro. Dring that Carolus Secu ndus of the Cooke MS. is an error for Carolus Magnus or Charlemagne, and that Manus, Namus, or the man with the Greek name, was Alcuin Flaccus of York, also called Albines, who it was s uggested might be the St. Alban therein mentioned, and who term s Charle magne \"the wise Solomon\" and speaks of the e rection of the Church at Aixe - la - Chapelle as the {368 } w ork of this wise Solomon. The theory has the merit of rectifying the chronology, which is erroneous as it stands. The importance of York as a Masonic c e ntre would d ecline from various causes. In 1538 the Monasteries were dissolved, and b uilding requirements ceased for a time; this was emphasised b y the suppression of the Minor Fraternities, Brotherhoods, and Guilds. One of the Guilds thus s uppressed at York had endured exactly for a century, and was named the Guild of \"Corpus Christi\" and consisted of a Master and six priests, who ann ually on Trinity Sunday regulated the \"Mystery - play\" of Corpus Christi when every trade in the city was bound to furnish a Pageant; this s acred d rama existed at York in 1220 A.D. Another r eason is that with the abolition of Guilds, the e xisting Livery Companies lost even the lax hold which they had p ossessed over the trades; and the Municipality of York, and other cities, ha d adopted a form of City Freedom, as early as the 14th century, which was granted b y the Lord Mayor and Comm on Council to the Apprentice who had served his term of seven years. It was an Exoteric mode resembling the Esoteric reception of a Mason. An Appr entice was bound b y an Indenture, in which h e took upon h imself"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"rules of conduct, which are practically the same as those to which, as a Mason, he would have been sworn in Lodge; this Indenture was taken to the City Clerk, who endorsed it \"Entered.\" At th e e nd of his s even years \u0000 Apprenticeship he repaired to the Guild Hall, and took an oath addressed \"to the Lord Mayor and Good Men,\" that he would k eep the privities and maintain with h is body the Freedom of the City. The Clerk then \"Charged\" him to prote ct the tolls and dues of the City, and conferred the \"Freedom.\" We have not the precise date when this form began at York, though there are lists of Freemen from early in the 14th century; the same usage was in force at Boston in Lincolnshire, and lists o f the Apprentices \"Freed\" are preserved there from 1559 ; it existed at Leicester, {369 } Norwich, Appleby, etc., etc.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" iv.>> A like custom was adopted in S cotland, and ordered at Aberdeen in 1641 .<<\"Ibid.\" ii, p. 161 .>> Smith, in h is lear ned Essay on the Romano - Germ an laws, which we have previously quoted, considers that t he Roman Collegia were the foundations of our Municipal corporations, and says: \"In England the Guilds appear to have been the imm ediate foundation of the old Municipal c orporations. Many of the e xclusive privileges, which are scarcely y et forgotten, and many of the customs derived from the Guilds, with regard to the e xercise of a Craft, have passed into comm on law, though n ow disconn ected with the imm unities derived from the Municipalities.\" At t his period, and for long afterwards, the Crown h ad ample cause for uneasiness in regard to the Assembly of any large body of Men in the North of England; and no o ther portion of the kingdom so strongly resented the suppression of Monasteries and Guilds as did Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire. Brother Francis Drake, the historian, says that their dissolution inflicted a terrible blow upon the grandeur of York, the sick, the infirm , and all sorts of religious persons were tu rned out of house and home to starve or beg. A form idable rebellion was organised in 1537 under the name of the \"Pilgrimage of Grace,\" in which the leading men of the country, with the Abbots of Fountains, Jervaux, and Rivalx, took p art. These Pilgrims t ook an oath of their good intentions to church and King, and at their head marched a body of priests, habited in their vestments, and with crosses in their hands. The leaders assumed characteristics s uch as Charity, Faith, Poverty, Pity. Their bann er was embroidered with a crucifix, a chalice, and emblems of the 5 wounds of Christ, and the last mentioned emblems were placed on the sleeves of their robes, with the name of Jesus in the centre. The rising was s uppressed in Henry \u0000 s usual brutal mann er, but t he dissatisfaction continued to slumber on, and must have caused the government to look {370 } w ith suspicion upon any considerable gathering of men, however inn ocent their intentions might be. This dissatisfied element was also very strong in S outh Durham as well as North Yorkshire, and extended into Northumberland. A second and final rising occurred in 1569 , under Elizabeth, but was as disastrous as the first, but though these \"Recusants\" were often persecuted, and large numbers hanged, they made no furt her attempt to regain their lost position; it is however, known that they adopted secret modes of recognition, such as passwords, by which to recognise friends; one of these was Gibb, and Gibbs in a continental system was one of the 3 Ruffians. We find nothing worthy of mention in the reigns of Edward VI., 1547 - 53, or that of Mary, 1553 - 8, but the long reign of Elizabeth, 1558 - 1603 , has much to record. The \"old tradition,\" recorded b y Anderson, that Queen Elizabeth sent"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"an arm ed force in 1561 to break u p the ann ual Assembly at York is probably of an authentic c haracter. He states that it was held under Sir Thomas Sackville, as President, and that by his friendly management the Assembly was allowed to continue its labours. There is an ancient song in re ference to this which may be almost contemporary.<<\"Rosicrucian,\" 1878 , p. 464 >> The Law complained querulously, in 1548 , that \"artificers made confederacies not to meddle with another \u0000 s work\"; which is exactly what the Masonic Charges had insisted upon from ancient t imes. In 1562 all previous laws are superseded b y Statute e mpowering Justices to rate the wages of journeymen and forbidding the e xercise of trades without an Apprenticeship to such trades, which requirement is what Masons always c ontended for as a necessity of their trade. Anderson quotes the view of Judge Coke, as to the Statute of 1425 , which h e said was now abrogated, and adds that it confirm s the opinions of old Masons that \"he was a faithful brother.\" It is asserted in Masonic hist ories that, up to 1561 , York was paramount in Masonic Government, but that North {371 } and South were now divided, and the e xisting remnants of the old Guild system teaches that the Trent was the division line; it is, therefore, probably a true statement. In the feeble rule of the Masons \u0000 Company and the e xistence of independent Guilds there is traditional basis for the foregoing statement, which seems to be represented b y a Southern version of the old Charges. These MSS ., f or there are several copies, do not differ m aterially from the others except but in one or two points; they omit the Euclid Charge, but that seems to be an accident of the scribe. Edwin is s aid to have been the son of a worthy King of England in the time of Knight Athelstan, thus ref erring to their father, Edward the e lder, and this Edwin was made a Mason \"at Windsor.\" Hebrew MSS . are now said to have been produced at the Assembly which Athelstan h eld at York, and there is actually a Jewish profession of Faith before Solomon in use b y the French \"Sons of Solomon.\" The oath in these MSS . is c onfirm ed b y the Invocation of Almighty God, or as a copy of 1686 , which is believed to have been prepared for the London Guild whence sprang the Lodge of Antiquity, has it \"Almighty God of Jacob,\" in place of \"by my Halidame.\" The most important script of this version is the \"Landsdowne MS.,\" reproduced in facsimile by the \"Quatuor Coronati Lodge,\" and supposed to have been in the possession of Lord Burghley, who died in 1598 . There is s ome doubt of its alleged antiquity, and the changes made savour of Comm onwealth times, 1649 - 60 when the Jews were readmitted. A critical examination of the several copies has been made by Brother Dr. W. W. Begemann , with the conclusion that t here was an older vers ion than any of the three versions examined, such might have been Burgley \u0000 s. If Queen Elizabeth did contemplate the suppression of the Assembly at York, it would go before the law officers of the Crown, and the Secretary of State at that time was Sir Wi lliam Cecil, a Lincolnshire man, who was c reated Baron Burghley, and is alleged to have possessed this {372 } Constitution. He began the building of Burghley House about 1556 , and it was c ontinued d own to 1578 , and all details of the work were submitted to him. One of the Free - Masons employed was Roger Ward, Peter Kempe was Clerk of Works, and Richard Sh ute Surveyor. We read 10 th January, 1562 , Of \"one freemason yt was hyred b y y e yere working upon ye ij wyndows of ye courte\" in the letter of Kempe to Sir William Cecil.<<Trans. Ro. Inst. of Brit. Arch. 1890 .>> Burghley"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"and Sir Nicholas Bacon, who was Lord Keeper, married two sisters, and Bacon died in 1578 , leaving a son Francis born in 1561 , and created Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Albans in 1618 - 19. Now the following curious c oincidences occur in regard to these three closely related p ersons of rank and ability: -- 1. This peculiar Charge is s upposed to have belonged to Lord Burghley. 2. The house of Sir Nicholas Bacon, called Gorhambury House i n S t. Albans, built about 1565 , contains portraits of persons distinguished in the seven Liberal Arts and Sciences, and b eneath each of these two Latin lines, expressive of benefits to be derived from the study of each: -- \"Gramm ar\" -- Donatus, Lilly, S ervius, Priscan. \"Arithmetic\" -- Stifelius, Budaeus, Pythagoras. \"Logic\" -- Aristotle, Rodolp; Porphyry, Seton. \"Music\" -- Aryan, Terpander, Orpheus. \"Rhetoric\" -- Cicero, Isocrates, Demosthenes, Quintilian. \"Geometry\" -- Archimedes, Euclid, Strabo, Apollonius. \"Astronomy\" -- Regiomontanus, Haly, Copernicus, Ptolomey.<<Vide \"Royal Mas. Cyclo.\" -- Mackenzie.>>. 3. Francis, son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, wrote in 1624 the unfinished fragment called \"New Atlantis, or the House of Solomon, or o f the Six Days \u0000 Work.\" Many foreign writers of note have e rroneously thought that it led to the e stablishment of Freemasonry; but it is likely that the writer had the Masonic Society in h is mind and d esired to {373 } shew how its v alue might be e nh anced. The 1620 edition of his \"Instauratio Magna\" (John Bell, London) has as engraved title a ship b etween two columns. In 1570 Sir Thomas Gresham built the Royal Exchange in London, and the movement t o revive \"the Au gustan style\" and d epreciate the Gothic wa s general. The facsimile of a map of Portsmouth, of this period, shews the position of a \"Masons \u0000 Lodge,\" probably a body was at work on some building at the port.<<\"A.Q.C.\" vi.>> In 1584 Sir Walter Mildmay founded Emanuel College at Cambridge. A colony of Spaniards s ettled at Galway in 1584 , and many of their buildings yet exist, and are said to resemble the older Moorish architecture. The north is in evidence in the year 1581 : \"The Ordinary of the Company of Masons of Newcastle upon Tyne, dated the first of September of this year, constituted a body Incorporated of themselves, with perpetual succession, enjoyned them to meet yearly to choose Wardens, &c. \u0000 That whenever the general plays of the town called Corpus Christi should b e played they should play the burial of our Lady St. Mary the Virgin, \u0000 every absent brother to pay 2s. 6d., and that at all the marriages and b urials of the brethren and their wives, the Company should attend to the church such persons to be married or buried.\" The Arm s attac hed to this paragraph are -- On a chevron between three towers a pair of compasses extended. \"Crest\" -- A tower. \"Motto\" -- In the Lord is all our trust.<<Richardson \u0000 s \"Border Table Talk,\" i, p. 219 .>> It would seem that the intention of the Newcastle C ouncil was to constitute a body held of themselves; at the same time the Lodge may have long existed, and have sought a Municipal Charter to legalise their m eetings. In reference to the \"Corpus Christi\" Mystery - plays, they are mentioned at Newcastle in 14 26, but would seem from the \"Ordinary\" t o have been on the decline in 1548 , the house - carpenters, whose \"Ordinary\" dates 1579 , played the Burial of Christ, and the Masons that of St. Mary. The Lodge may have been privy to the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Initiation {374 } of Sir Rober t Moray in 1641 b y a Scotch deputation, and had late meetings of their own. The \"Watson MS.\" was discovered in the town, and is s igned b y Edward Thompson in 1687 , who was doubtless a member of that Lodge, the Arm s attached to it are identical with those a ssigned to the body of 1581 . It is now known to have come through the hands of Dalziel, a member of Lodge 24. We shall allude to these Masons again in later notices. The position of this \"Ordinary\" of Newcastle needs a better explanation than that her e given. Durham and Northumberland were a County Palatine under the Bishop, but Newcastle as an important military station was a county in itself. Previously to 1215 Newcastle was governed b y Bailiffs, but Henry III. in this year ordered a Mayor and 4 Ba iliffs to appoint a trusty Moneyer and Assayist. But it was in 1400 that Henry IV. chartered the town as a separate county with a Sh eriff, a Mayor, and 6 Alderm en. The Newcastle \"Ordinaries\" begin in 1426 with the Coopers. The Skinn ers \u0000 \"Ordinary\" of 14 37 contains the names of the Mayor, Sh eriff, and the 6 Alderm en. In 1527 the Weavers met in Carliel tower, and in 1532 the Tann ers had the Black Friary. The \"Ordinary\" of the Goldsmiths in 1536 included Braziers, Plumbers, &c., and they had to play the T hree Kings of Cologne (the 3 Magi who visited the infant Jesus), at the Corpus Christi. It would seem therefore that an old Masters \u0000 Guild of Masons existed here which accepted its \"Ordinary\" from the Mayor, Sh eriff, and Bailiffs in 1581 . Whoever exami nes an old Cathedral cann ot fail to see that t wo classes of Masons were e mployed on them, a class which did the level and square work, and a class which did the curved and arched work, yet their separate duties was one of their trade secrets. Surprise has often been expressed that amongst these Mystery plays there are none recorded as s pecially Masonic. Mackenzie states in h is \"Cyclopaedia\" that an \"Arch Confraternity\" of builders existed in 1540 and enacted Mystery Plays in the Colosseum of Vespasian and expresses belief that it {375 } still exists. There is s ome e vidence that in 1561 Masonry at York was in a declining state, as the Records s ay that their share of the Corpus Christi plays was given to the Minstrels. Incorporations also continued to be granted b y the Bishops as Count Palatines. The Cordwainers of Durham in 1436 . In 1559 Bishop Tunstall re - incorporated the Barkers and Tann ers of Gateshead. Up to 1565 the City of Durham had b een governed b y Bailiffs, but in that year Bishop P ilkington I ncorporated the Alderm en. In 1638 a charter was granted to the Free Maysons, Rough Maysons, etc., etc., of the Cittie of Durham. We gather from the Schaw Statutes of 1598 , the Warden General of James VI., that Edinburgh was a district governed b y \"Six men of Ancient Memory,\" who had to \"tak tryall of the offensis,\" and these \"six o f the maist parfyte and worthiest of memorie\" had to \"tak tryall of the haill Maisons within the boundis foresaid.\" They appear to be the \"Deacon Maisters,\" and Wardens of th e old Lodges, and they were authorised to Pass Fellows of Craft, after serving a seven years \u0000 Apprenticeship, and another seven years as Journeymen unless the latter was reduced b y the Assembly, and after m aking a trial - piece. We see from this that t o bec ome a Passed Master a Freed Apprentice had to serve seven years as a Passed Fellow. A similar Constitution was given to Kilwinn ing in 1599 , and their Six Quarter Masters were to appoint a famous notary as Clerk. King James \u0000 sanction was awaited this Cons titution, and p ossibly there were other districts that may have had similar grants by the Lord Warden"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"General. Thus we learn from a Kilwinn ing Minute that the Six Quarter Masters of Cunn ing, Carrick, and Barrowthrow in 1659 continued to meet once a year a t Ayr to \"tak order with the transgressors of the Acts of Court.\" There can be no question that these six in every case were duly Passed Masters and that they correspond with what we shall hear of as \"Harods\" in Durham. For want of contemporary MS. cer emonials we will {376 } occasionally refer to Masonic s ymbolism in several countries; for identity of symbols and the mode of their application, press on towards the proofs that Initiatory ceremonies were identical in all times. In Ireland a Mason \u0000 s s quare was deposited in the \"east\" corner of the northern landpier of Baal \u0000 s Bridge in Limerick. It bears date 1517 , and was dug out in 1830 . There is a heart at the angle on each side, and this inscription in one line at each side: -- I will strive t o live with love and care, 1517 , Upon the level, by the square.<<Freem. Quart., engd., 1850 , p. 330 >> In Coverdale \u0000 s translation of Werm ylierus \u0000 \"Spirituall and Most Precyousse Pearle,\" 1550 , is the following:\" -- The Free Mason h ewyth the hard e stones, hewyth of here one pece, there another, tyll the stones be fytte and apte for the place where he wyll lay them. Even so God the heavenly Free Mason buildeth a Christian churche, and he frameth and p olysheth us which are the costlye and precyous stone with the cosse and affliction that all abbomynacon and wickedness which do not agree unto this gloryus buyldynge mighte be removed and taken out of the waye.\" (Cowderie \u0000 s \"Treasurie of Similies,\" 1609 .) In the old church in Hanover of which we ma de mention in our last chapter there is a sun - dial with the date 1555 , and the letters H.B.A.S., which a chronicle of 1695 says alludes to Hans Buntingsen, \"who loved his art, and was well acquainted with the compasses and square and the great secret there of.\" In the parish register of Much Wenlock in Sh ropshire is an entry of value, as it shews the meaning then attached to the word \"Speculative,\" as theory; it refers to dates between 1546 - 76: \"Burd. out of tenmts. in Madfold Street, next St. Owen \u0000 s well , Sir William Corvehill priest of the service of or. Lady in this c h., which 2 tents. belonged to the sd. service; he had them in h is occupacon in pt. of his wages, wch. was v iii. marks, and the said houses in an ov \u0000 plus. He was well skilled in geometry, \"not by speculation\" {377 } but by experience, could make organs, clocks, and chimes, in kerving, in Masonry, in silk weaving, or painting, and could make all i nstruments of music, etc., etc. All this c ountry had a great loss of Sir William, he was a good bell - founder and maker of frames.\" The same Register records in 1599 that \"Walter Hancox, free mason, was buried 16 September. This man was a very skilfull man in the art of Masonry.\" A Melrose MS. of 1581 alludes to \"Loses or Cowans,\" and contains a caution that \"he ought not to let you know ye privilege of ye compass, square, levell, and ye plum - rule.\" The Master Wincestre who gives the Charge as a Certificate to his freed Apprentice, was evidently an Englishman, as he dates it in the 12th year of t he reign of Queen Elizabeth.<<\"Ars Quat.

Rylands has c ontributed much inform ation, at various times, upon Masons \u0000 Marks, and amongst these we have those of Stone yhurst, 1585 ; Bidston old Hall, 1590 ; Bromborough Manor - house,etc. At Ayton Church, near Nantwich, is a monument of 21 April, 1596 , to Peter and Elizabeth Ashton; it has two shields of arm s, one containing a five - pointed star, and the other a square from which h angs a pair of compasses.<<\"Ibid,\" viii, p. 88.>> The reign of James I., 1603 - 25, is Masonically important. When h e came to this c ountry, he had at his own request, been accepted a Mason, by his Master Mason John Mylne, who was Deacon, or Master , of the Scoon and P erth {378 } Lodge. This is related in positive term s in the 1658 records of that Lodge, and the King accepted membership in it.<<A copy in \"Scottish Freemason,\" Au g. 1894 .>> He claimed to be a patron of the learned who designated him t he \"Scottish S olomon.\" A rising artist who had p rofessionally made the tour of Italy under the patronage of Thomas Earl of Pembroke, named Inigo Jones, was employed b y the King in 1607 to build a new banqueting hall at Whitehall, and Anderson asserts that at t his time many wealthy and learned men were received into the Craft. In 1649 he and Stone were e ngaged to repair St. Paul \u0000 s. Part of Wigan Church was rebuilt in 1620 , the Rector having a Charter from Richard III. as Lord of the Manor. It is the seat of irregular Lodges in recent times. In the reign of Charles I., 1625 - 49, whom Anderson claims as an Initiate, many erections were made under the superintendence of Inigo Jones, who died in 1652 aged 80 years. Anderson (1738 ) cites a MS. by Nicholas S tone which was burnt in 1720 , to shew that Jones \"remodelled the Lodges\" after the mann er of the \"Schools,\" or \"Academies of designers in Italy,\" of which we gave a specimen in the \"Cuchiari\" of Florence (ch. vi.); he is s aid to have held Quarterly Comm uni cations of the Masters and Wardens of Lodges, and Nicholas Stone was a Warden of these Assemblies. Possibly the system of the Guild which built St. Paul \u0000 s was the system \"remodelled\" by Jones. The Stone family was actively employed at t his time, and we re no doubt members of the Masonic Society. Nicholas was born in 1586 at Woodbury, near Exeter, and b uried at St. Martin \u0000 s - in - the - Fields in 1647 , and the records of the Masons \u0000 Company prove that he was a member of the Speculative Lodge there before 1639 ; he had several sons; it is recorded upon the monument of his s on Henry at Long - acre, that he \"spent the greater part of thirty - seven years in Holland, France, and Italy,\" and d ied in 1653 ; therefore he may have been known to Jehtudi Leon mentioned later; he also seems to have been {379 } a member of Masons \u0000 Company Lodge in 1649 . A somewhat interesting inscription appears on a tablet in the Chancel of Sidbury Church in Devonshire,<<\"The\" \"Critic,\" 15 June. 1861 .>> to the memory of John S tone, Free - Mason, w ho died 1 January, 1617 : -- \"On our great Corner - Stone, this Stone relied, For blessing to his building, loving most To build God \u0000 s temples, in works he died,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" And lived the temple of the Holy Ghost, In whom hard life is proved, and honest fame, God can of Stones raise seed to Abraham.\" Mackey quotes a sentence of 1607 : \"Yet all this form e of form less deity drewe by the square and compasse of our creed.\" In the year 1619 two books were printed in L ondon, one having the title, \"Keep within compasse\"; the other, \"Live within compasse.\" An old b lack - letter book on Bees, printed at London by H. B., 1608 , is dedicated \"To the Worshipful Master M. gentleman,\" and although the patron \u0000 s name and profession is not given it proves the use of a certain title at t hat date. In Speed \u0000 s \"Description of Britain,\" 1611 , we have some characteristic language of a Masonic c ast, worth reference: \"Applying myself wholly to this most goodley building, has as a poore labo urer, carried the carved stones and p olished pillars, from the hands of the more skilfull architects, to be set in their fit places, which I offer upon the altar of love to my country.\" Dating from 1620 , Bother Edward Conder, junr., has given us s ome va luable inform ation in regard to the Speculative Lodge of the London Company of Masons, which met, from time to time, in their own Hall, accepted Master Masons, and had a framed list of such, now unfortunately lost. The fees, 1622 , are thus recorded: \"As a gratuity to the Company, 1.Pounds 0s. 0d.; f or being made a Master, 3s. 4d.; f ee for entrance, 6d.\" The Company preserved \"the names of the Accepted Masons in a fair enclosed frame with a lock and k ey.\" The Inventory (of {380 } 1660 and 1675 ) mentions, \" one book of the Constitutions that Mr. ff lood gave.\" In 1629 - 33 the celebrated Dr. Fludd has various s ymbolic allusions to his wise brethren who are labouring as architects. The Lodge had also a set of 1481 laws for the governance of the Livery. In 1649 certain persons were admitted on the \"Livery,\" after \"Accepting Masonry,\" or in other words after Initiation and P assing as Masters. This proves that Anderson h ad grounds for expressing a belief that in form er times members of the Masons \u0000 Company had fir st to be admitted in a private Lodge; and also that Continental writers had slight grounds for their belief that Freemasonry arose at Masons \u0000 Hall. Brother J. Ross Robertson, P.G.M. of Canada, alludes to a boulder stone, with square and compasses, and t he date 1606 indented upon it, which was discovered in 1827 on the shore of Ann apolis Basin in Nova Scotia.<<\"Canadian Craftsman,\" xxvii, p. 206 .>> Brother Hosier m entions in the \"Bauhutte\" of 1889 that amongst the portraits of his ancestors is one of 162 4 of Jacob Hosier, which represents him decorated with Masonic emblems and using the Master \u0000 s s ign. In Derrykeighan, County Antrim, is a tombstone of Robert Kar, who died 1617 ; it appears to have Masonic application to family arm s; the top is a species of shield: Quarterly, 1st and 4 th, a sun, or star of eleven points; 2nd and 3 rd, a deer \u0000 s head upon which is a square. A Lodge at Berwick upon Tweed has an old arm chair of 1641 ,<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" Plate, iv.>> which may be described as a carved shield of a rm s; a chevron between various Masonic emblems; in the lower division a circular body, apparently an arm illiary sphere, and \"1641 \" above the chevron a pair of compasses and square, and reversed, back to back, with the others, square and compasses; in chief a scallop shell between two circular or floral emblems, with a raised p oint in the centre."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Of Comm onwealth times, 1649 - 60 there is nothing that need b e specifically named. Speculative Masons have no {381 } Lodge minutes of any antiquity in England, suc h as they have in S cotland, and though these are rather a puzzle to us than of serious v alue, our want of such is regrettable. Besides the paucity of the material to be found in such minutes, there is the fact of their dependence upon the Masters \u0000 Incorpo rations, and a doubt whether the rituals of Scotland and England were identical though n o doubt they had in ancient times been so. The Jews were readmitted in Cromwell \u0000 s time, and Catholic attacks in France alleged that he founded Masonry. In 1655 the Lo ndon Company dropped the title of \"Free,\" presumably because there e xisted independent Guilds of Free Masons, and Robt. Padgett who signed the MS. of 1686 , now in possession of Lodge \"Antiquity,\" was not a member of the Company. The Kilwinn ing records s hew between 1642 - 56 that the Lodge consisted of Fellow Crafts or Masters and Apprentices. Prentices on entering paid 20 s. and Fellow Crafts at Passing 40s. Scots, with 5s. additional for their Mark. This incidentally confirm s c ertain old Catechisms which make the Fellow Craft degree to consist of two parts -- the Master \u0000 s part being the second p ortion. Scotland certainly had, in some sort, two degrees in their Lodges, whilst the Chair and Work Masters were in the Incorporations and had their trials upon admission; opening and closing prayers, with oaths as in the English Companies. In n either company, at any time in their history, does the Society seem to have confined the Lodge receptions to o perative Masons, and certainly, in the 17th century, amateurs and gentlemen were accepted in both countries; in S cotland the non - operatives were term ed \"Geomatic\" and the operative \"Domatic\"; thus distinguishing Geometers and house builders. Nor can we form any other opinion of the Constitutions during a thousand y ears, when they tell us that it was a Society for all trades using Geometry, and we see Clerics as leading members. A Lodge was held at Newcastle, by deputation, on behalf of the Lodge of Mary \u0000 s Chapel, the 20th May, 1641 , under {382 } comm ission to Robert Mackey, General Quarterm aster of the Arm ies of Scotland, to receive Sir Robert Moray; amongst t hose present were General Hamilton and John Mylne. This latter family were Master Masons to the Kings of Scotland for m any g enerations, and for five they were members of the Lodge of Mary \u0000 s Chapel; the last of them was buried in S t. Paul \u0000 s Cathedral in 1811 , having been surveyor of that edifice for fifty y ears.<<Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Freem.\" i, p. 151 .>> In 1646 Elias Ashmole was made a Mason in a Lodge at Warringto n, and it is now ascertained that the majority of the members present were not operative Masons. Amongst the Sloane MSS . is a copy of the Masonic Charges, endorsed by Robert Sankey in 1646 ; the name is a place name, and that of an old Warrington family. The reign of Charles II. extended from 1660 - 85. Anderson asserts that he was made a Mason abroad d uring his exile, which is not improbable, and may have been traditional. In a proclamation of 1661 he advocates the building in brick and stone in place o f timber, for the safety and b eauty of London, the form er being equally cheap. Early last century the clerical enemies of Masonry in France attributed a Cromwellian use to Masonry, but on the other hand, and with more probability, there has existed a Maso nic belief that the Lodges were used b y the Stuarts to further the return of Charles II., and Brother Charles"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Purton Cooper, past P.G.M., has given us a note to the e ffect that \"G\" (Geusau 1741 ), who was acquainted with the Chevalier Ramsay and often conve rsed with h im on Masonry, had learned from him that the restoration was prepared by the Freemasons, and that General Monck b elonged to the Lodges.<<\"Freem.

Brother George E. Turner some short t ime ago bought from a widow a quantity of Masonic sc raps, amongst which are 27 p lates, apparently torn out of various books, and referring chiefly to the ancient gods and Mysteries. These he p rinted in 1896 at Blandford, and, from the mode in which they were acquired we give them with reserve. One of these is a readable \"set off,\" from an alleged work entitled: -- \"Treatise on Phremazeonry,\" with dedication to the Earl of St. Albans, 1670 . A fragment of printed matter on one of the plates, mentions a 12 mo. tome of 1539 entitled \"Solis Adoraio,\" which alludes to Phre - Mazonry, and says Lord Danby (died 1643 ), Sir Gil bert Gerherd (named in sister \u0000 s Will 1637 ), Sir John Brooke (created Baron Cobh am 1645 ), \"and many others; noted members of the Order,\" were of this opinion, whatever that may be. The Scottish Kirk was tainted with the narrow - mindedness of the times of the Comm onwealth, as is proved b y an attack upon one of their own Ministers: -- Extracted from the MS. records of the Presbytery of Jedburg, parish of Minto, by the Rev.

December 9th, 165 2, objection h aving been taken because he was a Freemason, and the neighbouring Presbytery consulted p revious to entering him on trial, the Presbytery of Kelso, 24th February, 1653 , shewed \u0000 that, to their judgement, there is neither sinn e nor scandal in th at Word, because in the purest tymes of this Kirke, Maisons having that Word have been, and are daylie in our sessions, and many professors having that Word are daylie admitted to the ordinances, \u0000 \" Two o ther r eferences, 1678 and 1691 , as to the nature of this Word, have recently come to light. The first is from the letters of the Rev. George Hickes, D.D., Dean of Worcester, amongst t he MSS . of the Duke of Portland. He says: -- \"The {384 } Lairds of Roslyn h ave been great Architects and P atrons of building for m any g enerations. They are obliged to receive the Masons Word, which is a secret signall Masons have throughout the world to know one another by.

It is like a Rabbinical Trad ition in way of comm ent on Jachin and Boaz, the two Pillars erected in S olomon \u0000 s temple (I.

The traditions of the ancient Masonic Guilds are not t o be altogether despised. The actual G uild of York is s aid to have claimed to date from A.D. 79 in the time o f Agricola, and there was a Carpenters \u0000 Guild which claimed to date from A.D. 626 . The form er built a Roman temple at that time, and the latter a church of wood on the model of the Tabernacle of Moses. Like the old operative Lodge of which the Duke of Ri chmond was Master which claimed to date from the time of Julius Caesar it would seem to have been the fashion of the Guilds to claim from some great ancient work, thus there was an operative Lodge {385 } at Berwick which claimed to date from the e rection of the great wall to keep out the Picts. The detached p rinted notices which we have of Free - Masonry in England during the reign of Charles II, shew that small Lodges were scattered over the country, independent of each other, but with a copy of the old Co nstitutions as its right of Assembly, and with a form al ceremony of reception. All Trades are admissable, and gentlemen affect their company. Here and there, as we might expect, one Lodge seems more faithful to the old traditions than another. It is evi dent t hat in the 17th century the Speculative, or Geomatic, element was becoming predominant, and that an attempt was made to retain the Society in its old groove, and to keep on foot the general Assembly. This is indicated in the e xistence of several Cop ies of the old MSS . which contain a Code headed \"New Regulations.\" It is quite probable that there was an earlier and a later form al adoption of this Code. Two o f these MSS ., the \"Harleian\" and \"Grand Lodge No. 2,\" have been printed in facsimile. Yet we have no record, either of the date of these, or the place where the Assembly was held. They are supposed to be e arly 17th century, but Anderson says that they were adopted, though it may be readopted with the addition of an article limiting the reception to persons of full age, at an Assembly held on the 27th December, 1663 , under the Earl of St. Albans. Critics admit that none of the e xisting MSS . are copied from each other and that there was an older copy not now extant. A version was printed b y J. Ro berts in 1722 . which states that the \"New Laws\" were adopted at a General Assembly held at (13 d ashes -- which may read \"the city of York \") on the 8th day of December 1663 . The New Laws, of this latest Charge, enact t hat in future the Craft shall be rule d b y \"one Master and Assembly,\" and that there shall be present a Master and Warden of the trade of operative Free - Masonry, and that certificates were to be given and {386 } required. The \"Grand Lodge, No. 2;\" \"Roberts; \"and the MSS . seen by Anderson cont ain a Clause which is not in the \"Harleian MS.,\" t hat no o ne shall be accepted if under 21 years of age; possibly this indicates the 1663 revision of an older form . Attached to these \"New Regulations\" is, for the first time, a separate Apprentice Charge, which closes with an oath of Secrecy, and indicates that Apprentices and Fellows had a ceremony of reception. A York origin for this form m ay be thought to be indicated b y the fact that most of the Copies in which the Apprentice Charge appears are found i n the North of England; the form was used at Bradford and elsewhere 1680 - 93; at Alnwick"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"1701 ; and is minuted in 1725 at Swalwell. Brother Conder, however, considers that it originated with the London Company of Masons. There are no minutes now preserve d at York of the 16th and 17 th centuries, but there are other proofs that Assemblies c ontinued to be held. There is a copy of the Charges which was discovered at t he demolition of Pontefract Castle, where persons s ent their documents for safety during the civil wars; it is s upposed to date about the year 1600 , and contains: -- \"An ann agraime upon the name of Masonrie: Willm.

A Copy of the Charges, written by himself, is No. 2054 of the Harleian MSS ., which contains the ordinary inform ati on and two fragments: -- \"There is severall words and signes of a free Mason to be reveiled to you, which as you will answer before God at the great and terrible day of judgement you keep secret, and not to revaile the same in the heares of any person, or to any but the Masters and Fellows of the said Society of free Masons, so helpe me God.\" The second fragment is a list of fees, and no doubt a Lodge list, beginn ing: -- \"William Wade wt. give for to be a Free Mason,\" twenty - five names follow paying sums f rom 5s. to 20s. Brother W. R. Rylands has s hewn that it was a Speculative Lodge, embracing many who did not follow operative Masonry. In h is \"Academie of Arm orie,\" 1688 , Randle Holme, a member of above Lodge, says: -- \"I cann ot but honour the Fellowship of the Masons because of its antiquity; and the more as being a member of that Society called Free Masons.

York); Henry Fresall, gentleman; Robert Trollop; Henry Trollop; and others, Masons, Carvers, Stone - cutters, a nd various trades mentioned therein. It would seem to represent an ordinary Masters \u0000 Incorporated Lodge of the time. They were to assemble yearly on S t.

The \"Bow - Makers Guild\" included \"Bow Carpenters,\" who had the construction of the wooden centres to build Arches.

They reckoned seven degrees as in the Cr aft, but where the latter held, as s ymbols three straight rods to form a \"square,\" the Arch - i - tectus, of whom there were three, had curved rods with which to form a \"circle.\" They, only, used compasses and employed themselves in curved, and in Assemblies they sat in circular and not in square fashion.

Both an \"Arch\" and \"Square\" Guild existed at St. Paul \u0000 s in 1675 and minutes h ave been preserved with extreme care. Its c eremonies are known to the writer and it sent a branch into Derbyshire to build Chatsworth, though in the jurisdiction of York. Some 30 or 40 years ago, an Assembly of about 400 could be e xpected ann ually and it is not yet extinct. The St. Paul \u0000 s Guild was quite independent of the Masons Company which in 1677 obtained a Charter from the King. One of their Initiates is now at Assuan, and affirm s that an ancient Jewish Guild exists there, and that they practise S olomonian ceremonies with exactly the same rites as he received in 1866 - 76. They have a plan of a q uarry, of three rooms through which the stone is perfected, and near thereto are other three for the officers, and a \"site\" for the building. Egypt has a \" Slant Masons Guild\" unknown h ere. A properly constructed Lodge room in these several offices or yards would have double folding doors, form ing a porch to each, where the preparation takes place. Solomon \u0000 s temple is s aid to have had only a single door i n the East. The 1st Officer sits in the West, the 2nd in the East, and the 3rd in the North; and this applies to all the six sections; in the Modern Freemasonry of 1717 they sit East, South, and West, or with their backs to their assigned duties. Their c arpet has s quares of one {392 } cubit and the border is a lozenge 8 x 6 inches, a figure which includes the 3 - 4 - 5 angle four times repeated. All Stones are sent from the Quarry to the 1st yard and d ressed 1 /16th larger than required; in the 2nd yard they are trued to their required size; and in the 3rd are marked and fitted for the site. The 5th, 6th, 7th Offices are Overseers. Now as to the ceremony continued to o ur own day; the Candidate passes through the same process, and as a \"living stone,\" is f irst taken as a boy rough dressed, then polished, and advanced. Ist Degree \"Apprentice,\" received b y a ceremony similar to the Ist Degree in Speculative Freemasonry. Three officers are sent out to prepare him in the Porch. He bathes as in the ancient Mysteries, is refreshed with food, clothed in the white Roman Cloak, examined b y the doctor, and finally admitted on the report of the three officers s ent out. He remains a brother 7 years, but is not a Free - Mason as in the speculative system. 2nd Degr ee \"Fellow,\" at about 21 years of age the Brother applies to be relieved of his Bond; is accepted as a square Fellow by a ceremony similar to the 2nd Degree of modern Freemasonry. 3rd Degree \"Super - Fellow,\" after 12 months is \"Marked\" as a \"living stone ,\" and sent to the \"site.\" He is instructed in marking and fitting the actual stone. 4th Degree \"Super - Fellow, Erector,\" knowing the system of Marking he knows how to join the stones and is himself erected in that position. If it has any conn ection wi th Modern Masonry it is the 1st part of 3rd Degree. The two sections, however, are found in the degree of Mark Man and Master. 5th Degree \"Superintendent.\" These represent t he 3,300 Menatzchim of Solomon.

The ceremony of reception is of a most solemn character, and cann ot be given publicly. 7th Degree \"Grand Master.\" There are three of these, co - equal, received in private. The degree has no analogy in Modern Freemasonry, except in the three Principals of a Royal Arch Chapter, which seems to have restored a portion of the old Guild ceremonial. \"Ann ual Comm emorations,\" given 2nd and 30 th October. (1) Laying Foundation and fixing the centre by 3, 4, 5, and b y the 5 P oints; there is a portion referring to the 2nd temple which h as originated the Modern Royal Arch degree. (2) A tragedy, and Solomon appoints Adoniram the 3rd G.M.M.; the 2nd p art of the Modern 3rd Degree is taken from this. (3) The Dedication. There is a symbolical sacrif ice in the 1st or Foundation. These Rites s hould b e perform ed b y the Grand Master, acting in the 6th Degree and transferred to the site of the Temple or 4th Degree. -- All these comm emorative ceremonies are Semitic, the rest might equally appertain to an y nation. When first I heard of these ceremonies in 1856 the Guild could number 400 members at the ann ual Drama. There is a curious analogy between the seven \"degrees\" of the Guild and the seven \"ranks\" of the London Company of Masons, which h ad a Char ter of Incorporation, granted, in 1677 , with a 7 mile radius: Conder gives these ranks as follows (p. 139 ): -- (1) Apprentice, bound for 7 years to a member, and p aid 2s 6d; (2) Freedom or Yeomandry; (3) the Livery or r obes; (4) the Court of Assistants; (5 ) Renter Warden; (6) Upper Warden; (7) Master in the Chair; these would have to be sworn though n o ceremony is mentioned. They had however the Guild Society \u0000 s branch, and Conder considers that t hey were term ed \"Accepted,\" because they were received as ama teurs to qualify them for acceptance into the Livery of the Company. The Guild Masons s ay that before the advent of Modern Freemasonry they had four Head Guild Houses {394 } w hich ruled d ifferent parts of the country and are those given by Anderson. As I read Anderson, who wrote in 1738 , guided b y what we actually know before 1738 , he can only mean that when, in 1716 , Anthony Sayer was elected Grand Master, by \"some old b rothers,\" he had one or m ore of some, or of all these Guilds, or is s upposed to have had them. It seems an attempt t o hoodwink the reader. No. 1, the Antiquity, certainly continued to meet for some years at the Goose and Gridiron, the House of St. Paul \u0000 s Guild, but Modern Nos. 2, 3 and 4 , seem never to have \"met\" at the other three Guil d houses. The reign of James II., 1685 - 8, was too short to leave its influence upon Free - Masonry but much of importance must have occurred in that of William III., 1689 - 1702 , had the particulars been preserved. We do not doubt that 16 May 1691 is the a ctual date of the Initiation of Sir C. Wren as an Accepted Mason; even though a Master of the Arch Guild 1649 ; and with the Convention of St. Paul \u0000 s it may be conjectured that the conn ection of the Accepted Masons with the Livery Company ceased to exist, i f any existed, which the Arch Guilds deny. The notorious Prichard, who wrote in 1730 makes 1691 to be the actual beginn ing of the \"Quarterly Comm unications,\" which ended in the form ation of the Grand Lodge of 1717 b y the dissidents who had b een members of a real Guild. Dr Anderson in h is Constitutions (1738 ) writes that a Lodge met at St. Thomas \u0000 Hospital in 1691 at the instance of Sir Thomas Clayton; and, on the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"authority of \"some brothers living in 1730 \" t hat six o ther Lodges then assembled in London; and b esides the old Lodge of St. Paul \u0000 s (whose bastard offspring, according to the Guild, was the Lodge of Antiquity), which possesses a copy of the Masonic Charges written by \"Robert Padgett, Clearke to the Worshipful Society of Free - Masons for the City of London,\" he mentions one in Piccadilly opposite St. James \u0000 Church; one near Westminster Abbey, which may be represented in a printed catechism of {395 } 1723 alluding to the \"Lodge of St. Stephens\"; one in Covent Garden; one in Holborn; another on Tower Hill ; and some others that assembled at stated times, these were probably no more than meetings at Inn s frequented b y Masons. No doubt t he great fire of London, and the e fforts of Sir C. Wren in restoring the city after that calamity, would attract people from all parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and lead to the Assemblies of Masons. In the North there is a copy of the old MSS . at York, of 1680 , which concludes \"that at every meeting or Assembly they pray heartily for all Christians.\" Another c opy of 1693 , includes the Apprentice Charge, and has a peculiar reading which is doubtless ill translated Latin, it reads, -- \"Then one of the Elders takeing the Booke, and that hee or \"shee\" that is to be made Mason, shall l ay their hands thereon, and the Charge shall be given.\" It concludes, -- \"These be the constitucions of the Noble and famous History, called Masonry, made and now in practise by the best Masters and Fellowes, for directing and guiding all that use the said Craft.

The names of the Lodg, -- William Simpson, Anthony Horsman, Christopher Thompson, Christopher Gill , Mr. Isaac Brent, Lodg. Ward.\" The Duke of Richmond seems to have been Master of a Lodge at Chichester in 1696 . The Minutes of Grand Lodge of 2 March 1732 contain an entry that Edward Hall was \"Made a Mason by the late Duke of Richmond six and thirty years ago.\" Hall \u0000 s petition was recomm ended by the Duke \u0000 s s on, who was then Grand Master, and the Chichester Lodge was registered b y Grand Lodge as dating from the time of Julius Caesar.<<\"Freemasonry in Havant.\" -- Thos. Francis. 1892 .>> A Lodge met at Alnwick, Northumberland, in 1701 ; it was a n operative Craft Lodge, and may have kept more {396 } closely to o ld customs from its nearness to Scotland, where the ceremonial work was practically extinct though the legal basis of Masonic Guilds was s till i n force. We give two o f the regulations of 17 01 in regard to Entering Apprentices, and Accepting Fellows,, -- \"5th item. That no Mason shall take an Apprentice and give him his Charge within one whole year after. Not so doing the Master shall pay for any such offence 0Pounds 3 4 .\" \" 9th item. Ther e shall noe Apprentice, after he has s erved his seven years, be admitted or Accepted b ut on the Feast of Michaell the Archangel, paying to the Master and Wardens 0Pounds 6 8 .\" A minute of 21 January 1708 , decrees, \"that for the future no Master, Warden, o r Fellow shall appear on S t. John \u0000 s day, or attend the church service at Alnwick, without his apron, and comm on square fixt in the belt thereof.\" We must carefully g uard ourselves from the supposition that these (Passed) Wardens and Masters, are those n ow term ed such; they were the Menatzchim and Harods, or Superintendents and P assed Masters of the old Guild ceremonies. In the County of Durham up to 1813 , Wardens, as well as other"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"officers, took the same O.B. as the Master. The Guilds O.B. the Master i n the 6th Degree and the Minor officers in the 5th Degree Lodge. A similar operative Lodge e xisted in Durham, and is s upposed to have been first established at Winlaton circa 1690 , by a Germ an iron Master, which art had b een established at Solingen from early centuries, from Damascus, thence it removed to Swalwell i n 1725 . This last date is later than the period with which we intended to close this Chapter, but as it is c onsidered to date from 1690 , and as its Lodge customs were similar to those at Alnw ick, and were maintained to the last unaltered, it is not inappropriate here. Its regulations are minuted in 1725 . The \"Penal Laws,\" t hat when a youth was taken as Apprentice by a member of the Lodge, his Master was required to \"Enter\" him within 40 d ays , in contrast to the one year at Alnwick, and a small fee was charged. {397 } The form by which the Apprentice was \"Entered\" is given in the Minute Book, and is an abridgement of the history g iven in our Charge. Of course the Apprentice Charges, known to date between 1600 - 63, are those he would b e sworn to keep. Nothing is s aid about Secrets, but the 8th Penal Laws imposes a fine of 10 P ounds, \"not faithfully to keep the 3 fraternal signs, and all points of fellowship.\" When the Apprenticeship expired th e youth was made free of his Craft by the full ceremony. On the 21 March 1735 the Lodge went under the Grand Lodge of London, but retained its old customs intact for over 30 years afterwards. But we now read of two Masters \u0000 grades, the one term ed Harodim , spelled in the minutes Highrodiam, given in a \"Grand Lodge,\" and the other term ed \"English Master,\" and the presumption is v ery strong, and especially as a mutual recognition of fees are made, that Harodim was their old Passed Master \u0000 s Ceremony, but we s hall again refer to the nature of these Rites in our next Chapter, as operative Masons. There was also an independent Lodge at Hexham, but nothing is known of its history. In the Minute Book of the Haughfoot Lodge, Scotland, there is an entry under dat e 22 Decr. 1701 , after a missing leaf, which clearly alludes to Fellow Craft work, as it says, -- \"Of entrie as the Apprentice did leaving out the comm on Juge (Gudge? Luge); they then whisper the word as before, and the Master Mason grips his hand after th e ordinary way.\" As we understand it, the \"comm on,\" or Apprentice part, who is a rough dresser, was omitted from the ceremony, and the Fellowcraft word was given in a mann er similar to the form er degree. But the Scottish system seems to have been so loos e that very little reliance can be placed upon what we meet with in their m inutes, as a general custom, and it would appear that, at times, Apprentices were present when a higher ceremony was c onferred, and that the signs, tokens, and words, were comm unica ted p rivately, whispered, shewn in the Bible, or given in a separate room. The regulations {398 } of the old Dumfries Lodge, 20th May, 1687 , enact that on Entering Apprentices a fee of 10 P ounds Scots had to be paid, and when afterwards passed as Fellow Cr aft a fee of 5 P ounds Scots, in each case besides gloves and entertainment. (A Scots Pound is 1 shilling.) If Professor Robison is c orrect in h is c onclusions as to the operative Masonry of Germ any, and he seems to have carefully studied the subject, th e instruction and therefore the ceremonies v aried in that country. . He says that there were \"Wort Maurers,\" and \"Schrift Maurers;\" and that there were Borough Laws enjoining the Masters to give e mployment to Journeymen who had the proper words and signs; that some Cities had more.extensive privileges in this respect than others; that the Word given at Wetzler entitled the possessor to"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"work over the whole e mpire; and that we may infer from some Municipal decisions that the Master gave a Word and Token, for each year \u0000 s progress of the Apprentice, the Word of the City upon which h e depended, and another by which all his pupils recognised each other. The Word and Token were abolished in 1731 in favour of the Script Masons. At Halberstadt there is a copy of t he Germ an S tatutes of 2 December 1713 , from which we gather that there were still four Overm asters at Koln, Strasburg, Wien, and Zurich. These are designated Old - Masters, as distinct from the Old - Fellows who governed the Craft. The first were a Chief or Arch - fraternity, the second were Masters of Lodges. A Master who made his Apprentice Free of the Craft had to bind him to keep the Word concealed in h is heart, under the pain of his s oul \u0000 s s alvation. There is an old Arm chair at Lincoln of the date of 1681 .<<\"Ars. Quat. Cor,\" v, -- Plate.>> In a semi - circular top is c arved a hand holding a balance in equilibrium, and under it PIER I -- 1681 -- POYNT. Below this are two stalks with leaves, each bearing what appears to be a passion - flower. Beneath are two p anels, one of which contains the double triangles, {399 } and the plumb - rule; the other panel has the square and compasses. A member of the family deems the chair to have belonged to William, 4th Earl of Kingston, Lord Chief Justice in Eyre beyond Trent. In the grave - yard of Slane Castle, Ireland, there is a tomb - stone to John Frow, who died in 1687 , in the upper arc are compasses, Greek cross, and square. The \"Freemasons \u0000 Chronicle\" (2 March 1909 ) says that in the Leicester Corporation Museum there is an old chair which, 250 years ago, belonged to a Free Masons \u0000 Guild which met at the White Lion down to 1790 . Upon the back is a design to mark a square building and the letter B, and it is thought there may have been another with J. A second chair is s aid to have belonged the Arch Guild. Until very recent times our knowledge of what transpired in Ireland has been almost nil, but Brother Chetwode Crawley has recently shown that in 1688 a Lodge of Free - masons, \"consisting of gentlemen, mechanics, porters, parsons, ragmen, divines, tinkers, f reshmen, doctors, butchers, and tailors,\" t hus heterogeneously denominated, in the 1688 Tripos of John Jones, as c onn ected with the University of Dublin. It is further m entioned b y Jones that a collection was made for a new brother, \"who received from Sir Warren, being Free - Masonised this new w ay, five shillings.\" This new w ay may mean by some new regulation, or simply in reference to the collection,<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" 1898 , p. 192 ; also Oli ver \u0000 s \"Rev. of a Square.\">> but that was old Guild custom. The tomb of John Abell of Sarsfield, Herts, 1694 , has a representation of himself and his two wives; between a circular hoop at the bottom is a square, and above that a plumb, over which is a pair of compasses. It is s a id<<\"Voice of Masonry.\" 1887 .>> that one John Moore settled in S outh Carolina in 1680 from England, thence removed to Philadelphia, and in a letter which h e writes in 1715 , he speaks of having \"spent a few evenings in festivity with my Masonic brethren.\" The celebrated Jonathan {400 } Belcher, Governor of Massachusetts, was made a Mason in the year 1704 , for he writes to a Boston Lodge, in 1741 , \"It is now thirty - seven years s ince I was admitted in the Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Mas ons.\" There is a record at Newport, U.S.A., \"That ye day and d ate (1686 or 1688 ) We mett at ye House of Mordecai Campunall and after synagog We gave Abm. Moses the degrees of Masonrie.\" If this took p lace it would b e Operative Masonry, and I see no reaso n to express a doubt."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" We have alluded in the foregoing, and shall again, to Scottish customs, the more fully because there are traces, to be read b etween the lines, that t he Advent of the Stuarts, and later introductions of Scottish Masons into the Sout h, was instrumental in somewhat modifying the Free - masonry of London, and that what is taken for English is s ometimes Scottish. Yorkshire is notably rich in the old Charges, as besides those which form erly belonged to the York Grand Lodge, and are in po ssession of a modern Lodge there, there are others in private hands, and in the \"West Yorkshire, Masonic Library.\" It is s tated in a Manifesto o f the Lodge of Antiquity (1778 ) that there was one old MS. in the hands of Mr. Wilson, of Broomhead, near Sh eff ield, written in the reign of Henry VIII., which is now missing, and there appears to have been one dated 1560 . The Lodge of Hope, Bradford, has a copy of circa 1680 . It form s no part of our plan to give an account of these old MSS ., but students of them are greatly indebted to the late Brother Thomas W. Tew, P.G.M. of the West Riding, who had eight of these, in possession of his Provincial Library, printed and d istributed at his s ole cost. Amongst them are the \"Thomes W. Tew MS.\" circa 1680 ; the \"Waiste ll MS.,\" circa 1693 ; and the \"Clapham MS.,\" circa 1700 . The Rolls in possession of the Lodge at York have also been printed b y subscription; one of these, dated 1704 , is headed with the same Anagram on \"Masonrie\" as that of 1600 , but addressed b y Robert { 401 } Preston to Daniel Moult. It also appears in a Newcastle Roll, addressed b y Richard Stead to his friend Joseph Claughton. There are other documents at York, but none older than the reign of Ann e, 1702 - 14. It seems that George Benson was President in 1705 , and that he was followed b y other gentlemen at each ann ual election. We learn also from an old copy of the Charges which h as passed into the possession of the Grand Lodge of Canada, that a \"Private Lodge\" was held at Scarborough, Yorkshire, 10th July, 1705 , with Wm. Thompson, Esq., as President, when six members were received whose names will be found in the facsimiles executed for the West Yorkshire Masons. Last century the Grand Lodge of All England at York had minutes from the year 1704 , but t hey are not now to be found, they have, however, at the York Lodge some later parchment Rolls, which to some e xtent take the place of minutes. The probability is that such inform ation as we have prior to 1726 b elongs to the Operative Guild. On the 19th March, 1712 , we read that several members were \"sworne and admitted into the honourable Society and fraternity of free Masons by George Bowes, Esq., Deputy President.\" In 1713 the Ancient Lodge held a meeting at Bradford, \"when 18 gentlemen of the first families were made Free - Masons.\" Meetings were held each succeeding y ear at York, those on S t. John the Baptist \u0000 s Day, in June, being term ed a \"General Lodge on S t. John \u0000 s Day,\" whilst the others are designated \"Private Lodges.\" This was four years before any movement was made in London, and the meetings at Scarborough and at Bradford are in agreement with the ancient Constitutions which state that the Masons were to hold an Assembly \"in what place they would\"; and it seems very apparent that where the ter m \"General Lodge\" is used, as distinct from a \"Private Lodge,\" it is the tradition of the ancient Assembly continued. {402 } Again in 1716 it is minuted on this parchment roll as follows: -- \"At St. John \u0000 s Lodge in Christmas, 1716 . At the house of Mr. James Boreham, situate Stone - gate in York, being a general Lodge held then by the Honoble. Society and Company of Free - Masons in the City of York, John Turner, Esqre., was"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"sworne and admitted into the Said Honoble. Society and Fraternity of Free - Masons.\" \"Charles Fairfax, Esqre., Dep. President.\" Lists of the Grand Masters are found in any Modern Masonic Cyclopaedia, but Brother Whitehead recently discovered in an old Arm orial MS. that t he name of Sir Wm. Milner, Bart., 1728 , has been omitted, \"being the 798 th S uccessor from Edwin the Great,\" apparently claiming an ann ual election of Grand Masters from the year 930 . However m uch we may regret it, yet we cann ot blame the York Brothers for the strict respect shewn to the obligations. In such written doc uments as we have the term s used are simply well known Guild term s. We can draw no inference on such slight grounds as to the nature of their ceremonies, we do not know from contemporary documents what they were, and we have no right to expect that we sho uld k now. We can only judge of them by what they were when publicity began to be given to Masonic Rites in the 18th century. We have not the least warrant for thinking that, on the one hand, they took up new inventions and p almed them off as old Rites, n or on the other hand can we hope that they were very much better than the Grand Lodge of London, and shut their eyes to all i mprovement of the Ritual; they would b e guided in this by old tradition and landmarks. We note that in the facsimile of the \"Stanl ey MS.,\" 1677 , it is c losed with the tail - piece of a chequered p avement. The \"Tatler\" for 9 June 1709 , has an article upon a class of Londoners term ed \"Pretty Fellows\"; the paper is believed to be by Sir Richard Steele, and alludes to matters with which he seems to be acquainted, for he says: \"they have signs and words like Free - Masons,\" and a similar r eference is found in the same journal for 1710 . There is {403 } no record of Steele being a Mason, but there evidently was an impression that such was the case, f or Picart, in h is \"Ceremonies and Costumes,\" gives a medallion portrait of \"Sir Richard Steele,\" on a screen which gives a copy of the e ngraved list of Lodges in 1735 . As illustrating the state of things in S cotland at this date we may instance a dispute which occurred with the Mary \u0000 s Chapel Lodge in 1707 . A portion of these withdrew and established without perm ission the Lodge \"Journeymen.\" Lodge Mary \u0000 s Chapel objected to their m eeting to take fees and give the \"Mason \u0000 s Word,\" and the dispute ran on for some years. The Masters \u0000 Incorporation was the legal head of such bodies, and the Journeymen obtained leave to sue Mary \u0000 s Chapel for such Masonic rights as the latter possessed. The Incorporation agreed in 1715 that the Journeymen should have an \"Act of Allowance\" to give the Mason \u0000 s Word. From this c ircumstance Bro. R. F. Gould is inclined to think that t he custodians of this privilege were the Incorporations, and that this c ase is the old survival of a claim that the private Lodges were Agen cies or Deputations of the Incorporations for that purpose. It is a reasonable and just conclusion, and however loose the Lodges may have been in their working, we may feel sure that t he Incorporations were Custodians of ritualistic Catechisms, probably o f a Christian n ature, of all known grades in Masonry, whether the same were conferred or had lapsed. Brother Clement E. Stretton, who is eminent as a writer of books on h is own line as a C.E., has s tated in the journals of the day and confirm ed to me by letters that Dr. James Anderson was made chaplain of the St. Paul \u0000 s Guild in 1710 , in succession to Dr. Compton, who had b een in the habit of holding a daily service. In S eptember, 1714 , Anderson proposed that men of position should b e admitted to a spec ies of honorary membership, which was c arried b y one vote, and the accounts, in that and the following y ear, show seven fees of 5"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"guineas each. All the time St. Paul \u0000 s work was in operation the Guilds met {404 } at High XII. on a Saturday, but Anderson cha nged the period of meeting to 7 o \u0000 clock on a Wednesday evening, at t he Goose and Gridiron, and in September, 1715 , the Operatives found that t heir old p ass would not admit them, and they complained to Wren and Strong and the dissidents were struck off the Rolls; and this is probably why Anderson complained that Wren \"neglected the Lodges.\" Now, under such circumstances, no honourable man can say that Anderson acted a creditable part. But we can see what he actually \"digested.\" He made the Apprentice in a month, in place of seven years, struck out everything techn ical, including the ceremonies of conferring the Mark Mason; and left a fine moral institution on the lines of the Mystic Societies of the Ancients, but it is not Free Masonry, but an imitation of it; he retained as much of the Old Rites as s uited his purpose, and could b e worked into the modern system, but it lacked the e xplanation the Guild Rites afforded. In the Stanley MS. of 1697 , facsimiled for the West Yorkshire P.G. Lodge, there is a pec uliar addition which is of later date. A very precise investigation of the allusions therein was made by Brother Gould in 1888 , and he has c ome to the conclusion that the lines are applicable to 1714 . It is s upposed to have been a North Country MS., and we give the e ndorsement: -- \"The prophecy of Brother Roger Bacon, Disciple of Balaam, Wch Hee Writt on ye N.E. Square of ye Pyramids of Egypt In capital, Letters. \"When a Martyr \u0000 s Grand Daughter In ye Throne of Grea t Brittain, [Mary.] Makes Capet \u0000 s Proud Son look you \u0000 d think him beshitten, [Louis XIV.] When ye Medway and Mais Piss together In a Quill, [Kent and Holland.] And Tagus and Rhine of ye Seine have their will, [Germ anic Co nfedn.] When ye Thames has ye Tay taen for better, for worse, [Act of Union, 1707 .] {406 } An \u0000 to purchase ye Doxy has well drained his purse, [Scotland.] When by roasting a Priest ye Church h as her wishes, [Dr. Sacheverell.] Loyal Tory \u0000 s in places, Whiggs s ilent as fishes, [Ann e \u0000 s reign.] When Europe grows Quiet and a man yts right wily, [Peace of Utrecht, 1713 .] Setts up a wood b ridge from ye Land \u0000 s End to Chili, [South - sea.

It is evident that York was more a dvanced than London in the practice of a system of Speculative Freemasonry, because it had a more close operative derivation and was less reduced, and whether the lines above given originated North or South, they indicate the views of some old operative Br other, who saw changes which did not please him. Brother Edward Conder has recently shewn that Viscount Doneraile must have held a Lodge at his mansion, Cork, about the year 1710 . At one of these Assemblies s ome repairs were in progress in the library when h is daughter Elizabeth secreted herself to watch the ceremonies, but was detected and forced to undergo the Rites of Making and P assing.

Crawley, LL.D., has gone also into this matter in \"Coementaria Hibernica,\" and expresses his opinion that similar Lodges may have e xisted at t he Eagle Tavern under Lord Rosse, and at Mitchelstown under Lord Kingstown. T here is an Irish MS. amongst the Molyneux papers endorsed \"Feb., 1711 ,\" which clearly indicates a 3 - Degree system, and is headed with a {symbol: This is like an elongated \"H\" with a vertical line down to the center of the cross bar. Above, across the vert ical line, are two horizontal cross lines, upper shorter and just below top.} All the serious works which refer, in print, to the Society of Free - Masons make no question of its antiquity, {406 } either during the 17th century or after it had p assed into an entirely Speculative System. The \"Antiquities of Berkskire\" by Elias Ashmole (London 1719 ) has a paragraph which includes the inform ation given by Plot and Au brey that we have before referred to; and we add some interesting particulars from the letters of Dr. Thomas Knipe, who flourished b etween 1660 and 1711 , in which year he died, and which were used b y the compilers of Ashmole \u0000 s Biography in 1748 . This writer repeats the statement in regard to the Papal Bull of the time of Henry III., and goes on to say: \"But this Bull, in the opinion of the learned Mr. Ashmole, was c onfirm ative only and d id not by any means c reate our fraternity, nor even to establish them in this kingdom.\" He then proceeds to give an account of the statements gathered from the old Charges from St. Alban to the ratification of the Constitution by Henry VI., and closes with a statement that in the Civil Wars the Free - Masons were generally Yorkists, and abuses Plot for his injurious comm ents.<<\"The Kneph;\" Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Freem.,\" etc. >> In S cotland techn ically it would seem that a Scottish Master was Work Master of the Domatic Lodge, and the Chair Master of the Geomatic Lodge, but who had to be e xamined and P assed as a Master; for it is to be presumed that non - operatives might be ri tualistically dispensed from the 7 years \u0000 probation required for a Fellow of Craft. Melrose had a very old Lodge which kept to the ancient system until a few years ago, when it joined Grand Lodge. There is a Melrose minute of 1764 of which an unwise use is made; it enacts that the Apprentice and Fellow Craft ceremonies -- for that is what is meant -- shall be \"administered in a simple way and mann er free of anything sinful and superstitious,\" at t his date it had two degrees and the Praeses was Master Maso n. It only proves the presence of a puritanical spirit in the Lodge. That there was a Fellow Craft degree in S cotland worked in Lodges is proved b y the Charge of St. Mary \u0000 s, Edinburgh, against the Journeymen in 1713 {407 } that they \"presumed at their own hand to enter Apprentices and P ass Fellow Crafts in a public c hange house.\" From the middle of the 17th century the Scottish minute books s how numerous admissions of military men, and of Lairds who are designated b y their lands. The Kelso Lodge, to wh ich S ir John Pringle \u0000 s name appears in 1701 , in 1705 imposes a fine for absence upon \"Cornet Drumm ond and Lovetenant Benett.\" The Haughfoot Lodge, opened in 1702 b y John Pringle of Torsonce, leave us in n o doubt that it then conferred and \"Passed\" Apprent ice and Fellow Craft, the Master Mason occupying the chair. Sometimes both degrees were given at one meeting, at others after an interval. The ann ual meeting was held for business, and a \"Comm ission\" given each year to 5"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"members to Initiate others. The Lodge at Aberdeen h ad two classes, Geomatic and Domatic Masons, and the admissions differently worded for each. The Master was Geomatic, and the Senior Warden Domatic, and this latter class had to make a trial - piece for each degree. \"Old Catechisms.\" The most important question with Freemasons will be by what sort of Rites were these 17th century Masons received into the Brotherhood? and the answer m ust depend on the nature of the Lodge which acted. It does not seem very difficult t o form an approxima te idea of this. There are various old Catechisms which, though of doubtful authority, and not wholly written in this c entury, but yet are clearly of it, and moreover are in general unison with the reduced 16 th and 17 th century Constitutional Charges. Th ere is one copy of these Catechisms which the late Rev. Bro. A. F. A. Woodford, who further quotes c ompetent authority, considers from its archaisms to date 1650 if not earlier, and there are versions of 1723 , 1724 , 1729 , 1730 and onwards. A copy was prin ted in the \"Scots \u0000 Magazine\" of 1755 , and is s aid to reveal an actual reception at Dundee in 1727 . Although the general {408 } character of these Catechisms are similar they differ in detail, but the Dundee specimen is in close agreement with the one that Brother Woodford has attributed to 1650 , or earlier, and which is found amongst t he Sloane MSS ., and has been printed b y him; it raises the question whether it is not actually a Scottish version brought South. All these documents besides the recognition of some Apprentice ceremony, of an operative appearance, divide the Fellow \u0000 s part into two portions; \"first\" t he Catechism of that degree which we now term Fellow - craft, and \"second\" the degree now term ed Master, and this last clearly defined in every cop y that we have, and quite as c learly in the \"Sloane MS.\" as any other. They are all a debased version of the original system prevailing when it took some years to become an operative Fellow or Master. Equally some sort of mark or ceremony is in evidence. In S cottish Lodges s uch a system m ight arise from a desire to continue to confer a Master \u0000 s degree after the actual Masters had Incorporated, and in parts of England where the Fraternity ceased to be practical, from a desire to shorten the reception of F ellow and Master; in other words, to make an amateur into an Apprentice, Fellow, and Master in one e vening; in any case all give 5 p oints of Fellowship as applicable to Craftsmen, but in the ancient Guilds they had a techn ical reference. Sometimes a Pas sed Apprentice would appear to mean a Fellow, and a Passed Fellow a Master, so loose is the wording. In all cases, however, the Catechisms give certain secrets of the modern 3rd Degree, from which we may justly infer that they had k nowledge of a certain a nn ual Rite, or drama, and that if it should have passed out of practice it was owing to the changed position of the Lodge. Precisely the same thing has occurred amongst t he Guilds c laiming mediaeval descent, of which many y et exist, and P assed Masters hav e to be called in from a distance; one of the most expert workers is a York Mason. {409 } It is unn ecessary to particularise much of these Catechisms, but in our chapter viii. we advocated on the e vidence to be obtained from the Saxon Charge, old operati ves, and the usages of Societies s imilarly constituted, that the most ancient form of recognition was a \"Salutation,\" and this is found in every Catechism that has c ome down to us, until i t was expunged in 1813 . If this is c orrect the most ancient Masons were \"Salute Masons,\" the Freemasons"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"were Hebrew \"Word Masons\"; no doubt when this union took p lace, whether in the 13th century or any other date, it would b e followed from time to time with revisions, to correct inaccurate oral transmission. The \"Saluta tion\" varies in these old MSS ., but the following from the \"Sloane,\" and the printed 1723 , are given as s pecimens; those of Germ any were more e laborate as they contained seven prayers or \"Words\": -- \"The Right Worshipful, the Masters and Fellows, in that W orshipful Lodge from whence we last come, Greet you, Greet you, Greet you well.\" The Warden replies: \"God \u0000 s Greeting be at this meeting, and with the Right Worshipful the Master, and the Worshipful Fellows who keeps the keys of the Lodge from whence you c ome, and you also are welcome, Worshipful Brother, into this Worshipful Society.\" In the \"Sloane MS.\" there is found \"a Jerusalem word,\" Giblin, as well as a two - syllabled word, Maharhyn, and d oubts thrown on a sign, said to be given in France and Turke y, which may be considered in relation, to what was s aid at the opening of chapter ix. The Catechism of 1723 has the following lines: -- <<Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Frem.\" -- Appendix.>>  \"An Entered Mason I have been, Boaz and Jachin I have seen, A Fellow I was s worn most rare, And k now the Ashlar, Diamond and Square; I know the Master \u0000 s part full well, As honest Maughbin will you tell.\" {410 } Then the Master says: -- \"If a Master Mason you would b e, Observe you well the \"rule of three,\" And what you want in Masonry, Thy \"Mark\" and \"Maughbin\" makes thee Free.\" The printed catechism of 1724 represents a bo dy qualified as a St. John \u0000 s Lodge, a term we saw used in the oldest York minutes, and it is in altogether better form than some of the others. We find in it a \"version\" of an old Rosicrucian and Gnostic s ymbol, an equal cross with a triangle over it {Sym bol: as described}; it has also the word \"Irah,\" which n o o ne has v entured to explain, but it occurs in the Lectures of HRDM - RSYCSS . Symbolism couched in rhyme is found in the Scottish and north England Catechisms, to a late period. In a MS. of the old C harges belonging to the Dumfries Lodge, of date early 18th century, is the following, but we have no space to quote the Christian Catechism of the old Temple Symbolism found therein.<<Vide \"Ars Quat.

According to a MS. of the learned Mr. Jones in the Cottonian library, the e arly British Kings when they held a Council either personally or by deputy, -- \"went to a certain private house or tower on the top {411 } of a hill, or some solitary place of counsel, far distant from any dwelling, and there advised unknown to any man, but the Counsellors themselves.\" The following lines, of much interest, appear in the \"Dumfries MS.\" just quoted: -- \"A caput mortem {symbol: circle with face: two dots with eyebrows, a curve for a nose and a small dash for a mouth} here you see, To mind you of mortality.\" \"Behold great strength {symbol of two vertical, parallel lines} by Herod fel l, But \u0000 stablishment in h eaven doeth dwell.\" \"Let all your acts {symbol: vertical li ne with h orizontal li ne at top to right} be just and true, Which after death gives life to you,\" \"Keep round within {symbol: small circle over inverted \"V\"} of your appointed sphere, Be ready for your latter end d raws near.\"<<Vide \"Ars Quat.

Cockburn of Adelaide thinks they are of very g reat antiquity. He holds that originally the G was the Hebrew \"gimel,\" and the Greek \"gamm a,\" which is a Mason \u0000 s s quare, held sacred b y the Pythagoreans, and the Cabiric Initiat es of the e arth - goddess \"Ge\" or \"Gai,\" and he further suggests that the primitive e mblem m ay have been the Svastica {Symbol: Swastika} w hich embraces \"four\" gamm as, and again represents the sacred tetragramm aton of the Jews, -- Plutarch says \"The number fo ur is a square\"; and P hilo says, -- \"Four is the most ancient of all square numbers, it is found to exist in right angles, as a square in Geometry Sh ows.\" Brother Sydney T. Klein, P.M. 2076 , in a lecture upon the ancient Geometry<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" x.>> sa ys, that the Greek \"gamm a\" was actually the e tymon or name designating the square in the earliest times. The same Brother considers that the great secret of prehistoric geometry was, \"how to make a perfect right angle, in any desired p osition without poss ibility of error,\" and gives as illustration an Egyptian deed of 2,000 B.C., and later papyrus of 1,500 B.C. Both English and Coptic Guilds s till give it, and the old York Lectures also. He shews that the {412 } ancient geometers had this s ecret, and that it could b e made by means of the centre, from any straight line, or by taking any triangular line drawn from the circumference of a circle, by the rope or skirret.

In the next section of the same window, westward, is a figure kneeling, having a globe on a stand, on a pedestal behind him, with the moon, the sun, and seven stars before him; a root of corn is at the foot near a stream of water, with a branch of acacia on raised ground. And in the third section is a figure prostrate, on a piece of square pavement; the latter is, however, only a compilation of odd p ieces of ancient coloured glass.\" Brother Ker of Scotland has written something in reference to an examination of the Master \u0000 s grade by two astronomers who decided it was s ome very ancient sys tem. The celestial and terrestrial globes were rectified to the time of the foundation of Solomon \u0000 s temple, and \"the signs and words were obtained, and the reason of the implements being used; the legend of the third d egree; also the name being thrice r epeated; why the e ar of corn and the waterfall are depicted; and the direction in which the procession moves.\" A lecture similar to this, but not covering all these points, embracing chiefly the temple of {413 } Solomon as a type of the Universe, is in the Library of the Grand Chapter of Scotland and attributed to Dr. Walker Arnott, an eminent Scottish Mason. The late Brother Albert Pike seems to have e ntertained a similar opinion, and argues for the identification of Hiram with the Sun - god.<<\"Morals and D ogma; Vide also Liverpool Mas. Jol.,\" Dec. 1901 .>> In Egypt, Horus is represented as s eated upon lions, the same word meaning both sun and lion. Again Hari is a Hindu name of the sun, and Khurum or Hiram is the Egyptian Her - ra, Herm es, Hercules. He thin ks c ertain assassins may possibly be recognised in the Arabic names of certain stars; when, by the precession of the e quinoxes, the sun was in Libra, in autumn, he met in the e ast, where the reign of Typhon comm enced, three stars form ing a triangle, they a re thus designated Zuben - es - chamali in the west, Zuben - hak - rabi in the e ast, Zuben - el - gabi in the south; of these the corrupt form s, he thinks, may be found in Jubela - Gravelot, Jubelo - Akirop; and Jubulum - Gibbs.<<\"Ibid,\" pp. 79, 488 .>> The theory of Brothe r Ker \u0000 s two celebrated astronomers might imply the arrangement of the Rites by old astrologers. A similar theory is embodied in the Swedenborgian Rite, which upholds the Masonic s ymbols as those of the \"most\" ancient races, allied to the doctrine of cor respondences. Thus the Masters \u0000 degree is an astrological, or astronomical allegory, based upon the position of the stars 5873 B.C. The Lodge is a symbol of the Universe (also Dr. Arnott \u0000 s c ontention), and the Rites represent t he building of God \u0000 s temple in n ature, and the building up of humanity; it has a further r eference to the e rection of the Succuth, Booths, or Lodges erected at the feast of Tabernacles. Brother Samuel Beswick, in h is work on the Rite, asserts that Emanuel Swedenborg was made a Maso n at t he University of Lunden in 1706 , and that this date appears upon a minute of 1787 when King Gustavus III. presided, but that it is erroneously entered London. He {414 } also"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"asserts that Charles XII., who was assassinated in 1718 , had Lodges, and Cha pters or Encampments in h is arm y. The ancient Guilds may have been continued in S weden, and with reference to higher degrees we have already mentioned the e xistence of Rosy Cross in the 15th century and there was a similar non - Masonic Society in the 18th with the King as Chief. It is not supposed that any quarrel occurred at York to separate the Operatives and the Speculatives; the form er continued to hold their m eetings at High XII., and the latter withdrew to meet in the e vening; and their Ritual reta ined much of the Operative customs not now found in the modern ritual of 1813 . In the 1st Degree the Candidate took a short O.B. before preparation, in order that if he was rejected or withdrew, he might be pledged to secrecy, and the same system exists in the Guild, as the boy is O.B. in the porch before admission. On a York reception h e was invested with the Operative Mason \u0000 s leather apron up to the neck; and as in the Operative Guild he was s hewn h ow to hew the rough Ashlar. In the 2nd Degree he w as thrice tested b y the J.W., S.W., and W.M. in the use of the plumb, level, and square. At the 1st and 2 nd rounds he had to test the columns of the Wardens, and the W.M. required him to prove the perfect Ashlar with the square; there is this difference h owever that the Guild used the hollow square of the nature of a picture frame as a guage both for the stone and the Fellow. The 3rd Degree begins as Fellow, and ends as \"Casual\" Master. The old Masters \u0000 ceremony of York, and the north of England, conta ined much that is now omitted, and had many points of resemblance to the ancient Mysteries. The names of the criminals are given, and after the death of Hiram the Superintendent Adoniram succeeds him, and is ruler of Perfect Masters. The details would re ad thus, on the lines of the ancient Mysteries: Hiram the Abiv or father of Craftsmen is lamented for twice 7 d ays, {415 } w hen the fraternity is gladdened b y a reappearance in the person of Adoniram the prince of the people. In real history Adoniram was s lain, whilst according to Oli ver, who quotes Dius and Menander, Hiram r eturned to Tyre, where he is known as Abdemonos. The York ceremony was a good representation of the \"Aphenism\" and \"Euresis\" of the Mysteries; respecting which Diodorus inform s us that Egypt lamented the violent death of Osiris for fourteen days at his tomb, referring to the lunation of the moon, after which they rejoiced on a proclaimed rising. In regard to the Masonic s ymbols it is tolerably certain that t he more recondite of these have been received b y the Free - Masons from the most ancient t imes, yet t hat t heir actual signification became lost, to the society which ceased its c onn ection with architecture, and in many cases as we know new meanings were assigned b y the Grand Lodge in 1717 . In reference to what has already been said of the perpetuation of a Mark for tools and work, it may be pointed out t hat t he custom was c ontinued in Scotland when an Apprentice was Entered, and Fellows had it in England according to the Catechism quoted and the remnants of Guild life still have it. By the 1670 Laws of the Aberdeen Lodge the Apprentice, besides other fees, had to pay one Mark for his Mark. The Laws of this date e nact t hat Apprentices were to be \"Entered,\" in their \"Outfield Lodge, \" in the parish of Ness, save in ill weather when, -- \"We ordain lykwise that no lodge be holden within a dwelling house, where there is people living in it, but in the open"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"fields, except it be ill weather, and let there be a house closed, that no person shall heir or see us.\" In the old Dumfries Lodge, No. 53, by the Laws of 1687 Apprentices had to pay, \"a mark Scots money assignt mark.\" The \"Scots Magazine\" gives a Dundee Initiation of 1727 and has, -- \"How got you that Mark?\" Answer, -- \"I took up on e Mark, and laid d own another.\" {416 } In the Catechism, printed in England, we quoted the lines: -- \u0000 And what you want in Masonry, Thy \"Mark\" and \"Maughbin\" makes thee Free.\" All the e vidence which these documents afford u s, -- rudimentary, aid - memory, or fragmentary though they may be, point to this, that in some parts, and especially in S cotland, the ancient Fellow and Master of the General Assembly had b ecome the Apprentice and Fellow of the Lodge, first by swearing the Apprentice to a Charge, and then by reducing the seven years \u0000 qualification for Fellowship, until finally there was little or no interval, but customs were not uniform , for there was no general central authority. In other cases, where a stricter traditi on was followed, the Apprentice was sworn to a Charge by some ceremonial and at t he e nd of his s even years \u0000 Apprenticeship was accepted a Fellow by a form al ceremony and then, or afterwards, received the more ancient secrets of a Master Mason; or, as in ce rtain Northern Lodges was c reated a Harod or ruling Chief; f or as the Lodges ceased to be schools of architecture there was no call to continue a strict examination for the title of a Passed Master. This apparently was the view of Grand Lodge in 1717 , ado pted with some changes to suit a new state of things. It is quite open to belief, as modern critics c ontend, that when an unindentured man, or a gentleman, was made a Mason in a Lodge, such as that of York, he would receive the whole degrees at once, in a runn ing ceremony. The Guild received amateurs in the 6th Degree only. It must therefore be true, in a modified sense, that Fellow and Master were convertible term s. It is all but certain that the Speculative, so - called revivalists of 1717 had oral or written Catechisms of Guild ceremonies, and we are told b y Anderson, that the 1721 meetings of Grand Lodge were made very interesting by the Lectures of old Masons. At any rate, we are required to believe in their good faith, {417 } and that the men who f orm ed the Grand Lodge of London in 1717 , transmitted us what t hey had or could remember from the ancients; revised, subtracted, added a little, it may be, but t heir chief alteration was eventually to make three ceremonies the rule of Speculative Masons, an d to contain, in one form or another, all which they had obtained from the Ancient Guild Masons; who when they received an Amateur swore him only in the 6th Degree. As they had now no use for an Indentured Apprentice, they divided the degree of Reception into two portions, in our present Apprentice and Fellow - Craft degrees, revising somewhat the Passed Fellow and adding a second p art to their Master \u0000 s degree. At least they knew, however badly instructed they may have been, better of what genuine Masonry consisted than the iconocalistic c ritics of near two centuries later; and we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a Society that was established for secret and oral transmission of its Mysteries, and which bound its members to absolute secrecy on ev ery point under the most binding penalties. The whole allegory of a Master, it has been observed,"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"enforces the lesson that it is a danger, even to allow it to be suspected that he possessed certain Rites, that were a certificate of his proficiency in the Craft. Nor m ust we forget that speculative Masonry was c onstituted as a Triad Society governed b y threes, after the mann er of the Druids. Sh akespere says, \"that a rose by any other name would smell as s weet;\" and the Grand Lodge established in 1717 is th e same thing whether we call it by that name, or term it Assembly, Congregation, or Chapter, as the ancient designations ran. Practically 1717 was the revival of a previous attempt to continue a ruling body without its Rites and ceremonies, and from this period Freemasons c an h ave little doubt as to the nature of the Society and its degrees s o far as the ordinary Craft Mason is c oncerned. The supposed claim of the Modern Grand Lodge to a full possession of the e ntire {418 } system of Masonry was not univer sally acknowledged b ut denied, and led to York, and other centres of Masons, being term ed ANC IENTS, whilst t he Grand Lodge of London was designated MOD ER N. The guiding principle of the founders of the Grand Lodge Rites was Universality, and with antiquari an tastes, and logical views, nothing was accepted as Masonry but what concerned Solomon \u0000 s Temple, and in adopting Guild ceremonies they did so without reference to the 2nd temple. The question arises here whether or no they were fully inform ed Initiates, and that is v ery dubious. After a full consideration of all the facts produced in previous c hapters c an we arrive at any other conclusion than this, that though Freemasonry of the present day, may have undergone modifications in its c eremonies, and cha nged with the mann ers of Society, yet t hat t he general tone of its ritual has descended to us from the most remote antiquity. As to the 2nd p art of the Master \u0000 s c eremony, on which so much criticism has been wasted, there can be no doubt that it has been t aken from the yearly celebration of the Guilds of what is s upposed to have occurred at the building of the Temple. Throughout these pages we have followed the ordinary histories which treat Modern Freemasonry as a succession of the Operative Guilds; it is one of the descendants of these bodies, but lacking their techn ical instruction, and the abridgement which it has undergone can only be fully understood b y placing the two Rites in juxtaposition. It is, -- what else can we say? a moral and speculative imitation of the more ancient Rites of the Guilds, socially of a higher status, but separated from them, and with the next Chapter we e nter entirely upon a Speculative Freemasonry. Much confusion h as arisen owing to writers attempting to trace Masonry f rom a special class of what were term ed \"Mysteries.\" We have seen that the early Mysteries were Guilds, and that even after Caste influenced them, and divided them into three sections {419 } they were still all one, varying only in the names, &c. There we re then (1) those of the Priests; (2) those of Warriors and agriculturists; (3) those of the Artisans. All three were e qually Mysteries; all were e qually Guilds; equally one Mystery; with like ceremonies v arying mainly in the object and techn ical part of their Rituals. Masonry is the only one of these that has c ome down to us unchanged at the date we close this Chapter. They were a necessity to the priestly builders of Temples and Churches, and therefore e ncouraged. It must be admitted, however, that the modern rites have a remarkable reference to those of the Cabiri. It had \"seven\" anthropomorphised Gods of Art, the number of a \"perfect Lodge\"; of these, three were \"Chief\" Gods, and one was"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"slain by the others and b uried in the roots of Olympus.

SPECULATIVE FREE MASONRY. God b less the King! I mean our Faith \u0000 s Defender, God b less -- no harm in blessing -- the Pretender, But who Pretender is, or who is King, God b less us all! that \u0000 s quite another thing.  JOH N B YROM, Manchester. THE general opinion of Freemasons will be that this Chapter should conclude the next on the e stablishment of a Grand Lodge in 1717 . The reason for placing it before that event is a reasonable belief in the assertions of the ANC IENTS, as opposed to the MOD ER NS, who admitted themselves the characteristic by which the form er distinguished the latter. The subject of these degrees is a very intricate one and I am r ather puzzled how to put it clearly to the reader without much repetition. With Chapter IX. the Gothic Builders died out and their Lodges relaxed into small social gatherings, but in the North of England where there were Lodges in the jurisdiction of York, the Lodges c ontinued the \"Harodim,\" or Masters \u0000 Fraternity, of which Gould in h is large history affords ancient proofs. What became of these bodies, for Grand Lodge has no knowledge of them? But on the death of the Gothic Builders and the attenuation of their Lodges there arose, temp. Jas. I. , a young Englishman of the name of Inigo Jones, whom the Earl of Pembroke took into Italy. He studied with much interest, amongst the disciples of Palladio and the Comicini, the classic works of Italy, and on h is return reorganised such bodies as existed on the model of the {421 } Italian academies, and b rought over Italians to instruct t he Guilds in the classical Masonry of old Rome, and it became a fashion to term the magnificent Gothic erections a barbarous s tyle? Our principal authority for this s tate ment is Anderson who says that the account was recorded in a MS. by Nicholas Stone which was burnt in 1720 , in order, we may suggest, that it might not fall i nto his hands. He further states that Jones held Quarterly Meetings, and Lodges of Instruction; n ow there is no reason why Anderson should have falsified history on this matter, and his s tatements are accepted b y Preston, and b y so careful a writer as the Germ an Findel; but the known ceremonies of the Guild is a confirm ation strong enough in itself, f or they certainly represent a Guild of the classical style. They had also the old Jewish Menatzchim or Intendents,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"and Harods, term ed P assed Masters, of which rank Grand Lodge has no knowledge. The best work on the Comicini is by \"Leader Scott,\" she sh ows that on the sack of Rome by the Goths they settled at Como, and spread their Guilds over the whole of Italy and even to France; and retained the same style of architecture and ornamentation for centuries. Her impression seems to be that they had added to the Collegia a reference to Solomon \u0000 s temple, and this is not improbable when we remember that t he Roman Emperor Justinian after he had completed \"Agia Sofia\" in Constantinople e xclaimed: \"I have surpassed thee, O! Solomon.\" These Italian Academies ha d their \" \u0000 Caput Magistrum, \u0000 \" and their \" \u0000 Arch Magister, \u0000 \" who according to Leader Scott had to be a grandee. The head - master was no doubt the Master of the Level Men, the Arch - Master of the Guild working curved work. At the same time any authority that h ad central jurisdiction was term ed an \"Arch Fraternity,\" and M. H. Sh uttleworth mentions a reprint of 1776 at Paris, of the 13th century Statutes of the Knights of St. John which mentions their \"Archiconfrere Royale. . . de Jerusalem.\" {422 } Every count ry had a special class to \"Pass\" Masters; Scotland had its \"Six Men of Ancient Memory\"; Saxon England its \"Elders\"; France its \"Masters \u0000 Fraternities\"; Germ any its \"Old Masters\"; who assembled \"Chapter - wise.\" The establishment of the Grand Lodge of Englan d and its depletion of the techn ical parts of the Guild, in time destroyed the power of these Harods, Rulers, or Passed Masters, and sought t o o ccupy their place in a very perfunctory mann er. The dissatisfaction against t he Grand Lodge was everywhere grea t and England, Ireland, and Scotland had its Arch Masons in or about 1740 , France had its Menatzchim, its Harods, its Provosts and Judges, its Architects, and its Royal Arch. They were the real G rand Lodge, with secret Rites and tokens, they form ed a Cour t of Award, as they united the Geomatic and Domatic Sections, until the law and the Grand Lodge rendered their functions obsolete; chiefly held in cathedral towns, we may find the sacred name over its gates. Besides the feeling, engendered b y members of the old Operative Guilds, that Modern Masonry was an imperfect system, various other ideas operated in the development of a system of \"Masters \u0000 degrees,\" at a later period term ed High - grade Masonry. English Masonry, in the course of ages had gathered muc h Christian S ymbolism upon its Semitic c eremonies, which, in certain parts, would intensify the dislike to the Modern system. 1. On this question of teaching it may be noted that whilst t he Jacobite Masonic faction sought t o strengthen the Christianity of our Rites, the Southern Masons, had sought from the time when Cromwell readmitted the Jews, to broaden its lines 2. In politics again there e xisted great, but suppressed, antagonism between North and South; the Grand Lodge of all England at York was essentially Jacobite, that of London, Hanoverian. 3. There was an Herm etic element, from early times in the Guilds, and we shall see that this was well understood {423 } in 1721 ; for there was, as we have indicated in previous Chapters, a very early quas i - conn ection. 4. There were in existence from the time of the Reform ation in the 16th century, many mystical societies, and as these passed along the ages, they influenced the Masonic Lodges, and in some instances were drawn upon to"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"establish h igh - degre es; and we will preface the inform ation we can give upon some of these. England seems to have first began an inn ovation upon the system of the Modern Grand Lodge, but the hot - bed of the high - grades was France. From 1688 when a q uantity of English, Iris h, and Scottish Masons emigrated with James II. there was an ancient Masonry in France of which Hector MacLean was Grand Master, and who was s ucceeded in 1725 b y the Earl of Derwentwater who held that position until the Elector of Hanover decapitated him i n 1745 . But a little e arlier, namely in 1737 , the Duke of Richmond, who had b een G.M. of England, opened a Lodge in which h e initiated the Duc d \u0000 Antin who in 1743 b ecame Grand Master of the English Grand Lodge of Paris; we will l eave him there for the pre sent and take a survey of earlier m atters. There is a Carbonari Certificate of 1707 , printed b y St. Edme (Paris, 1821 ) as authentic, which says that a Count Theodore born at Naples in 1685 had already obtained the High Grades of Free Masonry in France. We cann ot doubt, upon the e vidence afforded in Chapter VI. that t he Epoptae, or higher Initiates, of the first ages of Christianity, transmitted their Mystical Rites; these were taken up and carried forward b y Monks, Dervishes, Manichees, Catharoi, Templa rs, Albigensis, Ghibellines, Friends of God, Militia of the Cross, Rosicrucians, and sects too numerous to mention; and that such secret Schools were in existence long prior to the Reform ation in the church, as witness the labours of such men as Fiscini, P ico de Mirandolo, Reuchlin, Erasmus, Agrippa, Rudolphus Agricolo, and many more, and that educated Free Masons, in their Masters \u0000 Fraternities and Fellow { 424 } craft Lodges, were more or less c onversant with Pythagoreanism, Platonism, Cabalism, Rosicrucian ism, and that t hese Societies interested themselves in Germ any and elsewhere in the spread of the doctrines of the Culdees, of Wycliffe, Huss, Luther, and other Reform ers, and the Secret Society established b y Cornelius Agrippa in London, in 1510 , may have been of this nature. How far these adapted the Craft guild ceremonies, or at what date if they did so, can only be plausible conjecture. These Secret schools, which the Church of Rome would term Gnostic, must have perm eated the whole of Europe and ent ered into the Guild life of the traders and artizans, and we cann ot, well otherwise, account for the friendliness s hewn to Luther, when in 1517 he began h is fearless c rusade against the overwhelming force of Rome. It is s upposed that Luther himself was a Guild member and he actually uses Guild term s in 1527 , when h e says that he is \"already passed - Master in clock - making.\" It is s tated that about 15 days after the holocaust which h e had the temerity to make of the Pope \u0000 s Bull, he was waited upon by a membe r of some Guild holding a meeting at Wiittemberg, and induced to go to an Assembly at the Guild Hall, where after Reception \"by ancient ceremonies,\" he received a medal bearing Mystic characters, and was then placed under the protection of the Brotherhood. <<\"National Freem.,\" Washingtorn, 1863 ; Row \u0000 s \"Masonic Biographs,\" 1868 ; \"Canadian Craftsman,\" 1893 .>> It is quite certain that Secret Societies of Mystics, united b y ceremonies with signs, then existed; and it may be that the Reform ers s trengthened themse lves by such S ocieties, intended for mutual protection, and the Charter of Cologne, 1535 , if genuine, may represent such Assemblies. The e arly Secret Societies of the Albigensis and the Ghibellines usually represented their position under the symbol of an Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"or Babylonish captivity, for both form s are used, and Luther himself adopts this in h is book entitled the \"Babylonish Captivity.\" He says, -- \"The Christian {425 } people are God \u0000 s true people, carried away captives into Babylon, where they have been robbed of that which they received at t heir baptism.\" Salandronius the Swiss, thus writes to Vadian, -- \"Oh! saw you how the inh abitants of the mountains of Rhetia, cast away from them, the Yoke of the Babylonish Captivity.\" Melancthon, in 1520 , say s, -- \"the finger of God is to be seen in what Luther is doing, even as the King of the Egyptians refused to acknowledge what was done by Moses.\" We can even find language amongst them, which form s the most secret part of certain Masonic high - grades, but which we cann ot repeat. Luther in 1520 thus writes to the Elector. -- \"With one hand I hold the sword, and with the other I build the walls of Zion\"; similar language was used in Paris and Toussaint Farrel, 1525 , says, -- \"The 70th year will come at last, the year of deliverance, and then we shall have freedom of mind and conscience.\" Nor is this s ymbolic language absent from the works of the English Rosicrucians for John Heyden, writing in 1663 , has an allusion to it, particularly forced; speaking of Chr istian Rosenkreutz, circa 1400 he says (p. 18), -- \"After five years c ame into his mind, the wished return of the Children of Israel out of Egypt, how God would b ring them out of bondage. Then h e went to his Cloyster, to which h e bare affection, and d esir ed three of his brethren to go with h im to Moses.\" These he e xplains were Brothers G.V., I.A., and E.O., who constructed a \"Magical language.\" This may be traditional or found in MSS . to which Heyden h ad access, if history, it indicates a company of four working in a like direction to Luther a century and a half before his days. We find this s ymbolic language reduced to emblems, two o f these brought from Nuremberg are e ngraved in the \"Transactions\" of the Newcastle College of Rosicrucians. One of thes e has, on one side, the figure of a Pontiff in the act of blessing, also the figure of a Monk with a lighted taper in h is hand, and between the two an Altar with an open Bible upon it, around the {426 } border is the inscription VER BUM DO MINI HB:YHYH (i rrad iated) MANETINAETER (nitate); the obverse has an arm ed man, with a drawn sword, holding the scales of justice, in the heavier pan is a human figure, and in the lighter pan a writhing serpent; several inscriptions appear in the centre but are indistinct, th e legend is JOSUA CONFIDE NON DIRE LINQUAMTE. In the Peasants \u0000 league against the Nobles, 1524 - 5, the motto o f Munzer was \"we must like Joshua destroy all the nations of Canaan with the sword,\" and in one of his letters he signs himself, \"Munzer, arm ed wit h the sword of Gideon,\" possibly this medal is Anabaptist. The Roman Catholic c lergy are very fond of making Faustus Socinius the founder of Freemasonry, this, of course, is false, but Socinius seems to have e stablished a secret Society by which h e spread his v iews in Poland. The second medal we have named is a Jubilee one of 1617 , the obverse being precisely the same as that just described; on the reverse we find a bee - hive, the HB:YHYH (i rradiated), a serpent twined round a cross, three other indistinct emblems, at the top EGYPTUS ET ISRAEL; at the bottom ANN O JUBILAEI OM; around the border, in two lines is the legend DEMSCHWER N EGYPTISCHEN DIENSTH AUS WIE MOYSES GEUHRTAUS VNS CFURTAVS DESBAEST FINIS TEK NU, ALSOH ATT MARTIN LUTHER US. The Jubilee date of 1617 is about the period when the Rosicrucian S ocieties began to supersede the Mystic Schools mentioned in Chapter VI., of which, to a slight extent, this"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"is a continuation. Although the Clerical enemies of Masonry in France pointed out last century the b earing of all this upon the Masonic Rites then practised, it is not in the province of a Mason to do so, but those who have the Red Cross and its analogous grades will comprehend. We have alluded to the Harodim, which in France became the nucleus of the high grades, and the secret Societies from which these latter drew some of their material. There is, however, another Order, which the Romish Church associates with a Secret Discipline, and {427 } an enlightened p urpose, which they suppose has been embodi ed in Freemasonry -- we allude to the Order of the Temple. The Templar origin of Masonry, or at least one of its Rites, was quite a cardinal doctrine abroad last century; and we have already g iven the facts leading to this v iew. Philip le Bel before he u ndertook the suppression of the Templars in 1310 , had, two years before this, interdicted the trade Fraternities. Two branches of the Templars escaped d estruction, the one in Scotland the other in Portugal, and a third is mentioned in Hungary down to 1460 , these would correspond with each other, and they could not feel any friendship for Rome. The difficulty of a widespread continuation would arise from the vigilance, after 1313 , of the priesthood, but the Order m ay have been continued in spirit under oth er names; and we must ask what became of the numerous bodies of Artisans expelled b y this action from the Preceptories of the Templars. Starck in h is reply to Dr. Beister<<\"Anti Saint Nicasse,\" 1786 , ii, pp. 181 - 202 .>> says: \"Had he been somewhat better a cquainted with ecclesiastical history he would have found, not only one, but several religious bodies which under far m ore violent oppression than those e ndured b y the Knights Templar, have secretly continued to exist for a far longer period.\" In Scotland there was a strong leaven of Culdee opinion to preserve the Templars, and P apal opinion was always more lightly considered b y the independent Scot than h is English n eighbour. Hence Scotland p reserved the name of the Templars even after the dissolution of the Chivalric Orders in that country in 1560 . These Knights were often addicted to Herm etic s tudies, and may have become amalgamated with some of these. Thory points out, in writing of the times of Lord Bacon, what he calls the singular fact that here a nd there in works of the time are found allusions to the Templars, and that Alchemical works have references to their red - cross bann er. Mere denial of some such conn ection does not admit {428 } of being loosely made, and Aberdeen h ad its s hare of support as a seat of Masonic Templary. Baron Hunde inh erited some such traditionary belief and sent emissaries to investigate the belief. When the lands of Maryculter were surrendered in 1548 the Knights took up their r esidence in the city, where an old Lodge e xisted which embraced the noble and gentle; and we find this Lodge meeting in Tents, or Encampments under canvas, designated \"Outfield Lodge,\" or held in the Bay of Nigg, \"where no o ne could see or hear,\" and hence believed to have included Templar rites. It is also alleged that certain Templars, before 1600 , united with the ancient Stirling Lodge. For some time after the Reform ation the orthodox party would seem to have recruited themselves s ecretly with the sanction of the Grand Master at Malta, and it is v ery probable that the same thing had p lace in England when James I. was the \"Mason King\" and the craft included men of learning and gentlemen. The first assimilation of Chivalry and Freemasonry would arise within the Domus or Preceptory, amongst the A rtisans and Lay - brothers there e mployed; and when they were e xpelled together in the 16th"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"century, there would b e a desire amongst both parties to continue the conn ection, and still stronger amongst the Protestant parties; gradually, in the course of a cen tury, the Temple began to be looked upon as a Masonic appanage, owing to the chief members belonging to both orders. Finally, in order to make the Orders homogeneous, the craft and other degrees were treated as the necessary g radation by which to become a Templar. There was undoubtedly an ancient t raditionary conn ection besides this, even if the Templars, as s eems most probable, did not in the 12th and 13 th centuries, introduce the Rites of Freemasonry now practised. We will now consider the participat ion of the Freemasons themselves in the aims of the old Herm etic Schools of \"Sons and Masters.\" We must all admit that t he builders of our ancient religious houses were men {429 } of great intelligence, who would seek to increase their knowledge from all a vailable sources, and amongst t hese sources from the Societies of Alchemists and Rosicrucians, including Astrologers and Mathematicians. We have given instances in 1450 where Herm etic Symbolism was identical with that of Freemasonry; but t he \"Ordinall of Alchemy\" compiled b y Thomas Norton of Bristol, \"In the yeare of Christ, 1477 \" (83 pp . of MS.), comm ences as follows: -- \"To the honour of God, one in persons three, This Boke is made that laie men shouldn \u0000 t see.\" He undertakes, \"To teach by Al kimy g reat riches to winn ,\" and enumerates the great personages who have worked in the Mysteries of Herm es, Popes, Cardinals, Byshopes, Priests, Kings, Lords, Merchants, and adds: -- \"And goldsmithes whome we should lest repreve, For sights in their Craft move them to beleeve.\" He styles Alchemy a \"Noble Craft,\" and says (page 2) i n allusion to the Freemasons: -- \"But wonder is it that Weivers deale with such worke, Free - Masons, and Tann ers, and p oore P \u0000 issh Clarkes, Stayne rs, and Glasiers will not thereof cease, And yet seely Tinkers will put them in prease.\" He closes his instruction in the Noble Art thus: -- \"All that hath pleasure in this Boke to reade, Pray for m y soule, and for all both quick and d e dde; In this yeare of Christ, one thousand four hundred seaventy seaven, This warke was begun, honour to God in h eaven.\" This participation may have gone on for centuries, and we may feel sure that it did; various Societies of Oriental orig in then existed using symbols by which Masons would b e attracted to them, and it is in evidence that t he e arly Rosicrucians were Initiated b y the Moslem sectaries. In 1630 we find Fludd, the chief of the Rosicrucians, using architectural language, and the re is proof that his Society was divided into degrees, and from the fact that the Masons \u0000"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Company of London h ad a copy {430 } of the Masonic Charges \"presented b y Mr. fflood,\" we may suppose he was a Free - Mason before 1620 . From the language of Eugenius Ph ilalethes or Thomas Vaughan we may assume that he also was a Mason. Sir Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole, who were received Masons in 1641 and 1646 respectively, were both of them diligent students of Occult matters, and it is within the bounds of probabili ty that the Rosicrucians may have organised a system of the Craft degrees, upon which they superadded their own Harodim r eceptions long before Free - Masonry passed to the Grand Lodge in 1717 . \"The Wise Man \u0000 s Crown,\" 1664 , has the following: \"The late yea rs of tirany admitted stocking weavers, shoemakers, millers, masons, carpenters, bricklayers, gunsmiths, hatters, etc., to write and teach Astrology.\" This latter Society Ashmole term s the Mathematicians; it held an ann ual festival, which was active in Lo ndon in 1648 and again in 1682 . Even Wren was, more or less, a student of Herm eticism, and if we had a full li st of Freemasons and Rosicrucians we should p robably be surprised at the numbers who belonged to both systems. It included a study of the Jewish Cabala, and a Dutch Jew w as exhibiting a model of Solomon \u0000 s temple in 1675 , and he would b e likely to draw upon the Talmud and Cabala in h is explanatory lectures; for the Cabala has a branch which possesses a semi - Masonic c haracter in \"Architectonic Gemat ria,\" which refers to the construction of words from the numbers given in the Bible when describing the measurements of the Temple, and the Ark of the Covenant, in relation to man h imself. Brother W. W. Westcott, M.B., has translated a very curious passag e e ntitled \"The Secrets of Initiation, by J. J. Casanova, born 1725 , Fr. R.C. circa 1757 ,\" in which h e says: \"The secrets of Initiation are by their very nature inviolable; for the Frater who knows them, can only have discovered them by himself. He has fo und them whilst frequenting well - instructed Lodges, by observing, comparing and judging the doctrines and symbols. Rest assured then, {431 } that once he has arrived at this result, he will preserve it with the utmost care, and will not comm unicate it, eve n to those of his Fraters in whom he has c onfidence, for since any Frater has been unable to discover the secret for himself, he would b e e qually unable to grasp their real meaning, if he received them only by word of mouth.\" There can be no reasonable doubt from the e vidence of numerous degrees of high - grade Masonry, and their symbolism, that what we have here described has c ontributed to the development of the systems now w orked, though it must always be difficult to trace the development seriatim. Th ese Mystical Societies had survived in various c entres of Europe down to the period when Craft Masonry underwent a revival, and such traditional and mystical ceremonies were revised in many cases to adapt them to a new basis in n ew Rites. This is proved b y identity of aims and emblems, but t he system has s uch scant influence on the general work of the Craft t hat few consider these things worthy of notice; and moreover their ancient value as a means of uniting the forces of sectarian Brotherhoods, ceased to exist in their new form , with the general acceptance of freedom of conscience. The e nquiry is of interest, but the secrecy of the old Mystic Societies will ever be an obstacle to full elucidation. Thus amongst Masons meeting together in Lodge, there wer e members of other Societies which h ad similar Rites to themselves, and therefore e very probability that one would influence the other. The \"Modern\" historians, the word is used in its double sense, have always c onceded scant justice to this s ection of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Fr eemasonry, and it has been their effort to assign all degrees, above the three first, of which the Grand Lodge, at its s tart, adopted two, to a foreign origin; and although French and Germ an systems were introduced into this c ountry in the 18th century; th e e vidence goes to show that with our Craft system went the nucleus of all the high - grades which were carried from England as early as 1688 and afterwards {432 } manipulated abroad. There is far m ore probability for the continuous transmission of secret so cieties of mystics in this c ountry than on foreign soil, and nothing is gained b y the contention. We cann ot be a party to the insinuations that truth is found only amongst English Masons, who are usually more ignorant than those abroad, nor concede an all seeing infallibility to the conceited critic who imagines that he knows everything. In affinity with this s ubject of the high - grades must further be noticed, in one section at least, the e ssentially Christian character of its ancient ritual. Thus in a printed Catechism we find after a q uestion of \"How many lights?\" t he farther question, \"What do they represent? A. The three persons; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Q. How many pillars? A. Two, Jachin and Boaz. Q. What do they represent? A. A strength a nd stability of the Church in all ages. Q. Who is greater than a Freemason! A. He who was c arried to the highest pinn acle of the Temple of Jerusalem.\" This Christian character is found, in its s trength, in the \"Dumfries MS.\" from which we have had quota tions, and was probably the system of such bodies as possessed the old Christian Masters \u0000 Grade of Harodim - Rosy Cross. The e arliest printed evidence of something beyond the then n ew speculative Craft is a work b y Robert Samber, written in 1721 under the nom - de - plume of Eugenius Philalethes, Junior, and which h e dedicated to the Grand Lodge of London in 1722 ; and there is no doubt that much h as passed out of existence that would have e nlightened us upon the writer \u0000 s v iews, inasmuch as he claims, as did th e Carpocratian Gnostics, that Jesus established an esoteric doctrine which h e comm unicated to his disciples, and the possibility of such views implies a much broader field to survey than most writers wish to concede. This Preface of \"Long Livers\" clearl y refers to certain h igh - grades then known, and is written in the e asiest of three keys used b y the Herm etic Societies, namely, the operative, philosophic, and religious; it bears entirely {433 } upon the latter, and has no reference to o perative Alchemy bu t uses the term s of this Craft, after the mode of Fludd, to convey Theosophic and Masonic truths. Almost whilst we write Brother Edward Arm itage has discovered in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, fragments of a Ritualistic nature which bear upon the printed Preface, and is admitted to be in the handwriting of Samber. It is the preparatory application of a Rosicrucian form ula to something missing. It embraces a trial by \"water\", in washing; of \"fire\" in purification; of \"light\" as a symbol carried to its ext inguishment; of giving the \"coal\" and \"chalk;\" t he \"cord,\" or girdle, binding the recipient to the brotherhood; the \"incense,\" the symbolism of \"knocking\" at a door; of \"entrance;\" and the \"Oath\" which is that of secrecy, extending even to the persons acti ng, and treats of the Aspirant \u0000 s duties in general.<<Vide\"Ars Quat. Cor.\">> As a Preparation, which it says that it is, it may bear some relation to that which follows, as there is v erbiage in comm on. In the Preface of 1721 , Samber alludes to the grade s of the Arcane Discipline of the e arly Christians as c omparable with Masonry; to a spiritual cube, and he"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"associates Masons s piritually with the three principles of the Herm etic Adepts, namely, salt, sulphur, and mercury, and there are other comparisons w hich agree with three Masonic grades. He claims that in all time there was a Brotherhood which preserved true religion, essentially what Derm ott claims for the Royal Arch, and he goes on to demonstrate the doctrine of the Unity, passing from Moses through the Schools of the Prophets, and the Rabbis. He has also three traitors who correspond with the Cain, Achan, and Enn i (Ann as) of Harodim - Rosy Cross who slew the \"Beauty\" of the world. He e nds by making Christ the reorganiser of a Masonic Brotherhood, an d \"holy brother St. Paul,\" is alluded to with a marked emphasis which shews that he had a Masonic theory respecting him. He thus leads us through the natural law exemplified in the Craft, the Jewish law in the Arch {434 } or Red Cross, to the law of grace in Christian Masonry; for these things are fully implied though n o such grades are alluded to by name. He says that he is addressing \"a higher class who are but few,\" and this is done in Herm etic language, which shows that he perfectly understood the myst ic language of that body. He speaks of those who o ught to be \"erased from the Book M.,\" which implies here Masonry, but remotely that mentioned in Chapter VI. We are rather concerned in defending Samber against his c ritics of the last 20 years, who repre sent him as little better than an idiot; the fault is theirs, for they \"have e yes but see not.\" We will now follow with some e xtracts which shew that it was a well understood thing that there were certain degrees above the Craft system. The learned Dr. Stukeley states in h is \"Au tobiography,\" \"7 Novr. 1722 . The Order of the Book instituted,\" he term s it also \"Roman Knighthood,\" and says, 28th December that he admitted to it Lords Hertford and Winchelsea. There is nothing to shew the nature of it, and i t is not probable that it survived as a Masonic degree. Bro. R. F. Gould has s tated, in one of his papers, that t here is an advertisement in the \"Daily Mail\" of 1724 ann ouncing that a new Lodge is to be opened at St. Alban \u0000 s Tavern for regulating the mo dern abuses which h ad crept into the fraternity, and \"all the old real Masons are invited to attend.\" It is evidently the beginn ing of the agitation which led to \"Ancient\" Masonry, and the role of the Royal Arch. In the years 1724 and 1725 there appear ed two editions of a pamphlet entitled \"Two Letters to a Friend,\" in which are allusions to Dr. Thomas Rawlinson, a leading Freemason, who left the Craft some documents referring to this period. In this print it is s tated that the Brother styles himself R .S.S. and LL.D., and \"he makes wonderful Brags of being of the Fifth Order. . . . The Doctor pretends that he has found out a mysterious \"hocus pocus\" {435 } Word . . . that against whomsoever he (as a member of the Fifth Order) shall pronounce the terrible word the person shall i nstantly drop d own dead.\" To whatever degree Rawlinson really belonged it is c ertain that the allusion is to the Jewish tetragramm aton, and that the worthy doctor had b een incautiously airing his knowledge of the \"Essays\" of Reuchl in and Agrippa upon the \"Cabala,\" and the Mirific Word. There is no reason why the \"fifth order,\" should not mean the 5th Degree which it is known the Arch was a little later. The nom - de - plume of the writer of the pamphlet is \"Verus Comm odus,\" and he men tions that some of the Masons \"write themselves STP,\" after their names, which in h is blatant fashion h e tries to make a profanation of the Trinity; from this it may be inferred that a civil reference was not to be understood b y him"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"but t hat it represented something Masonic, and we know, later on in the Century, that the Templar grade was abbreviated T.P. either as here, or with the crossed {symbol: \"P\" with vertical extended b elow and crossed as a Greek cross} and is s o found on the 1791 Seal of Grand Conc lave. The writer also says: \"they tell strange foppish stories of a tree that grew out of Hiram \u0000 s tomb.\" In Ireland there seems an incipient reference to the Christian grades in the newspaper report of the Installation at Dublin of Lord Rosse as Grand Master, 24th June, 1725 . The representatives of six Lodges of \"Gentlemen Masons\" were present, and it is s aid: \"The Brothers of one Lodge wore fine Badges painted full of crosses and squares, with this Motto \"Spes meo in Deo est,\" which was no doubt very significant, for the Master of it wore a yellow jacket and Blue Britches.\"<<\"Caementaria Hibernica,\" fasc. II.>> It was well known that t he clothing refers to the brass handle and steel l egs of a pair of compasses. The reporter also speaks of the \"Mystic al table\" being in form of a Mason \u0000 s s quare. There is a burlesque advertisement of the tailors, 24 Dec. 1725 , which accuses their \"whimsical kinsmen of {436 } the hod and trowel,\" with h aving changed their day of meeting and P atron, \"on n ew light receive d from some worthy Rosicrucians.\" On the 31st Dec. 1728 , Brother Edward Oakley delivered an address at London, in which h e quotes largely from Samber \u0000 s Preface to \"Long Livers,\" so that it must have had some Masonic importance given to it, and its refer ences understood. Also, in 1729 , Ephraim Chambers mentions in h is \"Cyclopoedia\" that t here are certain Free - Masons who \"have all the characters of Rosicrucians,\" or \"as retainers to the art of building.\" There is a still more precise statement signed A .Z. in the \"Daily Journal\" of 5th S eptr., 1730 , f rom which we e xtract a small portion: -- \"It must be confessed that there is a society abroad, from which the English Freemasons have copied a few ceremonies, and take pains to persuade the world, that they are derived from them. These are called Rosicrucians from their Prime Officers (such as our Brethren call G rand Masters, Wardens, etc.), being distinguished on their High days by Red Crosses.\" The \"Gentlemans \u0000 Magazine,\" April 1737 , contains a long att ack upon Masonry signed JACHIN, in which h e says: -- \"They make no scruple to acknowledge that t here is a distinction between \"Prentices\" and \"Master Masons,\" and who knows whether they have not a higher Order of \"Cabalists\" who keep the \"grand secret\" of all entirely to themselves.\" It looks v ery like an intimation of the Royal Arch degree. All this points out t hat prior even to 1717 the mixed Lodges possessed a higher section, whether known to the Grand Lodge or not, which could b e spoken of in Rosicr ucian Jargon, thus raising the question whether there was not t hen a Freemasonry that had b een passing as Rosicrucian during the previous c entury; even the Chapter of Clerm ont, a Templar system, asserted that t he system of Solomon, contained 7 d egrees, and other books asserted that they had received a 7 d egree system \"from the very heart of Albion, the sanctuary of the high degrees.\" {437 } One of the e arliest bodies of which we know something was the following:  THE GO RMOGO NS.

Particulars of the body is found in the 1724 p amphlet entitled \"Two Letters to a Friend,\" from which it appears that they had an Emissary at Rome, and Samber the author of \"Long Livers,\" is identifiable under the designation of a \"Renegade P apist.\" Ramsay was with the Pretender at Rome in 1724 , and the Duke of Wharton, P.G.M. of England is evidently alluded to as a Peer who had suffered himself \"to be degraded\" by having his apron burnt in order that he might join the Gorm ogons, was with the Pretender at Parm a in 1728 , and had received the title of Duke of Northumberland from him about fourteen years previously. They had a secret reception and cypher of their own, and Kloss c onsiders, no doubt rightly, that in their jargon \"China\" meant Rome . Brother R. F. Gould has been at great pains to disentangle the history of the Gorm ogons, and has made it clear that not only was Wharton a member, but probably founded the Society on an older Jacobite plan; and he shows that the dates of its activity syncronises with the e vents of Wharton \u0000 s life; and the lampoon may very probably be Wharton \u0000 s own composition, in which case it throws added light upon the matter in reference to Dr. Rawlinson. The \"two unh appy busy persons\" who o btained their idle notion s . . . \"about Adam, Solomon, and Hiram being Craftsmen,\" and who abused, \"a venerable old gentlewoman under the pretence of making her a European Hiramite,\" is interpreted to signify Anderson and Desaguliers in the new Constitution, whilst the venerable o ld gentlewoman is the old Operative {438 } Charges. The whole satire was embodied b y William Hogarth in a plate designated \"The Mystery of Masonry brought t o light by y e Gorm ogons.\" which went t hrough three editions, the last about 1742 ; in this plate the old woman upon an ass who is about to be saluted b y a man with h is head in a ladder is thus explicable.

This degree was at one time very popular in the County of Durham, and may be supposed to be a part of the work of the Gateshead b ody to whom the Count Bishop granted a Charter in 1681 . Bro. F. F. Schn itger was well acquainted with the la st surviving Harod Bro. R. R. Read, a D.P.G.M. of the Mark, who received the degree from his father at Gateshead, where his grandfather also conferred it, and he had b een received in the Lodge in youth as an Apprentice and it is s aid that the Lodge possess ed his operative Indentures. Bro. Read made over all his privileges \"free from Harodim,\" to the Newcastle high grades. Bro. Robert Whitfield first mentioned the Swalwell Minutes of the degree in the \"Freemason\" of 11th Decr., 1880 , and says that t he Lo dges c laimed important privileges from form er ages; the appointment of the P.G.M., and the wearing of hats at the P.G.L. meetings. The first mention of it, if it can be called so, is the quotation by Bro. Joseph Laycock, who brought the Swalwell, and th e Gateshead Lodges under the G.L. in 1735 , and was appointed P .G. Master of the Co. of Durham in that year. On these occasions he gave a q uotation, in an Oration h e then made, and which is"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"printed in the \"Book M., or Masonry Triumphant,\" in 1736 at Newcas tle. He term s these \"old verses,\" and they are yet a part of the 4th section of the Jacobite Harodim - Rosy - Cross. The next reference is a minute of the Swalwell Lodge {439 } as follows: \"July 1st 1746 . Enacted at a Grand Lodge \"held this evening that no brother m ason shall be \"admitted into the dignity of a Highrodiam under less \"than a charge of 2s. 6d.; or as Domaskin or Forin as \"John Thomson of Gateside paid at the same night 5s. \"Memorandum: Highrodiams to pay for m aking in that \"order only 1s. 6d.\" (8 names follow and 9 th line closes) \"Paid 2 s 6d. English, William Ogden. N.B. The \"English Masters to pay for entering into the said \"Master - ship 2 s. 6d., per Majority.\" Of course the \"English Masters\" refers to the Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of London, introduced b y Laycock, and as they style themselves a Grand Lodge, and as the name of Joseph Laycock d oes not appear as a Harod at any time, it seems v ery clear that t he object was a semi - rebellion of the old operative Masons against the inn ovat ions of 1735 . A man who spells Harodim as Highrodiam m ay be e xcused for spelling Domatic as Domaskin, but Bro. Schn itger seems to think it may mean Damascus. The Lodge was mostly composed of the men employed at Cowley \u0000 s foundry, and he brought over from Solingen, steel workers who claimed that they had inh erited their m ethod of working the metal from Damascus, as the Markgrave had b rought instructions thence in the time of the Crusades. The Ceremonial was a system of secret receptions in points, simila r to the Jacobite Harodim - Rosy - Cross to which we will shortly refer. They were the custodians of the Ritual of all Masonry, which was what Oli ver invariably term ed the \"Old York Ritual,\" and which certainly contains Harodim points, and no doubt York at on e time had the ceremony. The two Trollopes who were part of the Gateshead foundation of 1681 were Stone - Masons of the city of York. Its position in Masonry is precisely that which we have described as Passed Masters, in the old p re - 1717 London Guild. In operative times the Ritual, of which they claimed to have been the custodians, was doubtless the yearly Drama; it is the key {442 } to all York Masonry after 1725 , and b egins with the 7th Degree and goes down even to the Apprentice. They had oversight o f all the Lodges of their jurisdiction, there were 9 of them, and they travelled in groups of 3 to punish irregularities, and reconcile differences. At receptions there were to be 9 p resent, but 6 and 3 candidates would suffice in emergencies. At Sunde rland Bro. Hudson states that the Harodim was c onferred from the first establishment of the Phoenix Lodge, and that between 1755 and 1811 they received 150 members. In 1787 R. Markham \"Passed the Bridge,\" and a month later was made a Royal Arch Mason. Br o. Logan h as s hown that Palatine Lodge, 97, had the Harodim. In each case members v isited from neighbouring towns.  HAROD IM - ROSY - CROSS . "},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":" This was a London version, clearly of Jacobite derivation, which in 1743 claimed a time im memorial origin; we would suggest that it might have been carried to France from the North by Derwentwater who belonged to this part of the country. It is c learly the grade which Baron S cheffer had from him, in two sections, when h e gave him authority to establish Lodges in S weden 25 Nov. 1737 . Ramsay in h is s peech of 1737 alludes to the old Arcane Discipline of the Alexandrian Church when h e says: \"We have amongst us three classes of confreres, the \"Novice or Apprentice; the Companion or Professed; \"the Master or the Perfected. We e xplain to the first the \"moral virtues; to the second the heroic v irtues, and to \"the last the Christian virtues. . . the fourth quality is \"a taste for the useful sciences and the liberal arts. . . . \"Religious discords c ause d us to change and to disguise, \"and to suppress, some of our Rites and usages, which \"were opposed to the prejudices of the times.\" He also alludes to the Jews working with the sword in one hand and the trowel in the other, which are the lines quoted b y Laycock in 1735 . Dean S wift must have had some {441 } knowledge of this, and he was acquainted with Ramsay in 1728 ; and he thus writes in 1731 , -- \"the famous old Lodge of Kilwinin, of which all the Kings of Scotland have been, from time to time, Grand Mas ters without interruption,\" and he speaks of the adornment of \"Ancient Jewish and P agan Masonry, with many religious and Christian Rites,\" by the Knights of St. John and of Malta. It is quite possible that Scotland may have had the Rite of Harodim - Rosy - Cross at an early date. There is a curious passage in the \"Muses Threnody,\" a metrical account of Perth, published in 1638 for Henry Adamson, M.A. The extract may mean much or little in the argument, according to the idea in the mind of the student, for he says:<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.,\" 1898 , p. 196 . Vide also the writer \u0000 s paper in A.Q.C., 1903 .>> \"For we be brethren of the Rosie Cross, We have the Masons word and second sight,\" The claim is made for this Metrical system of Lectures that it is of Culdee origin, and had I - colm - Kill for its birth place.

A Charter was granted to the Hague in 1751 , and this was c arried to Edinburgh in 1763 , since which period the Rite has handed d own the Lectures intact. It is likely however that some revision may have been made about 1740 say in the last section and the title. It has s ince 1767 b een term ed the \"Royal O rder of Scotland.\" In 1786 they Chartered a body at Rouen, when an interesting correspondence e nsued b etwe en Wm. Mason the Grand Deputy Master, and Murdoch the Grand Secretary, in which the latter speaks of the dorm ancy of the Order for some time in S cotland, in a light that scarcely agrees with the facts of the case. Rebold says that the ceremonies of the Ro yal O rder were revived on the form ation of the Grand Lodge of St. John \u0000 s Masonry the Mastership of the Jacobite Lodge Canongate Kilwinn ing, and it is a fact that in 1735 that Lodge had, as is proved b y the Minutes, a \"Masters \u0000 Lodge\" quite distinct from th e Craft, and which in its work and organisation, was identical with the London Lodge, No. 115 , designated in 1733 a \"Scotts Masons Lodge,\" and Brother John Lane holds that t his was identical in Constitution with certain Lodges established as \"Master Masons Lodges\" conferring that degree only of the English Ritual, that therefore the so called Scotts Lodges differed only in this that their m embers were Scottishmen. But though this be so it is no proof that the Rituals were the same, and it may well be that the actual Scots Lodges had a special ceremony such as the Mastership of Harodim. It is probable therefore that t here is truth in Rebold \u0000 s s tatement t hat t he Cann ongate Kilwinn ing Lodge, which was a Jacobite Lodge, was the Christian Harodim which expired, as the Scotch Rite contends with the ruin which befel that political sect. Thory who was {443 } \"Atharsata,\" or Most Wise, of the French Branch in 1807 makes the Mason of Heredom; the Knight of the Tower; and the Rosy Cross to correspond. -- as they clear ly do, -- with the degrees of Scotch Master; Knight of the East; and the Prince Rose Croix; the fourth and last step term ed the Sanh edrin h e considers \"the figurative banquet of the Pascal lamb,\" we rather consider it was c onverted into the Templar Kadosh.  RE D AND ROSY CROSS . In the absence of any old Minutes of these two degrees, it may perhaps be thought idle to express an opinion that t hey may have had an existence amongst Herm etic Masons long prior to the e stablishment of M odern Freemasonry. Ramsay told to Geusau, when occasionally visiting him at Paris in 1741 , that General Monck had used the Lodges as meetings at which to promote the return of Charles II. Geusau \u0000 s Diary passed into the keeping of the Prince of Reuss, and it is held that at this period it was s ought to further ally the Herm etic associations of London with the Craft for the same purpose. There is this further to be said on the matter that the quaint old rhyming ritual of Heredom - Rosy Cross would seem to be a system of Lectures referring to these two degrees, which constituted with the Craft a Rite of themselves, the only qualification for the Rosy Cross being the Red Cross, -- sometimes term ed the \"Mysterious Red Cross of Babylon.\" When Harodim - Rosy Cross was c arried to France by the followers of James II. the title was translated into \"Rose Croix"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"of Heredom,\" and the Red Cross was designated Knight of the East, and in 1744 , Knight of the Sword, whilst the Rosy Cross is the Rose Croix. In the Red Cross the re are three points, namely: -- (1) The Obligation of the 3 Sojourners, Sh adrach, Mesech, and Abadnigo, who have e scaped the \"fiery furnace of affliction\"; (2) the Arch Chapter of Jerusalem, which includes the Passing of the Bridge on the way to and from D arius; (3) the Council of the Persian Monarch. There are many points {444 } in the degree which h ave reference to the Harodim Lectures; such as passing the Bridge; the dungeon of the Tower; the journey of Zerrubabel, and the e ssays on the respective streng th of Wine, Women, and the King, when Truth is s aid to be mighty above all things. Would that it applied to Masonry and Masons! There is one curious thing in this portion, in which it is said that the Lord will provide a victim, and it probably alludes t o the ancient Guild Rite of a human sacrifice. Whilst t he Red Cross is a mystery of the second temple added to that of Solomon, the Rosy Cross of Harodim is the erection of a spiritual temple not made with h ands, the Mystery of the ancient Gnostics -- \"Go d with us\" in the bodily temple. There is an ancient alphabet given in Barrett \u0000 s \"Magus\" called \"Passing the River,\" having much similarity to Masons \u0000 Marks, which may be allied with \"Passing of the Bridge.\" It is, to say the least, somewhat singular t hat so favourite a symbol, in all time, as the Rose has been, in both religious and civil architecture, should have been n eglected b y the modern Freemasons, and p roves that it must have lost much of its s ymbolism. We have mentioned that Bishop Theodoratus conn ects mystically \"Ros\" with the Rose, which was a Gnostic emblem of the Saviour; and applies equally to the Arcane Discipline and the Rosy Cross -- \"Ros,\" or dew, implying regeneration, and the Rose the thing regenerated. Sh all I say it? The writer h as s een an old Rosy Cross ritual, where the Adonisian fable that a drop of blood from the slain god, sprang up a rose, is applied to the Christian S aviour. In Egypt the Rose was c onsecrated to Isis or Mother Nature, and Apuleius fables himself as drawn fr om brute nature, or an Ass, by eating roses. Chaucer translated the Romance of the Rose, wherein a pilgrim is represented as going in search of roses. We have mentioned the Girdles of the Guild Mason, John Cadeby, of Beverley: a much worn one contains th e letters J and B, whilst another is embroidered with roses, in the mann er of modern Rose {445 } Croix clothing. The Arm s of William of Wykeham were two carpenters -- couples between three roses. The e mblem was often carved in the centre of the ceilings o f mansions to symbolise that what passed at the table was \"under the rose.\" One other example we will mention: the Chapter House of York Minster, which is octagonal, and therefore based on the e ight pointed Cross of the Temple, has upon the lintel of the entrance door the following Latin couplet, which, though it looks modern, is s aid to be ancient, but renewed when n ecessary: --  \"Ut Rosa flos florum Sic est domus ista domorum.\" As the Rose is the flower of flowers, s o this house is the house of houses. Under the name of Macons Ecossois, Harodim, the \"Parfait Macon,\" 1743 , gives the degree of Knight of the Sword, or of the East, our Red Cross, as of the time of Darius and Zerrubabel, but in 1766 \"Le Plus Secrets des Hauts Grades,\" omits Darius and adopts Cyrus, and term s the degree a military"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"ceremony, which goes to prove that the Arm y was employed to spread these degrees. Out of these two versions arose the Royal Arch, and other degrees. The 4th point of Harodim - Rosy Cross was made Scottish by claiming Bruce as founder of it as a Knighthood, but Gould has s hown that in ancient times, in the primitive Guilds of Paris, the Masters and Wardens were Esquires, and the Provosts (our Harods) Chevaliers. They also elect ed a Chief who had the title of Prince or King. HO LY ROYAL ARCH, KNIGH T T EMPLAR, PRIEST. This Rite is that of the Ancient Masons of York and London; yet although we have inform ation that in or about 1740 , it was known in London, Dublin, York, Stirling, very little that is reliable has appeared to show its actual origin. It is usually held that it originated with the dissident Ancients; yet as there was no Ancient Grand Lodge at the time when it had some prominence, it could {446 } only ha ve been established b y the numerous Lodges of Masons which then existed, and which did not recognise the Grand Lodge of London. When Rawlinson brags of a 5th Order in 1724 it is just possible he may have belonged to such degree whether then term ed the Red Cross or the Royal Arch. Only one thing is historically certain, sometime between 1723 and 1740 there were ancient pre - 1717 Guild Masons, who were dissatisfied with the \"digestive\" faculties of Anderson and Desaguliers, and made up their m inds to restore to Modern Masonry some part of what it had lost. There are so many features in comm on between the Red Cross of Babylon and the modern Royal Arch degree, that we are quite safe in assuming that there was a primitive Ritual from which both were e volved, an d we can easily prove what that primitive ritual was. The term Red Cross s eems to be far the most appropriate name for the degree, and for this reason that t he term Royal Arch refers to a special G uild which members of this degree are not, they are e ssent ially Craft Masons. Both York and Derm ott practised the Templar degree, but it seems never to have assumed the rank of Masonry, but was occasionally, in all parts, at times, conferred on n on - Masons; whilst t he Priest was essentially a Protestant ceremon ial. THE ARCH. We have previously alluded to the ancient drama, or ann ual Comm emorative Ceremonies, of the primitive Guilds. We have also mentioned that in laying the Foundation S tone of the temple of Solomon, a vault was constructed 1 Reed, or 6 cubi ts, below the floor, where, over the centre, was erected a Pedestal, in which were the plans and a scroll with the first lines of Genesis. This Foundation is laid on the \"Five point method,\" and the instant the centre is fixed it is guarded b y four m en ar med with swords in one hand and b uilding tools in the other. When the fugitives returned from Babylon the centre of Solomon h ad to be found, and the labourers were set to find the vault and report to the duly Passed Masters {447 } w ho had to report to the three Grand Masters. The vault being found, three Passed Masters descended and brought away the plans and the scroll which every modern Arch man brings away also. Nor did these revisers end here; they could not understand why modern Masons had only one G rand Master, whilst the Guilds had three, and they therefore gave the three Principals all the attributes of the original builders of the first temple; these held as their attributes three Rods by which to form a square building, or oblong as the 3 to 1 te mple; the Arch Principals"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"instead of rods have sceptres; the private receptions of these principals, and their secrets, are all but identical with those possessed b y the representatives of S.K.J., H.K.T., and H.A.B. Masons are so utterly careless about hi storical truth, that we might safely have left them to puzzle out the origin of the Arch degree for themselves, but what we have written, we have written. There is no doubt t hat t he old northern Harodim gave much of this inform ation owing to their havin g been of Operative origin before they joined the Grand Lodge of London. The author of \"The Illustrations of Masonry,\" William Preston, who was s ometimes a Modern and sometimes an Ancient, reorganised the system of the Lectures in 1786 under the designati on of the \"Grand Chapter of Harodim,\" and established them in London 4th January, 1787 ; he claims that \"it is of ancient date in different parts of Europe. . . . The Mysteries are peculiar to the Institution, and the Lectures of a Chapter include every bra nch of the Masonic System.\" The Rulers were a General Di rector and a Grand Harod, of which Harodim is the plural. The members were divided into Clause - holders, Sectionists and Lecturers. Thus the 5 first sections would carry a member to the Royal Arch; and four m ore sections c onducted to the \"Ne plus ultra,\" in a total of 81 p oints. The Arch of the Ancients represents the Sanh edrin, composed of 72 members, as a Supreme Court of Judicature amongst the ancient Jews, so also does the Red Cross, {448 } Kni ght of the Sword, and P rince of Jerusalem. Hence it is s upposed to have a standing superior to that of a Grand Lodge which h as irregularly usurped its functions. Although the ritual has undergone many changes, since none of its tinkers s eem to have under stood what it was, there is no doubt that it had d eveloped into a stately reception before the year 1750 . Brother A. J. Cooper Oakley has gone so far as to suggest a more ancient origin for the Arch Pedestal than any previous writer, namely, that it is th e \"Yantram\" or symbol of the Temple of Jehovah, for the temple of every Hindu deity is bound to have a Yantram composed of a geometrical or m onogramm atic emblem upon which the god is placed. An old catechism printed in 1723 asks the question, \"Whence co mes the pattern of an Arch?\" and the answer is, \"From the rainbow.\" Another printed Catechism of 1730 b ut grounded on the modern system of 1717 , speaks of a word \"which was lost, is now found,\" and there are French tracing boards of the Craft for 1743 , wh ich contain the word \"Jehovah,\" and the Rituals of that period say that a word was s ubstituted out of fear lest Hiram should have been induced to reveal the genuine one. We must bear in mind that the work of the Grand Lodge was not that of the Harods, tho ugh Anderson \u0000 s Constitutions of 1723 has the representation of an Arch. Oli ver in h is \"Discrepancies\" embodies the e xcellent authority of the late Peter Gil kes that t he lost secrets of the Moderns, for the Guild had no lost secrets, were anciently g iven to the newly received Master after an interval of 15 d ays, and the old French ritual, before quoted, gives them at the close of the ceremony. There is a symbolism at York and Stirling which seems to make the Arch and the Rainbow synonymous. The minutes of Derm ott \u0000 s Grand Lodge in 1752 mentions the \"absurdities\" of Dr. Macky, of London, \"one of the leg of mutton Masons,\" so called b ecause they made Masons for that useful joint, \"who gave a long story about twelve marble stones, &c., and that the rainbow w as the Royal {449 } Arch.\" Yet Oli ver in confirm ation of this quotes \"an old Masonic work,\" in which the Royal Arch is c arried up from the building of the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"second temple to Moses, Aholiab, and Bezaleel, and from thence to the Altar and Sacrifice of Noah, un der the Rainbow as an Arch, and with the Altar as a Pedestal, thence to the e xpulsion of our first parents from the Garden of Eden.<<\"Landmarks,\" ii, p. 350 .>> Similar m atter is referred to in the Old York Lectures, and its 2nd Degree has a legend of 12 s tones erected in the river Jordan. Dr. Crawley thinks that an incipient form of the Arch degree can be traced in Anderson \u0000 s Constitutions of 1723 ,<<\"Cem. Hib.\">> and that this is hinted at in two parts of the ceremony of Installation of Master, sanction ed b y the Duke of Wharton in 1722 , where he speaks of the \"cement of the Brotherhood,\" and of the \"cement of the Lodge,\" when the \"well built\" Arch was form ed, and the word may have been then given. It is a very plausible theory and the only thing against it is that the oldest rituals we have give no hint of it. The Arch degree, by written evidence, f irst consisted of three steps or Veils, entitled the Excellent, Super - Excellent, and the Royal Arch itself. In the \"Impartial Enquiry\" of Dr. D \u0000 Assigny, p rinted at Dublin in 1744 , he makes allusions to the Arch degree as c omposed of a body of men who had passed the Chair of Master, and alludes to some propagator of degrees in Dublin who claimed to have the York system \"a few years before\" (1744 ), and that h is want of knowledge was exposed b y some brother who was acquainted with the Royal Arch degree as it was practised in London, which is \"prima facia\" evidence that it was widely spread. He adds in a note: \"I am told in that city (York) is held an assembly of Master Masons, under the title of Royal Arch Masons, who as their qualifications and excellencies are superior to o thers, they receive a larger pay than working Masons, of which more hereafter.\" This seems to allude to an Operative Arch Guild at York, as it is doing violence to his language to read it that whilst the Craft was the {450 } initiation of working Masons, the Arch was intended for Initiates and Rulers of a higher standing. At the \"General Assembly on S t. John \u0000 s day,\" there may have been pr actised ceremonies of which we are allowed to have no written knowledge, and which may have been discontinued in the sleep into which it fell between 1740 and 1760 ; their old Lectures ask the question: \"Who amongst Masons are e ntitled to knowledge?\" A. \"T hose who are justly considered Free and Accepted, and have been Exalted to the Royal Arch Degree, and Knighted in a Masonic Encampment.\" D \u0000 Assigny g oes on to say that t here had \"lately\" arrived in Dublin some itinerant Mason, evidently a different perso n to those he had mentioned, who offered to add three more degrees to the Craft, of some \"Italic\" Order, and he warns his brethren against foreign schemers. When Lord Sandwich asked a definition of \"Orthodoxy\" from Bishop Warburton, the latter wittily rep lied, \"Well, my Lord, Orthodoxy is my doxy, but Heterodoxy is another m an \u0000 s doxy.\" Hence we need not worship D \u0000 Assigny \u0000 s doxy; what we learn from his remarks is that about 1740 there had entered Dublin two systems of working the Arch, one of York, and a L ondon one which D \u0000 Assigny favoured, and that these were, in some respects, opposed to each other. The three grades of an \"Italic\" system may have been Clerm ont Templary, Jacobite and Romish. For some 15 or 20 years the Grand Lodge of all England at Yor k was dorm ant, but was revived in 1762 b y one of its old Grand Masters., Francis Drake, Jacobite in h is leanings. The Grand Lodge form ally recognised the Arch, and there are minutes which show that in 1778 the Templar was a"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"ceremony equally recognised. I t would seem, however, that the officers named, 7th Feb., 1762 , are H.Z.J., so that the Arch degree related to the 2nd temple as with Derm ott, but t hat in 1776 it referred to Solomon \u0000 s temple, and would therefore be the \"Arch of Enoch,\" and Oli ver says tha t he saw an old {451 } ritual of 1778 in which this c eremony appears as introductory to the Arch of the 2nd temple, and that after his own Exaltation in 1813 he saw another r itual in which the portion relating to Enoch \u0000 s Arch was s truck out. At a later per iod, however, the officers are those of the 2nd temple as in Derm ott \u0000 s System. The actual earliest mention of the Royal Arch in print is at Youghall in 1743 , where there was a procession of Lodge 21, with display, amongst these particulars we have: \"Fou rthly, the Royal Arch, carried b y two Excellent Masons.\"<<\"Faulkner \u0000 s Dublin Journal,\" 10 - 14, Jany. 1743 (1744 ) quoted b y Dr. Crawley.>> If these grades were given at York b efore 1740 , it is c urious to note that degrees, or systems, called \"Scotch Maste rs,\" are alluded to in minutes. Thus in Royal Cumberland Lodge, 41, Bath, appears the following, 8th January 1746 : \"Brothers Thomas Naish and John Berge were this day, made Scotch Masters, and p aid for m akeing 2s. 6d.\"; five others were received 27 th Novr ., 1754 . In the minutes of the Salisbury Lodge, 19th October, 1746 , we find this: \"At this Lodge were made Scotts Masons, five brethren of the Lodge,\" one of them being the W.M. The Lodge of Longnor, Co. Derby, claim that t hey received the method of the secrets from the rebel Arm y whilst in Derby. Kloss quotes J. F. Pollett as s aying, 25th April, 1763 , that the Scotts \u0000 degree was the same as that known as the Royal Arch of France, where it dates from the raising of the Scottish Regiment Ogilvy in 1746 , a nd he gives the clothing as green and red, which is that of the Red Cross, and the two, crossed, of Harodim - Rosy Cross. This would render it probable that \"Scotts\" in England went with the rebellion of 1745 . The old Scottish Minute books s how Initiations of military men, many of whom joined James II., and established these degrees in the Arm y and on the Continent. Lawrence Derm ott, to whose labours London was indebted for the establishment of the Grand Lodge of the \"Ancients,\" who term ed themselves Yor k Masons also, {452 } had no doubt received the London version of the Royal Arch in Dublin apparently in 1746 .

Cor.\" vi.>> in reference to the Arm s, qu arterly, a lion, ox, man, and eagle, which h e says were found in the collection of the Architect and Brother, Rabbi Jacob Jehudah Leon, who had constructed in 1641 a model of Solomon \u0000 s temple, for the States of Holland, which h e e xhibited in Paris, Vienn a, and in London under the great seal and the signature of Killigrew. At t he same time Leon published a description of his labours entitled \"A relation of the most memorable things in the Tabernacle of Moses, and the temple of Solomon, 1675 ,\" and d edicated it to King Charles II., and Derm ott adds that in 1759 and 1760 he had examined and p erused such curiosities, and he concludes, \"As these were the Arm s of the Masons who had b uilt the Tabernacle and Temple, there is not the least doubt of their being the pr oper Arm s of the most Ancient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, and the continual practice and form alities, and tradition, in all regular Lodges, from the lowest degree to the most high, \"i.e.,\" THE HO LY ROYAL ARCH, confirm s the practi ce thereof.\""},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" Derm ott in h is \"Constitutions\" seems to follow the lines indicated b y Samber in 1721 , and he inform s us that the Arch degree possessed (circa 1740 ) the peculiar square alphabet, which h e says that he had k nown for over 30 years. A similar alphabet was in use amongst the Occultists, who term ed it the \"Aiq Bekar,\" or Cabala of nine chambers; it is found in Barrett \u0000 s \"Magus,\" and when dissected gives an alphabet of 9 characters increased to 27 b y adding to the first series one and two dots res pectively; Trithemius, the friend of Cornelius Agrippa, is known to have possessed it. In reference to Derm ott \u0000 s c laim to the Arm s used b y Rabbi Leon, it is easy to prove that they were not used b y Craft Lodges, unless it might have been by some unknown {453 } Speculative branch. All the ancient Guild MSS ., which add Arm s, use those granted to the London Company of Masons in 1472 , or a variation of them. Randal H olme gives these in h is \"Acadamie of Arm orie,\" with triple towers, according to the original grant, but he adds as s upporters, which are not in the Grant, two pillars of the Corinthian Order, \"or,\" or gold. But we cann ot hastily dismiss Derm ott \u0000 s c ontention, for Leon \u0000 s Arm s of the Masons were used b y the Grand Chapter of York, and Bro. W. H. Ryl ands posesses an old p anel brought from St. Albans, of date circa 1675 - 80 which gives these Arm s over the interlaced square, level, and p lumb of the Masons. There are moreover Rosicrucian and Cabalistic works which treat of these symbols, and it is probab le, as they represent the bann ers of the four leading Hebrew tribes, that Leon might derive them from the Cabala or Talmud, or he might have been a member of the ancient Jewish Guild. In Masonry peculiar systems are taken up b y small bodies, then die out, to be revived in another part of the country. The \"Book of Razael,\" alluded to by Cornelius Agrippa in h is book on \"Magic,\" affords evidence of the signs used in the Arch degree, and the \"Exagogue\" of the Jew Ezekiel, written, so Wharton thinks, after th e destruction of Jerusalem, and translated into Latin by Fr. Morellus at Paris in 1580 , gives details which have reference to the Signs of the Veils, omitted from the modern ceremony, but which gave the titles of Excellent and Super - excellent. Clemens and Eusebius give portions of the drama, so its great antiquity is unquestionable. The following seems to have been the general practice before the modern revision; Masons under the G.L. of the Ancients prefaced the Arch ceremony by the Mosaical Veils; those under the G.L. of the Moderns prefaced it with the Arch of Enoch. France at the same period had a degree said to refer to the time of Vespasian which they term ed the Royal Arch of York. A London Lodge of 1754 p ractised d egrees to which the ordinary Ma son was not admitted; Derm ott t erm s it {454 } Ancient Masonry held every third Lodge night, on account of extraordinary benefits its members had received abroad. The Lodge met at the Ben John son \u0000 s Head in S pitalfields, and Grand Lodge censured them. Moder ns, however, became members of both the Royal Arch and Templar, but without the sanction of their Grand Lodge. They sought and obtained from Lord Blaney, 22nd July, 1767 , a Charter of Institution and Protection, f orm ulated a \"Charter of Compact\" in 1778 , and p rinted an \"Abstract of Laws for the Society of Royal Arch Masons in London,\" 1778 , and followed b y a 2nd edition in 1782 . Bristol had a Lodge founded in 1757 and erased in 1769 , in which the Arch degree was worked. A Charter was granted in 1769 to M anchester under the title of \"The Euphrates Lodge, or Chapter of the Garden of Eden, No. 2\"; the writer tried to save it from erasure in 1854 , but the old members were indifferent to its fate.

In Octr. 1778 , the term Companion is used, and Dunckerley g ives the Chapter perm issio n to make Knights Templars. In 1769 the Arch was known at Darlington, Co. of Durham. as the \"Hierarchal Lodge\"; and Lodge 124 , Durham possessed the Mark as we read 21st Decr., 1773 , \"Brother Barwick was also made a Mark \u0000 d Mason, and Bro.

TEMPLAR PRIEST. All the Templar bodies of the 18th century in Englan d, Ireland, and Scotland, possessed this degree, which was at one time in esteem; it is now entirely abandoned; in Ireland b ecause the Orangemen obtained it, at a time when there was a close alliance between that body and Freemasonry. The ceremony is an e mbodiment of Fludd \u0000 s idea that: \"It is under the type of an Architect that the prophet warns us -- \u0000 Let us go up to the mountain of reason and there build the Temple of Wisdom. \u0000 \" Again, its laws have: \"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath h ewn out the seven pillars thereof.\" The rite had seven steps, or journeys, with seven passwords, and seven species of refreshment, seven seals, and seven emblems. Its c ertificates s ometimes gave the e ra a s \"the year of revival 1686 .\" In the French Ordre du Temple t he Profession of Knight exacted the tonsure, and conferred clerical functions; and it is a reasonable conjecture that conscientious c onvictions led to the e stablishment of the degree, in or about the date named. The Early Grand Lodge of Ireland d ated its Era from 32 A.D. York Templars did the same.  KNIGH T T EMPLAR. The e arly history of this degree, or Order, is s hrouded in much mystery, and all that we can do in the e lucidation of it in this c ountry is to give such views as have some probability. The writer suggested in \"Notes on the Order of the Temple, etc,\" 1869 , that it entered England with the followers of James I., after 1603 . Bro. F. F. Schn itger, in a Lecture given at Newcastle, sought t o show, and with some force , that all the charges brought against t he actual {459 } Knights of the Temple in 1311 can be e xplained b y a forced and false view of certain Rites in the modern ceremony, which proves an actual descent of the ritual from the ancient body. In a lecture b y the late Bro. T. B. Whitehead, of York, some years ago, he advocated the probable conn ection of the Templars, whom Archbishop Greenfield p laced in the Monastery of St. Mary \u0000 s Abbey, and the York Guild Masons. Through the Knights of St. John and the Temp le some such conn ection is feasible, as Masonic history asserts that in 1500 the Knights in London and the Guild Masons were under the protection of Henry VII. Lessing advocates the chivalric union through a certain h ouse at which Wren assembled, with h is Masons, during the e rection of St. Paul \u0000 s. Bro. Henry Sadler<<\"Facts and Fictions.\">> shows that numerous independent Lodges existed term ed \"ye Holy Lodge of St John ,\" and the Grand Lodge list of 1723 , contains a Lodge held at St. John \u0000 s Gate, Clerkenwel l, the old p roperty of the Knights, and the Lodge must have withdrawn itself at once, as it is not mentioned in later lists. Hogarth in h is burlesque of the \"Scalde Miserable Masons,\" has the Tyler of \"His Grace of Wattin, Grand Master of the Holy Lodge"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"o f St. John of Jerusalem at Clerkenwell.\" By Whattin does he allude to the Duke of Wharton? It would seem so. During the 18th and 19 th century the \"Gate\" was a favourite meeting place for conferring the high grades and was much frequented b y the adjacent Lodges. The Grand Master at Malta in 1740 expelled six o f his Knights for being Freemasons. The late Bro. Col. W. J. B. McLeod Moore, of Canada, a Past G.M. of Templars, had a theory, which h e had received from an aged Danish Physician, and which incl uded Templars and Masons. He asserts that the Benedictines, who date circa 600 A.D., practised the sacred mysteries of the \"Arcane Discipline\" of the Alexandrian Church. The aged Dane inform ed him that the King of {460 } Denmark was head of a secret non - M asonic Society in the 18th century, of which h e himself was a member in 1785 . It had seven degrees. When the United Orders of St. John and the Temple were suppressed in the 16th century, and Torphican and its Knights dissolved, these fugitives c arried th eir m ysteries to Denmark, and that he belonged to the body at Copenh agen 60 years previously. These sacred Mysteries represented the Fall of Man; his Redemption by sacrifice; and the Resurrection.<<\"Canadian Craftsman,\" vol. 19 - 22, 1885 - 8.>> They saw Ch rist by Faith and represented his doctrine by symbols; they taught that none can claim the right of eternal li fe beyond the grave, but those that \"believe on Him that liveth, and was dead, and is now alive for everm ore.\" The object, the e nd, the result of the great speculations of antiquity, was the ultimate ann ihilation of evil, and the restoration of man to his first state by a Redeemer, a Master, a Christus, the Incarnate Word. Of course this v iew as to the Mystery of the Templars has been advocated by many writers, and has been equally applied to Masonry by Samber in 1721 , by Ramsay in 1737 , and is the same thing as the claim to a Culdee origin by the Harodim - Rosy - Cross. There were, as we have indicated, many similar Societies and the following may be noted. On 6th Dec., 1623 , John Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley Carlton, a letter which appears in the \"Court and Times of James the First\" (London, 1848 ), from which it appears that Lord Vaux \u0000 s regiment had brought from the Low Countries a Society the members of which h ad b ecome numerous in London, and \"under colour of good fellowship have taken certain oaths and Orders, to be true and faithful to the Society, and conceal one another \u0000 s s ecrets . . . having a Prince . . . wearing blue or yellow ribbons, having certain n icknames for their several Fraternities.\" Apparently all the form ula of Freemasonry. The Stuarts in the 17th century made an effort to revive the Order of St. John and the Temple, then of Malta, and {461 } a North Convent seems to have e xisted about Montrose, and it is alleged, on the authority of Dom Calmet, that Viscount Dundee was Grand Master of \"the Order of Templars in S cotland,\" and that when h e fell at Killiekrankie he wore the Grand Cross which was given to Dom Calmet by his brot her. It is also asserted that Mar and Athol succeeded him, and that Prince Charles Edward Stuart was installed Grand Master at Holyrood in 1745 , and that John Oli vant of Bachilton succeeded him, and held the office until his death, 15th Oct., 1795 .<<\"Scot tish S tatutes of the Temple.\">> After this the remnant of the Order is s aid to have united with some Scoto - Irish Templars, of whom Alexander Deuchar, Lyon Herald, was Grand Master, and who said, no doubt truthfully, that he could trace the Order back in S cotland to 1740 , by means of living members."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":" It is quite certain that t here was at t his period in France an \"Ordre du Temple,\" with a charter from John Mark Larm enius who claimed appointment from Jacques de Molay. Philip of Orleans accepted the Grand M astership in 1705 and signed the Statutes. Its enemies, in recent years, have asserted that these Statutes were forged b y the Jesuit Father Bonani, and that it was actually the resuscitation of a 1681 Society entitled the \"Little resurrection of Templars, \" and that it had as one of its members the learned Fenelon who converted Ramsay to Orthodoxy. In any case, if of 1705 , the Charter proves the existence of a branch of Scottish Templars, because it was c onsidered necessary to place them, with the Knights of St. John , \"outside the bounds of the Temple, now and for ever.\" In 1766 , de Tschoudy speaks well of these French Knights as the \"Fraternity of Jerusalem,\" nicknamed \"Freres de Aloya\" from the compositon of their suppers. At Stirling a system of Maso nic Templary prevailed which they attributed, rightly or wrongly, to certain Knights of St. John and the Temple who became protestants, and joined the Masonic Lodge at that place, {462 } w hence an order of \"cross - legged masons\" arose. We should p ut it that the Knights c ontinued the superintendence of the Masons of their Domus. In confirm ation of this they show two rudely - cut brass plates about 9 x 3 inches, which they believe to date into the 17th century. The first of these has on one side, the words STI RLING ANTIENT LODG E, and the Apprentice Symbols; -- the obverse having the Fellow Craft emblems. The 2nd contains on one side the Masters \u0000 symbols, -- two pillars, sun, moon, figures 1 to 12 in a circle (a clock); obverse, at top the words RE DD - CROSS OR A RK , with a cross, a dove, and an ark; at bottom, a series of concentric arches, like a rainbow, but with a Key - stone in place, within a border of three e qual divisions the inscription S EPULCHRE , with an adze, stone, and sarcophagus.

There is a minute of 1784 that Alexr. Craig then conferred on certain brethren the Order of Malta, and that about 10 years previously he had conferred the degrees of Excellent, super Excellent. The objection is s ometimes made that as Masonry was a n Operative Guild they were not a likely body to have continued d ifficult Rites and ceremonies, or to have appreciated anything but simple tokens of recognition. But this is a very shallow view to take as will be apparent {463 } w hen we remember that Mason s, and other trade Guilds, were e ngaged for ages in the spectacular dramas entitled the Mystery plays, and they were therefore, from ancient times,"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"the very men who were most likely to appreciate such Rites in their own secret Assemblies.

There is a valuable paper on this s ubject by Bro. C. A. Cameron.<<A.Q.C., 1900 .>> It appears that the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland on the 29th Au g t. 1805 , issued a document contesting a proposal of the Grand Lodge to take over the control of that body, in which it is s aid, -- \"Our Early Grand Encampment of Ireland has s ubsisted in the City of Dublin for above a century,\" and additional currency was given to this by Caesar Gautier, who says, -- \"its age was above a century, as appears by its books.\" Some of its Warrants established b odies of non - Masonic Templars of St. John , and the like is known to have been the case, from time to time, in England, Ireland, Scotland, and in America a s s ays Dr. Folger; and although all the Ancient Masons in these countries gave the Templar in succession to the Arch degree, there seems equally a feeling everywhere, that it was not looked upon as a Masonic degree. There was form erly an Early Grand b ody at Carisbrooke, I. of Wight; they also existed in Lancashire, and I have supplied to enquirers c opies of a Ritual of 1800 . The body ceased to meet about 1836 . The \"Freemasons \u0000 Quarterly\" (1846 p . 176 ) gives inform ation i n regard to an Early Grand Encampment of England, the minutes of which passed into the hands of the Duke of Sussex, G.M. It contained a curious document of 1312 in the shape of a Prayer, or supplication {464 } of the ancient Knights, at the time of their t rial, at the hands of the two scoundrels Bertrand d e Goth, and P hilip le Bel, a coiner of false money. This ancient document is s aid to have been deposited under the high - altar of the Temple Church London, where it was discovered in 1540 . Then it passed, -- how is not stated, -- into the hands of Jacob Ulric St. Clair of Roslyn, in whose family it was handed d own, until i t came to William St. Clair, the Scottish Grand Master of 1736 , who gave it to his nephew John S t. Clair, M.D., of Old Castle, Co. of Me ath, who translated it, with assistance, and forwarded this c opy to the said E. C. E. of England. There was however a second b ody of Templars in Ireland term ed the \"High Knights Templar,\" who conferred the Rite under their Craft Charter. These men appl ied in 1770 to the Kilwinn ing Lodge of Scotland for a Charter under the designation of the \"High Knights Templar Kilwinn ing Lodge,\" who granted the same without any enquiry. It is s aid that Baron Donoughmore was their G.M. in 1770 , and that these said H.K .T. of Ireland \u0000 s Kilwinn ing Lodge in 1779 conferred the degrees of E., S.E., H.R.A. The Knights Templar are mentioned in 1786 , 1792 ; and the Rose Croix, is s aid to have been carried to Dublin by the Chevalier St. Laurent. The Early Grand has been extin ct for half a century but at t he present moment is represented in S cotland b y an independent body working the degrees of Red Cross of Rome and Constantine; Kt. of St. John ; Knt. of the Holy Sepulchre; the Christian Mark; the T. I. O. of the Cross; Pilgrim, Templar, Mediterranean Pass, and Knight of Malta. Besides which they recognise other side degrees form erly practised in S cotland. It appears that after the Early Grand Encampment of Ireland had issued some 30 Charters to Britain they"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"gave to Brother Rob ert Martin as Grand Master, in 1822 , a Charter of renunciation of rights and of Erection under which this body works to the present time quite unattached to the ordinary history of Templary in S cotland. {465 } At York the Templar was form ally recognised by the Grand Lodge, and they chartered several subordinate \"Royal Encampments\" before 1780 , when a Charter was granted, 6th July, to Rotherham. We have mentioned that t he \"Modern\" members of the Royal Arch h ad established themselves under a so - called Ch arter of Compact, and the Templars of Bristol executed a similar Charter, 20th Decr., 1780 , with Joshua Springer as G.M. Its 20 rules will be found in W. J. Hughan \u0000 s \"English Rite;\" in which they style themselves, -- \"The Supreme Grand and Royal Encampmen t of the Order of Knights Templars of St. John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitallers, and Knights of Malta, &c.;\" these Regulations s ettle the question of Costume, &c., but we have not t he \"Charter of Compact\" itself, nor the bodies thus compacted. About t he year 1790 Thomas Dunckerley, who had long taken a very important part, in every degree of Freemasonry, and was Grand Superintendent of the Royal Arch for Bristol & c., and he himself writes to the York Encampment of Redemption, 24th July, 1791 , that the Bristol Knights had requested him to take the Grand Mastership of their Order, which of course would include all the bodies which h ad \"Compacted,\" no doubt Bath and Salisbury. There was an Encampment term ed the \"Observance\" of London, which h ad evidently a Foreign origin, as Lambert de Lintot, who was a P.M. of Lodge \"St. George of Observance,\" and who had b een initiated in 1743 , had for many y ears been working the seven degree system of the French Templary of Clerm ont, ostensibly as \"Agent of Prince Charl es Edward Stuart.\" A Rose Croix ritual in French was printed at London which says that a member of the degree had \"power to assemble Masons, and p erfect t hem up to the 6th degree of Ecossaise Knight of the East;\" qualifying for the 7th Degree of R.C. B ath, it has already been n oted, had the practice of \"Scotts \u0000 Masonry\" in 1746 , nor was it then abandoned, {466 } for there are other m inutes of 1754 .

Judge Wright gave prominence to a degree term ed \"Red Cross of Rome and Constantine\" which h as been revived as a special Rite in recent years. It also appears that French Masons had introduced into London various degrees, of which the members belonged to a Lodge chartered b y the G. L. of London {467 } in 1754 . On the death of Lambert de Lintot, about 1775 , an Inventory was taken of his effects in which n umerous references are found to French h ig h - grades, which are not now practised.<<Vide \"Knept,\" viii, p. 22.>> The Initiation of Lintot must have taken place about 1743 , when the Jacobites were very active, and meditating a descent on England, to enforce the rights of the Stuarts.

CONTINENTAL ECOSS AISISME. We have already alluded to the e xistence in France of two species of Masonry the e arlier of which was that of the Jacobites and term ed Ecossaisme, the ritual of Modern Masonry was later by a generation. Two works published in France in 1727 and 1731 had some influence upon the high - grades; the first was the \"Travels of Cyrus\" by the Chevalier Andrew Michael Ramsay; and the other was the \"Life of Sethos\" by the Abbe Terasson; but they founded no degrees. There need b e no mystery in regard to Ramsay \u0000 s degrees, but there is much as to where he received them. Born in 1680 it is pretty clear that the system to which h e belong ed was not that of the Grand Lodge of London and though h e was in England and Scotland, 1728 - 36, there is no record to show that he mixed with the Modern Lodges, but we have given a q uotation from a work of Dean S wift \u0000 s that has s ome affinity. French wr iters s eem to be of the opinion that the e arliest additions to the Craft degrees were three, term ed \"Irlandais,\" and included a Potent, or Powerful Irish Master. Then succeeded \"Ecossais\" degrees; usually assumed to be {468 } a 4th Degree voted b y the Craf t Lodge, to which Professor Robison, who was a member, assigns the date 1690 ; but if, at an early date, it had reference to o ne degree only, it ended in being applied to all degrees of the \"Ancient\" system. The first step in the increase of the degrees was this: In old p re - 1717 Guild Masonry there was a trial of three traitors, and this s ystem applies it in the best form ; and as old Jacobite Masonry was that of the old Scottish Operative Lodges, and as the portion was omitted b y the \"Moderns,\" though adopte d b y the Ancient - Moderns, so, as the Modern Rituals became known, three degrees of Elect -- of 9; of 15; and of Sublime, were e stablished. The Heredom - Rosy Cross was the old Guild P assed Master or Harodim. Out of these sprang the high - grade system, but m ost of these degrees were soon perm eated b y Herm etic influence -- and I will therefore first speak of it. "},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"  ROSICRUCIANISM. One of the first Societies to make use of the Craft as a basis for their own operations was the Rosic rucian, and it may even date from the time of Agrippa, and Fludd. Abroad the same view w as adopted b y the \"Golden Rosy Cross,\" and, once inaugurated, the Herm etic c ulte e xpanded. In 1714 a Germ an pastor of the name of S. Richter published a book entitled \"Sincerus Renatus,\" which contains the basis of the order of the \"Golden Rosicrucians,\" and which, itself, contains many points which resemble Modern Freemasonry. About the year 1730 , when the two Societies had b een associated p ublicly, some of the form e r joined the latter. In 1716 Richter published at Breslau, -- \"The true and complete preparation of the Philosopher \u0000 s Stone of the Brotherhood of the Golden Rosy Cross for the benefit of the Sons of the Doctrine.\" In this he says that \"some years ago the Masters of the Rosicrucians went to India, and since that time none of them have remained in Europe.\" {469 } Mr. \"Karl Kisewetter,\" to whom we referred in a previous c hapter, has s tated that his grandfather was Imperator of the Order between 1764 and 18 02, and that amongst his papers is mentioned, under the Cypher of F.R.C. an Adept who lived in h onourable imprisonment at Dresden, and who made four quintals of gold for the Prince of Saxony, and that he vanished, in a mysterious way, leaving some \"tinctur e of health.\" His s erving brother Johann Gotleib Fried, was afterwards employed at Taucha, near Leipzig, and had some of the tincture which \"was of lead and quicksilver and found to give true results.\" The last mentioned Imperator of the operative craft was admitted at Amsterdam by Tobias Tschultze. In religious matters the then members s eemed to have sympathised with Boehme, and were in touch with the \"Emanation\" theory of the Cabala, and therefore with the ancient Gnostics. Then arose an amalgamation with the Masonic Rite founded b y Martines Pasqually in 1754 , and that of his pupil the Marquis de St. Martin, and which was instituted after a journey which the form er m ade to the East. Schrepper, St. Germ ain, and Cagliostro, are said to have been conn ect ed with this Order of the Golden Rosy Cross; but t he Masonic element, and a conn ection with the Illuminati of Germ any, would seem, says \"Keiswetter,\" to have forced it out of its grooves, and in 1792 it was decided to relieve the members from their vows, a nd to destroy their archives.  THEURGIC. Martines Pasqually was making proselytes between 1754 and 1762 under a Jacobite authority of 20th May, 1738 , which describes Charles Stuart as King of Scotland, Ireland, and England , and Grand Master of All Lodges on the face of the e arth. According to the book \"Martinesisme,\" (Paris, 1899 ) which seems to be written on the e vidence afforded b y contemporary writers, he added three degrees of Apprentice Coen, Companion Coen, and {470 } Master Coen. A letter says, -- \"I have been received Master Coen, in passing from the triangle to the circles.\" The seventh degree was that of Rose Croix. His work was Theurgic and sought union with deity, as in Oriental Societies. He traced the Initi atory Circles, and the Sacred Words himself; and p rayed with great humility and fervour in the name of Christ. Then the super - human beings appeared in full light to bless the labours. After these had d eparted Martines instructed his"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Disciples how to o bta in like results, and it was to these only to whom he gave the 7th Degree of Rose Croix. Females were not refused admission. Jean Baptist Willerm oz organised the Rite at Lyons about 1760 and the Marquis de St. Martin was a member between 1785 and 1790 , wh en h e resigned, having first made a system of his own by extending the degrees. The Rite of Cagliostro was c learly that of Pasqually, as evidenced b y his complete ritual which h as recently been printed in the Paris Monthly -- \"Initiation;\" it follows s o closely the Theurgy above noted, that it need leave no doubt as to whence Cagliostro derived his s ystem; and as he stated himself that it was founded on the MS. of a George Cofton, which h e had acquired in London, it is pretty certain that Pasqually had D isciples in the Metropolis. Chastann ier was at one time acting with Cagliostro, and left a Rite term ed Swedenborg in London. Amongst the Masonic Rites which dabbled more or less in Herm eticism and Theurgy may be mentioned the Beneficent Knights of the Holy City; the Philalethes; the Philadelphes; the Unknown Philosophers; the Philosophic Scotch rite; the True Mason; the Herm etic Rose Croix; the Cabalistic Rite; the Illuminees of Avignon, f ounded b y Dom Pernetti; a system of Masonic Rosicrucianism and Al chemy was worked in Hungary by the Knights of St. Andrew in 1773 . There was also the Fratres Lucis, or Brothers of Light, of which an {471 } interesting ritual appears in the \"Theosophical Review\" of 1899 .  THE HO MUNC ULI. Som e of the Lodges appear to have gone in for the creation of the \"Homunculi\" of Paracelsus, and Dr. Hartmann in h is \"Life of Paracelsus,\" gives a very lengthy and curious account from a MS. diary printed in the \"Sphinx\" of Dr. Emiel Besetzay published at Vie nn a in 1873 , and which is s hortly as follows. The Count Joh. Ferd. Von Keuffstein, in Tyrol 1775 , carried these bodies in bottles to the Lodge of which h e was Master, where they were seen by Count Max. Lemberg, Count Franz Josef Von Thurn and others. Thes e Homunculi were created b y Keuffstein, and the Abbe Geloni, or Schiloni. Owing to the bottle being overturned one of the objects died, and the Count attempted to make another, but in the absence of the Abbe he only succeeded in making something of the na ture of a leech, which soon died. It is however impossible to dwell at length upon the numerous Rites which sprang out of the Herm etic and Mystic c ulte, and we must return to the basis upon which the e xisting and p opular Rites are founded, and which we have already pointed out is to be found in the \"Elect\" degrees, and in the \"Harodim,\" and, as well, in the legends of the old operative Guilds.  CUMULATION OF RITES. Although Rites were being established with feverish h aste, thei r cumulation into o ne Rite of numerous degrees was gradual. Though Derwentwater was considered, as we have shown, to be Grand Master of the Scottish system, yet the real claim to rule was in the hands of the Masters \u0000 Fraternity. There is little truth to be gathered from the pretended history of Modern Masonry, and when Past G. M. Richmond had b rought the Duc d \u0000 Antin into the Modern system in 1737 , and made him G.M. until his death 11th Decr. 1743 , the Venerables"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"assembled and {472 } elected the Comte de C lerm ont as G.M. of a new Grand Lodge \"Anglais,\" and a law w as passed that the claims of the Ecossaise had recently arisen and were not to be recognised. Kloss gives an extract from an address published in the \"Franc Maconn e\" of 1744 , thus translated.<<\"Fr em. Quart.\" 1853 . K. R. H. Mackenzie.>> -- \"Ignorance is s o comm on that t he Masters and Wardens do not know that Masonry consists of seven degrees and the \"Loge Generale,\" in its blindness, resolved, on the 11th Dec. 1743 , to regard the Masons of the fourt h degree, that is to say the Scotch Masters, only as comm on Apprentices and Fellow Crafts.\" This refers to the law of the English Grand Lodge just mentioned, and if, it has any meaning it is, that the Modern Masons were ignorant legislators who considered the Scots \u0000 degrees as the equivalent of the Modern Craft, and some historians of to day fall into the same error. The French Heredom - Rosy - Cross c onsisted of three steps: -- (1) Lectures on the Craft; (2) the temple of Zerubbabel; (3) the Rosy Cross; (4 ) the Knighthood which is attributed to Bruce, and which it was s ought to tack on to the Order of the Thistle. Out of these an Order of Templars, of which Bruce had assumed the protection in 1314 was established at Clerm ont, and with which Ramsay, a disci ple of Fenelon, who belonged to the Temple, is s upposed to have had some conn ection about the year 1740  CHAPTER OF CLER MONT. The original degrees of this Chapter were Scotch Master Elect; Knight of the Eagle; Illustrious Templar ; and a little later a 4th degree was added viz.: that of Sublime Knight. Graf von S chmettau introduced these claims into Hamburg in 1742 . In 1741 Field Marshal Von Marshall was admitted a Knight; the Baron Von Hunde followed in 1743 . The Baron Von Weil er claimed to have received the degrees in 1743 at Rome, by some one whom he term s Lord Raleigh, the reception being {473 } made in a church of the Benedictines with two Monks in attendance. Out of this s prang the Germ an Rite of \"Strict Observance,\" worked jointly by Marshall and Hunde, the latter of whom said that he had b een created b y Lord Kilmarnock, the Grand Master of Scotland, and that Lord George Clifford acted as Prior, that he was then introduced to the \"Knight of the Red Feather,\" whom he believe d to be Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and the Supreme Grand Master. At a later period he sent two members to England and Scotland, who returned with a charter in cypher, creating him the head of the Seventh Province. Between the years 1743 - 7 Sir Samuel Lockhart constituted Lodges of a Rite called the Vielle Bru, or Faithful Scots, at Toulouse, at Montpelier, and at Marseilles in 1751 . The Rite, if we know it, drew on the legends of the old operative Guilds and d id not proceed in its instruction beyond the 2nd temple. It consisted of 9 d egrees of which the last was Menatzchim, or Prefects. In 1751 a similar Rite, and evidently derived from it, existed at Paris under the designation of \"Knights of the East,\" and ruled b y a de Valois. It was democratic in its nature, whilst the Clerm ont Chapter was aristocratic. This Clerm ont Chapter in 1754 had added, to its degrees, under an unknown de \"Bonn eville\" some of those of the Vielle Bru, as well as others of an Apocalyptic character, that we may find amongst the Friends of the Cross, the Militia Crucifera, and the Christian Fraternity of Andrea, previously referred to."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" Brunswick received the degrees of the Clerm ont Chapter before any g reat change was made, and the following account has recently appeared fr om the pen of Archivist and Librarian F.

The 1754 version of the degrees in Brunswick was as follows; after the three Craft degrees: -- 4th Degree, Maitre Ecossais. (Scotch Master). 5th Degree, Maitre Eleu. (Master Elect, or Knight of the Eagle). 6th Degree, Maitre Illustre. (Illustrious Master, or Knight of the Holy Sepulchre). 7th Degree, Maitre Sublime.

In the 7th Degree, a hexagonal star of mother of pearl, suspended from the neck b y a black ribbon). Bro. Kistner goes on to say that the Jesuits c reated clerical grades for the Jerusalem ones; and that in 1758 certain French Officers, prisoners of war, introduced the degrees into Berlin, with some changes, the organisation consisted of three grades, -- \"Capitulum Electum;\" Illustrious; Sublime. Pastor Philip Samuel Rosa introduced it into Brunswick, where he received \"seven members\" into it.  I. It ca nn ot be denied that between 1725 - 47 the Irish, English and Scottish Jacobites were making political capital out of Masonry, and the e ventual changes may be thus s umm arised. Their first essay, though the e vidence is slight, would seem to have been, after t he Craft degrees, -- 4th Degree, Irish Master; 5th Degree, Perfect Master; 6th Degree, {475 } Powerful Master.

It was c onstituted b y a Brother of the name of Marchot, and it is necessary to mention it here, because several of its degrees went to swell the \"Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite\" of 33 Degrees, which was known at Geneva before 1797 , as Chemin Dupontes gives a certificate of i t at that date, granted to Villard Espinasse, an officer of the Grand Orient of France: the 33rd Degree title of Grand Inspector General was acquired b y the G.L. of France from the dignatory Officers of the \"Emperors\" when, together with the \"Knights of th e East,\" the remains of these Orders united with the Grand Orient in 1786 , and into which de Tschoudy had introduced the \"Noachite.\"<<Thory.>> Between 1762 and 1780 , this de Tschoudy was working a Rite of his own term ed \"Adoniramite Masonry,\" of which t he last is the 13th degree or Noachite; but it is not a Rite of any importance in this enquiry.  THE MORINITE R ITE OF PER FECTION, 25 DEGREE S. We are now approaching a subject which in every way is discreditable to Freemasonry. Stephe n Morin {479 } proceeded to San Domingo, as we have said, with a patent of the 25th Degree as Grand Inspector of Lodges, but there is no evidence of what he did until l ater. On the 17th Au gust, 1766 , he was accused in Grand Lodge of \"propagating strange an d monstrous doctrines,\" and his patent of a Grand Inspector was withdrawn; and the rank conferred on Henry Martin, who was proceeding to San Domingo. Upon this Morin, no doubt with revenge in h is heart, proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica, where in 1767 he e st ablished a Grand Consistory of the 25th Degree, off his own bat. We know quite well, on the e vidence of his own rituals what the changes which he made were. The \"Freemasons \u0000 Magazine\" for 1885 (p. 506 - 7) gives a full description of his ritual of 1767 . He had with h im, or they were sent after him, certain statutes of 1762 , enacted and agreed to at the East of \"Paris and Bordeaux,\" and are so designated, even in the reprint of them which the late Bro. Albert Pike made. In 1767 Morin term s them of \"Berli n and P aris,\" and says they were of the \"Grand East of France and P russia.\" To give a colour to this lie he introduced the degree of Prussian Noachite, which h ad b een translated, from the Germ an, at Paris in 1757 . This he ranked as 21st Degree, and added the degree of \"Key of Masonry\" which h e had on h is patent of 1761 , to the 23rd Degree \"Knight of the Sun.\" He shows his ignorance of Prussian h eraldry by using the double headed Eagle of the \"Emperors,\" and retaining the mantling of the French Royal Arm s . He probably -- ignorant charlatan as he was -- mistook Frederick II., Grandson of Barbarossa, an actual King of Jerusalem, for his c ontemporary Frederick II. of Prussia."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" He seems to have shown ability in selecting energetic and p ugnacious individuals as his disciples. He first conferred the degrees of his irregular Consistory at Kingston upon Henry Andrew Franken in 1767 , who admitted M. M. Hayes, of Boston, who conferred the {480 } same on S pitzer of Charleston, who received others until we find them in possession of Mitchell and Dalcho. In 1802 , when these latter issued to the world their Manifesto, they had certainly heard of the increase of the rite by 8 d egrees, though they would seem to have been ignorant of their very names. In this Manifesto all the falsities of Morin are accepted without question, and others are added to them, as for instance, Challon de Joinville is term ed \"Deputy of the King of Prussia,\" instead of what he actually was, Deputy of the Count of Clerm ont. When they forged the name of Frederick of Prussia to a charter they had d iscovered that several of the 8 added d egrees were taken from the \"Primaeval Rite,\" or that of Namur 1770 . On the 21st February, 1802 , Mitchell and Dalcho signed a patent of the 33rd Degree on behalf of de Grasse Tilly, and also for Pierre Delorne of San Domingo. Franken also conferred the 25th Degree upon Au gustin Prevost, as Deputy Inspector of the Windward Islands and the British Arm y; and this Brother in 1776 conferred the degrees upon J. P. Roche t of Scotland, who is understood to have e stablished them there. Prevost also conferred the degrees upon Major Charles Sh erriff of Whitchurch, who was propagating them between 1783 - 8, and who gave Laws and a Charter for the Ineffable degrees to Grand Trea surer Haseltine, and Grand Secretary White, through whom they entered the Templar Conclaves. One important fact is little known. When de Grasse Tilly was a prisoner of war in England, one or two French Lodges were e stablished b y him and his c onfreres, an d in 1811 Ben Plumm er and six o ther \"Noble Knights\" -- the requisite seven -- were received members of the Conclave at Bath. Plumm er had b een member of a Lodge held at Wincanton in S omersetshire, and on the 20th, 5th month, 1813 , Tilly certificated him as a member of Lodge \"Les Mars et de Neptune\" of which h e was Master at Abergavenn y, and term s him \"a Royal {481 } Grand Comm ander of Templars,\" which h e had attained before his membership at Bath, where he was regularised. THE MARTIN RITE OF T HE GRAND LODG E, 25 DEGREE S. In the meanwhile the Grand Lodge of France was asserting itself, and as Henry Martin was proceeding to the West Indies he was appointed a Grand Inspector to supersede Morin, and Rituals, stamped, signed, and sealed, were ord ered 17 th Au gust, 1766 , to be prepared and handed to him. He laboured at the Consistory previously established b y Morin, though little is recorded. He was s ucceeded in h is office by Matthew Dupotet, with whom was the Frenchman Joseph Cerneau. In 1801 it is believed that Dupotet and Germ an Hacquet had converted the Consistory of San Domingo into a S. G. C. of the 33rd Degree of the Scottish Rite. Towards the e nd of 1802 a second insurrection of the blacks occurred, and Cerneau fled to Cuba, and Hacquet t o France by way of New York. Dupotet would seem to have appointed, 1st July, 1806 , Joseph Cerneau, as Grand Inspector for Cuba. Hacquet revived the Rite in the Grand Orient of France in 1803 , and Cerneau established a S.G.C. 33rd Degree in New York 22 nd October, 1807 , yet flourishing. Emanuel de la Motta,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"of Charleston, in 1813 gave him trouble by establishing his S.G.C. there; Folger treats him as a crazy lunatic; he acted it well. It may be mentioned that the Lacornites c ontinued to give trouble to the G.L. of France, and in 1766 a dozen of them were e xpelled. The Count of Clerm ont died 16 th June, 1771 , and with the aid of the Duke of Luxemburg, and the recognition of the Grand Lodge of London, Philip Egalite was elected G.M. of a new Grand Orient, which in 1786 reduced the degrees to seven, or 8 with the Kadosh. Now w e have the \"Martinites,\" the \"Morinites,\" and the \"French Rite;\" and the chief distinction between the two form er is this: in the Rite of Morin the 33rd Degree claims to govern all M asonry under the pretended charter of {482 } Frederick of Prussia; with the Rite of Martin the bodies are governed chiefly by the 32nd Degree, the 33rd Degree form ing a Supreme Court of Appeal.  CHANGES ON THE CRAFT UNION OF 1813 . Conside rable changes arose in the Constitution of the High grades on the Union of the two rival bodies denominated \"Ancient\" and \"Modern\" Masons. The Duke of Sussex had b een received into the Royal Arch degree in 1810 . In the Templar Order -- HRDM -- KDSH -- Hi s Royal Hi ghn ess was proposed as Grand Master 5th May, 1812 , and d uly installed 6 th Au gust of the same year, but he seems at no time to have shown interest in aught but the Craft. In 1813 the Modern Grand Chapter had issued to its members 183 separate C harters for the Royal Arch, whilst on the other hand the Ancient - Modern Grand Lodge of 1751 empowered the working of the Arch under their Craft Charters, and it was now stipulated in the Articles of Union that the Royal Arch should b e considered as the com pletion of the degree of Master Mason, and the members allowed to join the Chivalric Orders under separate governance. As a completion of the 3rd Degree, however, the statement is more imaginary than real. Up to 1813 if a Mason h ad not been a Chair Maste r the Past Master \u0000 s degree was c onferred upon h im, as is yet done in America. Accordingly it was resolved b y the United Grand Lodge, 30th November, 1813 , that a United Grand Chapter should b e constituted with the Craft Grand Officers as its Rulers; and unlimited p owers were given for this purpose. An Assembly was held on the 18th Au gust, 1817 , with the Duke of Sussex as First Principal. There is no doubt that many old Chapters, previously held under Craft Warrant, neglected to renew their privileges by applying for Charters, as they were required to do; and that such bodies gradually passed out of working. In Au gust, 1826 , it was decreed that none but Past Masters were eligible as Principals. The ceremonial of the {483 } degree was revised, and reduced to its present form in the year 1835 b y the Duke \u0000 s Chaplain, the Rev. Bro. Adam Brown, under a Comm ittee of nine, appointed 5 th February, 1834 .<<\"Freem. Mag.\" ii, 1860 , p. 471 .>> A Chapter of Promulgation, consisting of 27 members was c hartered May 1835 . Also a new edition of Regulations of the United Grand Chapter, was published in 1817 , and was followed b y one with plates of Jewels, and a list of Chapters, in 1823 ; since which there have been editions printed in 1843 , 1852 , 1864 , 1869 , 1875 , 1879 .<<Hug han \u0000 s \"English Rite,\" 1884 .>> The death of the Duke of Sussex, in 1843 , caused further changes in the rule of the High - grades; he had held the Supreme power of the Orders of Knight"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Templars, HRDM - KDSH, since 1812 , though h e gave scant countenance to the High - grades. At one time he accepted a Patent as Grand P rior of the French Ordre du Temple, and it is s aid that Paul of Russia made him Grand P rior of the Order of Malta; he had also the degrees of the Rite of Mizraim conferred upon h im. Ragon gives a r itual of the e arly time of the Duke \u0000 s rule granted to a subordinate body at Porte - au - Prince, from which it appears that the ceremony was assimilated to the Templar Kadosh. The Jerusalem Conclave at Manchester, which h ad originally been chartered b y the Gr and Encampment of All England at York in 1786 , and had gone under Gd. Master Dunckerley in 1795 , issued its own certificates during the neglect of the Duke. It installed certain brethren from Liverpool i n 1813 who constituted the St. Patrick Conclave; and there was also in 1830 a Conclave e ntitled the Jacques de Molay emanating from Scotland and which in that year went under the bann er of the French Ordre du Temple, at the instance of Brother W. H. Stewart, a Grand Cross of the Scottish Conclave who sought recognition at Paris, and was made Comm ander, Bailly, and Grand Cross for the Liverpool Convent,<<\"Letters\" of Dr. Morison to Bro.

Marples, 71 Lord St., Liverpool, 1830 .>> Brother Dr. Robert Bigsby was a member of the Metropolitan Convent of the Order, and nominally received a f ew members into the Order, after it had ceased to exist.  THE ANC IENT AND ACC EPTED RITE. Certain members of the Templar Order and of the Rite of Perfection of 25th Degree, which continued to be conferred under Templar Charters, and i n that form is not yet quite e xtinct, applied to Brother John James Joseph Gourgas, of New York, for a Charter to practise the Ancient and Accepted Rite of 33rd Degree -- the pupil and amanuensis of the notorious Emanuel de la Motta in 1813 . The Rite, as we have seen, dates from Charleston in 1802 ; Ireland had obtained a Charter from Charleston in 1825 , Scotland from France in 1843 . Accordingly the following English brethren obtained a Gourgas Charter 26th October, 1845 , namely: -- R. T. Crucifix; George Oli ver, D.D.; Henry Udall; D. W. Nash, of Bristol, who was expelled b y his c onfreres in 1858 b ecause he had the audacity to attend meetings of the Templar bodies from which they had each and all received what degrees they individually possessed when the Ch arter was granted. Brother D. W. Nash then reorganised the old Templar body and p ushed it as a System of seven degrees. The S.G.C. is s aid, however, to have freed itself from the Morin - de la Motta frauds by registration as a Limited Liability Company. T he reader m ay consult t he two exhaustive Histories of Robert Folger, M.D., and Wm. H. Peckham, of New York, as to the discord created b y Charleston. The seven degrees of Nash in 1858 were as follows: -- 1st Degree, Knight Templar; 2nd Degree, Knight of St. John ; 3rd Degree, Knight of Palestine; 4th Degree, Knight of Rhodes; 5th Degree, Knight of Malta; 6th Degree, Rosae Crucis of Heredom; 7th Degree, Grand {485 } Elected Knight Kadosh. To o btain a union of Bristol Knights with the Grand P riory of England that body in 1866 agreed to allow the practise of the old d egrees of Heredom Kadosh, by its older Encampments, now term ed P receptories. Manchester r evived the old"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Dunckerley degrees of Red Cross, Heredom, Kadosh, 1869 - 70. The trouble with Bristol led to a similar trouble at Bath in 1871 , and they revived their old degrees together with the whole of the degrees which they had had from 1811 Of the Scottish Rite. In 1872 they received and certificated seven \"Noble Knights\" of the Manchester Chapter, and fo rm ed an alliance with them, their Certificates including the whole of England, Scotland, and Ireland and an alliance was form ed. When Harry J. Seymour, the S.G.C. of the Cerneau S.G.C. of New York, was over in Manchester in 1872 he received as 33rd Degr ee of that System the writer, John Yarker, and on h is return to New York had him created an Honorary Member, 15th November, 1872 , and Representative of Amity, and the same was renewed in 1880 b y his s uccessor W. H. Peckham, S.G.C. 33rd Degree. On the othe r hand Dr. R. B. Folger established a S.G.C. in Canada with Bro. G. C. Longley as S.G.C. 33rd Degree, and, 23rd July, 1882 , Hon. Membership was c onferred upon Yarker with a request that he would send on two o ther names for the same rank. Again on the 11th July, 1882 , Peckham established a 2nd S.G.C. 33rd Degree in Canada with Bro. L. H. Henderson as G.C. 33rd Degree. Canada had also two bodies of the Rite of Memphis which were united in 1882 , and from the combined b odies Theo. H. Tebbs v isited Manchester, and form al documents were drawn 12th January, 1884 , since which time the Scottish Rite has been in occupation. It may be mentioned here that, January, 1903 , Mrs. Ann ie Besant established in London a S.G.C. 33rd Degree, conferring all degrees from the 1 st to the 33rd indiscriminately upon Men and Women; she received her constitution {486 } from India, a S.G.C. which h ad its authority from a dissension in the S.G.C. of the 33rd Degree for France, Tilly \u0000 s c onstitution.  THE TEMP LAR. The new Templars assembled a Grand Conclave 27th February, 1846 , and elected Sir Knight Charles Kemeys Kemeys Tynte as Grand Master, and revised their r itual, as a single ceremonial in 1851 . On h is death, 22nd November, 1860 , the e nsuing Grand Co nclave e lected Brother William Stuart who was Installed Grand Master 10th May, 1861 . On the death of this brother in 1870 the Order was placed under H.R.H the Prince of Wales with H.M. the Queen as Grand P atron, and attempts were made to unite with Irelan d and Scotland under a General Chapter, or Convent General, with National G rand P riories in each country, but Scotland p osed as a superior System though they had accepted a Patent in 1811 from Edward Duke of Kent, the Grand P atron of English Templary durin g the Grand Mastership of Bro. Alex. Deuchar, and hence the full scheme fell through. Other changes in clothing, nomenclature, and ritual were introduced, which met with scant approval. On the 12th December, 1895 , the Prince of Wales dissolved Convent Ge neral, which h ad been utterly without success, and was proclaimed Sovereign of the National Great Priory, and the Statutes of the Order were revised accordingly. England has had as Gd. Priors, Earl of Limerick, 2nd April, 1873 ; Sh rewsbury, 8th December, 1 876 ; Lathom, 5th October, 1877 ; Euston, 8th May, 1896 .  THE R ITE OF MIZRAIM. "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" As to its origin and history something may be gathered from the French historians of the Rite. It may be added that the Herm etic Scottish body named the Illuminati of Avignon was founded b y Dom Pernetti, and Gabrianca, and thence spread to Montpelier in 1760 . Gad Bedarride {487 } of Cavillon went in 1771 to Avignon, where (he says) he was Initiated into Masonry by one Israel Cohen surnamed Carosse; and , after a few years, he obtained (the e quivalent) 77th Degree, at Toulouse. In 1782 an Egyptian of the name of Ananiah visited Cavillon, and gave Gad an \"Au gmentation of Salary,\" which means a higher degree, and p erhaps we owe to this \"augmentation\" t he T almudic and Cabalistic degrees of the Rite. In the troubles of the time, Gad b ecame a Captain of Artillery at Nice, and here he united himself with G. M. Blanc, and became 87th Degree, and was afterwards made a Sovereign Grand Master, 90th Degree, at Napl es, by G. M. Palambo. The great authority of the Rite, Marc Bedarride, together with h is brothers Michael and Joseph were born at Cavillon in 1766 , and Marc became a soldier, and was Initiated at Cesina, 5th January, 1801 ; at Paris he received the 18th De gree Of Rose Croix (his 46th Degree), and also the 31st Degree Of the A. & A. S. Rite, and he says the 70th Degree of the Rite of Mizraim. At this time the Chief of the Rite was Bro Le Changeur, of Milan, who is s aid to have systematised the 90th Degree in the year 1805 . Ragon seems to have examined a certificate granted to B. Clavel in 1811 b y a Chapter of Rose Croix meeting in the Abruzzes, and which Marc Bedarride signs as 77th Degree. In 1813 Milan granted P atents of the 90th Degree to a few brethr en in Paris, and the Grand Orient accepted the authority, but on the 22nd December, 1817 , the Rite assumed independence. Marc Bedarride himself states that he received the 90th degree at Naples, and he seems to have taken an active part in the Masonic Lod ges of Italy and France. With varying fortunes the Rite continues to meet in Paris, and has recently exchanged Representatives of Amity with this country. Rebold says Jacques Etienn e Marconis (surnamed d e Negre), and founder of the Rite of Memphis, was a t one time a member of Mizraim. The \"Rite of Mizraim\" was first cumulated and established in Italy in 1804 - 5, and consists of 90 d egrees, collected from all sources, and is not without value; it {488 } w as then taken to Paris by the brothers Bedarride. At one time it was looked upon favourably in this c ountry, the Duke of Sussex was its recognised head in England; the Duke of Leinster in Ireland; and in S cotland the Duke of Athol was s ucceeded b y Walker Arnott of Arleary, Esqre.; but eventually they cam e to an agreement to abandon the Rite. No doubt they were influenced in this s tep b y financial difficulties in Paris; some one has observed that it needs the fortune of a kingdom to carry on a Rite of ninety degrees with the necessary splendour. Some of the Templar Conclaves c ontinued to confer it till recently; in Italy and some other parts it has been reduced to 33 d egrees, and designated the \"Reform ed Rite of Mizraim.\" In a q uiet way it is s till conferred in this c ountry under its own S upreme Council.  THE ANTIENT AND PRIMITIVE R ITE. The \"Rite of Memphis\" has a similar r ecord to that of Mizraim, and was established on the basis of the Rites of Primitive Philadelphes and the Primitive Philalethes; occult branches of the systems of Paschalis and St. Martin, in which the grades were not clearly defined, but each of the three sections into"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"which they were divided had p ower to add any suitable degrees useful for its aims. An Egyptian system of Masonry was foreshadowed in the pamphlet of \"Master of Masters,\" Paris 1815 . Freemasonry had b een introduced into Egypt by the arm ies of Buonaparte, and from thence, where it gathered some additions, was transplanted to Montauban in France, 1816 , by the Brothers Marconis, Baron Dumas, Petite, La brunie, Sam Honis of Cairo etc. After an interval of sleep it was revived at Brussels and P aris by Jacques Etienn e Marconis, surnamed d e Negre, son of Grand Master Marconis; its revival at Brussels took p lace in 1838 , and at Paris in 1839 , with the assist ance of the elder Marconis, under the designation of the Ancient and P rimitive Rite of Memphis divided into three Sections, and 95 or 97 d egrees. At an early period it was introduced {489 } into America, Egypt, and Roumania, the form er Chartered a Sovereig n S anctuary for Great Britain and Ireland in 1872 , and in the two latter countries it is the only Rite held in much esteem. It requires, in this c ountry, that its neophytes s hould already be Master Masons, and in this year of grace is s pread into almost a ll countries, with whom Representatives are appointed. It introduced the Rite into Germ any in 1905 , where it has numerous Craft Lodges, and P aris is in course of re - establishing itself.  THE SWEDENB ORGIAN RITE. The Swedenborgian Rite was revived in the United States and Canada by Brother Samuel Beswick. It consists of three e laborate and b eautiful ceremonies for which the Craft is required. A Supreme Grand Lodge and Temple for G.B. & I. was c hartered b y Brother Colonel W. J. B. McLeod Moore, 33rd Degree, &c., of the Canadian body, on 1st October, 1875 , with Bro. John Yarker as G.M. A Charter has recently been issued b y this c ountry for a body in Paris, and p reviously to Roumania a nd Egypt.  MARK MAST ER . In the old arrangement there were, as we saw, two ceremonies of Mark Man and Mark Master, and at its early establishment a cubic s tone of the Craft was used, then changed to an arch key stone. There was also a Fugative Mark conferred upon Royal Ar ch Masons, as well as a Christian Mark. It has also been worked in conjunction with the degrees of the Wrestle, the Link, and the Ark. One version which was practised in Yorkshire last century, say 1780 , is based upon the older Red Cross of Babylon and t he Second Temple. The ceremonies must have arisen from the discontinuance by the Speculative Masons of the old Operative Mark. A Grand Lodge of the Degree was established b y Lord Leigh in June 1856 , and has now a very numerous following. {490 } The prese nt Ritual is a revisal of an old Aberdeen one; in Scotland the Marks are often h ereditary.  RE D CROSS OF CONSTANTINE. This Order was revived in 1870 ; it had b een form erly worked under Lord Rancliffe, and Judge Waller R. Wright; it enjoys c onsideration. Newcastle has not been dorm ant. "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"  ROSICRUCIAN ORDER . The Rosicrucian Order in IX. degrees was revived in 1866 , chiefly by the exertions of Brother Kenn eth Mackenzie, who had resided in Germ any; it has made itself most useful to Freemasons by the publication of papers upon occult and abstruse subjects, of a superior kind, emanating from Scotland, Newcastle, York, and London. The first Supreme Magus was Bro. R. W. Little, whose successor was Dr. Woodman, and the present Chief is Dr. W. Wynn Westcott.  THE CRYPTIC RITE. This is an American importation, and is the revision and rearrangement of certain ceremonies of the Ancient and Accepted Rite, as well as those of Mizraim and Memphis , and therefore was sc arcely necessary in this c ountry.  THE ORDER OF ST. MARTIN. This Order has its Supreme Council i n Paris, and its members are scattered all over the world. It has bodies in this c ountry and a Sovereign Inspec tor and Delegate. Each of its members are supposed to contribute a paper ann ually upon the aims of the Order, and in affinity with those of its founder the Marquis de St. Martin. In Paris, its members are republishing the works of that author.  ALLIED D EGREE S. In 1884 a Grand Council of the Allied Masonic {491 } degrees was c onstituted in London; taking over the Red Cross of Babylon; the Knight of St. Lawrence, which claims an operative origin; the Knight of Constantinople, an American invention; the Grand High Priest, a degree in part referring to the Head of a Chapter prior to 1838 , and in part to the Chief officer of Knight Templar Priest; there is also the Secret Monitor, and other degrees have recently been added, such as t he Red Branch Knights of Ulster.  ORIENTAL SOCIETIES. THE SAT B \u0000 HAI. This is a Hindu Society organised b y the Pundit of an Anglo - Indian Regiment, and b rought into this c ountry, about the year 1872 , by Major J. H. Lawrence Arch er. The name alludes to the bird \"Malacocercis Grisis,\" which always fly by \"sevens.\" It has s even descending degrees, each of seven disciples, who constitute their seven; and seven ascending degrees of Perfection, Ekata or Unity. Its object is the stud y and d evelopment of Indian philosophy. Somehow its \"raison d \u0000 etre\" ceased to be necessary when the \"Theosophical Society\" was established b y the late H. P. Blavatsky, which at one time at least had its s ecret signs of Reception. AUGUST ORDER OF LIGH T. This Order was introduced here in 1882 b y Bro. Maurice Vidal Portman. The Altar is that of \"Maha - Deva,\" and had a Ritual of 3 degrees -- Novice, Aspirans, Viator. The writer arranged with Bro. Portman to amalgamate it with the Sat B \u0000 hai Rite of Perfect ion, but it seems to be continued separately at Bradford, Yorkshire, as the \"Oriental O rder of Light.\""},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Its early certificate adopted the form s of the Cabala, with which the Theosophy of India has s ome affinity. In the East ceremonial degrees are not valu ed, the object being the development of practical O ccultism, which was the purpose of the e stablishment of the Order of Light, governed b y a Grand Master of the Sacred Crown or \"Kether\" of the Cabala. The writer has a letter from Bro. Portman in which h e says: \"The Sat B \u0000 hai rituals are {492 } w ithout exception the finest and b est suited to an Occult Order of anything I have e ver read,\" and he leaves all arrangements in the writer \u0000 s hands.  ADO PTIVE MASONRY. This Chapter would be incomplete without some mention of Adoptive Masonry. Societies admitting females as members were e stablished in France early last century, and spread to o ther countries. One of the first to admit ladies were the \"Mopses,\" who reorganised after the Pa pal Bulls of 1738 against Freemasonry. The \"Felicitaires\" had a nautical character, and existed in 1742 . In 1747 Brother Bauchaine, the Master of a Paris Lodge, instituted an Order, admitting ladies, called the \"Fendeurs\" or Woodcutters, modelled on the Carbonari a class of men who would seem to be a branch of the ancient Compagnn onage; the popularity of this Order led to the creation of others, to wit, of the \"Hatchet,\" of \"Fidelity,\" etc. This popularity induced the Grand Orient of France, in 1774 , to establish a system of three degrees c alled the Rite of Adoption, with the Duchess de Bourbon as Grand Mistress of All France; the Rite has been generally adopted into Freemasonry, and various degrees added from time to time, to the number of about 12 in al l. The \"Ladies Hospitallers of Mount Tabor\" added to the original plan, a recondite System called the Lesser and Greater Mysteries. The French Lodges of Adoption were patronised b y the highest ladies in the land; and there is evidence that the Rite of Mi zraim held androgynous Lodges in 1819 , 1821 , 1838 , 1853 ; and the A. & P. Rite of Memphis in 1839 ; of these two last t here are handsome certificates in the museum of the Lodge of Research, Leicester. America has a system of her own called the \"Eastern S tar \" in 5 p oints. In all systems admissions are usually restricted to the wives, widows, sisters, or daughters of Master Masons. Scotland has attempted {493 } the working both of the \"Order of the Eastern Star\" and \"Adoptive Masonry,\" but not successfully.  SUMM ARY. To sum up this c hapter, it advances that prior to Grand Lodges there were Masters of Masters and d uly Passed Masters or Harods, who had controlling power over the ordinary Craftsmen, and that the chief Rites of t he speculative system of which there is evidence may be thus s umm arised: -- 1. The Guild Rite of four working and three official degrees -- Judaic. 2. The Craft and their ruling Harods in the Co. of Durham. 3. Three Craft degrees, and the Red and Rosy Cross, Judaic and Christian. 4. Ancient Masonry of the Moderns, three Craft, and the higher degrees of Holy Royal Arch, Knight Templar, Priest. But outside all this, numberless degrees which we have not space to mention, in some cases derived fr om the Mystic Schools and adopted into the Masonic System. In many cases new degrees were but variants of the different"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Rites, readopted b y others with a new name; the ruling degree of one Rite becoming a mere ritualistic c eremony in another.

The Guild Ass embly is s upposed to have been revived as the Grand Lodge of London in 1717 , and according to the account of Dr. James Anderson, by four old Lodges, which met for that purpose at the Apple - tree tavern; but another account, of 1764 , states that six o ld Lodg es took p art in the proceeding but gives no evidence. The first Grand Master m ay be considered a member of the old operative body, namely Brother Anthony Sayer, of whom a very excellently executed p ortrait has recently been published b y Brother Henry Sadl er; the election of this first Grand Master took p lace at the Goose and Gridiron on S t. John \u0000 s Day, 1717 ; he was followed b y George Payne, a gentleman of antiquarian tastes, who was elected G.M. on the 24th June, 1718 . In the year 1719 Bro. J. T. Desaguli ers was elected Grand Master, he was a man of some scientific eminence, and visited Lodge Mary \u0000 s Chapel, Edinburgh, where he was received, \"after due e xamination;\" it has been suggested that he may have exemplified the London working, but the facts are suc h that it is much more probable that he went to learn and not to teach, moreover, the Grand Lodge term s, \"Cowan\" and \"Fellow - Craft\" are Scottisms. {495 } Of late years the more critical historians have e xpressed themselves as v ery dissatisfied with the a ccount which Anderson h as given of himself and of the establishment of his Grand Lodge in 1717 , and if the statements which appear in our pages are unassailable, -- as we believe them to be, -- he had every reason for prevarication and reticence. He says that t he Grand Lodge was established b ecause Wren n eglected the Lodges, that is the Lodges which were established b y the dissidents who left the operative Guilds in 1715 . Under the circumstances whatever legitimacy the Grand Lodge of London h ad it derived it from the old operative Lodges, chiefly in the North of England, which united with it. The Guilds assert that it was Anderson who abrogated the seven years \u0000 Apprenticeship and changed the seat of the Master from West to East. In 1720 Brother George Payne was elected for a second time, and compiled a code of regulations for the Grand Lodge which was passed on the 24th June 1721 , and form s the first Constitution. Several old MSS . were burnt in London"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"by scrupulous brethren in 1720 , one of them being b y Nicholas Stone, who is said to have been a Grand Warden of Inigo Jones. The office of Deputy Grand Master was instituted. In 1721 the antiquary Dr. William Stukely was made a Mason and records the circumstance thus in h is \"Diary:\" -- \"6th January 172 1, I was made a Free - mason at the Salutation Tav., Tavistock Street, with Mr. Collins and Captain Rowe who made the famous diving engine.\" In h is \"Comm on - place\" Book he records; that: -- \"I was the first person made a Free - mason in London for m any years. We had great difficulty to find members enough to perform the ceremony. Imm ediately after that it took a run, and ran itself out of breath through the folly of the members.\" In h is \"Au tobiography\" he again refers to the matter: \"his c uriosity led him to be initiated into the mysteries of Masonry, suspecting them to be the remains of the Mysteries of the antients.\" These {496 } references are very valuable in the inferences to be drawn from them. As there were few members in 1721 , it is c lear that under Anderson and his friends much progress had not been made, but from some old members, he must have received the impression of the great antiquity of Masonic Rites. On the 10th March, 1721 , he says -- \"I waited on S ir C. Wren.\" At a meeting of the 24th Jun e 1721 , at which were present the Duke of Montague, Lords Herbert and Stanh ope, and Sir Andrew Fountain, Stukely saw the \"Cooke M.S.,\" which he says Grand Master Payne had obtained in the West of England, and Brother Speth points out that Stukely made a co py of the first and last page. There exist two o ther copies of it made at this period; Stukely considered the MS. 500 years old. Grand Master Payne read over a new set of Articles and Dr. Desaguliers pronounced an Oration.<<Vide Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Frem.\">> From this we gather that Speculative Masonry was rising into importance. On the 24th June, 1721 , at the Grand Lodge held b y G. M. Payne at the Queen \u0000 s Arm s, St. Paul \u0000 s Churchyard, at the request of the Duke of Montague, Philip Lord Stanh ope (afterwards Earl of Chesterfield), and several gentlemen attended; after usual proceedings the Brethren adjourned to Stationers \u0000 Hall, and in the presence of 150 b rethren the Duke of Montague was proclaimed Grand Master and Brother Beale, Deputy. Dr. J. T. Desagulier s delivered \"an eloquent oration about Masons and Masonry,\" which is s aid to have been printed. Stukely records that on the 25th May, 1722 , he met the Duke of Queensboro, Lords Dunbarton and Hinchinbroke at the Fountain \u0000 s Tavern Lodge to consider the Fe stival of St. John \u0000 s. Philip Duke of Wharton was elected G.M. 25th June, 1722 , and Brother J. T. Desaguliers Deputy. Brother Gould has given good reasons for believing that Anderson \u0000 s s tatements of 1738 on this point, as well as upon others, are unreliab le.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" viii.>> Brother William Cowper was appointed Grand Secretary, {497 } and G.M. Wharton approved a Ceremony for Installing the Master of a Lodge. Wharton at this time was much embarrassed having inh erited an impoverished estate, and wa s himself a man reckless in h is expenses. Stukely records that on the 3rd November the Duke of Wharton and Lord Dalkeith visited the Lodge of which S tukely was Master. In this year J. Roberts printed the version of a MS., in which are the \"New Regulation s,\" as to o ne Master and Assembly which h is c opy says was passed 8th December, 1663 ; it contains the Clause that a Freemason must be fully 21 years of age. At this time the Grand Lodge claimed the sole right to confer the grade, or grades, of Fellow and M aster; it is thought that one grade is implied, if"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"it is two it indicates the sense in which they regarded the rights of Assembly given in the \"Cooke MS.\" In 1723 Francis Earl of Dalkeith was Grand Master, and in this year Brother James Anderson, a pres byterian divine, and a genealogist, published the first \"Book of Constitutions,\" which h e had compiled from the old MSS ., and other sources, by order of the Grand Lodge. It was dedicated to the Duke of Montague by J. T. Desaguliers the Deputy Grand Master , and Brother Gould is of opinion that Anderson, as an Aberdeen Man introduced Scottish term inology into the English Craft. As a Scottish Antiquary the author would b e well acquainted with the Customs of the Lodges and the Masters \u0000 Incorporations, and whi lst the e arly y ears of Grand Lodge resembles the Scottish Lodges, the grant of \"Fellowcraft and Master,\" t o the private Lodges, and the sending of Masters and Wardens to Grand Lodge brings it into line with the Incorporations, but Desaguliers had also visi ted the Edinburgh Lodge. This year an engraved list of Lodges was begun by Brother John Payne, in a small volume; the \"Freemason an Hudibrastic Poem,\" appeared, and attacks on the Society began in the Press. In 1724 , 1725 , 1726 ,the Grand Masters were C harles Lenn ox Duke of Richmond; James Hamilton Lord {498 } Paisley; and William O \u0000 Brian Earl of Inchiquin. In 1724 the office of Grand Treasurer was instituted. We gave particulars, in our last Chapter of a considerable Lodge at Chester of which Randle H olme was a member, and it is probable that admissions were continued, for in the year 1724 three Lodges were accepted at Chester and Brother F. Columbine was appointed the Provincial G rand Master. On the 27th November, 1725 , Grand Lodge passed a Resolutio n granting the privilege of Masters to Private Lodges, -- \"the majority of the members being Masters may make Masters at their discretion.\" No doubt Grand Lodge found its time fully occupied with affairs of the government; and this led, a little later, to the sanction of \"Masters Lodges,\" or m eetings for the sole purpose of making Masters.<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" -- Lane.>> The lampoon on the Freemasons and Gorm ogons appeared, and in 1726 the \"Freemasons \u0000 Accusation and Defence.\" Anderson seems to have withdra wn from the Grand Lodge until 1730 . A copy of the old Constitutional Charges appeared in 1726 which contains many additions and the name of Herm es is s ubstituted for Euclid.<<Spencer \u0000 s \"Reprints,\" 1870 .>> In June 1726 Dr. Stukely removed to Grantham and established a Lodge there. In Ireland Masonry, as we have seen, was known at the University in 1688 , and there was a Grand Lodge of Dublin in 1725 , having six subordinate Lodges of \"gentlemen Freemasons.\" The first Grand Master was the Earl of Rosse wh o was Installed in the Great Hall of King \u0000 s Inn 26th June, 1725 . There was also a Grand Lodge at Munster in 1726 , of which Brother James O \u0000 Brian was Grand Master, and also member of the Horn Lodge in London. At Cork a Lodge is known to have e xisted in 17 28. The custom of issuing Charters to Lodges began with the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1729 , and they were the first t o Charter m ilitary Lodges, the e arliest of which is 7th November, 1732 , to the \"First Battalion Royal.\"<<\"Cem. Hiber.\" -- Crawley.>> {499 } A copy of the English Constitutions edited b y J. Penn ell, with some slight additions, was printed b y J. Watts of Dublin in 1730 ; and in 1734 Bro. Wm. Smith issued a \"Pocket Companion,\" of which later versions appeared in England."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" In the constant recept ion of noble brethren, changes in the Constitutions, and in the qualifications, coupled with the e limination of Christian references which h ad obtained admission in the course of ages we probably see, it is supposed in the first named case e specially, the cause of the attacks made by the press between the years 1723 - 26, by a class s ocially inferior, but equally zealous for Masonry, of whom the old Speculative and Operative body had b een previously composed. There are allusions in the \"Praise of Drunkenn ess \" by Robert Samber to catechisms then known in 1723 ; another appeared in that year; the \"Grand Mystery\" and p raise of the Gorm ogons 1724 , and a second edition in 1725 ; to this a short reply was printed b y Dublin Masons, 1725 , in which the Society is held t o be of great antiquity and supported b y superior persons. Some years ago the late Brother Matthew Cooke brought to light a very curious and important MS. book of this period which is now lying in the British Museum, being Add. MSS . 23002 .<<\"Frem. Mag.\" v , 1861 . -- Old Lodges. Now facsimiled b y Quat. Cor. Lodge.>> It is a minute book of the \"Philo Musicae e t Architecturae Societas\" established at t he Queen \u0000 s Head, near Temple Bar, by seven members of whom two were made Masons by Mr. Thomas Bradbury and t hree by the Duke of Richmond. Other Initiates were afterwards made by the Society and we read under date 1724 , -- \"Mr. William Goulston, Court Nevit, Esq., Mr. William Jones, and Mr. Edmund Squire were regularly pass \u0000 d Masters, in the beforementioned Lodg e of Hollis Street, and before we founded this Society a Lodge was held consisting of Masters sufficient for that purpose, in order to pass Charles Cotton, Esq., Mr. Papillon Ball, and Mr. Thomas Marshall, Fellow Crafts; in the perform ance of which Mr. {50 0} William Goulson acted as Senior Warden. Imm ediately after which, viz. the 18th day of February A.D. 1724 , the said Mr. William Goulson was c hosen President of the said Society.\" These brethren, were visited amongst others by Past Gd. Master Payne, and the S. Gd. Warden Wm. Sorrel. As there are no minutes in Grand Lodge of any one being made Masters after 1723 , and as it never had an actual body of \"Passed\" Masters the ancient Guild ceremony is in evidence. It is probable that the regulation of passin g existed only on paper, for we see that officers of Grand Lodge were visiting and acting in private Lodges. In the North of England, f ollowing a meeting evidently operative at Scarborough in 1705 , and therefore unminuted; at Bradford in 1713 ; there are records of meetings in 1721 , 1723 , 1725 , 1726 , of Private Lodges at York, that mode being used to distinguish the Lodge from the General Assemblies on S t. John \u0000 s day. At a meeting in 1725 Francis Drake, the historian was made a Mason by Brother William Scourfield. A Code of regulations for their m eetings was agreed upon and the Society now took the title of \"Grand Lodge of All England.\" In 1726 Charles Bathurst was appointed P resident, and Francis Drake, Warden, and the latter at the Ann ual Assembly on St. John \u0000 s day, 27th December, 1726 , gave an address, which h as often been printed, and always held to be of great interest; he speaks of the e fforts to revive the Society in London; addresses the operative Masons, other trades, and gentlemen, and claims for York the undeniable Mastership of \"All England.\" Brother Wm. Scourfield in 1726 was s uspended for calling an unauthorised meeting, and making masons, and was probably acting with the operatives. The old b ody met t ill 1744 , and then fell i nto abeyance until the year 1761 , when Drake revived it. Besides York other bodies of an operative and independent nature"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"existed in the North as at Swalwell, Alnwick, Hexham, Ford, Newcastle, etc. {501 } At London in 1727 , 1728 , 1729 - 30, the Grand Masters were Hen ry Clare Lord Coleraine; James King Lord Kingston; Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk who held the position for two years. On the 27th May, 1727 , Hugh Warburton was appointed P rov. Gd. Master for North Wales; and on 27th December, 1728 , George Pomfret opened a Lodge in Bengal. A copper plate of the \"Mystery of Free Masons,\" was printed b y Andrew White -- \"Taken from the papers of a deceased Brother\"; and we find Bro. Oakley quoting largely from Samber \u0000 s Preface to Long Livers, 1721 . Benjamin Cole published in 1728 , from copper - plate, the Constitution of 1726 . It is noteworthy as illustrating the state of things now existing that Past Gd. Master Sayer was c ensured for \"behaving irregularly,\" and what he did was probably to attend his old Guild as he was an ope rative. Brother Gould thinks he may have been visiting the Gorm ogons. In Au gust and September 1730 the \"Daily Journal\" printed certain spurious rituals, and the \"Grand Whimsey\" of Masonry, by F. G., and these were followed in the same year by a broadshee t reprint entitled, \"The Mystery and Motions of Free - masonry discovered.\" In this year also Samuel Prichard p ublished his \"Masonry Dissected\" (12mo. pp. 31, London, 1730 ) which led to an able \"Defence,\" which Brother Gould has proved, from the Minutes of the Lodge at Lincoln, was written by Brother Martin Clare. Also the censure of Grand Lodge fell upon a Society of Honorary Freemasons. Also appeared in 1730 \"The Perjured Freemason Detected.\" In all this there was probably a Jacobite undercurrent couple d with High grade dissatisfaction, for the sympathies of Grand Lodge was Hanoverian while York was essentially Jacobite. On the 29th January, 1731 , the Duke of Norfolk p resented Grand Lodge with the old sword of Gustavus Adolphus, to be used as the Sword of State. It is worthy of note that in the few preserved minutes of Lodge meetings, at this period as in those of Lincoln, there is but little mention, {502 } and sometimes none, of the degree of Fellow, now term ed Fellow - craft, the minutes c onfining thems elves to record the making of Apprentices and Masters. Faulkner of Dublin printed in 1731 , Swift \u0000 s \"Letter from the Grand Mistress of Female Freemasons.\" There appears in the \"Daily Advertiser\" of 16th Au gust, 1731 , an advertisement t o the public, th at t here was on view a fine model of King Solomon \u0000 s Temple, with 2,000 chambers and windows, 7,000 p illars, and models of the Ark and all the holy utensils; further stating that a printed description, with 12 fine cuts, might be had. This would b e a model prepared by Councillor Schott of Hamburg between 1718 - 25 and on exhibition 1725 - 31. There is mention 22nd September, 1732 , of the admission of Jews in the Rose Tavern in Cheapside, and the \"Grub Street Journal\" printed letters attacking Freemasonry. T here are several interesting notices of meetings at Newcastle - on - Tyne, which we should suppose from \"Border Table Talk,\" to have had a succession from 1581 , a tolerable antiquity for an English Lodge, if the links were shewn. The Northumberland Calendar s tates that 1st July, 1674 , the Society met in the White Friar \u0000 s tower; and no doubt the \"Watson MS.\" written in 1687 b y Edward Thompson was their Lodge document. On the 29th May, 1730 , a Lodge of the \"Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons\" was he ld at Mr. Barth. Pratt \u0000 s \"at which abundance of gentlemen assisted, wearing white leathern"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"aprons and gloves.\" On 28th December, 1734 , the \"ann iversary of the Most Honourable and Ancient Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons,\" was held at widow Grey \u0000 s, \" the Society consisting of the principal inh abitants of the town and country;\" after this they attended church to hear a serm on by the Rev. Mr. Robinson, Vicar of Byewell, \"their chaplain.\" On 27th December, 1737 , Walter Blackett, Esq., was W.M.; Mr. Thore sby, Deputy W.M., Messrs. Newton and Graham, Wardens, for the e nsuing y ear.<<Gould \u0000 s \"Hist. Freem.\" ii, p. 261 ; also \"Trans. Newcastle Coll. Ros.\" pt. I.>> Richardson says that {503 } in, \"1742 , the Company obtained from the Corporation a grant of the Cutl er \u0000 s tower in Carliol Croft (now Croft Street), which they repaired, and fit up in a handsome mann er.\" We have seen an old Craft certificate form used in the old Newcastle Lodge, under the Grand Lodge, which represented two pillars on one of which was e ngraved \"Isk Chotzeb, Isb Sabhal, Giblim;\" and on the other (facing right), \"Bonai, Menatzckhim, Harods.\" The Lodge of Alnwick p reserved its minutes from 1700 - 55, and these have been h andsomely printed b y the Newcastle College of Rosicrucians. We find mention of the Entering of Apprentices; making of Free - brothers; of Brothers and Fellows; the ann ual elections of the Masters and Wardens; yet no word as to Rites and secrets. But the only inference we can draw from this is that the brethren were real Mas ons, not pretenders, inn oculated with the new doctrines of 1717 , and k new that such things c ould not be written about. Hence in the case of similar omissions in the minutes of York, Durham, Scotland, etc., no reliance can be placed, or arguments drawn fro m obscure allusions to matters of this nature. There was also, at this period a Lodge at Hexham, which would seem to have died out without at any time coming under the Grand Lodge of England. There was another at Swalwell, which will be referred to when it comes under the Grand Lodge in 1735 . We may add a few lines here in regard to Masonry in S cotland, which h ad many ancient Lodges at work; and which were societies s anctioned b y law for mutual assistance and the regulation of business, and over which the Clare family had an h ereditary jurisdiction, and had to be in possession of the \"Masons \u0000 Word.\" From early times they had admitted traders unconn ected with building, and gentlemen of position; the one term ed \"Domatic\" or operative Masons, the other \"G eomatic,\" or Speculative Masons. These bodies met together in 1736 , and established a Grand Lodge upon the London {504 } system, and consolidated it by the e lection as Grand Master of Brother William St. Clair, who then resigned the rights if such still ex isted which h e had from his ancestors who had b een appointed in the 16th century Lord Wardens General, and p atrons of the Masonic Craft; with the consent of Lodges, and sanction of the Kings, Judges of all matters in dispute.<<Vide the \"Schaw Constitution, \" or r ules, also previous c hapter.>> From this period, Scotland gradually conform ed to the ritualistic s ystem of England, but as proved b y the \"Dumfries MS.,\" quoted in our last chapter, for a long period retained its Christian character. In this c onde nsed account it is unn ecessary to repeat the mere names of the Grand Masters of England; these are found in any modern Cyclopaedia, or in the Grand Lodge calendars. Various old Lodges must have united themselves with the Grand Lodge, but as the e ntries ar e made from the date of admission, it is impossible in all cases to trace their origin by the Grand Lodge Register;"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"one notable e xception is Lodge 65, of St. Rook \u0000 s hill, Chichester, which is registered as dating from the time of Julius Caesar. An old Lod ge of Swalwell, nr.

The Grand Lodge of London h ad now achieved high prestige, for in 1733 eighteen n ew Lodges were constituted in the London district alone, and the power s of the Comm ittee of Charity were e xtended. In 1734 P rov. Gd.. Masters were appointed for Lancashire and Durham, Northumberland we have already named. This would not be likely to give much satisfaction to the Grand Lodge of All England at York, and may have contributed to its later relapse, and even in the South, 1735 - 8, dissatisfaction was s preading; Freemasons were being admitted in unchartered \"St. John \u0000 s Lodges,\" members dropped off, and Lodges began to be e rased. On the 15th April, 1736 , the Earl of Loudan h ad Garter and Lyon, the Kings of Arm s of England and Scotland, besides many titled p ersons, to attend his Installation as Grand Master, but his appointment of officers s eems to have given dissatisfaction. In 1737 the Prince of Wales was made a Mason, at a private Lodge held at the palace of Kew. Under the Marquis of Carnarvon the Gd. Master in 1737 a Prov. Gd. Master was appointed for the West Riding of Yorkshire. A Papal Bull excomm unicating the members of the Society made its appearance in 1738 . In the same year Anderson issued a second {506 } edition of the \"Book of Constitutions\" in which the history of architecture is much extended, but some changes were made in the wording of the Charges which were not altogether r eceived with favour. I n the same year the \"Gentlemens \u0000 Magazine\" printed a pretended d escription of the ceremonies, and J. Wilford, the printer of Prichard \u0000 s 7th edition,issued a 6d. pamphlet entitled, \"Masonry further Dissected; or m ore SECRE TS Of that Mysterious \"Society\" Rev eal \u0000 d.

A plate of this ridiculous procession was published 27 th April, 1742 , but this must not be confound ed with Hogarth \u0000 s embodiment of the Gorm ogon \u0000 s s landers which h ad a third edition about the same year, and mentioned in our last chapter.

It is not difficult to see where the shoe pinched the \"Modern Mason.\" An old broadsheet of 1755 says that, \"the Moderns leave out at least one half of the Lectures\" -- and this is c onfirm ed, later, by a pamphlet of 1765 entitled, -- \"A Defence of Freemasonry,\" the writer of which states that he visited a Lodge of the \"Ancients,\" and he condemns their prolixity, and d efends the abridged form o f Modern ceremonies. In our days the Guild Free Masons have spoken, to some e xtent, and we know their process. What the founders of the G. L. of 1717 d id was to do away with all techn ic, and revise what was left to make a new system; the Derm ott body had Guild Masons to help them. The general dissatisfaction thus s hewn to exist, was {509 } taken advantage of in the e stablishment at London of a rival G rand Lodge of which Brother Lawrence Derm ott, an old Irish Mason, became the Grand Secretary. Their cer emonies were undoubtedly, as he states, remodelled b y Ancient Guild Masons. Their affairs from 1751 were managed b y a Comm ittee of the Lodges until 1753 when Robert Turner, Esq., became Grand Master, and was succeeded b y Robert Vaughan in 1754 . In 1755 a Manifesto entitled \"the Masons \u0000 Creed\" was issued. In 1756 Derm ott issued their first Book of Constitutions under the title of \"Ahiman Rezon,\" and certain rules are e ntitled, \"Regulations for Charity in Ireland and b y York Masons in England.\" The Earl o f Blessington became Grand Master in 1757 . Brother Henry Sadler in h is work entitled \"Facts and Fictions\" has done much to disentangle the confused history of the period and he has s hewn that this body was established b y Irish Masons, reinforced b y dissid ents who had b een Initiated in the unchartered \"St. John \u0000 s Lodges,\" and b y members of the Lodges which h ad b een struck from the Roll of the Grand Lodge of 1717 . They claimed to have retained the full ancient work of York which h ad b een curtailed b y the Gr and Lodge which they dubbed Modern. The \"Ancient,\" or the \"York Masonry,\" by which the new Grand Lodge distinguished itself, was an old Arch - Templar body, and the same system was worked b y the London Grand Lodge of 1751 . By their Charters the Arch was worked under Lodge authority, and though n o prominence was given to the Templar, it was usually conferred with the Arch degree. At York itself, when a revival took p lace under Grand Master Drake, in 1761 , the Arch was recognised by the Grand Lodge and the Templar also, continuing in active operation until 1792 , when they silently expired. In 1764 Derm ott published a second edition of the \"Ahiman Rezon,\" in which comm ents are made upon three pamphlets of the period, namely: \"Hiram, or"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the Master Key to M asonry; The three Distinct Knocks;\" and \"Boaz\" {510 } \"and Jachin;\" t hese works s eem to have given Derm ott much ann oyance, and he brings the author of the two last to untimely ends on the 23rd Au gust, 1762 , and 8 th S eptember, 1763 . The Charity regulations of this new edition give in parallel columns the Dublin and London rules in force since 1738 , and those of 1751 for his own Grand Lodge. In 1772 the Duke of Athol became Grand Master, after which they were usually designated \"Athol Masons,\" and had form al recognition from the Grand Lodges of Scotland and Ireland. A third and enlarged edition of the \"Ahiman Rezon\" appeared in 1778 . We will now return to the Grand Lodge of 1717 ; and may mention that in 1746 a brother of the name of John Coustos published an account of the sufferings he had undergone by the Roman Inquisition for the crime of Freemasonry, and expressing his grateful thanks to the British Government for claiming his release from his abominable torturers. Complaints of irregular meetings rea ppear in 1749 , and again in 1752 . In 1754 - 5 there are proceedings against the members of a Lodge held at the Ben John son \u0000 s Head in Spitalfields as \"Ancient\" Masons and the Lodge was ordered to be e rased; Derm ott says that some of its members had b een abro ad, where they received much favour from the fact of their following the traditional rites of the \"Ancients,\" and therefore they resolved to practise \"Ancient\" Masonry every third Lodge night, to which meetings the ordinary Craft Mason was not admitted. T he matter was not mended b y Brother Spenser, who replied to a letter from an Irish petitioner for his relief that their Grand Lodge was \"neither Royal Arch n or Ancient,\" and Derm ott prints his letter in 1764 . The progress of the \"Ancients\" has been attrib uted to the general mismanagement of the affairs of Grand Lodge and to the absence from England of Lord Byron the Grand Master, 1747 - 52, and a proposal was on foot to supersede him in 1751 , but Brother Thomas Mann ingham interposed so judiciously that the p roposal fell through, and he himself was promoted to the office of Deputy {511 } Grand Master in 1752 ; various Lectures and Serm ons, given between 1735 - 52, are printed b y Oli ver in h is \"Remains,\" and Brother Thomas Dunckerley delivered a Lecture \"On Masonic Truth and Charity\" at Plymouth in 1757 . A new edition of the \"Book of Constitutions,\" edited b y Brother John Entick, was published in 1756 . In 1757 a list of 14 irregular Masons meeting at the Marlboro \u0000 s Head in Pelham Street, Spitalfields, was ordere d to be sent to each Lodge; and Brother Henry Sadler points out t hat t hey were working independently of any Grand Lodge. In 1760 J. Burd p ublished a translation of \"Les Ordre des Franc Macons Trahi\" under the title of \" \u0000 A Master Key to Freemasonry;\" by wh ich all the Secrets of the Society are laid open, and their pretended Mysteries exposed to the Publick.\"<<\"Ars Quat. Cor.\" 1896 , p. 85; J. Bird, opposite St. Dunstan \u0000 s Church, Fleet St., MDCC LX. 6d. viii and 48pp . 8vo.>> This led in the same year to the p ublication of \"The Freemasons \u0000 Advocate, or Falsehood Detected.\" In spite of this untoward state of affairs Freemasonry made progress. In 1764 appeared a work entitled \"Multa Paucis for Lovers of Secrets,\" which is the basis on which is grounded the char ge of negligence by Lord Byron. In S cotland Joseph Galbraith, of Glasgow, in 1765 , issued the \"Free Masons \u0000 Pocket Companion.\" It contains an account of the \"Acts of the Associate Synod concerning the Masons \u0000 Oath,\" at Stirling in 1745 , September 26th, a nd at Edinburgh in 1755 , March 6th, and appended is an \"Impartial Examination of the Associate Synod against Free - masons,\" reprinted"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"from the \"Edinburgh Magazine\" of October, 1759 . In 1763 a Lodge at Durham which h ad met since 1738 went under the Grand Lo dge. The office of Grand Chaplain was instituted in 1765 , and in this year a Lodge at Ford in Northumberland, consisting of 40 members, petitioned Grand Lodge for a Charter, \"it being of old standing\"; and b etween 1764 - 7 seventy - one new Lodges were e sta blished. Prince Edward Duke of York having been made a Mason at Berlin in {512 } 1765 was c onstituted a Past Grand Master in 1766 . The Steward \u0000 s Lodge this year printed an \"Address\" of 16th November, 1763 . Entick issued a new edition of the \"Constitution s\" in 1767 . On the 16th May, 1766 , William Henry Duke of Gloucester received the three degrees in a Lodge held at the Horn Tavern; on the 9th February, 1767 , Henry Frederick Duke of Cumberland at t he Thatched House Tavern. Thus the three princes, as Maso ns, attended a meeting of Grand Lodge 15th April, 1767 , and were presented with their clothing, and the Duke of Cumberland was elected a Past Grand Master. Brother Thomas Dunckerley, who claimed to be an illegitimate conn ection of these princes, was prese nt at the meeting, and from this period was a most active promoter of Freemasonry. The registration of Initiates comm enced in 1768 . In the year 1769 Brother Wellins Calcott, P.M., published \"A Candid Disquisition of the Principles and P ractises of the Mo st Ancient and Honourable Society of Free and Accepted Masons;\" he dedicated the work to the Duke of Beaufort, and had the large number of 1,200 subscribers for the edition. In these years, 1759 - 70, the opposition to the Grand Lodge, which h ad never cea sed from the time that they broke away from the Operative Guild in 1715 , was in constant evidence, as witness the following publications: In 1759 appeared in jocular evidence, \"The Secrets of Freemasonry Revealed, by a Disgusted Brother.\" In 1760 \"Th e Three Distinct Knocks,\" by W.O.V. - N., member of a Lodge in England. Also a \"Wou \u0000 d Be \u0000 s Reason,\" for and against; followed b y a \"Willingly Wou \u0000 d Be,\" believed to refer to Derm ott \u0000 s Ahiman Rezon.

An effort was made at t his time to Incorporate the Society by Act of Parliament and to build a Hall; and, in reply to a circular letter, 168 Lodges expressed themselves in favour of the proposal and 48 opposed it. A bill was accordingly promoted in 1771 , but the scheme was fina lly abandoned. In 1772 under Lord P etrie, G.M., a Comm ittee was appointed for the purpose of erecting a Hall, and P reston \u0000 s \"Illustrations of Masonry\" received the sanction of Grand Lodge. In 1775 , \"The Spirit of Masonry\" was published b y Brother William Hutchinson, F.A.S., of Barnard Castle; it bears the sanction of the {514 } Grand Officers of England, and is dedicated to the Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland, and the Craft in general. He is s aid to have revised the Old York Lectures and hi s s ystem was used in Manchester. The foundation of Masonic Hall was laid 1 st May, 1775 , and was dedicated on the 23rd May, 1776 . On 10th April, 1777 , the first \"Freemasons \u0000 Calendar\" appeared. In 1778 a dispute occurred b etween the time imm emorial Lod ge of Antiquity and the Grand Lodge. This resulted in an application from Brother William Preston addressed to the Grand Lodge of All England at York, which h ad met regularly since 1761 , for the grant of a Charter to establish a third Grand Lodge in Londo n. This was accomplished on the 19th April, 1780 , and a Grand Lodge on the Ancient system was c onstituted, with jurisdiction south of the Trent, and P reston mentions it briefly in the 1781 edition of his \"Illustrations.\" Now we have three Grand Lodges in London and one in York. During the ten years \u0000 existence of this new Grand Lodge it established only two subordinate Lodges in addition to the \"Antiquity,\" and the authority came to an end with the readmission of Brother Preston in 1790 b y the premier G rand Lodge. In 1783 Brother Captain George Smith published a work entitled, \"The Use and Abuse of Freemasonry.\" The death of the Grand Lodge at York following shortly upon that of Brother Wm. Preston left only the two London rivals of \"Ancients\" and \"Mod erns,\" and efforts began to be set on foot to unite them. It is asserted b y the Rev. Brother A. F. A. Woodford, on the authority of Mr. Walbran, the e ditor of the Chartulary of Fountain \u0000 s Abbey, that the York Brothers were in possession of a Charter, now missing, which was supposed to be that of Athelstan; other brethren say the same, but assert that it was almost illegible. On the 1st May, 1782 , Henry Frederick Duke of Cumberland was nominated Grand Master, with the Earl of Effingham as his Deputy. In 1784 a new edition of the \"Constitutions\" was issued b y Brother John Northouck; the {515 } chief change is that t he word \"Order\" is often used for the customary titles of \"Society,\" or \"Brotherhood.\" On the 9th March, 1786 , Prince William Henry, afterward s Duke of Clarence, was initiated in Lodge No. 86 at Plymouth; and on the 6th February, 1787 , the Prince of Wales, afterwards King George IV., was initiated b y the Duke of Cumberland in a Lodge held at the Star and Garter, Pall Mall, London; and on the 21s t November, 1788 , Frederick Duke, of York was initiated b y the same Grand Master, at t he same place, the Prince of Wales, his brother, assisting at the ceremony. Sir Peter Parker, Admiral of the Fleet, had b een appointed Deputy G.M. in November, 1786 . Th e \"Freemasons \u0000"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"School for Girls\" was founded 25 th March, 1788 , mainly by the e xertions of the Chevalier Ruspini; it now bears the title of the \"Royal Masonic Institution for Girls.\" In 1790 the Grand Lodge met under the auspices of the Duke of Cumberlan d, when Edward Duke of Kent and Au gustus Frederick Duke of Sussex, both of whom had b een made Masons abroad, were constituted P ast Grand Masters. It was on this occasion that the old Lodge of \"Antiquity\" was reinstated. On the death of the Duke of Cumber land, G.M., the Prince of Wales was elected to the vacant t hrone, and was Installed Grand Master 2nd May, 1792 , when h e appointed Lord Rawdon as Acting Grand Master, and Sir Peter Parker as Deputy. The great extension of Freemasonry under the patronage of all these Princes is s hewn by the fact t hat t he number of Prov. Gd. Masters had increased, from eleven in 1770 , to twenty - four in 1795 , when Prince William of Gloucester was initiated, and Earl Moira a ppears as Acting Grand Master in 1795 . A Masonic publ ication entitled, \"The Freemasons \u0000 Magazine\" was begun in 1793 , and continued for some years with a change of title in 1798 . In this year Bro. Stephen Jones published his \"Masonic Miscellanies.\" In 1798 the Boys \u0000 School was founded, and continues to th e present day. On the 12th July, 1799 , an Act was {516 } passed for the better suppression of treasonable Societies, special exemption being made of the Freemasons \u0000 Lodges then existing. Under the favourable influence of the Prince of Wales and Earl Moira , Freemasonry made progress, and the possibility of uniting the two rival Grand Lodges began to be seriously contemplated. On the 10th April, 1799 , an Address was received from the Duke of Sunderm ania, Chief of the Order in Sweden, and a brotherly reply w as reported b y the Earl of Moira to Grand Lodge 9th May, 1799 . The first step towards uniting the \"Ancient\" and \"Modern\" Masons was made at a meeting of the latter body 20th November, 1801 , when a complaint was made against Brother Thomas Harper and oth ers for frequenting Lodges of the \"Athol Masons.\" Harper then requested a delay of three months, promising to use the time in exerting himself to promote a union of the two Grand Lodges, and this delay was c onceded. On the 4th May, 1802 , the complaint ag ainst Harper was rescinded, and a Comm ittee appointed, of which Lord Moira was a member, to pave the way for a union. From some cause or other Harper turned his back on this arrangement; the Duke of Athol \u0000 s name was used in opposition to the scheme, and n o progress resulted. On the 9th February, 1803 , Grand Lodge passed a resolution condemnatory of the \"meetings of persons c alling themselves Ancient Masons,\" and threatening to enforce the laws against their own members attending such meetings. In 1805 th e Duke of Sussex was elected a Past Grand Master. A pamphlet dated 9 th February, 1804 , by an anonymous author was issued entitled, \"Masonic Union: An Address to His Grace the Duke of Athol, on the subject of an Union, etc.\" Although the writer was a memb er of the Grand Lodge of 17I7, he closes his title with a q uotation from the ritual of Templar Priest. He overruns Masonry from the time of Carausius to the period when Harper was expelled b y his Grand Lodge. Other steps were being taken in the meantim e, and {517 } on the 12th February, 1806 , the Earl O f Moira reported that he had exerted his influence with the Grand Lodge of Scotland in favour of the union of the two bodies; the same course was followed with the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and a similar rep ort was made on the 23rd November, 1808 . On the 12th April, 1809 , a resolution"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"was passed that it was \"necessary no longer to continue in force those measures which were resorted to, in or about t he year 1739 , respecting irregular Masons; and d o therefore enjoin the several lodges to revert to the ancient landmarks of the Society.\" This refers to a change which the Grand Lodge of 1717 had made, during the period, of what they were pleased to term the advent of \"irregular Lodges,\" and which is referred to in the pamphlet of 1804 , by reversing the words of the Ist degree and 2 nd d egree, and which the pamphleteer alludes to as a dispute whether \"Gog\" and \"Magog\" were on the right hand or left, according to the position of the beholder. The reversal yet conti nues with many bodies of foreign Masons. This s tep was followed b y the appointment of a \"Lodge of Promulgation\" as preparatory to the desired union. Generally it is c onsidered that this c hange had given the Athol Masons the first handle for term ing the G rand Lodge \"Modern,\" but the distinction between the two sects had much wider grounds, as s hewn in our last chapter. On the death of Admiral Sir Peter Parker, H.R.H. the Prince of Wales appointed his brother, the Duke of Sussex, 11th December, 1811 , as Acting Grand - Master, and when the form er became Regent of the Kingdom, the Duke of Sussex was elected Grand Master, and the Regent Grand P atron. At a meeting of the Grand Lodge on the 27th January, 1813 , there were present six Royal D ukes -- Sussex, Yor k, Clarence, Kent, Cumberland, Gloucester; on this occasion Earl Moira, now Marquis of Hastings, was presented with a magnificent chain and jewel of office, as he was about t o depart for India. The Duke of Sussex was installed {518 } Grand Master on 12th M ay, 1813 ; and as Edward Duke of Kent had already become a member of the Athol G rand Lodge, their Grand Master the Duke of Athol, with the union in view, resigned his office and recomm ended as his s uccessor H.R.H. the Duke of Kent, who was accordingly Insta lled as Grand Master on the 1st December, 1813 , at Willis \u0000\u0001\u0007 ooms, St. James \u0000 Square. There now remained no o bstacle to the union of the whole Craft, and the form al \"Articles of Union\" were drawn up at Kensington Palace on the 25th November, 1813 , and ra tified at meetings of the two Grand Lodges held on 1st December, 1813 ; these Articles were signed on behalf of the Grand Lodge of 1717 , by Au gustus Frederick, G.M.; Waller Rodwell Wright, P.G.M. of the Ionian Islands; Arthur Tegart, P.G.W.; James Deans, P. G.W.; William H. White, Gd. Secretary; and on behalf of the Grand Lodge of 1751 , by Edward, G.M.; Thomas Harper, D.G.M.; James Perry, P.D.G.M.; James Agar, P.D.G.M.; Robert Leslie, Gd. Secretary. In accordance with this the two parties met at the Crown and Anchor tavern in S trand, when the Articles were accepted with Masonic acclamation and unanimously confirm ed. A \"Lodge of Reconciliation,\" composed of nine members of the Constitution of England, with Brother White as Secretary, and nine members of the old Institution, with Brother Edward Harper as Secretary, was then constituted with the object of mutually obligating each other, and affording the necessary instruction for amalgamating the two usages into o ne uniform r itual. Although the 1717 , or \"Mo dern\" Masons, had b ecome zealous members of the Royal Arch and Chivalric degrees, yet such degrees were held to be outside their Grand Lodge. On the other hand the 1751 , \"Ancient\" Masons, had from the first treated the Arch degree as an essential part of Masonry to be conferred on Past Masters under Craft Charters, and to meet this the following was made"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"part of the \"Articles:\" -- \"11. It is declared and p ronounced {519 } that pure ancient Masonry consists of three degrees, and no more; viz., those of the E ntered Apprentice; the Fellow Craft; and the Master Mason (including the Supreme Order of the Holy Royal Arch). But this Article is not intended to prevent any Lodge or Chapter from holding a meeting in any of the Orders of Chivalry, according to the Cons titutions of the said Orders.\" By this Article, which is obligatory upon the Grand Lodge in all time, the Royal Arch is the completion of the third d egree, yet worked as a High - grade, and though all other grades are e xcluded from the new Rite, they are not prohibited b ut they are allowed to be practised. At the period of this Chapter the official Catechisms had b ecome e laborate, the Harodim of Brother Preston being of some note. They still continued to retain a considerable amount of Christian symbol ism, confined chiefly to the spiritualisation of Solomon \u0000 s temple, and the furniture and utensils. {520 }  CHAPTER X III.  FREE MASONRY UNDER THE UNITED G RAND LODG E. A MEE TING of the \"United Grand Lodge of Anci ent Freemasons of England\" was held at Freemasons \u0000 Hall on the 27th December, 1813 , to form ally consumm ate the Union. The Masters, Wardens, and P ast Masters of the two bodies c omposing this united Assembly had b een obligated b y the \"Lodge of Reconciliatio n\" on a uniform plan, and were admitted b y tickets, signed and countersigned b y the two Secretaries whose names appear to the Articles of Union mentioned in our last chapter, Brothers White and Leslie. The two Grand Masters, namely, the Dukes of Sussex an d Kent, occupied equal thrones. The Rev. Brother Coglin, D.D., Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of 1717 , proclaimed the confirm ation of the Articles to which the brethren signified their assent; then the Rev. Brother Barry, D.D., Grand Chaplain of the Gr and Lodge of 1751 , proclaimed the Union; after which Brother Wesley perform ed a symphony on the organ. Other symbolic c eremonies were gone through and the tests were pronounced p ure and correct. The Grand Officers of both bodies now divested themselves of their Insignia. The Duke of Kent proposed his brother the Duke of Sussex as Grand Master of the United Fraternity. The latter was then obligated, placed upon the throne and p roclaimed; after which the Grand Master proceeded to appoint his officers, t he Rev. Bro. Samuel H emm ing, D.D., and Bro. Isaac Lindo, Grand Wardens, and the two Grand Secretaries being those of the form er Grand Lodges. {521 } The Register of the united List of Lodges was s ettled b y drawing lots for precedence, and as that resulte d in favour of the 1751 b ody its Charters obtained a rank in n umerical order over those of the other, which still perpetuates a muddle in the chronological position of the Lodges. A reference"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"to Brother John Lane \u0000 s v aluable \"Masonic Records\" indicates tha t the revised list of the United Grand Lodge included 388 Lodges of the 1717 Constitution, and 260 Lodges of the 1751 Constitution, or a total on the new Register of 648 Lodges. A new edition of the \"Constitutions\" was edited b y Brother William Williams a nd issued in 1815 , and which inserts the declaration as to degrees with which we closed our last chapter. The Arm s adopted b y the United Grand Lodge were a q uartering of those of the Grand Lodge of 1717 , and those of the Grand Lodge of 1751 ; the first b eing a differenced coat of those granted to the London Company of Masons in 1472 , and the latter being derived from the standards of the four principal tribes of Israel, adapted b y Christians to the four Evangelists, and form ing the seal of the Grand Chapt er of York, the Grand Lodge Seal being the three crowns attributed to Prince Edwin of Deira. Motto: Au de vide tace (Hear, see, and b e silent.) A revision of the Lectures of the three degrees of the Craft was c omm itted to the Rev. Bro. Samuel H emm ing, D .D., Chaplain to the Duke of Sussex, who made some progress therein, but is s aid to have been completed b y the Rev. Bro. Williams. The system, though exhibiting no great amount of genius, has continued in use to the present day, and though preserving the main features of the older systems all Christian references were e xpunged, in order to adapt them, in an antiquarian sense, to the supposed constitution of the Society by King Solomon, whose throne e very Worshipful Master is fabled to o ccupy. For some y ears the United Grand Lodge continued the e ven tenor of its way, without much worthy of notice for the historian. On the death of Brother William Preston {522 } in 1810 he left 300 P ounds in Consols the interest of which was to be devoted to an ann ual rehe arsal of his own system of Lectures. On the 8th March, 1820 , the Grand Master called the attention of Grand Lodge to the death of George III., who had occupied the throne since 1760 , and an address of Condolence was v oted to the Grand P atron of United Fre emasonry, now King George IV.; this address was presented b y the Duke of Sussex o n the 10th May, 1820 , and the Royal Arm s were hereafter engraved on the head of the certificates. A similar address was presented to His Majesty, the Grand Patron upon the de ath of H.R.H. the Duke of Kent, Past G.M. Between the years 1819 - 23 a regrettable misunderstanding occurred b etween the Prov. Gd. Master of Lancashire and some of the Lodges under his s way; the misunderstanding arising in Lodge No. 31, meeting at Liverp ool. Blame seems to be attributable to all sides alike, and the Lodge was erased in 1822 ; it was followed in 1823 b y the e rasure of the Sea Captain \u0000 s Lodge, No. 140 which h ad resolved to stand or fall by No. 31.<<Preston \u0000 s \"Illus.,\" Oli ver \u0000 s ed.; also \"Hi st.

Belzoni left behind him some little memento o f his Masonic theories, in which h e refers to the triangular and the serpen t aprons of the Egyptian Kings, and their Initiations; he also expresses an opinion that the invention of the Level and P lumb, are due to Nimr od and Ashur."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" In the year 1829 p ast Grand Stewards had p erm ission to wear a Jewel. The death of the Grand P atr on George IV. in 1830 was reported to Grand Lodge 17th July, 1830 b y his brother the Grand Master, who then read the draft of an Address to be presented to King William IV. {523 } condoling with h im upon the loss of his brother, and soliciting that he would extend his Patronage to the Craft. To this a reply was received from Sir Robert Peel, dated the 28th July, 1830 , signifying the King \u0000 s c onsent to become Grand P atron. At the beginn ing of the year 1832 Sir John S oane, the Grand Superintendent of Works, reported the completion of alterations which h ad b een in progress to adapt the new Masonic Hall as a Temple e xclusively devoted to Masonry, and as the e xpense of the alterations had b een great he e nclosed a draft for 500 Poounds towards the cost. In this year 1832 a renumbering of the Lodges took place to fill up the vacancies occasioned b y Lodges which h ad b ecome e xtinct. In March 1833 Lord Dundas, the Deputy G.M. presented to Grand Lodge on behalf of the Duke of Sussex, G.M., a bust of King William IV. the Grand Patron; also three gilt trowels which h ad b een used on the occasions of laying the foundation stones of the London University; the Licensed Victuallers \u0000 Asylum; and the Charing Cross Hospital. In the year 1834 the \"Freemasons \u0000 Quarterly Revie w\" was c omm enced and continued its labours down to 1850 when a \"New Series\" was begun, since which time the Craft has never been without one or m ore periodicals. The learned Brother George Oli ver, D.D., whose father, the Rev. Samuel Oli ver, had been a Mas on of the \"Ancient\" school, since 1823 had p ublished a number of Masonic works; he may be considered the father of Masonic literature, though his works, for want of critical attention, have fallen into much undeserved neglect. Several new Lodges were co nstituted in the Provinces in 1834 , when the Earl of Durham was Deputy G.M., and new Masonic Halls were opened at Dorchester and Tiverton. In the month of June 1835 a resolution was passed at a meeting of brothers favourable to the scheme in view, -- \"th at it is expedient to provide for the wants of the meritorious, but aged and d ecayed Freemasons, by {524 } the e rection of an Asylum to receive them within its Sanctuary.\" In December 1835 the Grand Stewards \u0000 Lodge celebrated the Centenary of its foundat ion in June 1735 , at Freemasons \u0000 Hall. Also the Grand Lodge of Scotland celebrated the Centenary of its foundation by a Festival on S t. Andrew \u0000 s day 1836 . In this year 1836 several foundation stones were laid in England with Masonic ritual and solemnitie s. The Duke of Sussex, G.M., had been for some time in bad health, and the loss of his eyesight was feared, but on the 27th Jany., 1837 , he was s o far recovered as to make his appearance in Grand Lodge, when h e received a most cordial and hearty welcome. The Grand Lodge at this period conceived the idea of form ing a Library. In the year 1838 a magnificent Candelabrum, the funds to purchase which had b een raised b y subscription, was presented to the Grand Master. The \"Asylum for Aged and Decayed Freema sons,\" celebrated a festival in June of this year, but later on, in the same year, an opposition to the scheme was raised b y the Grand Master, who had form ed the impression that it would injure the other charities, but the opposition was withdrawn, after s ome very unpleasant scenes, which for a time affected the Masonic s tanding of Brother R. T. Crucifex, one of its s upporters and the Editor of the \"Freemasons"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Quarterly Review.\" This Asylum was brought into actual operation in 1839 ; and the Earl of Durham was appointed P ro - Grand Master in the same year. In 1842 the Male Ann uity Fund of the Royal Benevolent Institution was established, the Grand Lodge voting it an ann ual sum of 400 P ounds. The Duke of Sussex, G.M., died on the 21st April, 1843 , and it th en became necessary for the Grand Lodge to elect a Grand Master. Bro. Thomas Dundas Earl of Zetland was s elected for that office, and his Installation took p lace in March 1844 . In the same year a handsome testimonial was presented to Dr. George Oli ver. Also the {525 } Duchess of Inverness presented to Grand Lodge the Candelabrum which h ad b een given to her husband in 1838 . Between the years 1944 - 7, a certain amount of friction occurred b etween the Grand Lodges of England and the Royal York of Berlin, owi ng to the refusal of the latter to acknowledge any other than Christian Freemasons; the difficulty was finally arranged b y the Royal York, acceding, in a limited measure, to the liberal views of this c ountry. Previous to 1847 it was, from olden time, a ne cessity that a Candidate should b e \"free - born,\" but in this year it was resolved to substitute the qualification of \"free - man.\" In 1849 the Masonic Widow \u0000 s Ann uity fund was established; and the Queen became Grand P atroness of the Boy \u0000 s School in 1852 . On the 7th December, 1853 , the Grand Master reported to Grand Lodge that he had b een under the necessity of suspending Bro. William Tucker, the Prov. Gd.

Tucker had made a point in h is Address of recomm ending those higher degrees of Masonry found in the Ancient and Accepted Rite of 33 d egrees, which after having met with disfavour from the late Grand Master had b een introduced into England from America within two years of the death of the Duke of Sussex. On the 4th June, 1856 , an attempt was made to foist the ceremonial of the Mark d egree into the Craft series, but was rejected as an impossibility, as the \"Articles of Union\" state that pure Freemasonry consists of three degrees and no more; on this occasion Brother John Henderson, the Grand Registrar, said tha t, -- \"no man, nor body of men, could make such inn ovation as that proposed, without endangering the whole fabric of the Institution.\" The Earl of Dalhousie was appointed Deputy G.M. in 1857 . {526 } Between October 1855 and September 1857 , many of the C anadian Craftsmen withdrew themselves from under our bann er alleging neglect by the officials of Grand Lodge, and thereupon erected a Grand Lodge of their own. This led to the form ation of a \"Colonial Board\" in 1856 b y the Grand Lodge of England, and the establishment of a second Grand Lodge in Canada. On this occasion England lost the Canadian Lodges, save a few Masons who remained faithful to their old allegiance. The two Grand Lodges, thus form ed in Canada united 14 th July, 1858 under the designation of \"The Grand Lodge of Canada.\" These troubles led to the resignation of Bro. Wm. Hy. White, who had b een Gd. Secretary since the union of 1813 , and to the appointment in 1857 of Brother William Gray Clarke. The nucleus of a Masonic Hall was begun in M anchester 27th,June, 1857 , by taking the upper floor of rooms over the shops with an opening at 78 Cross Street, and d ividing the same into Refreshment room supplied b y a back"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"staircase, a Lodge Room and a Tyler \u0000 s Room; a club also was established. The Li verpool Masonic Temple was c omm enced in 1858 b y the purchase of a building for 1,600 P ounds. In April 1861 the Earl de Grey and Ripon was appointed Deputy G.M. On the 8th January, 1862 , the Grand Lodge voted an Address of Condolence to the Queen on the death of her Consort on 14th December, 1861 . In July, 1862 , the Prov. Gd. Master of East Lancashire Brother Stephen Blair, laid the foundation of a Masonic Hall at Manchester, the necessary funds being raised by a Company of Sh areholders. On the 3rd Dec ember, 1862 , it was resolved to revise the numbering of the Lodges, thus eliminating the vacancies occurring since 1832 . The Masonic Hall at Manchester was opened b y the Prov. Gd. Master 3rd November, 1864 . It had b een in contemplation to improve the Mas onic Hall, London, by separating the Tavern entirely from that portion used for Grand Lodge purposes, and on the 27th April, 1864 , the Earl of Zetland, G.M., laid the {527 } foundation stone of the new building which was c ompleted for Masonic purposes in 18 66. In 1865 a revision of the \"Book of Constitutions\" was made and it was directed that t he term Prov. Grand Master in England, should b e District Grand Master in the Colonies and foreign parts. On the 7th June, 1865 , the subject of the Mark d egree was again brought under discussion and it was resolved to refuse recognition to the Mark Grand Lodge which h ad b een established in 1856 , the ceremonial being treated as c omparatively modern. The learned b rother Dr. George Oli ver was interred with Masonic hon ours in 1867 ; and on the death of Brother William Gray Clarke in 1868 , Brother John Hervey became Grand Secretary. On the 2nd June 1869 the Earl of Zetland, G.M., inform ed the Grand Lodge that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales had b een received into Freemasonr y by the King of Sweden; and in S eptember of the same year he was elected a Past Gd. Master of England, and the Prince attended Grand Lodge in December 1869 . The number of Lodges on the Roll had increased from 723 in 1844 , to 1299 in the year 1869 . Freem asons \u0000 Hall had now been separated from the tavern, and was form ally inaugurated on the 14th April 1869 . On the voluntary resignation of the Earl of Zetland as Grand Master in 1870 , a handsome testimonial was arranged and subscriptions obtained; the Ear l accepted a silver inkstand, and d irected that the remainder of the contribution, which amounted to 2,730 P ounds s hould form a fund for the relief of distinguished b rethren who might be in distress and to be named the \"Zetland Fund.\" Earl de Grey and R ipon was now nominated to the office of Grand Master, and was installed as s uch on the 14th May 1870 . The Masonic c areer of this Grand Master, who was made a Marquis for diplomatic s ervices in the United States, was not closed in a mann er equally distingu ished, as upon h is embracing the Roman Catholic faith h e resigned his office of Grand Master 2nd September, {528 } 1874 . Arthur Duke of Conn aught and Leopold Duke of Albany were initiated in 1874 , the form er in the \"Prince of Wales Lodge,\" and the latter i n the \"Apollo University Lodge.\" The Prince of Wales having already the rank of a Past Grand Master of England, a deputation was appointed to interview him upon the acceptance of the office vacated b y the Marquis of Ripon. At the meeting of Grand Lodge in December, 1874 , it was reported that t he Prince would accept t he Grand"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Mastership, and would appoint t he Earl of Carnarvon as pro - Grand Master, and Lord Skelmersdale as Deputy G.M. Accordingly the Prince of Wales was Installed Grand Master, with great pomp, at t he Royal Albert Hall, South Kensington, on the 28th April, 1875 , which was duly comm emorated b y a painting in oil, and an engraved copy of the same. In May of the same year the Prince was Installed G.Z. of the Supreme Grand Chapter. His brothe r Leopold Duke of Albany was Installed P rovincial G d. Master of Oxfordshire in February 1876 . At t he meeting of Grand Lodge, April, 1877 , the Prince of Wales, G.M., appointed his brothers the Dukes of Conn aught and of Albany as his two Grand Wardens; an d 4 ,000 P ounds was v oted b y Grand Lodge to the Royal National Life Boat Institution. On the 5th December in this year a Comm ittee was appointed to consider the action of the Grand Orient of France in reference to the abolition of the requirement of any sp ecial religious belief f rom candidates for Initiation, or as the Grand Lodge preferred to put it, the removal of the name of God from their Constitution, and in March 1878 the Comm ittee gave in a report denying recognition as \"true and genuine\" brethren to those so Initiated. In 1879 Brother John Hervey, whose death took p lace the following y ear, resigned the office of Grand Secretary, and Colonel Sh adwell H . Clerke was appointed. On the 1st June, 1881 , the list Of Grand Officers was increased b y adding a Deputy Master of Ceremonies and two Grand {529 } Sword Bearers. In 1882 the Prince of Wales, G.M., was present at Grand Lodge, with h is two brothers, when a congratulatory Address was v oted to the Queen on h er escape from the danger of assassination. I n 1883 a new edition of the \"Book of Constitutions\" was issued; the great Hall at Freemasons \u0000 Hall i n London was destroyed b y fire; and the Society lost t he Duke of Albany by death, 28th March, 1884 . On the 28th November, 1884 , a Charter was granted for the \"Quatuor Coronati Lodge,\" 2076 , Brother Sir Charles Warren being the first W.M.; the object of the Lodge, besides the ordinary routine of such bodies, being the increase of Masonic knowledge by competent Lectures at each meeting, the publication of th e same in a journal entitled \"Ars Quatuor Coronatorum,\" and the reprint of our ancient MSS ., and other works in volumes designated \"Quatuor Coronatorum Antigraphia.\" One of their first developments was the establishment, by the late Brother G. W. Speth, t he Secretary of the Lodge, of a \"Correspondence Circle\" which n ow numbers over three thousand members. In the year 1884 Grand Lodge passed a resolution of Remonstrance against the Pope \u0000 s Encyclical denouncing Freemasonry; and a new edition of the Arch R egulations was prepared. At a meeting of \"Royal Alpha Lodge,\" London, on the 17th March, 1885 , the Prince of Wales, G.M., himself Initiated his eldest son Prince Albert Victor, and in 1887 conferred upon h im the office of Senior Grand Warden. The new Gre at Hall was c ompleted in 1885 ; and on the 22nd June, 1886 , the Prince of Wales, G.M., Installed his brother the Duke of Conn aught as Prov. Gd. Master of Sussex. On the 1st June, 1887 , Brother Henry Sadler was appointed Sub - librarian of Grand Lodge, whic h was a poor affair for so wealthy a body, but which Brother Sadler has done much to improve and is himself the author of some valuable works, as \"Masonic Facts and Fictions; Life of Thomas Dunckerley; Notes on the Ceremony of Installation;\" {530 } Portrait of G. M. Sayer; Catalogue of Gd."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Lodge Library, etc. In this year, 1887 , Brother R. F. Gould completed the last volume of his well - known \"History of Freemasonry.\" On the 13th June, 1887 , a grand Masonic Celebration of Her Majesty \u0000 s Jubilee was held at the Royal Albert Hall, under the presidency of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales as Grand Master, when an Address, handsomely illuminated on vellum, for presentation to her Majesty the Queen, was read to the Assembly and a special Jewel was presented to the Gran d Master, such as might be worn by all Masons who were subscribing members of any Lodge at the time. At a meeting of Grand Lodge, 6th June, 1888 , the rank of Past Grand Master was conferred upon Oscar II. King of Sweden and Norway, Grand Master or Vicariu s Salamonis in those countries. Between the 4th and 7 th of June in this year the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution for Girls c elebrated its c entenary at the Royal Albert Hall; the 4th was the prize distribution day, at which were present the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Princesses Louise, Victoria, and Maud. On the 7th the Prince of Wales presided, and was s upported b y the King of Sweden, and various notables of the English Craft. In December 1890 the Prince of Wales, G.M., Installed his el dest son Prince Albert Victor Duke of Clarence and Avondale as Prov. Grand Master of Berkshire; unfortunately his tenure of that office was v ery short as he died on the 14th January, 1892 . The death of Brother Sh adwell H . Clerke, the Grand Secretary, on t he 25th December, 1891 , led to the appointment to that office of Brother Edward Letchworth. On the 27th January, 1892 , the Grand Lodge voted an Address of Condolence to the Queen, and to the Prince of Wales, G.M., on the lamented death of the Duke of Cl arence and Avondale, and the whole Craft followed this example. The Jubilee of the Royal Masonic Benevolent Institution was celebrated the 24th February of this year at the Covent Garden Theatre, with the Earl of {531 } Mount Edgecombe as President, when t he unprecedented sum of 59,593 P ounds 15s. 0d. was c ontributed. In December, 1892 , Grand Lodge again agreed to enlarge the number of Grand Officers by the addition of a Deputy Grand Registrar, a Deputy Grand Sword Bearer, additional G rand Deacons, and Gra nd Directors of Ceremonies; the like appointments to extend to Provincial G rand Lodges, according to their numerical strength. During this year the question of admitting Jews as Freemasons was agitated in Prussia, and a new Lodge was established for the s pecial purpose of such Initiations. It is, however, outside a work of this nature to print t he ordinary and recent outline of the routine of Freemasonry, which must give the world the idea that all is pomp, parade, man millinery, and b anqueting. Matters of this s ort can be gathered from the ordinary Freemasons \u0000 Journals, which make it t heir business to report every detail for the e dification of the members of Lodges. With the great increase that is c onstantly taking place in the numbers of Lodges, inn ova tions are constantly being introduced of a doubtful character, not calculated for the good of the Society. We will, however, mention a few more items of general interest. At a meeting of Grand Lodge, 19th April, 1896 , the rank of Past Grand Officer was conferred upon 21 d istinguished Masons, in comm emoration of the 21 years during which the Prince of Wales had filled the Grand Mastership. A comm emoration festival was held on the 14th June 1897 at the Royal Albert Hall, in h onour of her Majesty the Quee n h aving attained the 60th year of her reign, and which was one of the finest spectacles on record. Another, worthy of"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"record, was the Festival of the Royal Masonic Institution for Boys, on the 10th July, 1898 , under the Presidency of the Grand Master at the Royal Albert Hall, London, when the unprecedented sum of 141 ,000 P ounds was reported as subscribed for the purpose of erecting new school buildings, and removing the School to Bushey, near Watford. At the meeting of Grand Lodge on the {532 } 7th S eptem ber, 1898 , term s were proposed and p assed for the recognition of the sometime e stablished Grand Lodge of New Zealand. On the 12th May, 1900 , the foundation - stone was laid at Bushey of the New Royal Masonic Institution for Boys; the inscription upon the plate deposited was as follows: -- \"This s tone was laid on the 12th May, A.D. 1900 , with Masonic c eremonial, by H.R.H. the Duke of Conn aught and Strathearn, K.G., &c., &c., Grand Master, President of the Institution.\" The death of H.M. Queen Victoria oc curring on the 22nd January, 1901 , With the accession of the Prince of Wales as Edward VII., caused his resignation as Grand Master, on the 15th February, upon which the Duke of Conn aught was nominated as Grand Master and was Installed 17 th July, 1901 , in the Royal Albert Hall. The prosperity of the Craft, f or m any y ears, has been progressive and uninterrupted in its numerical accessions, and since 1869 , when the Lodges were renumbered, to the day we write, some 1,500 Lodges are added to the Roll. The a dvance in its literary efforts has kept pace with the numerical increase in its Lodges, though Freemasons as a body are very indifferent to its literature. The \"Quatuor Coronati Lodge\" has distinguished itself by the issue of numerous facsimiles of ancien t MSS . reproduced with great care, and in the most beautiful style; it has c ompleted twenty volumes of its \"Transactions,\" Lectures and p apers distinguished b y the accuracy and soundness of their inform ation, and the e xcellence of the workmanship, and it h as thus been the means of spreading sound and reliable Masonic literature over all the world; and we have been much indebted to its papers in compiling this book. In equally g ood style the Newcastle College of Rosicrucians has produced facsimiles of ancie nt MSS . besides their ordinary \"Transactions.\" The Rosicrucian College of London h as also published valuable papers. The West Yorkshire Provincial Library, established b y the e xertions of Brother Wm. Watson, the Prov. Gd. Secretary {533 } and Librarian, h as reproduced nine copies of the Constitutional Charges at the cost of the Prov. Gd. Master, the late Brother Thos. Wm. Tew. The York b rothers have published a similar volume of the old Charges by subscription. Other valuable works have proceeded from th e pens of Brothers Wm. James Hughan, Kenn eth R. H. Mackenzie, Robert Freke Gould, W. Wynn Westcott, M.B., G. W. Speth, John Strachan, Q.C., Henry Sadler, John Lane, W. J. C. Crawley, LL.D., G. W. Bain, and many others too numerous to mention; also some rep rints of old p lates, books, and d ocuments. The Quatuor Coronati Lodge, 2076 , however, has had the great misfortune to lose one of its most valued p illars, Bro. G. W. Speth, 19th April, 1901 , in h is 54th year, and the Lodge e rected, by subscription, a monu ment. The death of the Treasurer followed on the 4th June 1901 , viz., Sir Walter Besant in h is 65th year. In 1905 Bro. R. F. Gould p ublished his \"Concise History of Freemasonry.\" Another notable e vent of the time was the e stablishment, by Mrs. Besant, of a S.G.C. 33rd Degree, in London, under authority from India, which received it from a dissension which occurred in the S.G.C. 33rd Degree of France. It"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"confers all its degrees indiscriminately upon males and females, and works the Craft degrees under the Ritual of the Grand Lodge of England, and at t he present time has numerous adherents and Lodges. It has added only to the Ritual a \"Dharm a\" Lecture which compares Masonry with secret societies of India, and takes the name of Co - Masonry. Even this m ay aid in rousing amongst Freemasons a more intellectual standard of labour. Possibly, if Masonry was less of a political machine, officered from the Court, and its high officials elected b y the Craft for \"Merit\" alone, we should see a better state of thi ngs than n ow exists. A section of the Press is now agitating against Freemasonry, assigning as grounds that t he worst men are e mployed b y our Municipal Councils to the detriment of non - Masons. On the other hand, a very worthy brother, {534 } w ho was initi ated in the same Lodge as myself, was c omplaining against the carelessness in inquiry into the character of candidates. I replied that this was s o, but although I had been fifty - five years a Mason, and had b een deluged from every part of the world with un solicited Honours, I was pleased to say that, in all these years, I never, in a single instance, met with any one Mason with an eye to my worldly interests, hence I utterly disbelieved those assertions that good men were ousted in the interests of Masons. In all these years the old Operative Guilds of Free Masons have continued their work without changing the secrecy of their proceedings. They have their Lodges in London, Leicester, Norfolk, Derbyshire, Holyhead, York, Durham, Berwick, and elsewhere. S ome of these are in a languishing condition, but they exist, and are in course of galvanisation. Of late years they seem to have become disgusted with the vain pretensions of Modern S peculative Freemasonry, and under authority of the three coequal G .M.M. \u0000 s of the South and North h ave to some little e xtent relaxed the secrecy of their proceedings; and though the greater part of their m embers are utterly averse to anything whatever being made public, possibly in time these restrictions will be further modifi ed, to the advantage of the Speculative system of 1813 , for m any parts are quite incomprehensible, even to learned Freemasons, without the techn ical part which only the Guilds of the Free Masons c an supply.

IT has been thought advisable to add here copies of the ancient MSS . referred to in the foregoing pages, reduced int o somewhat more modern English for the comfort of the reader. No injury can arise from this procedure, as those who are interested in the e xact verbiage will consult the facsimiles issued b y Lodge 2076 , and other printed copies. We have made use of certa in emendations which h ave been shewn to be necessary by the best critics. Attention was first directed to these MSS . by Brother William James Hughan, who printed, in 1872 , a volume of the \"Old Charges.\" For some years his efforts to direct attention to these MSS . met with slight success, as the bearing of them upon the present state of Freemasonry was not fully recognised; but to Brother Hughan belongs the credit of bringing these documents into prominent notice. A few zealous brethren, amongst whom may be mentioned the Rev. A. F. A. Woodford, R. F. Gould, G. W. Speth, Dr. William Begemann of Rostock, C. C. Howard of Picton, N.Z., Wm. Watson, Henry Sadler, F. F. Schn itger, and others, have laboured to develop the work thus begun by Brother Hughan, and we must express indebtedness to their unselfish labours. It is noteworthy that, with the e xception of those MSS . which refer to Henry VI., all these documents c lose their Masonic history with the reign of Athelstan. Practically the \"Regius MS.\" and th e \" \u0000 Book of Charges \u0000 \" of the \"Cooke MS.\" are identical, except that the versifier has lengthened the form er MS. by his own comm ents, and we have therefore taken the prose copy, as probably nearer the Athelstan original; for m ost of the e mendations (in brac kets) we are indebted to Brother C. C. Howard. Brother G. W. Speth considered it likely that the nine ARTICLES were the legal enactments of the King, whilst the nine POINTS were those of the e mployers.

"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" This MS. as we have before stated is the \"Book of Charges\" attached to the \"Cooke MS.,\" and agrees with the \"Regius MS.,\" being complete in itself; and (our oldest MS.) is actually, with some additions, a rhythmical version of No. 1. When we come to the mention of \"New Men,\" it is possible that the 9 P oi nts may have been substituted for them by \"Divers Congregations\"; in later times they were read as the Charge of an Apprentice. It is even so to - day by Masons.  II.  ANGLO - NORMAN C HARGES. Ther e seems no reason to doubt that No. 1 is the original Saxon Charge, but as there was a constant influx o f French Masons from the time of the conquest, a pure French Charge must at one time have e xisted, and which h as c learly been added to the older English documents. The 1316 d ocument is extracted from Brother R. F. Gould \u0000 s History of Freemasonry (Vol. ii. p. 341 ). It is of equal value with any that we have, and illustrates the old MSS . in an interesting way. In the first place the Laws are decreed b y the very authorities which the Charges themselves appeal to, and \"six o r four ancient men of the trade\" are required to testify on a Master taking on work. It settles the dispute between the Mason - hewers and the Light masons or setters, and p laces them bo th under sworn Elders or Ancients of the trade. It admits that there was no Court, and orders one to be sworn, which thus became the London Company of Masons, uniting Masons and Freemasons, of which the form er had 4 representatives and the latter 2, but b ecame now a United Company.  III. The text of the \"Cooke\" preface, as far as the same is c omplete, has been used for this document, the remainder being taken from the \"Watson MS.,\" which is a document complete in itsel f, but with many errors of the copyist. The author speaks of \"old b ooks of Charges,\" existing before his time, and he has possibly mistaken \"Martellus\" for \"Secundus,\" inasmuch as Charles Martel was not King but Regent, and only \"came to his {538 } kingdom \" in h is c hildren, Charlemagne being his grandson, who had a grandson Charles Il.

It befell somet imes that great Lords had no such large possessions that they could well advance their free - begotten children for they had so many; therefore they took counsel how they might advance their children and ordain for them an h onest livelihood. And they sent a fter wise Masters of the worthy science of Geometry, that through their wisdom they might ordain them some honest living. Then one of them that had the name of Euclid was the subtle and wise founder, and ordained an Art and called it Masonry, and so with this honest art he taught t he children of the great Lords, by the prayer of the fathers and the free - will of their children; the which, when they were taught with h igh care, by a certain time they were not all alike able to take of the"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"aforesaid Art, where fore Euclid ordained that they who were passing of cunn ing should b e passing honoured, and ordained to call the more cunn ing Master, to inform the less c unn ing, Masters of the which were called Masters of Nobility of wit and cunn ing of that Art. Neverthel ess they comm anded that they who were less of wit should not be called servant, nor subject, but fellow for nobility of their gentle blood. In this mann er was the aforesaid Art begun in the land of Egypt, by the aforesaid Master Euclid, and so it went fro m land to land, and from kingdom to kingdom. After that many y ears, in the time of Athelstan King of England, by his Councillors and other great Lords of the land, by comm on assent, for great defects found amongst Masons, they ordained a certain Rule am ongst them, once in the year, or in three years, as the need were, the King and great Lords of the land, and all the comm onality, from province to province, and from country to country, Congregations s hould b e made by Masters, of all Master Masons and Fell ows in the aforesaid Art, and so at such Congregations they that be made Masters s hould b e e xamined of the \"Articles\" after written, and b e ransacked whether they be able and cunn ing to the profit of the Lords (having) them to serve, and to the honour of t he aforesaid Art. And moreover (that) they should receive their \"Charge\" that they should well and truly dispend the goods of their Lords, as well the lowest as the highest, for they be their Lords for the time of whom they take pay for their service, a nd for their travail. The first \"Article\" is this, -- That every Master of this Art should b e wise and true to the lord that he serveth, dispensing his goods truly as he would have his own were dispensed, and not give more pay to a Mason than h e wot he may deserve, after the dearth of corn and victual i n the country, no favour withstanding for every man to be rewarded after his travail. The second \"Article\" is this, -- That every Master of this Art should b e warned beforehand to come to his c ongregati on, but they be e xcused b y some cause. But nevertheless if they be found rebellious at such Congregations, or faulty in any mann er {540 } of harm to their lords, and reproof of this Art, they should not be e xcused unless in peril of death, and though they be in peril of death, they shall warn the Master who is Principal of the Gathering of his decease (disease). The third \"Article\" is this, -- That no Master take no Prentice for a less term than 7 years at t he least, because such as be within a less term may not profitably come to (knowledge of) this Art, nor able to serve truly his lord and to take as a Mason should take. The fourth \"Article\" is this, -- That no Master for no profit take no Prentice to be learned that is born of bond b lood, because hi s lord to whom he is bond, will take him, as he well may, from his Art, and lead him out of his Lodge, or out of his place that he worketh in; for his Fellows peradventure would help him and debate for him, and therefore manslaughter m ight arise; it is for bidden. And also for another cause; this Art took b eginn ing of great lord \u0000 s c hildren freely begotten, as it is s aid b efore. The fifth \"Article\" is this, -- That no Master give more to his Prentice in time of his Prenticehood, for no profit he might t ak e, than h e notes well he may deserve of the lord that he serveth; nor not so much (but) that the lord of the place that he is taught in, may have some profit for his teaching."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":" The sixth \"Article\" is this, -- That no Master for no covetousness nor profit take no Prentice to teach that is imperfect, that is to say having any maim, for the which h e may not truly work as he ought to do.

The ninth \"Article\" is this, -- That no Maste r shall supplant another: for it is said in the Art of Masonry, that no man can make an end so well of work, begun by another, to the profit of his lord, as he (that) began it, to end it by his matters, or to whom he sheweth h is matters. THIS COUNC IL is made by divers Lords and Masters of divers Provinces, and divers Congregations of Masonry, and it is, to wit, that whosoe coveteth to come to the state of the foresaid Art it behoveth them: -- First, principally to (love) G od and Holy Church and al - hal ows, and his Master and his Fellows as his own brethren. The second \"Point,\" -- He must fulfil his day \u0000 s work truly that he taketh for his pay. The third \"Point,\" -- That he can h ele the Counsel of his Fellows, in \"Lodge\" and in \"Chamber,\" and in eve ry place where Masons be. The fourth \"Point,\" -- That he be no deceiver in the foresaid Art, nor do no prejudice, nor sustain any Articles against the Art, nor against any of the Art, but he shall sustain it in all honour, inasmuch as he may. The fif th \"Point,\" -- When h e shall take his pay that he take it meekly, as the time is ordained b y the Master to be done, and that he fulfil the acceptations of travail and of rest ordained and set by the Master. {541 } The sixth \"Point,\" -- If any discord sha ll be between h im and his Fellows, he shall obey meekly, and b e still at the bidding of his Master, or of the Warden of his Master, in the Master \u0000 s absence, to the holy day following, and that he accord them at the disposition of his Fellows, and not upon the workday, for hindering of the work and p rofit of the lord. The seventh \"Point,\" -- That he covet not the wife, nor the daughter of his Master \u0000 s, neither of his Fellows, but it be in marriage, nor hold concubines for discord that might fall among the m. The e ighth \"Point,\" -- If it befall him to be Warden under his Master, that he be true mean between h is Master and his Fellows, and that he be busy in the absence of his Master, to the honour of his Master, and p rofit of the lord that he serveth. The ninth \"Point,\" -- If he be wiser and subtler than h is Fellow w orking with him in h is Lodge, or any other place, and he perceiveth that he should leave the stone that he is working upon for defect of cunn ing, and can teach h im and amend the stone, he sh all i nform him, and help him, that the more love may increase among them, and that the work of the lord b e not lost.

CHARGE, \"circa\" 1400 , RE VISED, \"circa\" 1475 . THANKE D BE GOD our glorio us Father and founder and form er of heaven and earth, and of all things that in them is, that he would vouchsafe of his glorious Godhead to make so many things of divers v irtues for m ankind; for he made all worldly things to be obedient and subject to man; for all things that be comestible or of wholesome nature he ordained it for m an \u0000 s s ustenance. And also he hath given to man wit and cunn ing of divers sc iences and crafts, by the which h e may labour in this world to get our living with (them); and to make divers things for God \u0000 s pleasure and our (own) ease and p rofit; the which things if I were to rehearse them, it were too long to tell and to write. Wherefore I will leave (them), but I will shew you some part of them, and tell you how and in what wise th e science of Geometry first began, and who were the founders thereof, and of other Crafts more, as it is noted in the Bible and other stories. {544 } How and in what mann er this worthy science of Geometry first began I will tell you, as I said b efore. Y e shall understand that t here be seven Liberal Sciences by which seven sciences all the Sciences and Crafts in the world were first found, and especially the science of Geometry, for it is the cause of all other that be, the which seven sciences are called thus: -- As for the first, that is c alled the foundation of science, its name is \"Gramm ar,\" it teacheth a man rightly to speak, and write truly. The second is \"Rhetorick,\" and it teacheth a man to write form ably and fair. The third is \"Dialecticus\"<<\"Lo gic\" (Watson M.S.)>>, and that science teacheth a man to discern the true from the false, and most comm only it is c alled the art of sophistry. The fourth is c alled Arithmetic, the which teacheth a man the craft of numbers, for to reckon and make accounts of all mann er of things. The fifth is Geometry,\" t he which"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"teacheth a man mete and measures and p onderation and weightiness, in all mann er of crafts. The sixth is \"Music,\" that teacheth a man the craft of song in notes of voice and organ and trumpet and harp and all others pertaining to them. The seventh is \"Astronomy,\" that teacheth a man the course of the sun and of the moon, and all other planets and stars of heaven. OUR INTENT is principally to treat of the first foundation of the worthy science o f Geometry, and who were the founders thereof. As I said b efore, there are seven Liberal Sciences, that is to say seven sciences or crafts that are free in themselves, the which seven live only by one, and that is the science of Geometry. And Geometry is , as much as to say, the measure of the e arth, \"et sic dicetur a Gea graece quod est pro terra Latine, e metrona q uod est mensura una Geometria ie mensura terae vel terrarum,\" that is to say in English that Geometry is, as I said, of \"geo\" in Greek earth, and \"metron\" t hat is to say measure, and thus is this name Geometry compounded, and is s aid (to be) the measure of the e arth. MARVEL ye not t hat I said that all sciences live only by the science of Geometry, for there is no artificial or handicraft that is wrought by man \u0000 s hand but is wrought by Geometry, and a notable cause, for if a man works with h is hands he worketh with some mann er of tool, and there is no instrument of material things in this world, but it comes of some kind of earth, and to earth it will turn again. And there is no instrument, that is to say a tool to work with, but it hath some proportion more or less, and p roportion is measure, and the tool or instrument is earth, and Geometry is s aid to be the measure of the earth. Wherefore I may say that men live all by Geometry, for all men h ere in this world live by the labour of their hands. MANY more probations I could tell you, why that Geometry is the science that all reasonable men live by, but I will l eave it at this time for the l ong process of writing. And now I will proceed further on my matter. Ye shall understand that among all the crafts of the world of man \u0000 s c raft Masonry hath the most notability, and most part of this sc ience of Geometry, as it is noted and said in history , and in the Bible, and in the Master of Stories, and in the \"Polichronicon,\" a chronicle proved, and in the histories that is named Beda \" \u0000 de Imagine Mundi, \u0000 \" et Isodorus \" \u0000\u0006\u0003 themolegiarum \u0000 .\" \" Mathodius Episcopus et Martyrus,\" and others, many more, said that Masonry is principal of Geometry, as me thinketh it may well be said, for it is the first that was founded, as it is noted in the Bible, in the first book of Genesis in the 4th chapter, and also all the doctors aforesaid accordeth thereto, and some of {545 } them saith it more openly and p lainly right as it saith in the Bible -- Genesis. ADAM \u0000 S line lineal of sons descending down the 7th age after Adam, before Noah \u0000 s flood there was a man called Lamech, the which h ad two wives, the one called Adah an d the other Zillah; by the first named Adah h e begat two sons, the one named Jabal and the other named Jubal. The e lder son Jabal, he was the first man that ever found Geometry and Masonry, and he made houses and is named in the Bible, \"Pater habitanicum in tentoriis atque Pastorum,\" that is to say father of men dwelling in tents, that is dwelling - houses.<<And the fnther of Sh epherds and Headsman (other MSS .)>> And he was Cain \u0000 s Master Mason and governor of all his works when h e made the city of Enoch; th at was the first city that ever was made, and that made Cain Adam \u0000 s s on, and gave it to his s on Enoch, and gave the city the name of his s on and called it Enoch, and now it is c alled Ephraim, and there was the science of Geometry and Masonry"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"first occupied and contrived for a science and for a craft; and so we may say that was the cause and foundation of all crafts and sciences, and also this man Jabal was c alled \"Pater pastorum.\"<<And the father of Sh epherds and Headsman (other MSS .)>> The Master of Stori es s aith, and Beda \"de Imagine Mundi Polichronicon,\" and others more say, that he was the first that made partition of land, that every man might know his own ground and labour thereupon, as for his own. And also he parted flocks of sheep that every man m ight know his own sheep, and so we may say that he was the first founder of that science. And his brother Jubal was the first founder of Music and of song as (\"Pythagoras\") saith, the \"Polichronicon,\" and the same saith Isadore in h is \"Ethemolegies\" in th e sixth book, there he saith that he was the first founder of music in song and of organ and trumpet, and he found that science by the sound of ponderation of his brother \u0000 s hamm ers, that was Tubal Cain. SOO THLY as the Bible saith in the same chapter, th at is to say the 4th of Genesis, this Lamech begat upon h is other wife, that named Zillah, a son and a daughter, the names of them were called Tubal Cain, that was the son; and his daughter was c alled Naamah, and as the \"Polichronicon\" saith, that some men say that she was Noah \u0000 s wife; whether it be so o r no we affirm it not. YE shall understand that t his s on Tubal Cain was the founder of Smiths \u0000 Craft and of other Crafts of Metal, that is to say of iron, of brass, of gold, and of silver, as s undry docto rs s ayeth; and his s ister Naamah was founder of weavers \u0000 craft, for before that time there was no cloth woven, but they did spin yarn and k nit it, and made such clothing as they could, but as the woman Naamah found the craft of weaving, therefore it is c al led women \u0000 s c raft; and these three, her brethren, had k nowledge before that God would take vengeance for sin either by fire or by water, and they had great care how they might do to save the sciences that they had found, and they took their counsel togethe r and b y all their wits they said that there were two mann er of stones of such virtue that the one would never burn, and that stone is c alled marble, and that other stone would not sink in water, and that stone is named lacerus (laterus). And so they devi sed to write all the sciences that they had found in these two stones, so that if God should take vengeance by fire, that the marble should not burn; and if God sent vengeance by water that the other should not drown; and so they prayed their elder brother Jabal that he would make two pillars of these stones, that is to say of marble and lacerus, and that he would write in the two pillars all the {546 } sciences and crafts that they all had found, and so he did, and therefore we may say that he was the most cunn ing in science, for he first began and p erform ed the e nd b efore Noah \u0000 s flood. KINDLY (intuitively) knowing of that vengeance that God would send, whether it should b e by fire or by water the brethren h ad it not by mann er of prophecy; they wist that God would send one thereof, and therefore they wrote their sciences in the ii. pillars of stone, and some men say that they wrote in the stones all the seven sciences; but they had in their m inds that a vengeance would come; and so it was that God sent ven geance by water, so that their came such a flood that all the world was drowned; and all men were dead therein; save viii. persons, and that was Noah and his wife and his iii. sons and their wives of which three sons all the world come of and their names w ere in this mann er -- Sh em, Ham, and Japheth.

And ye shall know w ell that it is plainly told and written in \"Polichronicon,\" and in Methodius episcopus et Martyrus, that Ashur that was a worthy lord of Sh inar, sent t o Nimr od the king to send him Masons and workmen of craft that might help him to make his c ity that he was in will to make. An d Nimr od sent thirty hundred of Masons; and when h e should go and send them forth h e called them before him, and said to them -- \"You must go to my cousin Ashur, to help him to build a city; but look that ye be well governed, and I shall give you a charge profitable to you and me. \"WHEN ye come to that Lord, look that ye be true to him, like as ye would b e to me, and truly do your labour and craft, and take reasonable for your m eed therefore, as you may deserve; and also that ye love together as ye were brethren, and hold together truly, and he that hath most cunn ing teach it to his Fellow, and look ye govern yourselves well towards your lord, and among yourselves, that I may have worship and thanks for m y sending, and teaching you the craft.\" {547 } AN D they received the charge of the King that was their Master and their Lord, and went forth to Ashur and b uilded the city of Nineveh in the country of Plateas and other cities more that men call Calah and Resen that is a great city between Calah and Nineve h. And in this mann er the craft of Masonry was first preferred and charged for a science and a craft. RE ASON would that we should shew you how that t he Elders that were before time had these Charges written (to them as we have now in our Charges of the Story of Euclid, as we have seen them written) in Latin and in French; and how that Euclid came to Geometry, we should tell you as it is noted in the Bible and in other stories.

And Abraham was"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"a wise man and a great cleric, and he knew all the seven sciences, and taught the Egyptians the science of Geometry. And this worthy clerk Euclid was his scholar and learned of him; and he gave it first the name of Geomet ry, all be that it was occupied b efore it had the name of Geometry. But it is s aid in Isidorus, \"Ethemolegiarum,\" in the 5th book, Capitolo primo, that Euclid was one of the first founders of Geometry and he gave it name; for in h is time there was a water in the land of Egypt that was c alled Nile, and it flowed so far into the land that men might not dwell therein. Then this worthy clerk Euclid taught them to make great walls and d itches to hold out the water; and he by Geometry measured the land and appo rtioned it in divers parts, and made every man to close his own part with walls and d itches, and then it became a plenteous c ountry of all mann er of fruit and of young people, of men and women, that there was s o much fruit of young people that they could n ot well live. And the lords of the country drew them together and made a council how they might help their children that had no livelyhood competent and able to find for themselves and their children, for they had so many. And among them all i n Council w as this worthy clerk Euclid, and when h e saw that t hey all could not bring about this matter he said to them -- \"Will ye (give) to me your sons in governance and I shall teach them such a science that they shall li ve thereby g entlemanly, under condition th at ye will be sworn to me, to perform the governance that I will set you to, and them both.\" And the King of the land and all the lords, by one consent, granted thereto. RE ASON would that every man would grant to that thing that were profitable to hims elf, and they took their sons to Euclid to govern them at his own will, and he taught them the Craft of Masonry and gave it the name of Geometry, because of the parting of the ground that he had taught the people in the time of the making of the walls and ditches aforesaid, to close out the water, and Isadore saith in h is \"Ethemolegies\" that Euclid calleth the craft Geometry; and there this worthy clerk gave it name, and taught it the lords \u0000 sons of the land that he had in h is teaching.

And also he that were most cunn ing should be governor of the work and should b e called Master, and other Charges m ore that are written in the \"Book of Charges.\" And so they wrought with the lords of that land, and {548 } made cities and towns, castles, and temples, and lords \u0000 palaces, and d id live honestly and truly by the said craft. WHAT time the children of Isra el dwelt in Egypt t hey learned the craft of Masonry.

IV.  \"MOD ER N C HARGES.\"  (ABB RE VIATED, \"circa\" 1535 ). The might of the Father of heaven, with the wisdom of the blessed Son, through the grace of God, and the go odness of the Holy Ghost, that be three persons in one Godhead, be with us at our beginn ing, and give us grace so to govern us here in this life, that we may come to His blessing, that never shall have e nding. GOOD BRE THRE N and Fello ws, our purpose is to tell you how and in what mann er this worthy science of Masonry was first founded and afterwards how it was maintained and upholden by worthy kings and p rinces, and many other worshipful men. And also, to them that be here, we will de clare the Charges that it belongs to every Free - Mason to keep sure in good faith; and therefore take good heed hereunto, for it is a science that is worthy of being kept, for it is a worthy Craft; and is one of the seven liberal sciences. {552 } The name s of the seven liberal sciences are these: The first is \"Gramm ar\" that teacheth a man to speak and write truly; the second is \"Rhetoric\" that teacheth a man to speak well, in subtle term s; the third is \"Dialectic,\" or Logic, that"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"teacheth a man to discern truth from falsehood. The fourth is \"Arithmetic,\" that t eacheth a man to reckon and count all kinds of numbers; the fifth is \"Geometry\" that teacheth a man to mete and measure the e arth and all other things, on which science Masonry is grounded. The sixt h is \"Music\" t hat teacheth the craft of song and voice, of tongue, organ, and harp. The seventh is \"Astronomy\" that teacheth a man to know the course of the sun, moon, and stars. THESE be the seven liberal Sciences, the which are all grounded upon one, that is to say Geometry. And this may a man prove that the science of all work is grounded upon Geometry, for it teacheth mete, measure, ponderation, and weight of all mann er of things on earth; for there are none that work any science, but he worketh by some measure or weight, and all this is Geometry. Merchants and all Craftsmen, and others who use the Sciences, and especially the plowmen and tillers of all mann er of grains and seeds, planters of vineyards and setters of fruit, none can till without Ge ometry; for neither in Gramm ar, Rhetoric, or Astronomy can any man find mete or m easure without geometry. Wherefore this sc ience may well be called the most worthy science, for it foundeth all others. HO W this sc ience was first begun I will now tell yo u. Before Noah \u0000 s flood there was a man called Lamech, as it is written in the Bible in the 4th chapter of Genesis. And this Lamech h ad two wives, the one called Adah by whom he had two sons, one called Jabal and the other Jubal. And his other wife was c alled Zillah, by whom he had one son Tubal - Cain, and one daughter named Naamah; and these four children founded the beginn ing of all the sciences in the world. Jabal, the e ldest son, found out the science of Geometry; he kept flocks of sheep and lambs in the fields, as it is noted in the chapter aforesaid. His brother Jubal founded the science of Music, in song of tongue, harp, and organ, and trumpet. And the third b rother Tubal Cain found the science of smith \u0000 s c raft, in gold, silver, copper, and iron. And their sister Naamah found the craft of weaving. And these persons knowing right well that God would take vengeance for sin, either by fire or water, therefore they writ their several sciences that they had found in ii. pillars of stone, that they mig ht be found after Noah \u0000 s flood. The one stone was marble that would not burn with fire, and the other called \"latres\" (latens, laterns, lacerus, &c.) because it would not drown with water. Our intent is now to tell you, how and in what mann er these stone s were found in which were written these sciences. After the destruction of the world b y Noah \u0000 s flood, as histories affirm , a great clerk called Pythagoras found the one, and Herm es the philosopher (who was Cush \u0000 s s on, who was Sh em \u0000 s s on, who was Noah \u0000 s s on) found the other, and was c alled the Father of wise men. These two found the two pillars in which the sciences were written, and taught them to o ther m en. AND at the making of the Tower of Babylon masonry was much esteemed. And the king of Babylon that was named Nimr od was a Mason h imself, and he loved well Masons and their science, as it is s aid b y Masters of histories. And when the cities of Nineveh, and other cities of eastern Asia, were to be built this Nimr od sent t hither three score masons<<O ther MSS . have it, sixty, forty, thirty hundred, see also No. 3 MS.>> at t he request of the {553 } King of Nineveh, his c ousin, and when h e sent them forth h e gave them a Charge in this mann er. That they should each one be true to the other; that they shou ld love well one another; that they should serve their lord truly for their pay, that"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"the Master m ay have worship and all that belong to him. And other m ore Charges he gave them, and this was the first t ime that a Mason h ad any Charges of his Craft. MO RE OVER Abraham and Sarah h is wife went into Egypt, and there he taught the seven sciences to the Egyptians; and (\"he had\") a worthy scholar named Euclid (\"and he\") learned right well and was Master of all the vii. sciences; and in h is days it befell that t he lords and states of the land had so many sons, some by their wives and some by their concubines, for that land is hot and p lenteous of generation; and they had not a competent proportion of estates wherewith to maintain their said children, which caused them m uch care; and the King of that land summ oned a great Council to consult how they might provide for their children to live honestly as gentlemen; and they could find no good way. And then they made proclamation throughout all the realm, that if ther e were any that could inform them therein h e should come to them and would b e well rewarded for his labours. After this proclamation was made the worthy Clerk Euclid came and said unto the King and the nobles -- \"If you will accept of me to teach, instruc t, and govern your children, I will teach them the vii. liberal sciences whereby they may live honestly as gentlemen. I will do it upon condition that you will grant me and them a comm ission, that I may have power to rule them, after the mann er the scienc e ought to be ruled.\" The King and all the Council granted him this and sealed the Comm ission; and then this worthy doctor took to himself these lords \u0000 sons and taught them the science of Geometry, and to practise work in stones, of all mann er of work tha t belongeth to building churches, temples, castles, towers, manors, and all other sorts of buildings, and gave them a Charge in this mann er: First, that they should b e true to the lord that t hey serve; that t hey should love well one another; that they shou ld call each other Fellow or Brother, and not servant, knave, or other foul name; that they should truly deserve their pay of their lord, or the master that they served; and that they should ordain the wisest of them to be masters of the work, and neither to chose for love, nor affection, nor greatness, nor r ichn ess, to set any in the work that hath n ot sufficient knowledge or cunn ing to be master of the work, whereby the Master should b e evilly served and they dishonoured; and also that they should call th e governor of the work Master, during the time that they work with h im, and other m ore Charges which is too long to tell here. And to all these Charges he made them swear a great Oath, that men used at t hat t ime; and he ordained for them reasonable pay th at t hey might live honestly thereby; also that t hey should assemble themselves together once e very y ear, and consult how they might best work for their lord \u0000 s profit and their own credit; and correct within themselves him that had trespassed against the sc ience. And thus was the science grounded in Egypt, and that worthy Master Euclid was the first that gave it the name of Geometry the which is now called Masonry. AND, AFTER that, when the children of Israel were come into the land of Behest which is no w called with us the country of Jerusalem (Jewry), King David b egan the temple that is now called Templum Dei, as is c alled with us the Temple of Jerusalem, and the said King David loved well Masons and {554 } cherished them m uch, and he gave them good wage s, and also Charges and mann ers, as they had learned in Egypt (\"from Euclid\"), and other m ore Charges that you shall hear afterwards. After the decease of King David, Solomon h is son finished the said temple that his father had b egun, and he sent for Maso ns"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"out of divers c ountries and d ivers lands, and gathered them together so that he had four score thousand workers of stone who were Masons, and he chose out of them three thousand that were ordained to be Masters and governors of the work. And furtherm or e, there was a king of another r egion that men called Hiram, and he loved King Solomon well, and he gave him timber for his work. And he had a son n amed Aman (Aymon, Hymon, Anon, Adon, &c.) and he was a Master of Geometry, and chief Master of all his grav ings, carvings, and all his masons and masonry, as appears in S cripture, in libro primo Regum and chapter 5th. And this Solomon confirm ed b oth the Charges and mann ers that his father had given to Masons, and thus was the worthy science of Masonry confirm e d in the country of Jewry, and city of Jerusalem, and in many other kingdoms. CURIOUS Craftsmen walked about full wide into o ther countries, some to learn more craft, and some to teach others that had little skill and cunn ing. And it befell that there was one curious Mason n amed Namas Graecas (Namus Graecus, Manus Graecus, Memon Grecus, Mamm ungretus, Mamus Graecus, Minus Goventis, Marcus Graecus, Namus Grenaeus, etc.) that had b een at the building<<Building \u0000 s (query of Bro. Schn itger) -- he had a Solomo n \u0000 s temple ritual.>> of Solomon \u0000 s temple and he came into France and there he taught the science of Masonry to men of that land. And there was one of the royal li ne of France called Charles Martel, and he was a man that loved well such a craft, and he dre w to this . . . . . abovesaid, and learned of him the craft, and took upon h im Charges and mann ers, and afterwards by the providence of God, he was elected King of France, and when h e was in h is estate he took and helped to make men Masons which before wer e not; and he gave them both their Charge and mann ers, and good p ay as he had learned of other Masons, and also confirm ed a Charter from year to year to hold their Assembly where they would, and cherished them r ight well, and thus c ame this famous Craft in to France. ENGLAND i n all this time stood void of any Charge of Masonry until St. Alban \u0000 s time, and in h is days the King of England<<Carausius.>> then a pagan did wall the town (that is now called) St. Albans about. And St. Alban was a worthy Knight an d Steward of the King \u0000 s household, and had the government of the realm, and had also the ordering of the walls of the said town, and he loved and cherished Masons right well, and made their pay right good, for he gave them (3s. a week -- 2s. 6d. and 3d . fo r noon, 3s. 6d. and 3d ., etc.), and b efore that time, throughout all the land, a Mason took b ut a penn y a day, until St. Alban amended it; and he procured them a Charter from the King and his Council, for to hold counsel together, and gave it the name of A ssembly, and thereat he was himself, and helped to make men Masons, and gave them a Charge, as ye shall after hear. BUT it happened soon after the death of St. Alban that there arose great wars in England, which came out of divers nations, so that t he g oodly rule of Masonry was well nigh destroyed until the days of King Athelstan,<<Query, Edwd., and Athelstan (suggested b y Bro. W. H. Upton, P.G.M., of Washington). May admit of interpretation as Edwd. the e lder, and his s ons Athelstan and Edwin (see IV. and V.)>> who was a worthy King of England, and he brought the land into good rest and p eace, and {555 } builded many g reat works, as abbeys, castles, towns, and other buildings, and loved well Masons; and he had a son n amed Edwin,<<Query, Edwd., and Athels tan (suggested b y Bro.

May admit of interpretation as Edwd. the e lder, and his s ons Athelstan and Edwin (see IV. and V.)>> that loved Masons, much more than h is father, and he was a great practitioner in geometry, and delighted much to talk and comm une with Masons and to learn of them skill and cunn ing, and afterwards for the love he bore to Masons and to their science, he was made a Mason, and he procured for them of the King his father a Charter and Comm ission to hold every y ear an Assembly, wheresoever they would within the realm of England, and to correct within themselves all defaults and trespasses that were done within the Craft, and he himself held an Assembly at York, and there he made Masons and gave them the C harges and taught them the mann ers and comm anded that rule to be kept ever after, and also gave them the Charter to keep, and also gave orders that it should b e renewed from king to king. And when the Assembly was gathered together he made proclamation, t hat all Masons who had any writings or understanding of the Charges and mann ers c oncerning the said science, that was made before in this land or any other, that they should b ring them forth, and when they were viewed and examined, there were found some in French, some in Greek, some in English, and other languages, and the intent and meaning was found all one. [<<Added from \"Tew MS.\" W. R. Co. York; also clauses 19 to 25.>> And these Charges have been gathered and d rawn out of divers antient books and writ ings, as they were made and confirm ed in Egypt by the King and the great Clerk Euclid; and b y David and Solomon h is s on; and in France by Charles Martel who was King of France; and in England b y St. Alban; and afterwards by Athelstan and Edward his s on,<<Q uery, Edwd., and Athelstan (suggested b y Bro.

May admit of interpretation as Edwd. the e lder, and his s ons Athelstan and Edwin (see IV. and V.)>> that was king after him.] And he had made a Book thereof, how the Craft was founded, and he himself counselled that it should b e read when any Masons s hould b e made, and the Charge given to them. And from that day to this the mann ers of Masons have been kept and observed in that form , as well as men might observe and govern it. ADD furtherm ore at divers Assemblies there hath been added certain Charges more by the best advice of Masters and Fellows. Tunc unus ex senioribus teneat librum ut ille vel illi potiat vel potiant manus s up librum et tunc precepta deberent Legi. EVER Y man that is a Mason, take right good heed to these Charges, and if any man find himself guilty of any of them, let him amend himself before God. And in particular, ye that are to be charged, take good heed to keep them r ight well, for it is perilou s and great danger for a man to forswear himself upon \"a book\" (the Holy Scriptures). 1st -- The first Charge is that you be true man to God, and the Holy Church, and that you u se neither error nor heresy, according to your own understanding, and to dis creet and wise - men \u0000 s teaching. 2nd -- You shall be true liegemen to the King of England without any treason or falsehood, and if you know of any that you amend it privily, if you may, or else warn the King and his Council of it by declaring it to his of ficers. 3rd -- Ye shall be true to o ne another, that is to say to every Mason of the Craft of Masonry that be allowed Masons, and d o unto them as you would they should d o unto you."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":" 4th -- You shall keep truly all the counsel of Lodge and Chamber, and all other counsel, that ought to be kept by way of Masonry. 5th -- Also that you u se no thievery, but keep yourselves true. 6th -- Also you shall be true to the lord, or Master, that you {556 } serve, and truly see that his profit and advantage be pr omoted and furthered. 7th -- And also you shall call Masons your Brethren, or Fellows, and no foul name. 8th -- And you shall not take in villainy y our Fellow \u0000 s wife, nor desire his daughter, nor servant, nor put him to any discredit. 9th -- And a lso that you pay truly for your m eat and d rink where you go to table, and that you do not anything whereby the Craft may be scandalised, or receive disgrace.
