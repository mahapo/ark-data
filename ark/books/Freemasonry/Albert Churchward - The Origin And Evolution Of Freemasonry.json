This evil is now threatening the whole of humanity and can be arrested permanently only b}^ the Unity of the Brotherhood of Freemasonry ; and it is to point out these facts and the remed}' that it has been willed I should write this book for the knowledge of the Brotherhood. The Unity of all the Brotherhood of Freemasonry throughout the world is the only means for a permanent Universal Peace. And what reasons are there against a Universal Brotherhood being formed to establish permanent Peace throughout the w^orld under the principles and tenets of the Craft ? Herein have I set forth details of the same. It is at the request of many Brothers I publish this book. I do so more readily because it supplies 7"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY a link missing in my former publications, giving to the Brotherhood a further proof of that knowledge which they seek, and which very few, if any, members of the Craft have ever devoted such time and study in scientific research as is necessary to speak with authority on the subject matter. In order to gain a true conception of the origin and evolution of Freemasonry, its Signs, Symbols, and all its Rituals and Ceremonies, one must have also a knowledge of the origin and evolution of the Human Race, with all the Totemic Mysteries performed in Sign Language by Primitive Man. They are linked together pari passu, and the answer as to the origin of all our Brotherhood can be found only by unravelling the mystery and causes as to why we find different Types of the Human Race, their different beliefs being in many cases analogous, and all using the same Signs and Symbols — although under -different termin- ology, and scattered over the face of earth and water throughout this world. There are two important subjects we must study and master before v/e can arrive at the critical truth. The first is the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles, which govern the evolution and devolution of the Universe and by -which T.G.A.O.T.U. created all things, and is for ever creating, and balances devolution by evolution. The second is the learning and comprehending 8"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODVCTION \" Sign Language \" in all its phases, that being the mode of registering the prehistoric past before verbal language came into being, by a continual repetition in the Totemic and other Mysteries or Ceremonies of Primitive Man.

W\\ the facts I have herein set forth can be veri- fied as the truth b}' any Brother who will devote sufficient study and scientific research to the subject matter.

By the cultivation of our reason we are better enabled to distinguish good from evil, as well as truth from falsehood ; both these are matters of the highest importance^ whether we regard this life or the life to come. A great error is often committed on account of the disguise and false colours in which many things appear when presented to us in an imperfect state. 1 have seen thousands of things which are not in reality what they appear to be, and that, both in the moral and natural world : Knavery puts on the face of justice. Hypocrisy and superstition wear the vizard of piety. Deceit and evil are often clothed in the shapes and appearances of truth and goodness. We are imposed upon at home as well as abroad ; often deceived in our senses, by our imaginations, by our passions and appetites, by the authority of men, by education and custom : also led into errors by judging according to these false and flattering principles for the want of mature judg- ment, rather than according to the nature of things and experience of the past, which is true knowledge. i6"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES Reason is the glory of human nature and one of the chief eminences whereon we are raised above our fellow-creatures in the lower world. It is only by reasoning from past experiences and understanding the Periodic Laws that a country or a nation can save itself from downfall and destruction and advance to a higher state of evolution ; without this knowledge the humans will not advance much further to a higher type of man than the present highest Hom.o. But by understanding and following these Laws, humanity may attain a much higher type than it has hitherto reached, and it is for our Brotherhood throughout the world to assist and carry forward this great work. That my readers may better understand the subject of the Periodic Law,' the result of different groupings and the causes for changes in these groupings of Corpuscles, I will give a short descrip- tion of how this is brought about by portraying it in tabular form, but must first premise for their information that a Corpuscle is a negative particle of electricity which can exist alone, ^ the size and weight of an Atom of Hydrogen, with a velocity of about 100,000 miles per second, and can penetrate through the thickest block of steel. An Atom is made up of two or more Corpuscles surrounded by Positive Electricity. I T am indebted to Professors J. J. Thomson and R. R. Dunkan for much information on this subject. 17 B"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY Positive Electricity cannot exist alone. Matter is a group of Atoms, either inorganic or organic. With regard to the number and arrangem.ent of Corpuscles, their structure as found in the form^ation of Atoms, and the different properties that a given structure would confer upon an Atom, they follow the same Periodic Law as for the Elements. If there are two Corpuscles only — i and 2 — they will be in equilibrium if placed on opposite sides of the centre of a sphere : If there are three Corpuscles — i, 2, 3 — they will be in equilibrium if they form an equilateral tri- angle with its centre at the centre of the sphere. iri\\ Four Corpuscles will arrange themselves at the corners of a square —"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES When these Corpuscles exceed five, they break up into two groups. The group containing the smaller occupies the surface of an inner shell towards the centre. The others are on an outer shell concentric with the inner one, the sphere of Positive Electrification surrounding and balancing them all. As the number of Corpuscles still further in- creases, there arrives a stage at which the equili- brium cannot be stable, even with two groups, and the Corpuscles divide themselves into three groups, on three concentric shells ; and as numbers further increase, more and more groups are necessary for equilibrium. For example, the following table will show how the Corpuscles group themselves.

It means, simply, the periodic recurrence of certain groups of corpuscles as the number of corpuscles consti- tuting the atom increases. We see in this way that we can divide the various groups of corpuscles into families — each member of the family is derived from the preceding member and has certain similar definite properties. Now, when any ring is subject to an external disturbance, one or more corpuscles may easily be detached from it. The negative electricity of the collection of corpuscles is just balanced by the sphere of positive electricity surrounding and enclosing it — if, therefore, one negative corpuscle is lost, the whole arrangement will assume a positive change. Such an atom would then behave like the atom of a strongly electro-positive or basic element. Applied to humans, the will, mind or action of an individual would become positive or of an optimistic character. In the case of 59 corpuscles, the number of cor- puscles inside is only just sufficient to make the outer ring of 20 stable ; this ring will be, therefore, on the verge of instability, and when its corpuscles are displaced the force urging them back again will be small. With the next group, 60 corpuscles, the outer ring is more stable, because there is an additional corpuscle inside it. While it may lose a corpuscle it will not do so as readily as the group 59. Hence, it'Vill not so easily assume the posi- 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY tive charge of electricity, and, therefore, will not be so electro-positive an element as group 59. In the human, the individual will not be so positive in his opinions or force of arguments. Sixty-one corpuscles will be still less electro-positive. When the total number of corpuscles increases, say, up to 63 or 64, the possibility of losing a corpuscle from the outer ring vanishes. When the stability of the atom becomes extreme, one or more corpuscles of the outer ring may actually lie on the surface of the atom without breaking the ring. In this case the atom receives a charge of negative electricity, and v/ould behave like the atom of an electro-negative element. In man, the thoughts, actions and opinions of the individual must assume, therefore, a negative character. This increase in the stability of the ring, and consequently in the electro-negative character of its atom, would augment until it had as many as 67 corpuscles, when the stability of the ring arrives at its maximum ; 67 corpuscles, therefore, consequently represent a strongly electro- negative element, or in the human a pessimistic character. Thus we see that, in losing or gaining a corpuscle at the terminal ends in a definite group, changes entirel}^ opposite are brought about, either electro-positive or electro-negative. In the human it would produce an optimistic or pessimistic character, or the action of the individual would become active or passive, whilst the corpuscles of 22"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES the centre of the group are neither electro-positive nor electro-negative and are incapable of receiving any charge of electricity whatever. In the human this is depicted by senile dementia, or the loss of recollection and thought. The atom would not be electro-positive or electro-negative, and as the brain cells are made up of atoms composed of these corpuscles in various groups, almost in pure form, it is easy now to understand why causes such as shell shock, railway accidents, mental shock of any kind, or the bombardment of these corpuscles by others from an outside influence, will convert a normal brain into an abnormal one. Also how the Divine Creator, by increasing the number of groups of these corpuscles, has produced the higher types of Man and higher evolution of the human race. One also obtains the physiological causes for good and evil to which the human race is subject, produced by evil or good influences outside the individual, or individuals, acting on the various groups of corpuscles in the brain cells of the objective, causing one group of corpuscles to lose a corpuscle at one of its terminals and another to gain it, by this arrangement possessing different properties. This occurs by what is called valency (grabbing power). A univalent positive series is one which, under certain circumstances, attains stability by losing one corpuscle, A univalent negative series is one that will acquire one, and one only, of the corpuscles of another series. 23"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY A divalent positive series is one which will lose two corpuscles and no more, and a divalent negative series will acquire two or more. The valency of the series is thus simply a ques- tion of the number of corpuscles that can escape from, or be received by, the corpuscular groupings which constitute any kind of series. We here perceive how impressionable brains or an unstable condition of the groups of corpuscles are easily acted upon by outside influences, or by those corpuscles which are grouped and possess strongly positive or negative conditions. I give one group as an example only to demonstrate to my readers how changes take place by the subtraction or addition to one or more corpuscles from the group, proving how a positive can be converted into a negative or vice versa ; whether it be actions, thoughts or elements, either in inorganic or organic matter, the results are always similar. For in- stance, we will take the inorganic element H^^drogen, an atom of which possesses i,ooo corpuscles=H, and Oxygenic, which has 16,000 corpuscles to make up one atom. Now, when these atoms combine under certain conditions an interchange takes place in their groupings, and what is called a chemical compound is the result. Two atoms of Hydrogen grab one of Oxygen, or one atom of Ox3'gen grabs two of Hydrogen, and the oxide of Hydrogen, i.e., water, is formed = H2O. 24"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES In the inorganic world, or in the elements, the groupings and number of corpuscles are the sim- plest : in the vegetable world a greater evolution takes place and the groupings are more complex ; when we come to the animal world there are still greater numbers of groupings and still more complexity ; in the highest type of the human race they are the greatest. In much of the in- organic world, radio-active matter is constantly returning these corpuscles to their original form. This inorganic world has been formed by the simple process of lowering the temperature from 30,000° Cent., when all were corpuscles only, and as the temperature cooled, so the various elements were formed at different degrees of temperature, by different groupings : ultimately all will revert to simple corpuscles again — because the Sun, the centre of our system of all the planets that have been thrown off from it, is cooling down, and in time, how long it is impossible to say, will become cold and dead ; then these will clash together again with others that have arrived at the same condition, the constant bombardment and clashing together, each one being attracted to the centre of the swarm, causing intense heat ; so that ultimate^ a temperature of about 30,000° Cent, will be produced, with the result that all the elements and matter split up into the original corpuscles from which they were formed and a new star comes into existence. We can see and 25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY prove by the telescope and spectroscope the changes as they take place ; also, as the star cools down again, we can see how the elements are re-formed at the various temperatures that occur in the process. This proves that evolu- tion and devolution in the Universe are balanced and that nothing is lost : only a transference and a transformation takes place of energy and matter. It is the same in the organic as in the inorganic w^orld : given a person's mind or thoughts in a stable condition upon any particular or definite subject, his brain cells are made up of these groups of corpuscles just on the balance of stability, i.e. on the line or condition of a series that is in a stable condition — electrically — a normal brain. But something occurs outside his brain cells w^hich affects this series, say shock or acute mental emotion, or only a bombardment of this series of corpuscles by others outside, for example ; first it alters the grouping of this series and the result is a change from the previous mental condi- tion, which has been a normal one, but now becomes either a positive or negative state of abnormal action or thought ; in certain events it might render the grouping of the corpuscles into that state which is 'neither positive nor negative, and these groupings are incapable of receiving or losing another corpuscle — his mind or brain then w^ould become '' lost/' i.e. he would be quite 26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES incapable of thought or impressions — \" His mind is a blank/' The evolution of the organic follows the same law, or rather is a continuance of the same laws of the inorganic. As I stated supra, in the lower forms of life the composition and groupings of these corpuscles are comparatively few and simple. The human follows on under the same lav; — take, for example, the lowest Homo, the brain of a Pygmy — Primitive Man. Here we find what is called the grey matter, from which all thoughts, will and ideas emanate, comparatively thin, and the sulci of the brain are not deep. In the highest type of man this grey matter is the thickest and the brain has the deepest sulci. In the different types between the highest and lowest we find many variations, the grey matter always getting thicker and the sulci deeper as we advance in the upward trend of evolution. Evolution being ever progressive, so these corpuscles ever multiply in numbers and series, and this is always the case normally. But if from any cause or causes this progress is inter- rupted, then the negative which will constitute a degenerative form will predominate, and a retrograde action may be the result. This is briefly the Periodic Law, or God's Law, or as it is commonl}^ called the Law of Nature, which few people study and fewTr comprehend. Yet these Laws are true and immutable. In 27"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY them we possess the key to gain the whole know- ledge of the secrets of the Universe, Life and Death and the Hereafter ; the causes and effects of the rise and fall of all nations — for the causes and the results we see developed in the human for good or ill ; the actions, thoughts, the different attitudes assumed by men and women, who may live under the same surroundings, but who in thoughts, actions, and words are diametrically opposed to each other in their opinions on any given subject, each one supposing and believing himself to be right, yet at the same time many labouring under the greatest fallacy, because the normal condition of the corpuscles of the atoms comprising their brain cells has received wrong impressions, either positive or negative, the result of different groupings. This may occur in many ways, i.e. by reading that which is not true, being erroneously taught, or having their brain cor- puscles bombarded by others outside, by suggestion, or any other pernicious influence. Disease will also produce the same results, or, if I may put it in another way, some of these causes will produce disease, which is a disarrangement of the corpuscles of one or more series. In some cases where (too many of) the brain corpuscles have not escaped to any great extent from the one normal series, by treatment, this may recover again the corpuscles which have escaped, and so we have then a return of a normal brain. As an example, a man 28"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES with a normal brain holds a certain and definite opinion on a given subject : some one has im- pressed him, say by talking to him, or he may have an objective shock in some form, which causes him to change that previous and true opinion into one which is false ; later he may, by physical or some other evidence impressing a positive or negative action on the corpuscles, find that his first opinion was correct, and so will think again rightly — normally. Here a corpuscle has escaped from one series and joined another, but its electrical attachment or attraction to its last series is not great, and so it may easily detach itself and rejoin its original series or group. The foregoing will fully explain to the Physiologist the curious pathological conditions which have recently been developed, probably for the first time in the human, causing the abnormal symptoms w'hich we term \" shell shock.\" The cause of some diseases is that the normal groupings of the corpuscles of the cells of certain tissues or of the blood have from some cause or another undergone different groupings, and the tissue and blood become abnormal ; now, treat- ment will rectify this. For example, we want the blood more acid : aluminium hydroxide in this case will be effective, because it increases the hydrogen ion concentration, and when absorbed the metallic ion (Al) takes up three hydroxyl (OH) molecules, being trivalent, and this leaves an excess 29"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY of Hydrogen (H) ions. On the other hand, saHcic acid makes the blood more basic, because the siHcon ion has the opposite charge to alumen, and so by this means the corpuscles regain their original groupings in the atoms forming the tissues involved ; the disease thus becomes eliminated and the patient cured. There is so much to be learnt on this subject that I look forward to see such a great advance made in the future medical treatment on these lines as will astonish the world and bring a great deal of human suffering to an end, but it is not a subject to dilate on here. There is no spontaneity in nature or the laws of nature that can be demonstrated by scientific research. The universe is harmonious, composed of three physical entities, Matter, Ether, and Energy. These three phases, although appearing to be separate and distinct, are in reality one. They are forms or phases of a reality, bound to- gether by the Divine God to form His Universe, and, if I may express it, \" His Laws of Nature,'' and you cannot create or destroy an atom or corpuscle of the same, neither can you arrest the devolution and evolution which is constantly taking place. Is the poetry of nature destroyed when one knows these laws ? In my opinion it is a thousand times increased, and the wisdom of man is but foolish in comparison. We know and must believe in these days, because we can prove it by scientific experiments, that everything in 30"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES God's Universe of World and Stars is made up of corpuscles, the ultimate constituent part of the atoms of all the elements as known to chemists. Men and women, mice and elephants, the belts of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, every mechanical work of earth, air, fire and water, every criminal act, every human deed of love or valour — all are made up of these corpuscles and the relation of one swarm of corpuscles to another. Here, for example, is a swarm of corpuscles vibrating, scintillant, martial— they call it a soldier ; and anon in France or Germany that swarm dissolves — dissolves, forsooth, because of another Httle swarm they call shells. What a phantasmagoric dance it is, these corpuscles of atoms ! Mark you the mutabihties of things. These same corpuscles, or others like them, come together again, vibrating, clustering, interlocking, com- bining, and the result is a woman, a fiow^er, a black- bird or shark, as the case may be. But to-morrow the dance is ended and the corpuscles and atoms are far away — some in fever germs that broke up the dance ; others are the green hair of the grave, and others are blown about the antipodes on the waves of the ocean, and the eternal ever- changing dance goes on. One thing, therefore, is sure : that every action of everything living or dead, within the bourne of time and space, is the action of one swarm of corpuscles on another, for without them there is *» 31"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY but empty void. These are God's little servants which nothing can destroy. You take a piece of coal, composed of these corpuscles and atoms ; you burn it, and you can convert this consecutively into heat, into mechanical energy, into electrical energy, and in some far away street into the radiant energy of the arc-lamp. Or take a piece of iron and heat it to 30,000° Cent. ; presto ! these little corpuscles fly off and unite with others — the moist atmosphere — and form clouds, de- scending again as rain to form rivers and oceans. Again \" the dead stars \" clash together, and the result an ever-increasing temperature, until it has reached a degree of 30,000° Cent., and lo ! a new star, a new world is formed, and at that tempera- ture all are in the form of our little corpuscles ; these gradually cool down again until the chemical elements of which this world is comxposed are found. This evolution and devolution is repeated and repeated, but God's little servants are never destroyed, not one ; they only assume other forms of swarms, or they can exist by themselves, and then so small, ^ the size of an atom of hydrogen. And how fast they can travel — 90,000 to 100,000 miles per second — and what can stop them ? Nothing, for they can penetrate the biggest block of steel ; and with these little atoms God has created all and everything, and is for ever creating. There is no spontaneity in the creations ; all 32"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES are governed by a well-known law — the Periodic Law. These corpuscles, when existing alone, possess the same properties, and when combined, always in definite combinations, each possesses definite properties which never exist precisely the same in any other combination. If a different quantity of these unite, or combine, a different property is evolved. These form the Alphabet of all things living or dead. The Socialists state that \" Nature is not like the products or works of man \" — no ; because man could never produce that which God can with His little servants. All man can do is to use these, mechanically or otherwise, and produce different forms of things, either material or diverse, such as good or bad actions or thoughts. He cannot, however, produce the ultimiate forms of the very atoms with which he works. These are given to him by a Divine Creator in order to attain a higher type, a higher standard, for himself and those who follow him. As man has advanced up the ladder of evolution, so by the Divine Will these corpuscles have with Time produced a higher type of the human from the original, by different combinations of the corpuscles forming the brain cells, and the law of evolution is tending to be always progressive and to evolve a superior Homo. When men or nations do not follow the laws of evolution, one little swarm of the brain cells will convert another little swarm into a third form, 33 c"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY and those men or nations will eventually become destroyed, and these corpuscles will unite again somewhere to form a higher type in other men or nations, for the progressive evolution which is constantly taking place. How could these things be if there was no Great Divine Creator ? It is the eternal law of evolution, the key to learn. This knowledge lies in the Periodic Law of the cor- puscles and elements. Here only can you fmd your Alphabet, learn to spell and then read the Universe of God — not the Socialist's Universe. They contend that if the individual is a complete and independent totality, if his end be in himself, then any voluntary self-restraint, let alone self- sacrifice, on the part of the individual is unintelli- gible. If the individual contains his end wdthin himself as person, where can the obligation lie to prefer a painful course which can never possibly redound to the ulterior interest ? He recognizes the call to do and to forbear only in things which directly affect the society, all actions not having a direct social bearing being morally indifferent to him. In this conception of duty, the individual consciously subordinates himself to the commu- nity, not limited by frontier, but world embracing. Thus we shall see later in this book that the only difference betv/een the Aboriginal Tribes and the present-day SociaHsts is, that the Aboriginal Tribes' first and only Tribal Ethic was for the Tribes or Totemic Clan alone into w^hich the 34"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES aboriginal was born, or belonged, but he believed in a Supreme Being and a life hereafter. In the case of the Socialists it embraces, or would do so, all the Tribes of the world, but with no behef in a Supreme Being or a life hereafter. In Socialism, Ethics becomes political, and PoHtics become Ethical, whilst Religion in the end is consigned to be absorbed in a corporate social consciousness of which the telos is the final purpose of Society, thus implying that there is no life hereafter or spiritual second life. That is a great fallacy and the cause of unbelief in the phenomena of Spirit Life hereafter. There is one man I am glad to see who writes with the courage of his convictions— Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S. Although he has so7ne proof of the borderland and the beyond, he is far from knowing the whole truth, nor does he yet possess the key to gain the entrance to the secrets of the future life. In his various works, to one who knows and possesses the key, this is evident. His article \" Must Nature Perish ? \" I answered in the Freemason, April 22, 1916. His recent articles in the Daily Chronicle and in his book on Raymond, or Life and Death, prove to me beyond a doubt that he has not been using a good spiritual medium — these are ver}^ few and rare to find, but many exist. He would not have written Life and Death, and expressed his experiences in the terminology that he has, if his medium had been a good spirit, and this I 35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY challenge to prove to him objectively if he so desires. Much that he has written, however, is absolutely true. He states : '' A chief obstacle in the way of recognizing the possibility of survival of bodily death is the fact that loss of body means the loss of brain, and that so the mind appears to cease to work. At any rate, the brain ceases to work ; and the question arises, how then can memory persist ? If memory is located in the brain and nowhere else, memory cannot survive the destruction of that organ. But if survival of memory is proved experimentally, we can take it as demonstrated that memory is not, or not solely, located in the brain.\" His answer to his own question is bad logic, because if the brain perishes so do all other parts of the body ; he is at fault because he does not understand or know the truth. If all perishes nothing can remain, yet he knows memory does remain. I answer, the truth is that memory is located in the brain corpuscles, and in the brain corpuscles alone. And although the matter part dies the corpuscles do not die, but still exist, and can be seen, the same as the body corpuscles. The whole spirit of the man or woman after death has no material body or material brain, but these exist as the likeness of the body and brain - in a bright corpuscular form. The Periodic Law provides for this. Many after death do not remember anything of this life here on earth until it is recalled to them. The brain 36"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES may be compared to a book with many blank leaves, and each day you print or write a page in this book during your Hfe on earth. How many people can tell you all they have printed in this book ? If asked about a certain thing that has happened, they say they have forgotten — their memory fails them ; and yet an hour or so after they remember all about it, by some incident perhaps that has been brought to their notice. It has been photographed on the corpuscles all the time, but they have not been able to turn to the right page of the book. And so it is after death ; at a certain time all is recalled to them. In no part of the body have you matter which possesses the same physiological effect as the brain. Here you have the brain tissue composed of corpuscles and ions almost in their pure form embodied in so-called matter, and it is owing to the disarrangement of these corpuscles and ions from their normal conditions that men's minds and memories become abnormal. It is by the knowledge of how to use these corpuscles that the mind, or will, of one who knows can operate upon another body submitted to its temporary guidance and control, also how to re-form these corpuscles in their normal and original groups which consti- tute what is termed a normal brain.

Sir Oliver Lodge states : \" However it be accom- plished, and whatever reception the present-day scientific world may give to the assertion, there are many now who know, by first-hand experience, that communication is possible across the boundary — if there is a boundary betw^een the world appre- hended by our few animal-derived senses and the larger existence concerning which our knowledge is still more limited ; communication is not easy, but it occurs/' Let me assure him that to those who possess the secret and know, as the old Wise Men of Eg37pt knew, it is quite easy if you under- stand the Periodic Law of the Corpuscles. If you wish to know the truth you can only work with good mediums, and you must never use bad spiritual mediums. You ask, How do you know, or how can you distinguish the one from the other ? The answer is that it is quite easily done when you possess the secret knowledge of how to send them to the Gates of Paradise and pass them through the Maa-Kheru of the Ancient Egyptian High Priests.

But scientists as a whole have much to learn, and until they take the trouble to do so they will not make any great advancement or gain any real know- ledge regarding the secrets of nature and the cosmic law^s. I have been induced to make these statements because I know that I know, and because Sir Oliver Lodge in his Life and Matter, p. 58, writes on this subject as follows : '' And those who think they have such a contribution to make, and such a revelation entrusted to them, are bound to express it to the best of their ability, and leave it to their contemporaries and successors to assimilate such portions of it as are true and to develop it further/' Although I have known some of the secrets of the old Egyptian Urshi for many years, and proved them to be true, I have not written these truths before. All those who are interested in the Laws of the Spiritual World must, therefore, thank Sir Oliver Lodge for my setting these forth in this book. I can only add that I quite agree with Sir Oliver in his criticism of Professor Hackel's writings — only more so. Herbert Spencer could find no origin for the idea of an after-life save the conclusion which the savage draws from the notion suggested b}' dreams (Spencer, Facts and Comments, p. 210). 39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY But whatsoever dreams the savage had, they would become famihar in the course of time. He would learn that dreams had no power to externalize themselves in apparitions, had there been no ghosts or visible spirits of the dead. He would also learn readily enough, and the lesson would be perpetually repeated, that howsoever great his success when hunting in his dreams of the night, there was no game caught when he awoke in the morning. Clearly no reliance could be placed on dreams for establishing the ghost, any more than on the result of other dreams. More- over, the same savage who is assumed to have panned out on dreams for a false belief also reports that he sees the spirits of the dead by abnormal vision and has the means of communicating with them. But all the credulity of all the savages who ever existed cannot compete or be compared with the creduhty involved in this belief or assump- tion that the ghost itself, together with the customs, the ceremonies, the religious rites of evocation and propitiation, the priceless offerings, the countless testimonies of the veritabilit}^ of abnormal vision, the universal practices for induc- ing that vision for the purpose of communicating with spiritual intelligence, had no other than a subjective basis, and, a false belief that the dream- shadow was the sole realit}^ Can one conceive anything more fatal to this, made on behalf of evolution as a mode of nature's teaching than this 40"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES assumption that man universally has been the victim of an illusion derived from a baseless delusion ?

The Divine God creates new Stars or new Worlds to serve His purpose and Will ; these when their allotted task is finished decay and die out, and then are re-formed into new Stars or Worlds ; so it is with man from the lowest Pygmy : each type rises to a higher type, evolution is progressive, and it is only because the great masses of people do not comprehend this and have follow^ed the teachings of ignorant men that Socialism and Bureaucracy have arisen, and consequent^ caused the destruc- tion of great nations. The individual is only a partly complete totality in this world, but to a great extent independent, the influence of good spirits and bad spirits being antagonistic ; his own consciousness and concep- tions being the individual factors to decide the issue, the ultimate decision is often influenced by material circumstances, other sw^arms of corpuscles in present human craniums bombarding his own. Education to a higher standard is the only means to eradicate these bad influences and impressions, which are thus against his ulterior interests. His complete totality is only achieved in Paradise by the blending of the male and female into one whole. Therefore the fallacy of the Socialistic arguments. The human has passed Totemic Sociology ; he is partially an independent totality in himself, but owes a duty to the State or country 42"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES to which he belongs, and above all has a duty to the Divine Creator, inasmuch that if he does not follow the Divine Laws laid down by evolution he will ultimately become annihilated,^ both as an earthly human and also a spirit form.

He is independent to follow the Laws of the Divine Creator ; if he obeys, he has his final reward, eternal happiness — not as God Himself or a part of Him, as the Socialists preach it must be, if there is a Divine Creator, but as one of His servants. The result, however, if he does not is total destruc- tion. The Ancient Egyptians knew^ these secrets, but when their old Wise Men were destroyed the only evidence left was written on stone and papyrus. And this has ever been the case when nations have been laid waste and ruined ; their wise men were killed and all art and learning ended, as far as the conquerors were able, and the whole country lapsed into barbarism and decay. But a few escaped to hand down the secrets to posterity when the chosen people should know them again, so hfting the human race to a still higher standard.

The Socialist is far inferior morally to the poor aborigine ; he is so imbued with self-interest that to work or act without personal advantage would be to admit the inadequacy of himself as an end in himself. He is so egotistic that he cannot admit there is a Divine Creator Who formed and created an infallible law — the Periodic Law^ — to govern and carry on the evolution and devolution of the Universe. The Socialist is so conceited that he places his own works and thoughts on a higher plane than any Divine Creator. He states : \" Did I become conscious, however dimly, however transiently, of ' myself ' as having lived and played a part amid the life of past ages, then I could believe in a continuance in the future, but my personal identity begins with a certain year ; beyond that I have no personal identity.'' He does not consider or understand that except the doctrine of transmigration was true this could not be the case, and inasmuch as this doctrine is a fallacy, founded on the behef that the elemental spirits were living personalities at one time, there could be no knowledge of personal identity, how- ever dim, to remind him of a former hfe — which did not exist. 44"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES The poor aborigines make little spirit-houses, and place food therein to propitiate the spirits of their ancestors, and offer sacrifices to the Great Spirit ; they also propitiate the elemental or animistic spirits — but they do not believe that these latter ever possessed any form of humanity ; they knew better, and it is through the ignorance of later humans in not understanding this that the doctrine of transmigration of souls arose and came into existence. The above must be sufficient proof, then, that the poor aborigines are morally a higher standard of the human than the Socialists. The Socialist recognizes a duty, however, to the world-wide society to which he belongs, but to nothing else. His argument is fallacious because ethically there can be no difference if the society is a State, clan, or world-wide — it is a duty to society, to which he belongs. He ignores recog- nizing a duty to his Divine Creator because he professes not to believe in any, and yet, mark well the consciousness of his brain cells, which inform him that there is ; but he gets over this by ad- mitting a \" first cause \" only. Whatever that may mean to him, he is still in the dark and unable to make further explanation regarding it ; he has jumped into a deep pit of mud from which he cannot extricate himself, although he attempts to do so by using metaphysical arguments and Platonic terminology. His \" first cause \" is the 45"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY Periodic Law of the Corpuscles and Elements, which he does not understand. If he could compre- hend this, his consciousness would convince him that the final purpose of this immutable law did not end with him personally here, or yet the telos of his society itself, but that his birth and life on this earth was only one phase in the evolu- tion of Life Eternal. The whole human life has been from the first, and is still so here, one state of transition to a higher type, interrupted now and again by the downfall of a great nation, which has reached the highest type for the time, the cause being in all cases the introduction of Socialism and Bureaucracy. But gradually the course of evolution continues, carried on by other nations, which arise out of the ashes of the dead. Socialists believe in the physical or materialistic principle of the life of mankind. If the materialist calls science to his aid, it is only to find that his difficulties increase as his scientific investigation goes on. He is met at the outset with the fact that the purely material- istic hypothesis utterly fails to render any adequate interpretation of the phenomena of life. To the materialist the question \" whence I came and whither I go '' remains unanswered w^hen you bid him look round, the universe and direct his attention in turn to the animal and vegetable kingdom, to the sea, to the stars and different constellations by night, to life and death ; and 46"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES when you ask him what is the meaning of it all, he can only generalize on his unknown laws of nature, and omits to account for the origin and purpose of nature, or the future life which the Spiritualist knows to exist.

No one has yet learned how it was engendered ; why, when, or where, not only in man but in animals and plants. According to the prevalent conception of life, human life is the short time from the birth to the death of man's animal part. But this is not all that life is in the human ; this is merely the existence of man as an animal personality. Human life is certainly something which reveals itself in the animal existence, just as organic life is something which reveals itself in the existence of matter — an unknown combination of series of corpuscles. The animal may live for his own body only ; nothing prevents his living thus : he satisfies his individuality and unconsciously plays his part, and does not know that he is an individual ; but reasoning man cannot live for hib owm body alone.

Man himself makes his real life in this world, and lives it. But in two modes of existence bound up with this life man cannot take part, i.e. his spiritual body and matter constituting him. The former is composed of all pure corpuscles which exist eternally in his bodily form. The latter, of a series of corpuscles forming his component parts ; which on death and disintegration assume other series of corpuscles and forms. The study of these forms of existence, included within and constituting him as a whole, i.e. his Spiritual and the Material, constituting the animal, shows man the universal Periodic Laws of all existence. Man does not know, and cannot know, any other life of his former self, scrutinize his past as carefully as he will. If he has learnt the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles, he knows how he has been formed by various combinations of series of these, but he has no knowledge from whence these were derived, or how formed, or what combinations these assume to form his whole, or what form they will take after the disintegration of his material body. The Spiritual or higher or better part of man's life — the everlasting Spiritual corpuscular body contained in the material body, is always striving towards the good, happiness and welfare of himself and fellow-men. But the common herd of unthink- ing men understand the welfare of man to be the welfare of his animal part. 49 D"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION Of FREEMASONRY Yet his consciousness or Spiritual Self, which he will discover definitely at some indefinite period during his life, will always call upon and tell him that the true life of love for others is the only one that will confer lasting happiness upon him, and that there is another form of life, after this animal life has been annihilated, that will exist for eternity. The gnosis to obtain this everlasting Spiritual Life, which Ethics was first promulgated by Taht-Aan in The Ritual of Resurrection or The Egyptian Book of Life, has been carried down through the past ages by the so-called \" Speculative Freemasons,\" time and circumstances being the causes of substituting the innovations in place of those fragments which have been lost or as yet have not been found. The discovery of the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles is the discovery of science, and applies equally to the Natural or Physical Laws, the Cosmic Laws and the Laws of the Spiritual World, — one is identically a continuation of the other, — and knowing therefore that these Laws are the Laws of the Spiritual World, that whole region at once falls within the domain of science and secures a basis as well as an illustration in the constitution and course of nature ; from the beginning to the end it becomes the discerni^ig faculty, clairvoyant power of seeing the eternal 'in the temporaL The unity of conception becomes complete.

All known phenomena can he arranged in one vast circle under the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles, being caused by the various groupings of the different series of corpuscles, separating and uniting into particular groups — these being the ultimate atoms that the Universe is built up of, and every ex- pression of thought, word, or deed is caused by various groupings into different numbers of these '* little bricks \" of the Great Creator. My own opinion is that life is not dependent upon the bodily matter — that life is an unknown combination of a series of corpuscles, which in the human at least continues to exist for eternity. What is commonly called the \" spirit \" consists of pure corpuscles in series, in the form of the person which once lived as a human, only much more beautiful. There is not the slightest doubt of this in my mind, because I know two people still living who possess the inestimable gift of seeing and being able to converse or communicate with their friends, who never leave them night or day. But these good spirits cannot talk so that one can hear them ; they cannot make noises, nor can you take photographs of them : all this that Spiritualists tell you is chicanery and humbug. You cannot take photographs of spirits because they are composed of pure corpuscles — Beta Rays ; and as it is the Beta Ray that pro- duces photographs, naturally it cannot produce 51"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY itself. If 3^ou ask them a question, they will make a motion of affirmation or negation only ; but if you have a good spiritual medium, whom you send into a hypnotic state, you can converse, gain any information you wish that they are permitted to tell you, and they will answer questions or communicate their wishes. The Ancient Eg^^p- tian Priests knew this and gained much knowledge through this means. But the real secrets are known to a few^ only, and since the fall of the Old Egyptian Empire the ignorance of the human always has been such that great opposition has always been, and still is, shown to the study of the Laws of the Spiritual World. But future genera- tions will become more enlightened, and the know- ledge that we shall gain through this means may be the source of enlightening us as to what life is and all the secrets of the Universe. Man has come so far up the ladder of knowledge and evolution that it is unthinkable there is not still a higher state to attain, and that ultimately we shall be able to gain the knowledge which up to the present we have not obtained. It is not likely that the Divine Creator should leave His work unfinished. In the higher degrees we are instructed to become Philosophers. All philosophy is in some sen^e the endeavour to find a unifying principle, to discover the most general conception underlying the whole field of nature and of knowledge. According to Schopen- 52"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"LITE AND WHAT IT IS hauer, \" Will\" is the fundamental reality of the world, the thing itself ; and its objectivation is what is presented in phenomena. The struggle of the will to realize itself evolves the organism, which in its turn evolves intelligence as the servant of the will. And in practical life the antagonism between the will and the intellect arises from the fact that the former is the metaphysical substance, the latter something accidental and secondary. But the \" Will \" of Schopenhauer is a swarm of corpuscles acting on another swarm of corpuscles in the atoms and molecules of the brain tissue ; some electrical or other cause changes these swarms of corpuscles (which as far as the will is concerned are dormant) into activity, and a will to think or do is the result ; that is the true science of his philosophy. \" Hackel and his followers maintain that when the material organism decays, the vital energy no longer exists, but is resolved into inorganic energies associated with gases and relics of the deca3dng body. He states that science always finds these inorganic energies to reappear on the dissolution of life, and has never in a single instance found the slightest reason to suspect that the vital force, as such, has continued to exist/' I do not understand what Hackel means by \" vital force,\" except life, and if that is so he is quite wrong.

Life does not alter the quantity of energy ; it utilizes available energy, the same as living things are able to direct inorganic terrestrial energy along new and special paths, so as to achieve results which without '' life \" could not have occurred. Life is a guiding principle, a controlling agency ; i.e. life does guide and influence the elements of inorganic nature, and when the \" body \" dies, that simply reverts into the in- organic elements. Life as in the human, at least, still continues to exist ; to most people it is by no means alone, i.e. without being in- corporated in matter, apprehensible to their senses ; but undoubtedly others have an in- estimable and unpurchasable gift and are able to see it, and with these it does not depend on matter for its visuality. This proves that it is indepen- dent, that its essential existence is continuous and permanent, and its interactions with matter are discontinuous and temporary. Whether the life of plants and animxals is the same is another question upon which I would have some doubt, for the reason that the series of corpuscles composing them have not yet mani- fested such a complete series as in the human, and as I look upon evolution as a progressive stage, 54"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"LIFE AXD V/HAT IT IS I can conceive that it is onty in the human where life has a persistent and eternal state of combina- tion of these complex series.

But there is no known proof on this point. I do not understand what Sir Oliver Lodge means vvhen he states (Life and Death, p. 318) : *' A Power that may properly be called super- naittral/' Does he mean an elementar}' power — super- human ?

In no other religion is continuity in spirit made dependent on the resurrection of the earthly body. The Christians mistook the risen mummy in Amenta for the corpse that was buried on earth, whereas the Egyptian religion was founded on the rising again of the s-pirit from the corpse, as it was imaged in the resurrection of Amsu-Horus transforming from the mummy Osiris, and by the human soul emerging alive from the body of dead matter. There is no instance recorded, in all the experience of spiritualists, ancient or modern, of the corpse coming back • from the tomb. The so-called worship of ancestors depended entirely on the ancestors being considered as living, conscious, acting and recipient spirits, and not as corpses mouldering in the earth. This furnishes the sole raison d'etre for all the sacrificial offerings, the life, the blood, the food, the choicest and costliest things that could be given to the dead.

So many great errors and evils have arisen from bad observation and reasoning that it becomes a natural question to ask how it comes to pass that man observes and reasons so badly, when his business is to observe and reason. Because he is a limited being, with very limited capacity, while that which he has to observe and reason about is illimitable. Observation is a process of mental growth, slow and tedious necessarily, and only to be perfected by degrees : for it is the organic construction of an internal order of mind, a mental organization, in conformity with the external order of nature, by mutual interaction. It is because it is objective and subjective that it requires the conjoint action of the within and without, that it is a slow progress of organic development, nothing less 58"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"LIFE AND WHAT IT IS than the patient construction of a mental fabric formed by minute degrees and slowly accumu- lating increments through ages of time by the gradual increase of the corpuscular groups in the brain cells. This is one of the causes of errors of thought and erroneous beliefs, which are now exploded notions because we have instruments of science, and these were long inaccessible to human sense. It therefore may be stated as, or the cause of, the want of means of observation. Another cause is the want of opportunities of observation. It is obvious that he who has not the opportunity is as ill placed for arriving at a sound conclusion as he who has not the means of observing ; to want the opportunity is to want the means. Perhaps at the present time the chief cause of errors is the want of habit or capacity of observa- tion. Although one person may have a better natural aptitude to observe than another, ^^et no one can observe well in any province of nature without training by practice, any more than he can shoot well without practical lessons. Thus we get erroneous reasoning by those who exult in the modern diffusion of knowledge, who bray of the enlightenment of the age, and who do not reflect how very small is the minority of men on whom the boasted progress depends actually ; how entirely the intellectual possessions of the race have been and are gained and maintained 59"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY by the few ; how httle real knowledge the vast majority has, and how mechanical that little is ; how great a dead weight of ignorance passively, and how strong an organization of hostile super- stition actively, withstand progress.

So much lies beyond dispute. Furthermore, it is indis- putable that temperaments proved naturally to lapse into morbid action have been designedly selected, and means suited to induce morbid action of them systematically used, in order to obtain visions.

If a hundred years ago anyone had advanced the theory that this life existed and was in many cases the cause of our ailments, describing the whole conditions, he would undoubtedly have been stamped as one suffering from hallucinations and mental disorder. Nevertheless, by the aid of the microscope and anihne dyes we have been able to demonstrate and prove that there is a life of active organisms existing which no one can see without the aid of the \" seer- ship \" of the microscope, after these organisms have been treated with aniline dyes — not even the microscope alone, however powerful, will enable us to demonstrate as a fact that these exist. Therefore, it is not of any great point in imagination that the common herd of humanity, 6i"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY with their gross material instincts and thoughts, are unable to see the corpuscles of the living spirit that has emaned from the dead human body. We have truth in Nature as it came from the Divine Creator, and it has to be read with the same unbiased mind, the same open eye, when we inquire as to the universal human good and the Divine interpretation of things ; but to find and gain the knowledge of the Truth we must obliterate and cast away the adulterations, the artificial accumulations of centuries of uncontrolled specula- tion : they mark the impossible of progress. How can it be otherwise with dogmas which depend for their existence on a particular exegesis, with propositions w^hich rest for their evidence upon supposed probabilities, or upon the w^eight of some unscientific authority which can give no actual proof ; with doctrines w^hich every age and nation may make or unmake, which each sect may tamper with, and which anyone may modify for himself ? — all of which is totally opposed to the immutable Periodic Laws of the Universe. There is a sense of greatness and solidness about the Periodic Laws of Nature (proved by scientific experiments) which belongs to nothing else.

And as regards the proof of Evolution I must say a few words here. Mr. Kidd, in his The Science of Power (\" The Limits of Darwinism and Social Evolution \")y has tried to prove that Darwin was not true in his scientific deductions — or at least only partially so. I will comment on a few \" extracts \" from Mr. Kidd's works which will, I contend, prove that Darwin was quite correct and that Mr. Kidd's ideas are erroneous — to say the least ; other parts of this work will also prove the errors of Mr. Kidd's theory and give the true causes of human evolution. He asks : ''If individual character and racial types are so rigidly fixed by biological inheritance, or inborn heredity, how comes it that the Japanese managed to change their entire national psychology in a single generation ? \" They have not changed as types of Homo. They are anatomically and physiologically Stellar Cult people, the same as the Chinese, but have had, in many cases, a mixture introduced of \" other blood.\" But a great number still remain true Stellar Cult type as from the first, before the exodus of these left Old Egypt, their original home.

When external objects in many different forms were presented to them continually, the development of the grey matter of their brain would increase from generation to generation, and would be quite sufficient to account for the assimilation of new changes and ideas of what Mr. Kidd calls \" national psychology.\" This, however, has not occurred in one single generation. Their osteo-anatomy has not changed except when there has been a mixture of types, as we find amongst many.' The fact that they have assimilated new ideas from an outside race, or races, who are in a higher state of evolution does not prove that Darwin is wrong ; on the contrary, we find that the principal change was first produced amongst those who had \" mixed \" blood, and that the evolution of the corpuscles of the brain cells continues progressively, a point which Mr. Kidd obviously has not taken into any consideration at all ; hence his errors. Mr. Kidd recalls the main thesis of his Social Evolution. \" Civilization rested, it was maintained, not on the intellect, or on the reasoning processes of mind, but on the physical inheritance transmitted from generation to generation, and entirely independent of inborn heredity in the individual,\" and he states : \" None of the leading races or nationahties w^hich have ruled in the past, or which wield power on I See Origin and Evolution of the Human Race. 64"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"LIFE AND WHAT IT IS 3l large scale over other peoples in the present, have done so, or do so now, because of any distinc- tive superior intellectual faculties inborn in the ruling race.\" To sum up : \" Darwinism is the science of the causes which have made those who are efficient in the struggle for their own interests supreme and omnipotent in the world. Now, this doctrine has nothing to do with the science of civilization. It is the doctrine of the efficiency of the animal. It has absolutely nothing to do with the causes making for collective efficiency on the social and moral world founded on mind, which is everything in civilization. Darwinism represents, indeed, the very antithesis of the principles of that social integration which is taking place in civilization. The dividing line, moreover, is fundamental. For the first principle of evolution in the world of the efficient animal of Darwinism is the supremacy and ommipotence therein of indi- viduals, or groups of individuals, efficient in their own interests. The iirst principle, on the contrary, in the evolution of the social world of civilization lies in the subordination of individuals. The story of creation up to and including human savagery is simply the story of the supremacy in the world of physical force in the life of the indivi- dual or the efficient group or the efficient State. But the story of evolution above savagery is nothing 65 E"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY else than the story of the gradual rise to supremacy in the world of those psychic forces organized in civilization which are subduing individuals or aggregations efficient in their own interests to those universal principles which are making for the limitless efficiency of civilization.\" These statements are absolutely diametrical to facts, and if Mr. Kidd had any real knowledge of the past and present evolution of mankind, I do not think for one moment he would have pro- pounded such theories. Take it as he states : \" The story of creation up to and including human savagery is simply the story of the supremacy in the world of physical force in the life of the individual or the efficient group.'' It is not. The lowest type of human which was evolved from the Anthropoid Ape was the P3^gmy ; some of these have attained a higher standard than others. The next higher type in evolution is the Masaba Negro ; the next higher to that is the non-Hero- Cult Nilotic Negro ; the next higher is the Nilotic Negro, with Hero Cult, and from these the Stellar Cult people were evolved. Remnants of all still exist in the world, but what has occurred ? This, that the higher t3^pe in evolution has exterminated, or driven away into fastnesses, forests, or moun- tains, the lower types, each in buccession. Does he mean to tell me for one moment that '' simply physical force \" was enough to drive the non-Hero Cult away from the Hero Cult ? The next higher 66"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"LIFE AXD WHAT IT IS type were the Stellar Cult people : does he mean to tell me that \" physical force '' alone was sufficient for these to exterminate the Nilotic Negro ? The suggestion is too preposterous to be entertained for one moment. He can prove this, if he cares to make the experiment, by taking a group of Warramunga, or Masai Nilotic Hero Cult people, and a group of Chinese or Japanese, Stellar Cult people : let them fight it out with nothing on — physical force would prove his theory was not sound, but that Darwin's was absolutely correct. Why ? Because the development of these lower-class humans is as distinct and certain in the evolution of the human race as is the white from the yellow, and the progressive form_s of white or dominant races. He states that '' Darwinism is the science of the causes which have made those who are efficient in the struggle for their own interests supreme and omnipotent in the world,\" and then states that the doctrine has nothing to do with civilization, etc. Here again Mr. Kidd fails to recognize what has occurred in the evolution of the human and is entirely wrong in his statement as a result. Man first had short legs, long arms and large abdomen, with small brain — 850 to 1,000 c.c. (the Pygmies) ; next we find great develop- ment of bone takes place, longer legs, shorter arms, less abdomen and greater brain — 1,000 to 1,200 c.c. (Nilotic Negroes) ; the next we find is that the bones are not too large, legs, arms and body 67"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY more proportioned, and the brain much enlarged — 1,200 to 1,400 ex. (Stellar Cult people). Had this nothing to do with civilization ? The very fact that, as they had greater development of brain tissue, they would observe and think more of all the phenomena of nature, their wants would increase in proportion, and civilization would gradually dawn and take place — this is what has occurred ; yet he acknowledges that '' collective efficiency in the social and moral world is founded on mind — which is everything in civilization.\" Quite so ; that is the proof of the evolution of the human race. The mind, as he terms it — or, as I would rather state it, the brain cells, and more particularly the grey matter of the brain — had been increasing both in size and thickness as a result of the progressive evolution of the human race, under the Periodic Laws, from the first, and still continues to do so in the higher types of the human. The '' series of corpuscles \" increase in numbers and complexity ; that is progressive evolution according to Darwin's science and is a profound fact. It is owing to the increase of the numbers and complexity of these corpuscles of the brain cells that higher types of evolution in the human race are produced and the highest civilization that has been attained up to the present tim.e has been caused (see later). Hom.o first developed great bone and muscular power because he had to contend against large and 68"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"LIFE AXD WHAT IT IS fierce animals if he was to live and become dominant, which was the Will of the Divine Creator ; but as soon as he had overcome these, what did he require for a higher state of evolution ? Not more bone and muscles, but brain, and this then began to develop : this is well observed in tracing the Pituitary Gland in the brain from the Pygmy to the Stellar Cult man. With the development of his brain greater powers of thought and observa- tion would come into being. Darwin never left out the development of the brain as a factor to attain a higher state of evolution, and Mr. Kidd's w^orks, therefore, are most decidedly misleading as regards the truth of evolution anatomically or socially : he must have overlooked what Darwin's opinion was when the latter wrote as follows : '' Variabilit}^ is generally related to the condition of life to which each species has been exposed during several successive generations ; changed conditions act in two wa^'s, direct^ on the whole organization or on certain parts alone, and indirectly through the reproductive system.\" As the wants of man increased so did his power of reasoning. The progressive development of the grey matter of the brain produced, as a result, \" ideas and reasoning powers \" to a far greater extent than man had attained before, giving him knowledge which he formerly did not possess. As one example, it would enable him to form and acquire new implements, which the inferior races were unable 69"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY to fashion, thus enabHng him to dominate and exterminate any resistance on the part of his inferiors. Science and Art would gradually dawn, and a higher and nobler form of religious ethics and civilization would be the result. Civilization, it is true, is an arbitrary term. Anthropologists have not 3^et settled the boundary line between a savage and a civilized people. The obtaining food from wild plants and animals, without any of the arts of culture and domestication, would apply as a definition to the savagism of the aborigines of Australia and all the non-Hero Cult people and probably to most of the Hero Cult people as well. But when we come to the group of the Masai, we must admit that an early step in civiliza- tion had commenced which has continued pro- gressively ever since. But what does Darwin say in his The Descent of Man ? — \" The small strength and speed of man, his want of natural weapons, etc., are more than counter-balanced, firstly, by his intellectual powers, through which he has formed for himself w^eapons, tools, etc. ; secondly, by his social qualities, which lead him to give and receive aid from his fellow-men. Natural selection had been the chief agent of change, though largely aided by the inherited effects of habit and also slightly by the direct action of the fluids of the system having altered for some special purpose (products of ductless glands), inducing other changes. In regard to mental powers 70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"LIFE AND WHAT IT IS the faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively y gained for the benefit of the community, and the individuals,\" therefore, have at the same time gained an advantage indirectly. The social in- stincts, together with sympathy (which leads to our regarding the approbation and disapprobation of others), have served as the primary impulse and guides. As the wants of man increased, so did his power of reasoning. Social instincts have been acquired by natural selection, or the indirect result of other instincts and faculties, such as sympathy, reason, experience, and a tendency to imitation, or long-continued habit. Man is a social being, but social instincts never existed in all of the same species ; he would inherit a tendency to be faithful to his comrades and obedient to the leader of his tribe, but these are qualities common to most social animals ; and although man has no special instincts to tell him how to aid his fellow-men, he still has the impulse, and with his improved intellectual faculties naturally would be much guided in this respect by reason and experience. With highly civilized nations, con- tinued progress depends, in a subordinate degree, on natural selection ; for such nations do not supplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes. Nevertheless, the more intelhgent members within the same community will succeed better in the long run than the inferior, and leave a more numerous progeny ; and this is a form of 71"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY natural selection. The more efficient causes of progress seem to consist of a good education during youth, whilst the brain is impressible, and a high standard of excellence, inculcated by the ablest and best men, embodied in the laws, customs and traditions of the nation and enforced by public opinion. With man we can see no definite limit to the continued development of the brain and mental faculties. It should be borne in mind that the enforcement of public opinion depends on our appreciation of the approbation and disappro- bation of others : and this appreciation is founded on our sympathy, which hardly can be doubted originally was developed through natural selection as one of the most important elements of the social instincts. I think what I have written here and in my other work is sufficient to prove that Mr. Kidd's theories are not the truth of the matter and that Darwin was perfectly right in his deductions. For further proofs, for those interested in Darwin's theory, I would refer them to The Descent of Man, new edition, 1901. Many readers may not agree with my chronology, and may think that I am not correct in dating back the world's history and the age of man to such great antiquity^ But let me assure them recent discoveries prove my assertions. One ex- ample alone is sufficient for this, viz. the discovery of skeletons of the Stellar Cult type of man found 72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"LIFE AND WHAT IT IS in the Pliocene strata in Lombardy. It is important to remember that the skeletons found in this stratum were of the modern type of man ; proofs that they were Stellar Cult people were found buried with them, as well as their osteo-anatomy : that they lived and died at this period, and were not accidental burials, we have Professor Sergi's author- ity — a most unimpeachable one. The Pliocene strata v/ere formed at least 600,000 years ago. The obstruction to the acceptance of the inductive evidence on which alone a lasting knowledge of ethnology and of the antiquity of the human race can be had is the same which opposed the progress of the science of Geology, and retarded for centuries the demonstration of the causes which in the long course of ages modified the crust of the earth — *' incompatibility,'' namely, '' with the chronology of the Bible.'' It must be admitted by everyone that there is much uncertainty as to Sacred Chrono- logy being correct, to say the least about it. The thirst for power is never satisfied. It is always insatiable, both in men and nations. When Rome was the mistress of the w^orld, the Emperors caused themselves to be worshipped as gods. The Church of Rome claimed despotism over the soul, and over the whole life from the cradle to the grave. It gave and sold absolutions for past and future sins. It claimed to be infallible in matters of faith.

Many men have it in their pov/er, if they really try, to find out true religion and separate it from the false ; so also have they then, when they have attained this, the power to enter \" the Mysteries of the Ancient Egyptians \" and to converse with the spirits of the ancestors ; but the majority will not try, and they remain forever ignorant and forever outside.

In this Sign Language they acted their wants and wishes in expressive pantomime whilst wearing the skins of animals — '' M37th-making Man \" did not create the gods in his own image. The primary divinities of Egypt, such as Set, Horus and Shu, three of the earliest, were represented in the likeness of the Hippopotamus, the Crocodile and the Lion, Ptah as a Beetle, Taht as an Ibis, and Seb as a Goose.

The Sun and Moon were not considered \" human in their nature \" when one was imaged as a Crocodile, a Lion, a Bull, a Beetle or a Hawk, and the other as a Hare, a Frog, an Ape or an Ibis, as they are represented in the Egyptian hieroglyphics by means of the Zoot3^pes. Until Har-Ur, the Elder Horus, had been depicted as the Child in place of the Calf or Lamb, the Fish, of shoot of the Papyrus plant (which was compara- tively late), there was no human figure personalized in the mythology of Egypt. Mythology did not spring from fifty or a hundred sources, as frequently assumed. It is one as a system of representation, one as a mould of thought, one as a mode of expression, and all its great primordial types are virtually 77"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY universal. Neither do the myths that were in- herited and which were repeated for ages by the later races of men afford any direct criterion of the intellectual status of such races. Mythology has had an almost limitless descent. It was in a savage or primitive state in the most ancient Egypt, but the Egyptians w^ho continued to repeat the myths in Sign Language did not remain savages. Egyptian mythology is the oldest in the world, and it did not begin as an explanation of natural phenomena, but as a representation by such means as were available at the time. No better definition of \" myth \" or '' mythology \" could be given than is conveyed by the Egyptian word \" Sem.'' This signifies \" representation on the ground of likeness,\" which led to all the forms of Sign Language that ever could be employed. In the folk-lore of various races the human soul takes the form of a snake, a mouse, a hawk, a pigeon, a bee, a jackal, or other animal, each of which was an Egyptian Zootype of some power or soul in Nature before there was any represen- tation of the human soul or ancestral spirit in the human form. Hence we are told that w^hen twins were born, the Batavians believed that one of the pair was a crocodile. Mr. Spencer accepts this \" belief \" and asks : '' May we not conclude that twins, of whom one gained the name of Crocodile, gave rise to a legend which originated this monstrous belief ? \" {Data 78"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"SIGN LANGUAGE of Sociology, chap. 22, par. 175). But all such re- presentations are mythical, and are not to be explicated by the theory of '' monstrous belief.'' It is a matter of Sign Language. The Batavians knew as well as we that no crocodile was ever born twin together with a human child. In this instance they were asserting in their primitive way that man is born with or as a soul. This the gnosis enables us to prove. One of the earliest types of the Sun as a Soul of Life in the water is a crocodile. We see the Mother who brings forth a crocodile when the Goddess Neith is portrayed in human shape as the suckler of the young crocodiles hanging to her breasts. Xeith is a wet-nurse personified whose child was the young Sun-god. As Sebek he was imaged b}^ the Crocodile that emerged from the waters at sun- rise. Sebek was at once the child and the Croco- dile brought forth by the Great Mother in the mythology. And because the crocodile had imaged a soul of life in water as a superhuman power, it became a representation in Sign Language of the human soul. We see this same t3'pe of a soul in external nature applied to the human soul in the Ritual of Resiirrectiori of Ancient Egypt, when the Osiris in the Nether World exclaims, \" I am the crocodile in the form of a man,\" that is, as a soul of which the crocodile had been a svmbol, as Soul of the Sun. It was thus the crocodile was born with 79"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY the child as a matter of Sign Language, not as a belief. Mr. Spencer not only argues for the actuality of these \" beliefs \" concerning natural facts supposed to have been held by primitive men and scientific Egyptians, which vanish with a true interpretation of the mythical mode of representation ; he further insists that there seems to be \" ample justification for the belief that any kind of creature may be transformed into any other,'' because of the metamorphosis observed in the insect world, or elsewhere, from which there resulted '' the theory of m.etamorphosis in general \" and the notion '' that things of all kinds may suddenly change their forms,'' man included, of course {Data, chap. 8, par. 557). But there was no evidence throughout all nature to suggest that any kind of creature could be transformed into any other kind. On the contrary, nature showed them that the frog was a tadpole continued ; that the chrysalis was the prior status of the butterfly, and that the Old Moon changed into the New. The transforma- tion w^as visible and invariable, and the period of transformation w^as always the same in kind. There was no sign or suggestion of an unlimited possibility in metamorphosis. Neither w^as there ever a race of savages w^ho did think or believe (in the words of Mr. Spencer) \" that any kind of creature may be transformed into any other,\" no more than there ever were boys who believed 80"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"SIGN LANGUAGE that any kind of bird could lay any other kind of bird's egg.

And it was in Africa that man was first born, as I shall prove. Progressive evolution to a higher type and state still continues, and whatever man does — or may do — he can never stop this.

The whole of this progressive evolution, as well as devolution, is governed by the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles, which are God's little bricks, with which He builds the Universe and all that therein is. We will, therefore, for our argument, begin with the first human evolved — how many milhons of years ago it is impossible to state, but his imple- ments have been found below the Miocene strata (Oligocene), therefore several, at least.

There is a great difference anatomically between the Nilotic Negro and the true Negro. With the Nilotic Negro came into existence what may be termed \" the Second Creation \" — the cutting and opening, the making of men and women. Hitherto all had been a promiscuous herd ; now, at the inception of their Totemic ceremonies, the boy was made into a man and the girl into a woman. This is the origin and meaning of the second creation in the V.S.L. Thus the creation of man was mystical in one sense and in another Totemic, i.e. pre-Totemxic and Totemic — pre-human and human. By Totem- ism we mean the earliest formation of society, in which the human group was first discreted from the gregarious horde that grovelled together pre- viously in animal promiscuity. It is in Totemism only that we can trace the natural genesis of various doctrines and dogmas that have survived to be looked upon as a Divine Revelation especially vouchsafed to later times, in consequence of their having, been continued as religious Mysteries wdthout the guidance of the primitive gnosis.

The non-Hero Cult people followed the Pygmies in their migration all over the world, killed them wherever they came into opposition, and drove the others into the mountains, forests and not very accessible parts, where we find them isolated at the present day — because they did not follow them there. Later the Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes followed the non-Hero Cult people and migrated in their tracks, but did not war against them or kill them, except the}^ had committed some act against the Law of Tabu, but drove them away from the best and most fertile lands and hunting grounds and occupied these themselves. 90"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"EVOLUriOX OF TOTE MIC PEOPLE The osteo-remains and implements of these are found in most parts of the world where they migrated — and the two classes can easil}^ be distinguished from each other by their osteo- anatomy.

These are the Totemic people in different states of evolution, and their governments and laws were, and are, pure Socialism. Totemic Sociology, therefore, was the first kind of government established by primitive man. They believe in a Great Spirit, spirits of their ancestors and Elemental Powers, all of which they propitiate. The curious and important fact I wish my readers to note particularly is, that neither these nor the Stellar Cult people, who were the next to follow them from Africa, ever developed into a higher type of Homo by evolution outside Africa. Only those who re- mained in Old Egypt of the Hero Cult people developed by evolution into the Stellar Cult people, and these by progressive evolution into the Lunar and then Solar.

The two Pillars, or two Poles, which they use in their ceremonies 1. representing with them i«> the North and South Pole Stars and the North and South divisions of heaven, were the origin of the S. and J.W. columns, and were the originals of the two pillars at the porchway entrance to all the temples in the world in the Stellar, Lunar and Solar Cults, including K.S., as I shall prove. These two pillars or poles still survive amongst some of the descendants of the Nilotic Negroes in many parts of the world — as, for example, amongst the Arunta of Central Australia.'

The Nurtunga is typical of the Northern and the Warringa of the Southern part of the Arunta tribes. Each of them, like the Egyptian Tatt pillars, is a sign of establishing or founding — as is shown from its use in the ceremony of \" young men making.'' The Nilotic Negroes knew that this was the sacred sign for \" The Great One \" amongst the Pygmies, and they converted it into two different forms. First they placed the two sticks across thus forming a double cross, and later added another, thus , forming the treble cross. These are still A used in the same two forms by Brothers of the 33°.

It represents amongst them \" The Great Chief/' sometimes called '' The Great Chief of the Hammer/' and the Sacred Axe was another symbol for Horus, their chief hero, and later for '' Horus of the Double Horizon \" or \" Cleaver of the Way \" in the first Solar Cult. Another ceremony, part of the initiation, called the Bora, is practised by the Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes, and is the original of our 3°, which ceremony has been much perverted from the true, but is more faithfully portrayed in part of the 18° ; all the members are pledged to secrecy. The penalty for any breach of its rules is death. '* A valley of death \" is portrayed, and members in two rows, armed with spears and clubs, etc., form an arch over a representative dead body.

He is initiated into the passage of the dead to the spirit world — a Totemic form of the '' Abyss \" of the Stellar and Lunar Cult people and Amenta of the Solar in the Eschatology. Another proof that the aboriginal Austrahans were Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes may be found in some of the words they use — for example (in their \" Snake \" ceremony), \" Ara Tapa Tyiri ai,\" the meaning of which they have for- gotten. This is pure Ancient Egyptian, and means \" The chief of the Red Crown made, or constructed, another burial-place for the Snake,\" and is repre- sented by the Egyptian Tem, who in one form was symbolically depicted as a Snake, as the God of the East — Tem-Asar in the East and Tem-Ra in the West — and in the V.S.L. w^e see that Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness (Num. xxi. 9), showing that he was '' wise \" in the Stellar Cult doctrines and that the symbolism had been brought on from the Wallunga Totemic ceremony.

The Pygmies, Bushmen, Hottentots and Masaba Negroes are all pre-Totemic and, therefore, non-sociological.

In the Stellar Mythos the seven Powers are symbolically represented by the seven Stars of Ursa Minor, and are called the Seven Glorious Ones with Horus. In the Lunar Cult the seven Powers are the seven Taasu with Taht. In the Solar Mythos the seven Powers are the seven Khammu with Ptah. In the Eschatology the seven Powers that pass through various phases, always in groups of seven, are the seven souls of man, w^hich finally become the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Thus there were seven primary Powers in the mythical and astronomical phases, six of whom are represented by Zootypes and the seventh is imaged in the likeness of a man. This is repeated in the Eschatology, where the highest soul of seven is the Ka-eidolon, with a human face and figure as the final type of spirit, which was human on the earth and is to be eternal in heaven. 98"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"EVOLUTION OF TOTE MIC PEOPLE The Ritual states (chap. 85) : \" My image is eternal.\" According to native traditions the eagle-hawk and crow were first among the ancestors of the human race.

In one representation, the two elements were imaged by means of the black bird of Set and the white bird, or Golden Hawk, of Horus, portrayed back to back. These two birds are equated by the black cockatoo and the white cockatoo as the two Totems of the Mukjaraw^aint in Western Australia. Thus we can identify the two primal Elemental Powers which are universal in mythology, and these two Powers, or animistic souls, were divinized as the two gods Set and Horus — that is, as the first two Elemental Powers which became the non- human ancestors in mythology. They are also known as the creators who divided the Murray Blacks into two classes or brother- hoods, whose Totems were the Eagle-hawk and Crow, and who now shine as stars in the sky.

The Stellar Cult people may justly be said to have founded Old Egypt, and divided it first into seven Nomes, or Domains, with a chief or prince over each.

The Hero Cult mythology of the Nilotic Negro was now evolved into astro -mythology by divin- izing the Elemental Powers and giving each a star on high.

The realities of Totemism have supplied the types to mythology as goddesses and gods that wear the heads or skins of beasts to denote their character. The mother as human, in Totem- ism, was known as the Water-cow, and this became the type of the Great Mother in mythology and polytheism. But it was the type that was continued, not the human mother.

But the human mother who was eaten alive at the sacramental meal did supply a type of the superhuman mother in external nature, who also gave herself as a voluntary sacrifice for human food and sustenance — the Mother of life in death, who furnished the first eucharist that was eaten in the religious mysteries. The human mother had been an actual victim, eaten as a sacrifice. The superhuman mother, or goddess, was eaten t3^pically or by proxy.

Lastly, we may be sure that such mysteries as these did not spring from a hundred different origins and come together by fortuitous concourse from the ends of the earth to be finally formulated as the Egyptian Mysteries of Amenta. 112"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI STELLAR CULT PEOPLE AND ORIGIN OF OTHER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS— THE SEVEN LESSER MYSTERIES — THE INITIATORY CEREMONY- WRITTEN LANGUAGE— ANCIENT HITTITE IN- SCRIPTION TRANSLATED — ORIGIN OF THE OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE MASONS AND DIFFERENCES Sign Language had so developed that the Stellar Cult people converted their signs and symbols into the Ideographic Hieroglyphics and so formed the first written language. The signs and symbols they had previously used to express things and mental pictures now became the primary Ideo- graph of the first written language. The Egyptian Hieroglyphics show us the connection betwixt words and things, also betwixt sounds and words, in a very primitive range of human thought. There is no other such record known in all the world. The government, which hitherto had been pure Socialism, was also carried to a higher state of evolution, and personal possession became pre- dominant and individualistic.

They first formed two kingdoms under the King of the North and the King of the South ; ultimately these were merged into one great kingdom. They had observed and studied the laws of nature, and founded a code of laws, as a result, that no nation has ever improved upon since. Here is one great lesson for the human race — i.e. Socialism and Bureaucracy cannot be set up in any country now without the destruction of that country following it. T.G.A.O.T.U. will not allow such a retrograde movement ; it is against His Periodic Laws, which He has established, and these are immutable, and any and every nation which attempts it will always be destroyed, as they have many times, the poor ignorant humanity having been set back to a dark and degenerate age, to commence again to climb the Ladder of Light. It will be forever the same in any country where the ignorant are put in office and allowed to try this primitive form of government. These old ancestors of ours had passed the stage of Totemic Sociology or Socialism, never to return to it and live. The Stellar Cult people now commenced to build cities and develop a very high degree of culture. The signs, symbols, and Totems of the myth- ology were divinized into and represented their 114"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"STELLAR CULT PEOPLE gods and goddesses in their astr o -my i\\io\\ogy , and became the emblems of the attributes of the One Great God. This is the reason why it is difficult sometimes to distinguish between Totems and tribes, repre- senting the mothers of the tribes and the Totems, or emblems representing the divinized super- human Powers, as the same Totem or sign was sometimes used for or represented each. Many people have stigmatized these people as worshippers of cats, dogs and idols, etc., and still believe it, whereas they were no more wor- shippers of these than the present-day Christians are of the eagle and lamb, which are often seen in Christian churches as symbols of the Divinity. If a sign or symbol represents the Great God, it is not the sign or symbol they worship, but the Great God. The animals were first recognized as Powers in themselves, but they were also adopted as the living visible symbols of Elemicntal Powers that were superior to the human, as a means of repre- senting natural phenomena. They were further adopted into the human family as Totemic types, with rehgious rites that gave them all the sanctity of the blood-covenant and made them typically of one flesh with the human brothers. The life- tie assumed between Totemic man and the Totemic animal, or Zootype, was consciously assumed, and we thus see on what ground the assumption was 115"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY made, and the cause of a mystical relation- ship that was recognized between man and the animals. It would take too long to give all the details and proofs of their progressive evolution during the 300,000 years which is about the period of time they existed, as far as my researches prove by the finding of their osteo-anatomy and implements in various strata of the earth and rocks. The Great Pyramid was built by these Stellar Cult people, which proves to what a high degree of knowledge they had attained astronomically and mathematically — a knowledge which has not been equalled by our present astronomers and mathematicians. This is the greatest Masonic Temple that has ever been built, and is emble- matical of their mysteries, is astronomically depicted, and therefore belongs to \" the seven Primary Mysteries \" (see Arcana of Freemasonry and Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man), There is a statement that they had worked out all their astronomy for 40,000 years before they gave it to the rest of the world, also a statement on parch- ment found under the corner stone of one of these temples in the Great Foundation in Dendera, in the 4th Dynasty, that '' the Great Pyramid was built by the followers of Horus,'' and these Stellar Cult people were the followers of Horus, just as the Christians are the foUow^ers of Christ ; indeed, 116"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"STELLAR CULT PEOPLE the traditional history is identical almost in every particular, including the Crucifixion. They sent out colonies all over the world, or nearly all over the world ; the exceptions are Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America, where I have so far been unable to find any traces of their remains. Of course, they may have gone there and all traces have been obliter- ated by the many glacial epochs, which occur roughly about every 26,000 years ; but against this we find in these places the descendants of the Nilotic Negro still existing, and apparently they have never been driven away by the Stellar Cult people, as we find in other countries. We can always distinguish them by the remains of their characteristic old temples and osteo-anatomy — not only in Africa, but in Europe, Asia, Central and South America and some of the Pacific Isles. They built their temples with huge polygonal stones and the finest cement. But the principal distinguishing characteristic was that their Great God and all His attributes were portrayed by iconographic pictures, i.e. Zootypes. These depict not only the Great God and all His attributes, but also the Elemental Powers. By many ignorant people these have been called \" idols,\" because they have not understood, and do not yet under- stand, the gnosis of their religious ideas and symboHsms, which was always portrayed in Sign Language.

The exoteric explanation given by various Professors and books hitherto published is not always the true esoteric representation, and this can only be fully understood by following and stud34ng the origin and evolution of the human race and their Sign Language. It is to these old Stellar Cult priests that we owe the origin of our Brotherhood and the Lesser Mysteries — the old Her-Seshta, or Wise Men of Egypt, self-designated \" the Urshi/' They w^ere the first to cause the primary temple to be built in Egypt, at Edfu. For their sacred buildings they initiated a certain clan, or tribe of men, called the Ari, of the seventeenth Nome of Upper Egypt, who were the original Operative Masons, These builders w^ere initiated into the first and second Mysteries only, so that they should keep the secrets of the temples, and no others were ever allow^ed to build or repair their tem.ples. The Lesser Mysteries were at first seven, but only two of these w^ere ever known to the Operative Masons, past or present. There were two classes of these operatives, called by the priests the Artizans and the Companions. The Operative Masons have divided the first and second Mysteries into four each in recent years, the Blue and the ii8"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"STELLAR CULT PEOPLE Red. The first four \" work with their hands \" — they are operatives of all kinds, the artizans that are required in building. The second four work \" with their heads \" — the architects, the old original Companions, who draw the plans of the buildings, etc., and see them perfectly carried out. The Operative sacred signs and symbols were given to them as a guide for this knowledge — how to form and build with various angles, circles and other figures, by which the Architects could, by crossing in various ways and positions, portray accurately the plans for the buildings of the old High Priests (see Arcana of Freemasonry^ chap, xii, for further details). They were unac- quainted with, and not informed of, the esoteric meaning of these signs and symbols. When an exodus, or colony, was sent out from Egypt — and we have it on record that they sent colonies all over the world — a company of these Ari was sent with them, accompanied by a priest who was fully initiated into all the Mysteries. At the present day the Operatives still have their priest attached to their Lodge — he is never initi- ated in the Operative Lodge, but by a Priest's Lodge. When he enters a new Lodge, none of the W.'s or D.'s have anything to do with him. Jachins of the Priest's Lodge lead him to one of the Three Masters, who gives him a \" password \" enabling him to enter that Lodge at any time, and then 119"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY conducts him to his position in that Lodge. He is never prepared as an apprentice and does not receive a \" bond,\" never pays any fees, and the ceremony of his initiation is unknown to the operatives. He has a special sign which no other member of the Operative Lodge dares to give. He is the representative of the old High Priest who accompanied the first and other exodes of the Ari from Egypt, and who were the builders of all the great Stellar temples that we find scattered over many lands of the world. The whole of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Operative Masons should be the first and second Stellar Cult of the '' Lesser Mysteries,'' but I find much innovation has been made in later years by the introduction of \" Solar positions/' v/hich may be accounted for, because these \" Ari,\" after the Stellar Cult, built for the Solar Cult people in many parts of the world. These Operatives spread throughout the world wherever the Stellar Cult people settled, and afterwards with the Solar Cult people. They w^re no doubt the originals of all those Operative Guilds we find throughout Europe in later times, some of whom established themselves first at Rome and then in many parts of Europe, during the dark and degenerate Middle Ages, and finally in these Isles, where they ulti- mately formed the Operative Lodges of Masons. The so-called '' Speculative Masons \" of the present 120"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE SEVEN LESSER MYSTERIES day, however, never originated from these, as some Brothers suppose. In fact, about 600,000 years ago these Operatives were initiated info the first and second Mysteries by the Her-Seshta, who were the originals of the so-called \" Speculatives.\" What I have written is critical proof of my contention, and there are many other proofs, if required. In this book there will not be space enough to give all. Our Brotherhood, i.e. the so-called Speculative Masons, originated with the old Stellar Cult Her- Seshta priests, who instituted the seven primary Egyptian Mysteries — called the Lesser Mysteries — and these were founded on their astro-mythology, the original mould being supplied by the Totemic Mysteries of the more primitive man, the Hero- Cult Totemic people and their dawning mythology. The Mysteries were a dramatic mode of communi- cating the secrets of primitive knowledge in Sign Language, w^hich now had become extended to the astronomical mythology, and to teach the doctrines of final things. Later, during the Solar Cult, ten more Mysteries were added, which were Eschatological and were called the Greater Mysteries or the \" Mysteries of Amenta.\" The difference between these is that the primary are the Mysteries of Time, the others the Mysteries of Eternity. The Greater Mysteries were ten in number at first ; later, two more were added. 121"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"ORIGIN^ AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY %. The Lesser Mysteries in their origin were par- tially Sociological. They were the customs and the ceremonial rites of Totemism. The Greater are Eschatological and religious. For instance, the transformation of the youth into the adult, or the girl into a woman, in the Totemic Mysteries was applied doctrinally to the trans- formation of the soul in the Mysteries of Amenta. With the primitive races the Mysteries remain chiefly Totemic and Sociological, though inter- spersed with religious sentiment. The Greater Mysteries were perfected in the Egyptian religion, to be read in the Ritual as \" The Mysteries of Amenta.\" The mythological representation was first applied to the phenomena of external nature, and the mode or representation was continued and re-applied to the human soul in the Eschatology. Many of our signs and symbols connected with the Mysteries and originating with the old Stellar Cult priests I will set forth here, but there are many more which we do not now use ; these have been lost to the \" Craft,\" although I am well acquainted with them and their symbology.

The first represented Horus, God of the North, the second Set, the God of the South, and the third, in the centre, Shu, the God of the Equinox. This formed the Primary Trinity. These were the three primary children out of seven of the old Earth Mother, now divinized as Apt in the astro- mythology, as Gods of the North and South Poles and Equinox. This was also depicted by an equilateral triangle placed on the upper cube with the three names at the three different corners and surrounded b}^ a circle.

The two poles or pillars used by the Nilotic Negroes in their ceremonies to represent the North and South divisions of heaven and the North and South Pole Stars, were now brought on in the Stellar Cult as the representative symbols for Set, God of the South, and Horus, God of the North, and w^ere called the Set and Horus Pillars, and were erected at the porchway entrance of every temple (see Ritual), the same as we find stated re traditional Temple of K.S. ; in fact, no temples were ever built without them during the Stellar or Solar Cults. Josephus has preserved a tradition concerning two pillars that were erected in the land of Siriad. He tells us that the children of Seth (Egyptian Set) were the inventors of astronomy, and in order that their inventions might not be lost, and acting upon Adam's prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the force of 124"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"SIGNS AND SYMBOLS fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of waters, they made two pillars, the one of brick, the other of stone ; they inscribed their discoveries upon them both, that in case the pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might remain and exhibit those discoveries to mankind, and also inform them that there was another pillar of brick erected by them. \" Now this remains in the land of Siriad to this day\" {Ant., B. I, chap. ii). Plato Hkewise speaks of these two columns in the opening of TimcBUS. The place where the two pillars, or one of them, traditionally stood was in the land of Siriad. Where that is, no mortal man knows. But Seri in Egyptian is a name for the South. Seri is also the mount that is figured as the twofold rock, which is equivalent to the two pillars of the two horizons, South and North. Seri is also the name of the giraffe, a Zootype of Set, the overseer. Siriad, then, is the land of the South, where the pillar \" remains to this day.\" According to John Greaves, the old Oxford astronomer, these pillars of Seth were in the very same place where Manetho placed the pillars of Taht, called Seiread {English Weights and Measures). It is possible to identify the missing pillar of the two, the pillar of Set in the South. There was a Southern Annu and a Northern Annu in Egypt, and possibly a relic of the two poles may be recog- nized in the two Annus, viz. Hermonthes, the 125"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY Annu of the South, and HeHopoHs, the Annu of the North, the original meaning of Annu being the place or pillar or stone that marked the founda- tion which preceded the sign of station or dwelling-place. There was an Egyptian tradition which connected Set, the inventor of astronomy, with Annu, as the original founder of the pillar which makes him the primary establisher of the Pole. As an astronomical character Set was earlier than Shu. The Arabs also have a tradition that one of the pyramids was the burial-place of Set. The pillar of brick, being less permanent, went down, as predicted, in the deluge as a figure of the Southern Pole, whereas the pillar of stone remained forever as an image of the North Celestial Pole, or of Annu, the site of the pillar, in the astronomical mythology. It is reported by Diodorus that Annu (Heliopolis in the Solar Mythos) was ac- counted by its inhabitants to be the oldest city in Egypt, which may have been mystically meant, as Annu was also a city or station of the Pole, the most ancient foundation in the northern heaven, described in the Eschatology as the place of a thousand fortresses provisioned for eternity.

The word Tattu denotes the two Tatt pillars. Tatt is a figure of stability and supports the four corners, and is therefore equal to a square. Thus the two Tatt pillars at the entrance ^ ^ are equivalent to a double square. Tatt is the entrance or gateway to the region where the Mortal Spirit is blended with the Imm.ortal Spirit, and thereby established for ever.

But of late years some of the Solar Cult people and their doctrines have migrated into these countries and so corrupted the pure Stellar Cult. In these isles and many other countries we find remains of old temples in the form of two circles — one North and one South — which can always be distinguished from the Solar because these latter are built with three circles, one North, one South, and a third bisecting these in the centre, proving that both of these people existed in these islands long ago.

The Candidate had a hood or thick veil placed over his eyes, so that he could not see, and was led by a Brother, called in Egyptian An-er-f, to the door of the Temple or Lodge, which appeared as a blank wall.

The finding of so many of these figures and bulls' heads at Phsestos proves that the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations were principally during the Lunar and first Solar Cults, and, therefore, com- paratively late in Egyptian history, as the Stellar Cult had undoubtedly existed in Egypt for 300,000 years before the Lunar and first Solar. The Cult of the Great Mother and Child w^as thus brought on from the Stellar to the Lunar Cult.

The tree, the pillar, or the mount was female, as a figure of the birthplace, the place of exit for the babe born from the mount, the Meskhen, or its equivalent in Sign Language. She was the House of Horus, and the House was imaged as a cone or tree, or some other type, and this will explain why the Mycenaean figure accompanying the tree-pillar is at times a woman and at other times a child. They are the goddess and her babe, identical with Hathor and the child Horus in the place of birth. In the gold shrine found at Mycenae (Evans, Fig. 65), the figures on each side are two doves. The dove in Egypt was the very ancient bird of Hathor, and the figure on each side is a dove, equivalent to the mother and the child who w'as born within her shrine, her house, her pillar, or her tree, as the dove of the generative spirit or the later Holy Spirit.

In the Stellar Cult the birthplace was in Sothos. Both the Mother and Child met there, and this star symbolizes the birthplace of Horus in the Stellar Cult. Following the Lunar came the Solar Cult, so called because these people had found that the time hitherto was not correctly recorded, and so they changed and kept their time by the sun. The Lunar and Solar people had developed to a much higher type of Homo in evolution in Egypt, as may be seen by their ph3'siognomy and also osteo-anatomy. They sent out colonies to many parts of the world, and spread over Africa and Europe, some parts of Asia, landed at Yucatan, in America, and went South as far as the Southern portion of Peru, exterminating the Stellar Cult people, or imposing their religious doctrines upon them wherever they were able to do so.

The \" disk \" represented an emblem of the circle made by Aten, as God of both Horizons ; and Horus-Behutet, God of the \" Hut \" or \" Winged Disk,\" was the earliest form of Aten. The word Aten, from At, was an ancient name for the child who crossed from the horizon West to the horizon East upon the vulture's wings, an emblem of the Motherhood. His was a com- pound type of godhead, in which the mother was dual with the son, who was her child on one horizon and her '' bull or fecundator \" on the other. The \" hut \" was a dual symbol of the divine infant and the mother as bearer of the child. As the wings, or bird, she carried him over the intervening void of darkness where the great Apap lay in wait. Thus the godhead of Aten consisted of the mother, her child and the adult male, or \" bull of his mother,\" in the very primary Cult. Har-Ur, the so-called Elder Horus, is thus repre- sented as the child of the mother when she had no husband ; hence she was the Virgin Mother. The first Horus was also called Horus-Behutet, or \" the Great Blacksmith,\" and was symbolized by the axe or the hammer, \" The Cleaver of the Way \" {supra).

The time that this first Cult was developed was when Shu was added to Horus and Set to form the Primary Trinit}^ Horus and Set were the two gods of the North and South when the divisions of the heavens were dual ; then Shu was added at the Equinox to form a tripartite division, or representation, as God of the Centre. In the next phase Horus became supreme as God of the North, South, East and West, and later this primary Cult of Horus of the Double Horizon East and West was instituted. (3) The next phase of this Cult was represented by Neith, on one Horizon, and Sekhet, on the other, with the child Sebek-Horus, depicted sym- bolically by the Great Fish, or Crocodile, which was reduplicated as two Crocodiles, to represent the double power or dual horizons. This is the reason and explanation why we fi.nd Horus symbolically represented as a \" fish- man,\" or \" by a fish \" (see later) in YJ raany phases of this Cult.

To read this Sign Language correctl}^ we must go back to the time when the autumn Equinox occurred in Virgo — that was the place of concep- tion of Sebak, the fish of the inundation. Six months later the sun rose in the sign of Pisces, and in the eastern Equinox, when the Jish as child and consort, or as the two Crocodiles, became the two fishes with Xeith as the Mother on one horizon and Sekhet on the other. Thus the virgin Neith conceived her child Sebek-Horus, the fish of the inundation, which was duplicated to express the adultship, and they were the tw^o typical fishes, or the two Crocodiles. The Crocodile-headed Sebek as the child attributed to Neith in Virgo swims across the \\\\ aters of darkness, or the abyss of waters, to rise up in the East as Horus of the Twofold Horizon. This is the reason why we find Horus repre- sented as a \" fish man \" or by a fish in many phases of Horus of the Double Horizon, the same as the Gnostic Jesus, and also in our present Cult.

He is also represented by sym- bolism as the young Child, representing the Spirit of life in the young Shoot, or the young Fish, or Bird, or Lamb, or other types of \" rebirth of Spirit life,\" also as the adult man, as typified by the head of Bes or Ha'r-Ur, as representing the full develop- ment of the Spirit of the Fish, or Shoot, or Tree, or Fruit, or other types.

The fish-man was at first the Crocodile of Egypt, next the Crocodile- headed figure of Horus, who is called \" the Crocodile God in the form of a man \" {Ritual, ch. 88). The conversion of the crocodile god in the Nun to the fish-man of Babylonia was thus made. Jonah is a form of the fish-man in the Babylonian story (which is neither Mythology nor Eschatology), and therefore a figure of both the Stellar and Solar God who made the passage of the waters as Horus the Crocodile, or as Ea the fish-man of Nineveh. Birth or rebirth, from the great fish in the Lower Nun, is one of the oldest traditions of the race. It was represented in the Mysteries and constellated in the heavens as a means of Memorial in Sign Language.

In this Solar Cult there were several phases following one upon the other, principally showing how the Fatherhood was substituted for the Motherhood.

Now, in the Solar Cult, the Fatherhood was recognized and took the place of the Motherhood, as the primary representation and as the first person in human form, although during the first phases of the Mythos the symbolic representation was partially continued.

(9) The Cult that followed this was that of Amen at Annu, where Amen was the one god in the two characters of Father and lu the Son. In the Cult of Ptah both characters of Father and Son were combined in one god, and so it was in this Cult — the one the Father and the ever- coming son. (10) The Osirian Cult, the 10°, followed this, and Amenta in one aspect became the world of the dead, the Kasu or burial-place in the Osirian Cult, and Horus the son of Osiris takes the place of Amen or Nefer Horus of the previous Cult. The Eschatology followed this Cult. Horus in the Eschatology was he who died and was buried and rose again in spirit at his second advent in human form. This time he was imaged in the likeness of his Father, as the beloved and only begotten Son of God, who manifested as the fulfiller of His Word and the doer of His Will.

The Cult of Atum-Iu lasted about 20,000 years or more. That of the Sphinx lasted about 10,000 years. That of Ptah lasted about 9,000 years. That of Amen lasted about 20,000 years.

The origin of various superstitions and customs seemingly insane can be traced to Sign Language. Modern popular superstition, to a large extent, is the ancient symbolism in its childhood. In the most primitive phase mythology was a mode of representing certain Elemental Powers by means of living types that were super- human, like the natural phenomena, and the foundations of all Ancient Wisdom were laid in the pre-anthropomorphic mode of primitive repre- sentation ; and this mythical mode of representation went on developing in Egypt, keeping touch with the advancing Arts.

Modern ignorance of the mythical mode of representation has led to the ascribing of innumer- able false behefs, not only to primitive man and present-day savages, but also to the most learned, enhghtened, and highly-civihzed people of antiquity, the Egyptians. The ignorant representation of the Egyptian Sign Language was begun by the Greeks, who could not read the hieroglyphics or understand their Sign Language. It was repeated by the Romans and has been perpetuated by \" Classical Scholars \" ever since. But as the interpreter of Egypt that kind of scholastic knowledge is erroneous, and futile as regards the truth of the subject matter. The Eleusinian and other Mysteries that we find in various countries were originally the Egyptian Mysteries carried out of Egypt by men who had been partially initiated there, and by the various exodes that left the old Motherland for some other countries, and, like their writing, had become perverted and altered by time and circumstances, such as new fauna, which were symboUcally the same but different .types ; innovations crept in when part of the true ritual had been forgotten, as we find amongst the Babylonians and Assyrians, who were first Stellar Cult and were later invaded 174"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"EVOLUTION OF RELIGIOUS IDEAS by the Solar ; these converted the Egyptian divinized Elemental Powers, representing all that was beneficent, into all the demons that repre- sented evil. The Greeks are very late as regards human history and evolution, and never understood the gnosis of the Egyptian Wisdom, because they could not read Sign Language or hieroglyphics. Thousands of years even before the Persian Empire existed, the Solar Cult had spread over India and further, to Siam and Java, where they formed a great civilization, as is witnessed by the remains of the old and huge temples still extant at the ruins of Nagor-Wat and Angkorthom. The Solar Cult is at least 100,000 years old and the Stellar over 600,000. But the Solar Cult people, as a great nation, were destroyed in Egypt on account of Socialism and Bureaucracy, and were fast deca3dng when Greece was only a number of States. The first Minoan civihzation of the Mediterranean existed ages before the Greeks (see The Dawn of Mediterranean Civilization, b}' Angelo Mosso), and this civilization only came into being at the time that the Ancient Egyptians were converting their hieroglyphic writing into alpha- betical form (Proto-Egyptian of Evans). In studying these ancient peoples one must take into consideration that there was great over- lapping.

The same with the Incas in South America, who were Solar Cult people and formed a huge socialistic-bureaucratic government, and were almost utterly destroyed quickly by the Spaniards. What are these people now ? But members of the old Brotherhood were not all killed ; some escaped, and in other countries still continued their rites and Mysteries — although much of the true symbolism was perverted, as the gnosis of the mythical representation had been forgotten, to be found again recently, and to be read once more as the truth, in the language in which it was originally written.

The Christian doctrine which issued out of the ashes of the old Eschatology, first evolved by the Copts, and the purity of which is spoiled by the recently introduced dogmas, has yet to evolve into a higher and purer Eschatology again. In the Solar Cult, the Mysteries of Amenta, called the ten Greater Mysteries, were eschato- logical — Amenta was a symbolic representation of the Earth of eternity, where Taht was the Great Teacher of the secrets, together with the seven masters. The passage through Amenta is a series of initiations for the deceased. He is inducted into the Mysteries of Rusta (chaps. I, 7, 9), the Mysteries of the Tuat (chaps. 27, 130), the Mysteries of x\\kar (chaps. 2, 37, 148). He knows or learns the Mysteries of Nekhen (chaps. I, 113). The deceased invokes the god who dwells in all the Mysteries (chaps, i, 14). He learns the Mysteries of the father-god Atum, who becomes his own son (chaps. 15, 46) ; he is the mysterious of form (chaps. 17, 19) and the mysterious of face (chaps. 9, 133). And the most secret and sacred of the greatest of all Mysteries : its name is the book of the hidden dwelling, that is, the Ritual of Resurrection (chap. 162). At the entrance to the Mysterious Valley of the Tuat there is the walled-up doorway, the secret entrance to the Mysteries. It was the first door of twelve 177 M"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY divisions of the passage. The rest have open doors and the twelfth a double door. This was typified or symbolically represented by the en- trance to the Great Pyramid, where a movable flagstone of a triangular shape revolved over a square stone when the magical word was given. It was called \" the Door of Stone.'' Here is the mystery — how to enter when there is no door and the w^ay is unknown. It is explained to the m.anes how divine assistance is to be obtained. When the stains of life are effaced, the strength is given for forcing the entrance where there is no door, and in that power the manes penetrate with (or as) the God (chaps, 2, 3, 148). The entrance to the Great Pyramid (the greatest Masonic Temple ever built) was concealed by means of this movable triangular flagstone that turned on a pivot which none but the initiated could detect. This, when tilted up, revealed a passage, 4 feet in breadth and 3I feet in height, into the interior of the building. This was a mode of entrance applied to Amenta as the blind door- way, that w^as represented by the sacred portal and movable stone of later legends. The means of entrance through w^hat appeared to be a blank wall w^as by knowing the secret of the nicely ad- justed stone, and the secret was communicated to the initiate with the password in the Mysteries. There is no death in the final stage of these doctrines — only decay and change and a periodic 178"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES renewal ; only evolution and transformation in the domain of matter and the transubstantiation into spirit. In the so-called death it is rebirth, not death — exactly the same as in the changes of external nature. If the manes failed at the weighing of his soul, he became annihilated. It would take up too much space to give details of all, but these can be found in the Ritual as per supra. It may be of some interest to Brothers of the iS\"^ to know that it was in the \" earth of Amenta \" that Horus came to restore sight to the blind, and that the funeral bed should not be recumbent. In the D.R. they ought first to arrange the Khen-Kat, '' a funeral bed that stands up.\" The Khen-Kat is the funeral bed on which the dead were laid out in '' Amenta,'' waiting for the coming of Horus, Lord of Resurrection, to wake the sleepers who are in the coffins or lying breath- less on the couches. It is the couch of the dead that is set up on end, like the mummy cases with the body inside, which is thus erected on its feet, as a mode of rendering \" the Mystery of the Resurrection \" or re-erection of the deceased. \" Horus causes thee to stand up at the rising.

There are seven Primary Powers in the mythical and astronomical phases ; six of these are repre- sented by Zootypes, the seventh is imaged in the likeness of man. This is represented in the Eschatology, where the highest soul of the seven is the Ka-eidolon, with a human face and figure as the final type of spirit, which was human on earth and is eternal in the heavens, i.e. the Khu (spirit). The Khu is a soul in which the person has attained the status of the \" pure spirit/' called the \" Glorified,\" symbolically represented in the likeness of a beautiful white bird. There was still one type or grade higher to attain — the Ka, w^hich is a type of totality and of eternal duration, in which the sevenfold 180"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES personality is unified at last for permanent or everlasting life. This is where the Hindu and other Mysteries have gone wrong, not knowing the gnosis of the Egyptian Wisdom, the seven Urseus divinities representing the seven souls of life that were anterior to the one enduring soul of, or in, their Eschatology (\" My image is eternal,\" chap. 85), as it would be when the seven souls were amalgamated into one that was imaged by the divine Ka.

He has grappled with the Apap of evil and wrestled with Set = the Devil, or Satan, and been overthrown in the passage of absolute darkness. Blind and bleeding from many wounds, he continues to fight with death itself ; he conquers, rises from the grave like a warrior with one arm — not that he has lost an arm : he has got only one arm free from the bonds of death, the bandages of the mummy made 181"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY for the burial.

The hell-fire of Christian Theology, the hell-fire that is unquenchable (Mark ix. 43, 44), is a survival of this representation made in the Egyptian Mysteries. The manes in Amenta passes through this hell of fire, called the Meskat, in which those who are condemned suffer their annihilation. He says : '' I enter in and I come forth from the tank of flame (or lake of fire) on the day when the adver- saries are annihilated in Sekhem \" [Ritual, chap, i) ; \" I have come from the lake of flame, from the lake of fire and from the field of flame.\" This lake of fire that is never quenched was derived from the Solar Force in the mythology, on w^hich the Eschatology was based. The initiate in the Mysteries had to pass through this '' lake of fire,'' which is depicted very graphically in part of the Great Pyramid. We do not now use this \" lake of fire,\" perhaps just as well for the initiates at present, because we have lost the secret connected with this ceremony. There are, however, some tribes belonging to the Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes who still perform the ceremon}^ in Africa, Asia, America and the Pacific Isles.

I am not acquainted with the secrets of the ceremony, but I know that it was a symbolical representation of the \" last judgment \" in the Greater Mysteries, and those who had failed to make the word of Horus truth against his enemies were doomed to die a second death in the lake of fire. The first was in the body on the Earth, the second in spirit. The enemies of justice, law, truth and right were doomed to be destroyed forever in the lake of fire or tank of flame. They were annihilated once for all into original and separate Corpuscles. The doctrine occurs in the Pauline Epistles and in Revelation, where the end of all is with destruc- tion in the lake of fire. In the Epistle to the Hebrews the destruction of lost souls is compared with that of vegetable matter being consumed by fire, i.e. the series of Corpuscles which formed this spiritual body, or vegetable matter, were broken np by fire into the original non-grouped Corptiscles, so that the living spirit was annihilated as a living spirit.

Entrance to the seven Arits or mansions of the final test could not be obtained without knowledge and the highest code of morality.

Herodotus and other Greek writers are much too late to be of value as regards the ancient past history of the world. Egypt was in a state of decay before the Greeks w^re born. Herodotus, who was the most reliable Greek historian, tells us, however, of the reluctance of the Egyptians to admit strangers to the holy secrets of their Mysteries. He states that they did, however, admit Eumolpus, King of Eleusis, who on returning to his country insti- tuted the Mysteries of that name which he had learnt from the priests of Egypt, also Orpheus, the Greek poet, the philosopher Thales, and many others. Herodotus also states {Euterpe, L.) : *' Egypt has certainly communicated to Greece the names of almost all the Gods.\" (LI.) \" The Greeks have derived many other customs of religious worship from Egypt.\" (LVni.) \" The two oracles of Egyptian Thebes and of Dodona have an entire resemblance to 193 N"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY each other.

Ireland appears to have retained a truer form of the original than any other country, possibly because we know that direct communication was maintained from Egypt to Ireland by the Her- Seshsta to comparatively late periods, and Ireland, being isolated, did not have so much communication with the rest of the priests of Europe, who exer- cised a form perverted from the original.

The people are not given a chance of developing on true human lines — that is to say, the laws of natural evolution of the development of the human race have been stultified ; the system of education is to make the individual a unit in the machine of State, and the individual is merely an accessory part, all his best instincts are stifled, only blind obedience and servility being taught. 207"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY Freemasonry, on the contrary, teaches and inculcates those principles which, if followed, will build character, increase intelligence, foster self- reliance, promote independent thinking, abolish fear, annihilate superstition, spread love and goodwill everywhere ; it possesses the highest and truest ethics which the world has ever seen.

As our strength becomes greater, as our experience becomes more extensive, you can no longer confine the Brotherhood within swaddling bands, or lull them in the cradle, or amuse them with metaphysical terminology, or try to terrify them with some bugbear of infancy. Men of the twentieth century cannot govern as did men of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies. Since then so much experience has been gained, and experience is true knowledge. Will those Brothers w^ho govern the Craft seize this opportunity (in these I include all the Grand Lodges of our Empire and those of all our Allies) ? And I say such an opportunity for unity and the discussion of such world-wide problems which have now arisen may never occur again. Alas ! I am afraid we shall look in vain to those who govern the Craft and to whom we are told to look for guidance and direction ; we shall have to wait for more enlightened men — men who do not set their faces against the very laws they are 219"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY supposed to support and uphold.

That part of the Ritual alone is proof of what I have written. But Brothers are begin- ning to take more rational and comprehensive views of our Ritual. We are not, we cannot in the nature of evolution of things be, what our fathers were : we are no more like the men of one hundred years ago ; there is a change, and at present a very bloody change, taking place. This change does not end in nothing ; therefore see you guide that movement which you cannot stop. Fling wide the gates to that force which else will enter through the breach. Then will it still be, as it has been hitherto, the peculiar glory of our Constitution to add to our titles of glory the noblest and purest ethics of the attainment of universal peace. Men are apt to deride what they do not understand, and the ignorant, being aware of the weakness of their minds, condemn that which they ought most to venerate. And what is there to prevent the combination of a Universal Brotherhood who will say, '' There shall be no war now, or at any future time \" ? Nothing that could not be easily overcome.

Secondly, no Lodge shall admit any Brother who does not profess to believe in T.G.A.O.T.U., and no Lodge shall be included in the Uni- versal Brotherhood which does not acknowledge T,G.A.O.T.U. To do so would at once shatter the corner stone of the ver}^ foundation upon which the Brotherhood has been founded, and to which it owes its existence — not only now, but from its very inception 300,000 years ago. The very foundation of Masonry is the belief in T.G.A.O.T.U. and an after-life, which we know does exist ; if, therefore, materialists were admitted, the whole structure on which it has been built becomes a foundation of sand only. We at once do away with the Great Creator of All, and He would do away with us. It has been only because we have believed in Him and kept to His Divine Law that we have prospered and become again a Great Brotherhood. Therefore, if each country formed One Grand Lodge, holding jurisdiction and alliance over their Provincial or States Grand and other Lodges, it would not be difficult to arrange for all '' Grand Masters,\" with a certain number of G.O., to meet at given intervals and decide the best method of procedure.

It would be founded then as on the principles of the G.L. of England. If this union of the Brotherhood were accomplished, and I see no reason why it could not be quietly accomplished, it would be worth all the navies and armies in the world, and universal peace could be insisted on for all time. I have suggested this in many former articles in various papers and in my books, and it now rests with the Brotherhood throughout the world to achieve this great end and prevent such suffer- ing and horrors as are still being enacted and have been for the last four years. We see now the repetition of the destruction of Great Nations which have gone against the Divine Periodic Laws, and ours will follow rapidly in their wake if this is not altered. Russia will take a thousand years to recover her state of evolution. What a lesson to those who will learn and take heed of the Laws of Evolution ! Anarchy, murder, starvation, and all the horrors too numerous to write, and all caused by Socialism and Bureaucracy, and so the poor humanity of Russia will return to a dark and degenerate age, to begin again to climb the ladder of light, w^hich will take her a thousand years before she reaches the top. 222"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY Another difficulty may arise pro tern, from the cause of lack of knowledge to understand what true Freemasonry is, and all the duties that are incumbent upon the members of the Brother- hood. The majority of Freemasons know nothing really of what Freemasonry represents. To them it is a charitable Brotherhood, a kind of semi-religious social club. There are others, however, who are striving to learn and to know ; their conscience tells them that there is something more in this great, wonderful Brotherhood than charity and social club, which holds them together in one firm bond. Let them continue their studies. Light will be given them. But nothing comes to him w^ho does not w^ork and strive to gain know- ledge.

I tell you all, my Brothers, because after forty years of hard study I have been permitted to know and learn these Divine Truths, both as regards this material world and also the Divine Laws of the Spiritual and Everlasting State, and I therefore write for you the Truth. If the League of Nations be formed, thai will not prevent the repetition of the \"Great Horror'' in fifty or one hundred years hence, although it would be an excellent work and might have the desired effect for many years. But no guarantee as such \"an international combination ' could last one hundred years. The Treaty, and even the action, of the League would be treated as \"a scrap of paper \" or be broken, because the neces- sary cohesion of all nations could not exist so long on that alone. Greed arid other interests would overcome the weakest.

Our Laws have been laid down for us from the first, and these are God's Laws. There would always be the one great sacred tie for the life here and hereafter, for the good of all the Universal Brotherhood ; this would be an imperishable bond, with every link forged of the sacred \" Ba metal,\" unbreakable and untouchable as long as this world lasts. And how has Freemasonry grown within the last two hundred years ? One has to look back only to the 24th of June 171 7, when there met in the City of London an assembly of Freemasons, representing the membership of four Lodges, under the chairmanship of the oldest Freemason then present. The assembly organized itself into a Grand Lodge. Within ten years there was formed a Grand Lodge in Ireland, and within twenty one was formed in Scotland. All regular Masonic Lodges in the world have derived their authority directly or indirectly from one or other of these first three Grand Lodges. Freemasons now number over two millions through- out the world and are growing in number every year. What was Freemasonry, then, prior to this London Conference in 1717 ? It might be compared to little rivers all issuing from an underground \" Lake of Knowledge,\" the source of these little rivers being unknown, except 225 p"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY to a few, it being hidden away amongst im- penetrable forests and mountains. But the source, or \" Lake of the Waters of Know- ledge and of Truth,\" was there nevertheless ; that hitherto few had been able to explore these regions and find the Fount was because no one could read the Sign Posts of the Path. Well, Brothers, I have given you the position in latitude and longitude, and pictured before your eyes \" The Fount of all our Mysteries.\" Therefore, let no one imagine 1717 marks the origin of Freemasonry. There are authentic manuscript copies of old constitutions and charges which prove incontestably the existence of working Lodges as earty as the thirteenth century in this country. The so-called Regius Manuscript of the old charges in the British Museum is definitely known to date from the fourteenth century. Both this manuscript and the next oldest — the Cooke Manuscript, also in the British Museum, which palaeographers assign to the early years of the fifteenth century — speak of Freemasonry as having originated in Egypt and having been introduced into England in the reign of King Athelstane^ who reigned in the tenth century ; and, as I have stated and proved, both the Stellar and Solar Cult were established here thousands of years before that, the former having the Lesser Mysteries and the latter (the Druids) practising the Greater Mysteries. 226"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY Certainly, about two hundred years ago these rivers of \" Masonic influence \" rushed forth from their concealed sources into the light of day, and it is only by tracing these small rivers back along their \" meandering way \" mile by mile that I have been able to give you the position and origin of that \" Great Lake of Knowledge \" from which they issued, with absolute certainty. Now all should unite in one great river and amalgamate in the '' Pool of Universal Brother- hood \" to erect amidst the waters that \" Great Lighthouse \" which has been so long required to brighten the dark and turbulent sea of humanity, so that they may travel in their \" Barque of Life \" for ever in Peace and safety. Brothers, do not be deceived into thinking that cultivating a regular attendance at rehearsals, memorizing the Ritual, paying visits and feeling that by the degree of culture to be obtained through painstaking adherence to these practices you may hope not only to become famihar with the forms and routine of the Lodge, but also to be enabled with confidence to make a speech — is Freemasonry ; unfortunately, this, in brief, is the limit to be obtained according to the views of many Brothers, and also this is in accord- ance with the modern tendency to regard Free- masonry from an external standpoint, with the result that a false value is placed on perfection of ceremonial and individual adeptness.

There could be no Universal Brotherhood, because there would be elements antagonistic and false in the combination — false to its principles, false to its morality and false to their God — and in the end it would, as a whole, become destroyed again, and the remnants would be scattered over the face of earth and water with only a survival of the few, as it has been before.
