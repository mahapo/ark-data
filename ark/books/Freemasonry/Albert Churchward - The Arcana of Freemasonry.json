Some readers of The Freemason have taken objection to my statements, and I take this oppor- tunity, for the sake of Brothers throughout the world, of replying to those of my critics. As regards my chronology, it is something new to me to find a Brother state that the Pliocene Age cannot date as long ago as 600,000 years — all the best authori- ties that I know would place it much earlier. That I am not wrong in dating back the world's history to such great antiquity in my books is proved by the discovery of skelet jns of the present type of man, found in the Pliocene strata in Lombardy."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"viii INTRODUCTION It is important to remember that the skeletons found in this strata were of the modern type of man ; proofs that they were Stellar Cult people were found buried with them ; and that they lived and died at this period, and were not accidental burials, we have Professor Sergi's authority — a most unimpeachable one. The Pliocene strata were formed from 600,000 to 800,000 years ago. 1 Is any further proof necessary? In the Natural History Museum at South Kensington there is an exhibit of peculiar interest, the reconstructed skull of a primitive man, or woman, found by Mr. C. Dawson in a pit at Piltdown Common, Sussex, in the autumn of 191 2, on which Professor Wood- ward gave a most interesting lecture at the Royal Societies Club. In the discussion which followed I then pointed out that the reconstruction of the mandible must be quite wrong, for to put on to a skull with a cubic capacity of 1200 cubic centi- metres the jaw of a chimpanzee, is alone sufficient proof that the reconstruction made is incorrect. The Pygmy has a cubic capacity of 900 cubic centimetres, average, and I have found one with only 850 cubic centimetres. The highest anthro- poid ape is 600 cubic centimetres. This skull, in my opinion, was a Nilotic Negro of the first exodus without Hero-Cult, types of which still exist in Australia and inner Africa. 1 \"Genesis of Rocks,\" by Brenton Symois."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION ix The Stellar Cult existed for at least 300,000 years, and the people of this cult travelled all over Europe, Africa, most parts of Asia, America- North and South (except the extreme North and South), but did not go to Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and some other parts. The Lunar Cult followed this, and after that the Solar, which existed in some parts of Europe (although not in the extreme north), in Asia and Japan, but it did not reach the north of Japan. In America the Solar people reached Yucatan and travelled south as far as Peru ; they did not go to North America, the Pacific Islands, and only to the line of least resistance in South America, down the west side along the Andes. They were stopped at Bolivia by the fierce old Stellar Cult people from going farther south, as they were from going north of Yucatan by the North Mexican tribes. The art of recording ideas by signs and symbols came before the use of articulate speech. A sign does not demand a word, and may not imply the existence of a word. A sign or symbol was used to represent the thing first — an animal, or bird, or some object for which man had no articulate sound as yet. The articulate sound followed.

Hundreds of other examples could be given in support of this, which Professor Maspero acknowledges is correct. Then as regards the age of the signs and symbols, one friend asks \" for one that is more than a few thousand years old— as all that I have shown belong to comparatively recent times ! ' Well, it is difficult in fraternal words to answer this question ; some are over 300,000 years, and the earliest over a million years old. Perhaps I might suggest to my critics that they should study geology and anthropology before rushing into print on these subjects ; likewise I would point out that in studying Stellar Chronology the alphabet must be learnt before one tries to read. The alphabet as regards their time is this : there are seven Pole stars, each one represented symbolically as an eye at the time of its being the centre ; each takes a definite time in revolution before this is attained ; and each of these revolu- tions or times of revolution was divided up again by the old mystery teachers of Egypt. They did not worship the sun or the stars.

The meaning of my quoting the V.S.L. is not as a proof of history, but as a proof that even those who believe in the traditions, have traditional evidence that it was not, and is not, correct. As an authority, \" sacred historical documents \"—i.e. the V.S.L.— are, I contend, not historical at all- only traditions. Let us see what reliance can be placed on these traditions against documents still in existence ; one point only must suffice, because otherwise I should have to write a whole volume. Clement of Alexandria fixes the date of the Exodus, among other enumerations, by this state- ment : \" That it occurred 345 years before the ' Sothic Cycle: \" Now the Sothic Cycle was in existence before the time of Mena, over 4000 B.C., as borne out by \" Manetho and the Monuments,\" and was a cycle of 1,460 years with four years as intercalary. The Hyksos period of \" Shepherd Kings,\" or their reign at Memphis and Lower Egypt, was 2554 B.C., and when they left Egypt they built Jerusalem.

Others, on account of the Christian symbols that have been incorporated in the decorating of things pertaining to Masonry, follow the Swedish system, and say that the Essenes and the first Christians founded it. Others, again, make it originate in the building of Solomon's Temple ; many Jewish names, emblems, and legends, taken from the V.S.L., having found their way into the rites of Initiation and in several degrees. And still others state that it goes back to Adam ; ask why — they do not know. Thomas Payne and those of his school say that the Druids were the fathers of the Craft, they being supposed worshippers of the sun, moon, and stars, these jewels of the firmament being represented on the ceilings of the Masonic Temples. Dance of Villoison speaks of Herculanasum as its birthplace, because of the many similarities that existed between the Collegia of the Romans and the Lodges of the operative Masons of the Middle Ages.

When, in 1308, Jacques de Molay, then Grand Master of the Order, was preparing an expedition to avenge the wrongs and disasters suffered by the Christians in the East, the Pope, the only Sovereign Power to which, in the spiritual, the Templars owed allegiance, enticed him to France. On his arrival he was received with every mark of friendship ; but soon after the King caused him to be arrested, together with some other dignitaries, accusing them of the most heinous crimes, imputing to them the secret rites of their initiation. By order of the Archbishop of Sens and his provincial council, Jacques de Molay, Guy of Auvergne, and several other officers were burned alive on 18th March, 13 14. The Pope, by a Bull, dated the 2nd of April, and published on the 2nd of May, 1 3 1 2, that he issued on his own responsibility — the Council of Vienne, in Dauphine, being adverse to hasty measures — declared the Order abolished throughout the world.

They assumed the title of Knights of Christ, which the order still bears. Jacques de Molay, before his death, had appointed Johan Marcus Larmenio as his successor to the office of Grand Master. The Knights who, fleeing from the persecution, had taken refuge in Scot- land at the Court of King Robert Bruce, refused to recognize his authority ; and pretending to re- establish the Order of the Temple, under the allegory and title of Architects, protected by the King, laid the foundation of the Order of Free and Accepted Masons of the Scottish Rite, in 13 14. The new society soon forgot the meaning of the execratory oath that the members were obliged to take at their initiation ; the death of Clement V, of Philippe le Bel, of the accusers and enemies of Jacques de Molay, and the other Knights who had been executed, having removed the object of their vengeance. Still they continued to decorate their Lodges with tokens commemorative of the death of the Grand Master, and to impose on all new members the obligation of avenging it, which they signified by striking with an unsheathed dagger at unseen beings, his supposed murderers. This allegory is well known to the Knights of Kadosh. A century had scarcely elapsed when this idea was abandoned — the founders and their disciples having passed away, their successors saw only allegories in the Symbols of the Order — and the extensive use"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 5 of words and texts taken from the Bible was intro- duced. The enemies of Cromwell and of the Republic, having in view the re-establishment of the monarchy, created the Degree of Grand Master to prepare the minds of the masses for that event. King William III was initiated. Masonry, says Preston, was very much neglected as early as the reign of James II, and even after this period it made but slow progress until 1 7 1 4, when King George I ascended the throne. Three years later, in February, 1 7 1 7, the first Grand Lodge was established in London. A committee from the four Lodges then existing in that city met at the tavern of the \" Apple Tree,\" and nominated Anthony Sayer, who was elected Grand Master on the 24th of the following June, the day of St. John the Baptist, and for that reason St. John was selected as the patron of the Order. This origin of the Craft is credited by many authorities on the subject. They found their opinion on the fact that many of the ceremonies practised by the \"Architects\" are still observed among Masons, and that the Grand Lodge pre- served the fundamental laws, together with the spirit of the ancient Brotherhood.

Pope Clement XII, on the 28th of April of that year, caused a prohibitory Bull to be issued against Freemasons, entitled \" In Eminenti,\" in which he excommunicated all Masons ; and the Cardinal Vicar of Rome, by edict, in the name of the High Priest of the God of Peace and Mercy, decreed the penalty of death against them in 1739; and in May, 175 1, Pope Benoit XIV renewed the Bull of Clement XII by another, beginning with these words : \" Providas Roman- orum Pontificum.\" Lodges were established in France in 1725, and on the 14th September, 1732, all Masonic Asso- ciations were prohibited by the Chamber of Police of the Chatelet of Paris. In 1727 Lord Coleraine founded a Lodge in Gibraltar, and in the succeeding year in Madrid, the capital of Spain, the stronghold of the Inquisition. In 1740, in consequence of the Bull of Clement XII, King Philip V of Spain promulgated an order against Masons in his kingdom, many of whom were arrested and sent to the galleys.

They caused them to be loaded with chains, to be obliged to row in the galleys, with a scanty supply of food of the poorest quality, but plenty of bastinado. King Fernando VI renewed the ordinance on 2nd July, 1 7 5 1, making Masonry high treason. In 1735 a Lodge was established at Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, by some of the descen- dants of the Knights Templar who fled there, under the title of \"Knights of Christ.\" These have kept alive the ancient Order in defiance of the Pope's Bulls. In .1730 a great many Germans were initiated in England. In 1733 the Grand Master, Lord Strathmore, authorized eleven of the Brotherhood to open the Hamburg Lodge. In 1740 B. Putt- man, of the Hamburg Lodge, received a Patent of Provincial Grand Master from England, and the Lodge assumed the title of Absalom. King Frederick II, who had been initiated when Crown Prince of Prussia, continued to give support, and assumed the title of \" Grand Master Universal, and Conservator of the Most Ancient and Most Respectable Association of Ancient Freemasons or Architects of Scotland.\" He cemented together again the Order which had become scattered, so far as he was able, and signed the Constitution in his Palace, at Berlin, 1st May, 1786, saving Free- masonry from annihilation in Germany."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"8 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY In 1732 we find the first Lodge in America; it was held in the \" Tun Tavern \" in Philadelphia, the brethren having previously met in Boston, which may be regarded as the birthplace of American Freemasonry. Henry Price was the first Provincial Grand Master appointed by the Grand Lodge of England on 30th April, 1733. It was established in Italy in the same year. In 1735 tne Grand Duke Francis of Lorraine was initiated. He protected the Masons, and the Craft flourished in Italy until 1737, when Juan Gascon of Medicis, Grand Duke of Tuscany, issued a decree of prohibition against it. Soon after his death, which occurred the same year, the Lodges which had been closed were reopened. It was not long, however, before they were denounced to Pope Clement XII, who issued his Bull of 28th April, 1738, and sent an inquisitor to Florence, who caused various members of the Society to be cast into dungeons. They were set at liberty as soon as Francis of Lorraine became Grand Duke of Tuscany. He not only protected the Masons, but founded lodges in Florence and other places on his estates. G. Findel was a great advocate that Free- masonry was not derived from the mysteries of the ancients ; he says : \" Seeing that the ancient symbolical marks and ceremonies in the Lodges bear very striking resemblance to those of the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 9 mysteries of the ancients, some have allowed them- selves to be deceived, and led others astray, imagining they can trace back the history of the Craft into the cloudy mist of antiquity ; instead of endeavouring to ascertain how and when these ceremonies were introduced into our present system, they have taken it for granted that they were derived from the religious mysteries of the ancients.\" Now I propose to trace these mysteries, for the information of the Brotherhood throughout the world. \"The cloudy mists of antiquity\" may no longer remain ; within the past few years we have dis- covered how to decipher and read the ancient writings on the walls of old ruined temples and cities in Africa, Asia, and North, Central, and South America, as well as the ancient writings on papyri, and these give the key to unlock the mysteries of the past and reveal the origin of our Signs, Symbols, and Rituals ; and these I trace back to Ancient Egypt, and in no other part of the world can the origins be found. If we take the theory propounded by Krause, what do we find? He has endeavoured to prove that Freemasonry \"originated\" in the association of operative Masons, who, in the Middle Ages, .travelled through Europe, and by whom the Cathedrals and Monasteries were built. But the .* w"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"10 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY secrets these operative Masons had were received from the Chaldean Magicians. These Chaldean or Turanian Priests were the working or operative Masons of the old Egyptian Stellar Mythos Cult, from the seventeenth Nome of Upper Egypt, and were styled Companions (see Ritual). 1 They were initiated in the first and second degree only of the old Egyptian Cult, because they, and they alone, were employed to look after the building of the Temples and keep the secrets of the same. These Turanians, who were called \" Com- panions \" in Egyptian, only knew the secrets of two of the degrees out of the Seven Primary Mysteries, which were Astro-Mythological. We ordinary Masons, M.M. and up to P.Z., only have these Seven Mysteries. The Greater Mysteries belonging to the Egyptian Eschatology were ten in number. If we trace these old Turanians (operatives) back to Egypt, we find them well established at the commencement of the Stellar Cult — but it is possible to trace them farther back than this, even to Early Totemic Sociology. In Africa, at the present day, there exist some of the Nilotic Negroes, descendants of those who first formed the \" Nomes \" in Egypt ; those who formed the seventeenth Nome are now \"the Elgunono.\" 1 By the word \" Ritual \" used I allude to the Ritual of Ancient Egypt, the so-called Book of the Dead."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 11 These tribes still, at the present time, are mostly formed into a \" secret brotherhood,\" and by some are called the Blacksmiths. \" Horus-Behutet,\" the first worker in metals, is their chief or head Deity ; our word T.C. is thus a substituted word. Their chief priest is called Ol-Aibon, and they still have many of the primary Symbols and Signs we use. These, with the Madi (who were the first builders) and Masai, ultimately all settled in Egypt and formed the early Stellar Mythos people. An early exodus from these tribes, to other parts of the world, was made by the old Turanians. The Stellar Cult existed for at least three hundred thousand years, as witnessed by records found and still extant. These people travelled and went out over Europe, Asia, part of North and South America, Central America, and the Islands of the Pacific, as well as Africa. The remains and ruins of the large cities and Temples found throughout the world were mostly built by these people. The Solar, who came after, built some, but the buildings of each are easily distinguished one from the other. The former were iconographic, the latter were not. They worked out all the revolutions of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and the Ritual of Ancient Egypt upon which all doctrines throughout the world have been founded. So that for the oldest records of our Brotherhood we have to go back as far as Totemic Sociology over six hundred thousand"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"12 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY years. This is proved by the fact that skeletons of Stellar Mythos people were found in Lombardy in the Pliocene strata — and the above is a low estimate for that. Now we find from these old Temples that all our Signs and Symbols were in use then just as we use them now ; there is no difference, except that in some cases we have slightly modernised them. Their Rituals, with slight modifications, were the same as ours. Here we see Krause's theory not without some semblance of plausibility, as Rome, during several centuries, held sway over Gaul and Britain. Roman colonists settled in various parts of these countries, and with their language and customs they imported many of their institutions and associations. That of the Builders, or Collegia, held their Lodges wherever they established them- selves, and no doubt initiated new members, and as these countries freed themselves from the yoke of Rome the associations would still remain. But they at best were only carriers of the \" operative masons \" — Egypt was their birthplace, and we can identify the Nome as the seventeenth Nome from the Ritual, these names, for instance, \" Com- panions \" — carried out of Egypt by the Turanians, who spread over Europe ; Asia, except the North ; lower part of North America, Central America, South America, as far down as Chili, in the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 13 Caroline Islands of the Pacific — but not in North Asia, Australia, Tasmania, or extreme North America. Chevalier Ramsay stated that modern Masonry had its beginning in the Society of Architects founded in Scotland under the protection of King Robert Bruce, and the title of \" Ancient and Accepted Masons of the Scottish Rite ' may possibly have been formed in Scotland there and then ; but, if that is so, we must trace the origin of this to the Order of Knights Templar, who fled to Scotland, and through them to the Ancient Mysteries practised in the East. From whence did these Templars obtain them? It is well known that one of the charges made against Jacques de Molay and his associates by their accusers was that \" they used sacred rites in their initiations.\" Their four oaths are well known, but who knew their rites of initiation? The aim of the Society of Archi- tects was to perpetuate the ancient Order of the Temple, and they continued to use their initiations of members, symbols, signs, and some parts of the initiatory rites, which had been obtained in the East, but they only knew three degrees out of the seven less^ and ten greater. The next question is : From whence did the Templars receive those symbols, and their esoteric meaning, in which we plainly trace the doctrines of the old Egyptians? No doubt from the Christians, who, like the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"14 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Emperor Julian, the Bishop of Synnesius, Clement of Alexandria, and many other philosophers, had been initiated into some of the mysteries by the Priests of Egypt before being converted to Chris- tianity. In this way may be traced how part of the religious mysteries of Egypt, signs and symbols, etc., came to Scotland. We must remember that the mysteries practised by the Samothracia, Greeks, Romans, Pythago- reans, the mysteries of Eleusis, the mysteries estab- lished by Zoroaster, and the Mahatmas, or Brothers of India, all took their origin from the Egyptian Eschatology. We see also from the above how, in one way, the so-called Higher Degrees (The Ten Greater Mysteries) were introduced here in Britain. The reluctance of the Egyptians to admit strangers to the holy secret of their mysteries was for a very long time insuperable. They, however, at intervals, admitted to the first and second degrees personages noted for their wisdom and knowledge. They admitted the great philosopher Thales, who went to Egypt to learn Geometry and Astronomy about 587 B.C., and Zoroaster 5000 B.C. Another was Eumolpus, King of Eleusis, who, on returning to his country, instituted the mysteries of that name, which he had learnt from the Priests of Egypt. Orpheus, the Greek poet, was also initiated into the first degree. Pythagoras"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 15 was initiated, but had not the courage to go through to the third degree, only the first and second. The Pelasgians had initiated to the first and second degrees the Samothracia. These Pelasgians obtained their knowledge from the Egyptian Priests direct. As regards the origin from the Druids. I have given in \" Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man \" the proofs of the origin of the Druids, and where they came from. They were High Priests of Egypt, who left the mother country at the early part of the Solar Cult, and were therefore well versed both in the seven Lesser Mysteries and the ten Greater Mysteries ; and these practised their religious rites in England until the edict of Canute prohibited their open worship. Canute reigned from 1015 to 1036. To evade persecu- tion they resorted to private meetings and secret celebrations. I do not entertain any doubt that they formed the first so-called \" Lodges ' in England, as a cloak to screen their religious rites and ceremonies, and to keep them as pure as they had received them originally from their parent sources in Egypt. Many of these old Druid Priests joined the Christian Church, and were the so-called Culdees, but although they had joined the Christian Church they kept themselves very much aloof for a long period, up to the twelfth century."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"16 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY These were the last remnants of the old Druid Priests — descendants of their Egyptian brethren — who practised the pure Eschatology of their fore- fathers. Gradually they all died out as a separate and distinct class, and those who remained were merged into Christianity ; but up to the twelfth century at least they brought all their doctrines with them, and practised them in secret places, in so-called Lodges. Here we have one source of the origin of Free- masonry, both in the Lesser Mysteries (seven Degrees) and in the ten Greater Mysteries — so- called Higher Degrees in this country. The Druids, in Gaul, were mostly put to the sword, others fled to this country for protection, when the Roman Christian doctrines were brought to them. In America it was the same. As soon as the Spanish Roman Priests arrived there they persecuted all the Solar and Stellar people, mur- dered their priests, overthrew their Temples, and scattered them with fire and sword. Yet there is sufficient evidence left in their Signs, Symbols, and writings on the wall which prove my contention that all these had the same Eschatology, signs, symbols, and rites as the Old Egyptians, from whence they came, and that all these are analogous to our own with really very little innovation, con- sidering the many thousands of years that these have been handed down from country to country,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 17 and generation to generation, as we must acknow- ledge to have been the case if we study the history of the human past. There were also many who crossed over to Europe from Egypt, and spread from Italy into France, who possessed and clung to the true doctrines, endured torture, and some even death, by the early Roman Priests, who tried to usurp the temporal power by destroying the spiritual ideas ; and yet these brothers would rather suffer death than give up their secrets and beliefs. Many of these migrations can be traced through Europe and finally to Scotland. « We must also remember that from the down- fall of the old Egyptian Empire, up to within the last few hundred years, we have possessed no readable records of the past history of man- kind. Our History of the World is quite recent, all the rest is tradition only. Therefore, if you do not read the Hieroglyphics and Glyphs, \" The Writings on the Wall,\" you still remain in ignorance of the history of the human race, and of the origin and antiquity of Freemasonry.

The oldest, and much the strongest, was founded at the Apple Tree Tavern, Charles Street, Covent Garden, London, in 17 17. Members of it traced their origin to an assemblage of Freemasons by King Athelstan at York, in a.d. 926. The Scotch Lodges did not go back nearly so far. They were content to claim descent from those foreign Masons who came to their country in the twelfth century to build the abbeys of Melrose, Holy- rood, and Kilwinning, and there is abundant evidence that the Lodges of York and Kilwinning were the parents of many Lodges founded in is L ?."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"TEE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 21 various parts of Great Britain. The Brethren of York, conscious that their city was the Mecca of Freemasonry, and believing that their Time Imme- morial Lodge was a direct descendant of that which was existing in the fourteenth century, de- termined that they would not be behind those of London, and in 1725 formed the Grand Lodge of All England. Despite its ambitious title, it had a very chequered career down to the last decade of the eighteenth century. About 1740 it, as did also the private York Lodge, became dormant. Both were revived in 1761, but there is no evidence of their existence after 1792. That Grand Lodge confined its activities within a limited area of \"All England.\" Under its banner were two Lodges in the City of York, one each in Scarborough, Ripon, Knaresborough, Hovingham, Swainton, and Rotherham, in Yorkshire ; one in Macclesfield, Cheshire ; and one in Hollingwood, Lancashire. The Grand Lodge of All England also chartered at York the Grand Lodge of England south of the River Trent in 1779. It consisted of discontented members of the Time Immemorial Lodge of Antiquity, of the Premier Grand Lodge (of which Sir Christopher Wren in its day was the Grand Master), and it granted warrants to only two Lodges, both in London.

It was con- stituted on July 17th, 1 75 1, at the Turk's Head Tavern, Greek Street, Soho, London, as \" The Grand Lodge of England, according to the Old Institutions.\" Its members were designated \"Ancients,\" while those of the body from which it had seceded were known as ' Moderns.\" The \" Ancients ' were also spoken of as \" Athol Masons,\" they having elected the third Duke of Athol as their first Grand Master in 1772, his son succeeding to the office at his death. Two reasons are offered for the founding of the new Grand Lodge. One is that the Regular Grand Lodge adopted severe measures against recalci- trant and impecunious Lodges. The other is that it introduced innovations in the customs of the Craft which were particularly objected to by the operative section. \"The new body,\" wrote the late Bro. W. J.

In 1 80 1 the older Grand Lodge issued a counter- blast. Some of its members were convicted of having patronized and acted as principal officers in \"an irregular society calling themselves Ancient Masons, in open violation of the laws of the Grand Lodge \" ; and it was determined that the laws should be enforced against these offending Brethren, unless they immediately abandoned such irregular meetings. These Brethren solicited the indulgence of the Grand Lodge for three months, hoping that during the interval they might be able to effect a union between the two societies. The indulgence was granted, and \" that no impediment might pervert so desirable an object, the charge against the offending Brethren was withdrawn, and a committee, consisting of Lord Moira and several other eminent characters, was appointed to pave the way for the intended union, and every means ordered to be used to bring the erring Brethren to a sense of their duty and allegiance.\" Nothing came of this, for two years later the Grand Lodge was informed \" that the irregular Masons still continued refractory, and that so far from soliciting readmission among the Craft, they had not taken any steps to effect a"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 25 union.\" Their conduct was deemed highly censur- able, and the laws of the Grand Lodge were ordered to be enforced against them.

LORD MOIRA'S EFFORTS In 1806 Lord Moira reported to Grand Lodge that he had visited the Grand Lodge of Scotland and explained the position relating to the \" Modern \" and \" Ancient \" Masons in England, and that the Scottish Brethren had declared that they had been always led to think that the \" Moderns \" were of very recent date and of no magnitude, and being convinced of their error were"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"26 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY desirous that the strictest union should subsist between the Grand Lodge of England and Scot- land, and in proof thereof elected the Prince of Wales Grand Master of Scotland.

Two years afterwards the Grand Lodge of Ireland approved the declaration of their Scottish Brethren, and pledged itself \" not to countenance or receive as a Brother any person standing under the interdict of the Grand Lodge of England for Masonic transgression.\" In April, 1809, the Grand Lodge agreed in opinion with the Committee of Charity that \"it is not neces- sary any longer for to continue in force those measures which were resorted to in or about the year 1789 respecting irregular Masons, and do therefore enjoin the several Lodges to revert to the ancient landmarks of the Society.\" This was accepted as a step towards the much desired union.

The Solar Cult and the Christian Cult, which have followed one another, have not in either case altered the tale, it is all one and the same from the beginning ; that names have altered is nothing, different languages have different names for the same idea, and because the attributes of the One Great God were expressed in \" Zootype form\" during the Stellar Cult, and \"Gods and Goddesses \" in the Solar, whilst at the present day"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 39 these are expressed in words, does not alter the meaning, ideas, or beliefs ; these are only altered and misunderstood by men who cannot read and understand \"The Writings on the Walls\"; and as regards dates, few, I believe, now would even think or believe that man has only existed about six thousand years, as assumed from Biblical tradition, when we find the skeletons of the present type of man in strata of the Pliocene age, six hundred thousand years old at least. 1 Therefore whatever Cult our Brothers may have belief in, the knowledge of the evolution of the human race would only be a greater factor to strengthen their belief. If we take the Chinese, and there are many Brothers amongst them, we know that they went out from Egypt during the Stellar Cult, and they have never risen in evolution since. The Hindu left at the time of the Solar Cult ; he has always remained the same. The white race, generally, left at the end of the Solar. The early Copts were the first of the Christians in evolution, and the white man has gradually developed into a higher type of the human. With this development into a higher type of man, so his spiritual ideas have developed into a so-called higher type of Chris- tianity than that which we find at the commence- ment of the time of the early Copts.

At the present day these are represented by the Celestial and Terrestrial Globes. Now this was the form of every Temple through- out the world, and at the porchway entrance these two Columns always stood ; in whatever country these ruins are found the form is the same ; it is also the correct form of a Masonic Lodge, and, as is well known, these two Columns stood at the porchway entrance of King Solomon's Temple and bore the names of J. and B. These two Pillars, in Egypt, were placed at the porchway of all Temples in the Solar Cult to repre- sent the entrance of their Amenta ; one was called Tatt, the other Tattu. The word Tattu also denotes the two Tatt Pillars. The Tatt is a figure of stability ; it supports the four corners, and is equal to the Square. Thus two Tatts at the entrance to Tattu is equivalent to a Double Square. Tattu is the entrance or gateway to the region where the mortal Soul is blended with the Immortal Spirit, and thereby established for ever. According to the Egyptian wisdom all these Temples were simply representatives, so to speak, of their Heaven.

The one outside the door was called the Watcher ; the one inside the door was called the Herald, as seen in the Veginetta. The Egyptian initiatory ceremony was conducted with great secrecy and care. The candidates were divested of most of their clothing, and a chain, or rope of some kind, placed around their neck, to signify their belief in God, their dependence on Him, and their solemn obligations to submit and devote themselves to His will and service. The fact that they were neither naked nor clothed was an emblem that they were untutored men, children of nature, unregenerate, and destitute of any knowledge of the true God, as well as being destitute of the comforts of life. The chain or rope was a symbol that the candidate was being led from darkness to light, from ignorance to a knowledge of the One True and Living God, Creator, and Judge of all things in Heaven and Earth.

The old Brothers of Egypt wore leather aprons, as do Freemasons of to-day, only of a different shape. The Egyptian apron was triangular, the strings or sash being fixed at the apex. They also wore collars. One apron, which I have seen, was that of the High Priest. It was yellowish- white in colour, made of leather, with tassels of gold, bearing the name of Amsu with an emerald stone in the centre. The collars worn by the High Priests were of gold, while another sus- pended collar bore twelve different stones, set in gold, representing the twelve divisions of Heaven, or the Signs of the Zodiac. As there were various degrees — seven in the Lesser Mysteries and ten in the Greater Mysteries — so the aprons and collars varied in colour and ornamentation as they do with modern Masonry. The G.W. in our thirtieth degree, as now given, and which we are informed is to be found in Maccabees (but that is not so), is, in Egyptian, \" Montu-anhuri,\" the meaning of both the ancient and modern word being identical.

It was first used in the time of the Totemic Soci- ology, before the Stellar Cult was evolved, which we may term Monumental times. Egypt was first divided into Nomes or Domains ; one of these Nomes was called Aria — the land of the Ari. It was the seventeenth Nome of Upper Egypt, and the only one which supplied workmen for the Temples. These Ari were styled \" Companions,\" because they worked in Companies, and were initiated in the first and second degrees, and these were the originals of the \" Operative Masons.\" None of them were initiated beyond the third mystery, and they were quite a distinct class from the \" Old Religious Brotherhood,\" who employed them to build their Temples and initiated them so that they should keep the secrets of the same. A body of these left Egypt at the time of the Stellar Cult and travelled throughout the world wherever the Stellar Priests went ; the first exodus was by the Botyia, the next by the Turanians. A Priest who was initiated into the third always accompanied them, though he was not an Operative himself. The buildings of these old Stellar people can always be identified in whatever part of the world found. These were always iconographic, which the people who followed did not copy. Both the Stellar and Solar built in polygonal and monolithic forms, stones, but the Solar was never iconographic."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 53 One of the earliest Ideographs for Set, El Shaddai, and Horus were the two Eyes (see Fig. 13), symbols of the two Pole Stars, North and South, originating at Apta, or at the Mount of the Equinox — Equatorial Africa. Another Ideograph was the two Poles — the Pole or Pillar of the South, assigned to Set, and the Pillar or Pole of the North, assigned to Horus (Fig. 15), the two Tatt Pillars.

The reason why the Operative Masons have gone wrong in this part of their ritual is that they have mixed up the Gods of the four quarters with the One Great God. These only represented attributes ; and they have also mixed up the God of the Pole Star South, El Shaddai, with the God of the Pole Star North, which was Horus, or Ihuh, of Israel, or Iu, Ea, of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, and Babylonians, which is later than the Sumarian"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"54 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY El Shaddai of the Egyptian Set.

That the Operative Masons have seven so-called degrees now is because they have converted their Initiate, Apprentice, and Master's degrees into seven ; but this is of quite a comparatively recent date. The Initiates and Apprentices were called \" Companions,\" and a few of the higher class were \"Masters.\" Bro. Dr. Carr has stated that the reasons for much of the Speculative Cere- monies can be seen in the Operative Rituals, while the Operative Ceremonies get no elucidation from the Speculative Ritual, and he specially draws attention to the obligation in the First Degree. The reason for this is obvious. The Operative Masons or \" Companions \" were initiated in part of the old Ceremonies and Rituals only, so that they were bound by Oath to keep the secrets of, and know the reasons for, the peculiar and dis- tinctive construction of the old Temples, and they never violated their obligations ; but the Operative Masons have no Esoteric Eschatological rites at all. These were never taught them, yet these"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 55 existed before the Operatives — when the old Temples were formed by a simple double circle of stones, twelve in number for each, surrounded by bushes. Thus a Brother who understands and knows all the ten Greater Mysteries, knows and understands all the Operative Masons' work, whilst the latter are completely ignorant as to the former. But the Operative Masons' origin dates back at least six hundred thousand years, and so I have no doubt they will be contented with their great antiquity. The proofs of all my contentions are in the Ritual of Ancient Egypt, and on the various monuments ; these I shall always be pleased to identify and point out to any Brother who may feel interested in this subject. The Operative Masons, like the Speculative, have made many \"innovations\" since they left Old Mother Egypt, but this is not surprising considering all the vicis- situdes they have passed through ; the wonder is that so much remains of the original, and that so little innovation has taken place after all these years, remembering the trials and tribulations they have endured. Our 24-inch gauge is the old cubit of the ancient Egyptians. It is the ideographic hieroglyphic, and has the phonetic value of Maat, and indicated, primarily, \" that which is straight,\" and was the name given to the instrument by which the work of the \" Craftsmen \" was kept straight and *"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"56 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY measured ; metaphorically, a rule, or law, or canon, by which the lives of men and their actions were kept straight and governed.

The British inch was the unit of linear measure- ment used at the building of the Great Pyramid, or at least it is the nearest standard in existence, as it has lost one one-thousandth part of itself after being carried from land to land all these thousands of years. There is, therefore, more in it than being an instrument to \"measure our work \" and being \"symbolical of time.\" One inch is the time representation of the Great Year prophetically. Five hundred millions of the Pyramid inch is the length of the earth's Polar diameter. Twenty- five inches give the length of the Sacred Cubit, 5 X 5 = 25 angles of the Pyramid. The absolute length of the Sacred Cubit is the same used by the Israelites and spoken of in the V.S.L. as the one ordained by God, and was brought out of Egypt by Moses, who, being one of the High Priests of On, knew and understood the Mysteries and Secrets of the Great Pyramid and the Sacred Doctrines. It was different in length to that of the Greek, Roman, and latter-day Egyptian Cubit."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 57 Freemasons, perhaps, unknown to most of them- selves, have been the custodians of the secrets connected with it from the original, through ages of time. Thus we see that the standard and unit of linear measurement, used at the building of the Great Pyramid (during the Stellar Cult), from which the British inch was derived in primeval days of purity and Eschatological worship, before the people fell away from their true doctrines, has been handed down by us pure and unsullied. The Incas, Mayas, and all the Old Stellar Cult people before them, possessed and used this same measure. The great attempt of the French people to abolish alike the Christian religion and hereditary weights and measures of all nations ; to replace the former by worship of philosophy, and the latter by the metre (the French metre scheme depending, in a certain manner of their own, upon the magnitude of the earth), is not very old, nor yet an improve- ment upon the exactness in measurement of these Egyptian people ; because, by assuming as their unit and standard of length, the one ten-millionth of a \"quadrant of the earth's surface,\" that took a curved line drawn on the earth's surface, in place . of the straight axis of rotation, it could not be so exact, and, in fact, is far inferior in measurement.

Thus we see that this symbol has a great claim upon our attention, and we have to return to the Egyptians of the Stellar Cult for its origin. The origin of the Blazing Star was the Egyptian ' Sothos,\" and is shown in Zootype form as Anubis, who guided the souls through the Under- world, and its allusion as the Star which guided the Wise Men is a recent version of the old (see Ritual). In another form, as \" The Bright Morning Star \" — the Star with eight rays — it represents Horus of the resurrection. It was typified by Orion, the eightfold one, the highest of the seven, with the essence of these to make One — The One, therefore eight. In Revelation the Son of God promises to give the Morning Star to him that overcometh ; \"as I also have received of my Father ; and I will give Him the Morning Star \" (Rev. ii. 28). The Morning Star was equally identified with Horus ; \"I know the power of the East ; Horus of the Solar Mount ; the Calf in the presence of God ; and the Star of Dawn \" (Ritual, Ch. cix.). Henceforth the Morning Star"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 59 was given to the followers of Horus, therefore, we, as descendants of the original brothers and followers of Horus, still retain the symbol.

In one representation in the Egyptian he is seen with the Star on his head, beckoning on his followers. The Masonic Square is depicted in many of the Ancient Temples, and also in the Great Pyramid. In the Egyptian Hall of Judgment Osiris is seated on the Square whilst judging the dead. It is also portrayed as the corner-stone of the building, and as the Foundation of Eternal Law in the Court of Divine Justice. The Egyptian name of it is Neka. It was first employed in squaring the stones of the builders, and symbolically in squaring the conduct in the sphere of morals of the Brotherhood. Maat is also depicted as sitting on the Square. Thus we have this symbol bearing the same interpretation as in Masonry. Among the Egyptians, when it was employed in squaring the stones of the builder, it denoted Creation accord- ing to Eternal Laws or understanding rules, it was the seat of Justice, and of judging right from wrong, \" To bring the material into perfect form and to reject that which was not perfect, both physically and morally.\" To build on the Square"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"60 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY as a fourfold foundation, is to build for ever.

The twelve Camps and the twelve Banners of the Children of Israel represent the original characters in their Astronomical Mythology, and were given first to the twelve Thrones or divisions of Heaven in the Stellar Cult, and in the Zodiac, in the final. Thus at first they represented twelve Stellar powers, and around many Temples we find these twelve depicted by Pillars of Stone.

These were the Kamite originals, brought over and converted into the Banners of the twelve Camps or Tribes of Israel. The four principal Banners in the R.A.C. took their origin from the four Brothers, or Children of Horus.

Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge, in 'The Gods of the Egyptians,\" page 485, states : 'It is, of course, impossible to say who were the ' blacksmiths ' that swept over Egypt from South to North, or where they came from,\" but believes ' that they represent the invaders in predynastic times, who made their way into Egypt from a country in the East, by way of the Red Sea, and by some road across the eastern desert— that is, through the Wadi Hammamat. They brought with them the knowledge of working in metals and of brick-making, and having conquered the indigenous people in the South— i.e., those round about Edfu— they made that city the centre of their civilization, and then proceeded to conquer and occupy other sites and to establish sanctuaries for their God.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"62 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY But I have proved that man originated in Africa and not Asia (\" Origin and Evolution of Primi- tive Man \"), and these came up from the South — Nilotic Negroes, the Kaverondo tribes.

They came up from the South to the North in predynastic times, and, having conquered the Masaba Negroes and lower types of Nilotic Negroes, who were then the inhabitants of the land of Egypt, established themselves in Egypt, making Edfu their chief city and centre. The Egyptians called these \" followers of Horus \" Mesnitu, or Mesniti, which, I believe, was the original name for all their tribes, and which may now be applied to the Masai Group. As we know, Horus was their deified God, and as Edfu became their centre, he was styled \" Lord of the Forge City,\" \" The Great Master Blacksmith.\" It was here that they first built a sanctuary or temple, which was called Mesnet.

Many other words which we have adopted have no relation or meaning to the originals. But the meaning of the mysteries could only be known whilst the genuine gnosis was authentically taught. This had ceased when the Christian Sarcolatry Jiteralized the mystic drama of Amenta, the Earth of Eternity, as a more tangible-looking human history and a new revelation sent from God. Yet it is at least six hundred thousand years old. From these mysteries the ceremonies of the Masonic Brotherhood have been handed down from generation to generation ; re-edited and altered only to conform with our present ideas — as, for instance, the statement : \" The six periods of the world's existence, now about to close with the second advent, when time shall be swallowed up in Eternity,\" has no meaning, nor has it any significance in its present form. The Great Pyramid of Egypt and Stellar Cult"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 65 explain the Mystery.

As a type the Eye might be full, once a month, once a quarter, once a year, once in a thousand years ; in 2,155 years ; 3,716 years, or in the Great Eye of All — The Eye of the Eternal once in 25,827 years (Ritual, Ch. cxl.-cxiv.). The submergence of seven Pole Stars involved the same number of ^luges, and marked the periods of the world's existence in the Cycle of Precession, which culminated in the great deluge of all, not to be swallowed up in Eternity, but to recommence again (only to be swallowed up in Eternity when the Pole Stars cease to exist). The Mystery of the seven Circles is the same as the Mystery of the seven Stars of Revelation ; it is the Mystery of the Celestial Heptanomes in the Stellar Cult of the old Egyptians.

Without a knowledge of the past there cannot be any guide to the future. The present and continuous thought of our Brotherhood, as well as of others amongst the majority, is one of selfi, and great indifference to the feelings and welfare of others, except when it specially affects them- selves, and it is here we have the Second Cause.— Those of the Craft who are striving to bring about that high ideal of brother- hood to be a reality, and not a sham, are not supported with that fraternal activity which is so desirable.

The men of the various Governments all the world over think nothing of the true benefit of the human race ; with them it is party politics, a repetition of self, position, and aggrandisement, to be obtained at any cost. Possibly, if they have ever studied the rise and fall of nations, they may be conceited enough to try and abase their thoughts and obliterate their better-thinking powers, and so, deceiving themselves, make them- selves believe that they cannot, or will not, fall into the same evils which have followed every nation that has entered on a similar course. Vain, ignorant, and foolish thoughts and actions, opposed to the divine laws of nature, can only have one result and termination. In the past history of the world there are two causes only, or primary factors, which paved the way for the downfall and destruction of every empire.

The Pillar of Red Brick, being less permanent, went down as predicted in the deluge as a figure of the Southern Pole, whereas the Pillar of Stone (North Great Pyramid) remained for ever as an image of the Celestial Pole, or of Annu, the Site of the Pillar, in their astronomical mythology.

Set or Sut, according to Plutarch, is the Egyptian name of Typhon — i.e. Satan of the Christian Cult. On the oldest monuments it has been almost invariably chiselled out ; we find the names of kings who have taken his name, in the same manner as we after- wards find the Horus name.

The fact that we find Sut here as one of the great Gods, is a proof that he was considered and looked upon at the earliest period of their mythology as at least a brother to Horus, and that now Horus was primary. The myth had shifted, or changed places, the domain of Paradise from the South to the North, and the great fight between Horus and Sut had not yet come into being. There can be no doubt that the primary part of the Mythos was first evolved at the Lakes at the head of the Nile when the Southern Pole Star was most predominant. The different names of Set taken by Kings which we find on the oldest monuments, some of which have been obliterated and Horus and Osiris sub- stituted, prove this, as well as the Pyramids and the Ritual. On later monuments we find that the great contest had been worked out in their myth- ology, and his name is then found Apap (the Great Giant, the Great Evil Serpent).

It was at the South. Mr. Don Covington discovered this \" let-in-stone,\" clearly incised in the dressed surface. It was the full tenth part of an eighteen- inch diameter circle ; it had been let into a south flank casing stone at a place from which another inscription had been chiselled out. This shows that the Pyramid was built at the early part of the Stellar Mythos with the hieroglyphic for the King of the Southern Hemisphere, and when the change took place to the Lunar and Solar this was erased and the Lunar and Solar sign substituted.

He accomplished great work by discovering many ruins of Temples, etc., and obtained photographs of the same, and deciphered the Maya characters thereon. There it ended. Mr. Leigh quotes Herodotus, but Herodotus only lived 484-424 B.C., and, moreover, was ignorant of the Egyptian language, and had to depend upon interpreters as to what was told him by the Egyptian Priests. He, however, made an important statement connected with the Pyramid, and that was : \" That Kufu {who was the sap- posed builder of the Pyramid) lived and reigned in Egypt during the Solar Mythos, but that Kufu was not the builder. .\" Now we know, for a fact, that the recent discoveries at Abydos prove that this cult (Solar) was at its zenith there twenty thousand to thirty thousand years ago, and at Helio- polis, before that, more than eighteen thousand years before the time of Moses. Now as regards the time, and who were the builders of the Pyramid, we have a very definite fact by the greatest and oldest Egyptian historian, Manetho, who was a high priest and kept \"The Records of Egypt.\" His statement is that the Great Pyramid was built at the end of the reign of \" The Gods and the Heroes \" — that is, at the time when their Totemic Sociology had arrived by evolution in the Stellar Mythos — \" and it was built by the followers of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"96 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Horus.\" Moreover, he states that \" the Gods and Heroes ' were not human, nor ever had been human. The followers of Horus were the Stellar Mythos people in the same sense as Christians are the followers of Christ. I have proved (and this proof has now been accepted by the greatest anthropologists and ethno- logists) that the human race sprang from Africa, and not Asia. It was there in old Africa that man began to develop his faculties and spread all over the world, taking with him, at various epochs, all the knowledge at the time of the exodus with which he left. The first were the Pygmies, with no Totemic ceremonies, but with a belief in a Great Spirit and a Spiritual life hereafter, and with a propitiation of elemental powers. The second were the Nilotic Negroes, with Totemic ceremonies, and a later exodus of these, when the elemental powers became divinized. Then the Stellar Mythos people, in at least two if not three different stages of evolution. After these the Lunar and then the Solar people, and finally the Christian doctrine was evolved, and is now spreading and replacing all previous cults. But the Stellar Mythos people, whose cult lasted three hundred thousand years at least, as witnessed and proved by the Ritual, \" They covered up my eye after them with bushes (or hairy net) twice, for ten periods \" (a period being one Great Year,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 97 2 5*827 years, or one revolution of the Little Bear or precession of the Pole Stars), had reached the highest stage of evolution eschatologically and astronomically, which stage has never been sur- passed ; they were the greatest of all. It was these people who built the Great Pyramids in Egypt, Central and South America, and other parts of the world where we now find the remains, and had then finally developed the whole of the present eschato- logy. Mr. Leith is wrong in trying to bring a Biblical proof for the whole of his contention. It cannot be done as an exoteric rendering. Can he or any one else bring forward any proof of the history? No ; for there was no history as an exoteric rendering. The oldest authorities that we have, and all their writings which are extant, prove this. And here let me state also that Mr. Leith is absolutely wrong in attributing \" The Dazan \" as the oldest book in the world. \" The Ritual of the Resurrection of the Egyptians \" is the oldest. But the Biblical wisdom, as an esoteric rendering, or, rather, representation of the Ritual of Ancient Egypt, is true, and all can be read and understood. Geology, and the remains of skeletons of the human found in various places, prove that man has existed here on this earth at least one million years.

The whole of their eschatology is there written for all those who can read, and for a witness from all time since it was built, when the man-god Horus was slain and rose again as Amsu in spirit form, until all the world will be re-united again under one divine brother- hood.

Thus the Baal is Jah, who is one of the Baalim, the Primary or Superior one of the seven Stellar attributes. The one God in Israel was made known to Moses by the two names of Ihuh and Iah.

It is the same with Freemasonry, the Recent History being separated from the mysteries of the past by a gulf. How, then, is one to unlock these mysteries? By one way only, and that is to learn to read the old Hieroglyphic writings of Egypt, and the Glyphs of the old Stellar Mythos people (or a translation), who worked out the whole of the Eschatology and left records of the same written in stone and on Papyri — in Signs and Symbols and in Sign Language, and if you do not read these you can never obtain that which many of you are striving to understand.

The Heavens were first divided into two divisions, North and South, at the time of their Totemic Sociology — before the Stellar Cult — at the very earliest time of their Astro-Mythology. The old Egyptians' custom was this : As they mapped out the Heavens Celestially, so they de- picted the same Terrestrially in old Egypt.

Their names all through the Stellar and Solar Mythos were \" Horus and Set,\" and represented symbolically the God of the North and the God of the South. You will find proof of this in several chapters of the Ritual. As evolution still progressed and when they had perfected their Eschatology, the two columns still continued to be placed at the entrance of their Temples, only their names were changed to Tatt and Tattu, and all Temples throughout the world had these down to the time of the commencement of the Christian cult. As you know, at the entrance of our Temples we have the two columns ; J and B are the names we use, but remember the oldest names were Nurtunga and Warringa, and that the later names, Tatt, which, in Egyptian, means \" In strength,\" and Tattu, which means, in Egyptian, \" To establish,\" denoting in Egyptian the place of establishing for ever, were those from which we copied them.

The Companions in Egypt were a special and privileged body of Brothers who occupied the seventeenth nome of Upper Egypt, and these — and these alone — had certain special duties to perform connected with the Temples. The Chief of the Nome was the Head or High Priest, and he was the first original of our Grand Master.

The casual Brother does not trouble his head about these things ; the majority look upon Freemasonry merely as a sort of Brotherhood for social intercourse and charity. Up to a certain point their views are correct ; our gatherings at the Lodges, and the social functions that follow after, tend to increase a fraternal feel- ing and goodfellowship one to the other. This is rightly so, and it is strengthened by the beautiful tenets and rituals which are taught and have been witnessed many times.

In Freemasonry we have many mysteries, handed down to us from remote ages, of a glorious past, a knowledge of which many are striving to obtain. This knowledge can be obtained only in one way, and that is by mastering the old writings of the Egyptians and glyphs of the Stellar Mythos people, or a transla- tion ; to obtain information of the evolution of man in all its phases, and to learn the history of the past, because by that, and that alone, can the origin and meaning of all that is attached to the term \" Brotherhood of Freemasonry \" be found. But you must learn these; and not from ignorance, from the want of this knowledge, draw conclusions, make guesses, and theories, of what these ideographs, signs, and symbols are, as many writers on Freemasonry in the past and present have done — for instance, Bro. Armitage considers that the symbols found in ancient buildings were used by the building traders only ; in other words, by the Operative Masons.

The Operative Mason came into being at the time of building the Temples on their Astro-Mythological foundation. These Operative Masons were initiated into some of the mysteries of the first and second degrees only, and were never advanced further in the old seven mysteries ; therefore you must not make the mistake about them that a great many have done, and still do, because they cannot read and under- stand Ancient Writings. These are not Freemasons with the Ritual of old Egypt, with all their Eschatology, but were the builders of the Pyramids and Temples for the old High Priests, certainly three hundred thousand years ago or more. The Priests of our cult, who were the learned men at that time, initiated a cer- tain class of men into part of the first and second degrees, because the Great Pyramid and other Temples had to be built, and the secrets of these buildings kept. These men came from the seven- teenth Nome of Upper Egypt, and were de- scendants of the Madi, Nilotic Negroes.

There could be no such mixture there — they knew — the origin of the two being as I have stated. The proof of this can be found in the Ritual. Our Brotherhood is the outcome of the evolution of religious ideas from the time of primitive man, who first adopted a sacred sign and symbol, pro- pitiated the elementary powers, and believed in a Great Spirit, up to the period of the final working out and perfecting of the Eschatology (or doctrine of final things) of the Ancient Egyptians at their zenith of power. Obviously, however, much of the original must have been lost. We have substi tuted our present innovations for that which we || have lost— for instance, the genuine secrets of a M.M., which were the secrets of the underworld in the Stellar Mythos, and of Amenta in the Solar Cult.

It is identical with the death of Horus I. and his rising again as Amsu in spirit form. This was the origin of that part of the Ritual, for which we have substituted the name of H.A., who was not killed, but lived to a very old age. Proofs of this may be found in the V.S.L., Josephus, and others.

The secrets of Amenta, or the underworld, were the genuine secrets of a M.M. The genuine password for a Master of the Lodge in Egypt is ' Maat Heru,\" one whose voice must be obeyed. Here it was, in Amenta, that the Tatt Cross was thrown down ; here it was that the veil of the Temple was rent asunder, and the Cubic Stone poured forth blood and water, and all was reborn. Here he was shown all the signs, given and taught those passwords, or words of power and might that kept evil and powers of darkness away, and enabled him to pass through the under- world and be raised to the glorious resurrection in Spirit form. The Egyptian religion, which was universal throughout the world at one time, was founded on the raising again of the human soul emerging alive from the body of dead matter. The Corpus could not, and never did, come back, or make its appearance again in any form, but the spirit that arose from this was seen by Seers. Religion proper commences with, and must include, the idea or desire for another life. This belief in another life is founded on the resurrec- tion of the Spirit.

It was the teaching, symbolically, of the life you should lead in this world and all you have to pass through in the next to obtain that promised life eternal. These were all acted symbolically and dramatic- ally, the more to impress it upon the Brothers, and the Signs and Symbols were brought on from the beginning. This was the secret Sign Language known to the Priests only. In some cases these have been changed as evolution pro- gressed, but the decipherment of these ideographs proves that the interpretations are analogous ; and although we do not profess any religious doctrines in Freemasonry, yet it is the highest form of religion conceivable in the human intellect.

That names and some forms and ceremonies have changed matters nothing ; it does not alter the original.

In a later phase, in the form of a double-headed Hammer or Axe, it was a symbol of the Great One, the Great Prince. When primitive man began to learn more it became of great import, and amongst some tribes a special hut was built for it. The Priest and Great Chief were the only people allowed to see it. This is still extant at the present time amongst the Nilotic Negroes in -Africa. In the Stellar Mythos it was also a symbol representing Horus — The Great Chief of the Hammer was one of his names ; The Cleaver of the Way ; the God of the Double Power, or Double Equinox — and it was brought on in the Solar Cult in the same way, when they recorded time by the sun's revo- lution. The Great God Ptah was not only the G.A.O.T.U., but was also called The Great Chief of the Hammer. (See Ritual.)

The ancient Egyptians, when working out their Astro-Mythology, first divided the Heavens into North and South — depicted by the two Columns J. and B., and sometimes by two circles (Fig. 27), then as a Triangle, next as a Square, and finally as a Circle ; and as they portrayed Heaven in these forms, so in each case was the earth symbolized — it was always a double earth — i.e. the Earth and the Earth of Eternity. The first things they noticed at the Equinox were the Pole Stars, those stars which never set. Primitive man was evolved somewhere around the Great Lakes, the source of the Nile in Africa, and as he advanced in knowledge and worked out his Astro -Mythology, he never forgot the tradition of his home, which must have been handed down verbally from generation to generation.

There are very few students amongst our Brotherhood ; and even amongst those few scarcely one who can go beyond the \" Modern Aspect \" of Freemasonry ; I have chosen, there- fore, to discuss the \" Ancient Origin \" of Free- masonry, not the Modern Aspect, which covers a period of a few hundreds of years only. Bros. Gould, Anderson, Armitage, Horsley, Lawrence, and many other able writers and speakers have studied the latter. We have no written history of the Craft prior to that time, only traditions. Yet Freemasonry has existed for at least six hundred thousand years, but not under the name of Freemasonry. That term did not then exist. The farthest date back in which we find that word is 1376.

Freemasonry was then the religion of the world ; it existed not in this country only, but throughout Africa, Europe, Asia, America, and many islands in the Pacific. You may ask, How do I know this? It is because I have been enabled to read the writings on the wall still existing in the old ruined cities, and on various papyri that have been found in different parts of the world. Moreover, I dis- covered that these people were all of one Cult or Brotherhood, analogous in every particular to our own Brotherhood, and my knowledge of geology has assisted me in arriving at these conclusions as regards the vast ages of time. It is only by going- back to the primary and tracing the human race from the beginning, the signs and symbols then formed as sign language in substitution for the articulate sounds, which at that time did not exist such as we have now, and following the history of the \" rise and fall \" of all great nations, and the causes for the same, that the secrets of the past can be unravelled. Having done this, after critically examining all existing evidence, one conclusion only can be arrived at, and it is that our Brotherhood originated with the old Mystery Teachers, or High Priests, in Old Egypt, whence various exodes spread throughout the world, carrying with them all the Rituals, Signs, and Symbols of the Brother-"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 149 hood, primarily as Stellar Cult, and at a later date the Solar Eschatology. That this was so is proved by what we still find extant in many countries, i.e. all our Signs and Symbols, with engraved hieroglyphics explaining them by their side as an objective proof, and their hieroglyphic writings on papyri as subjective evidence. It must have taken hundreds of thousands of years to spread throughout the world, in view of the fact that presumedly journeys had to be made on foot at this early period of the world's existence. The lowest strata of the earth's surface where remains of Stellar Cult man have been found is in the Pliocene Age, in Italy, which must date back six hundred thousand years or more. Also the Piltdown skull of a human found in Sussex. 1 Hence the proof of the great antiquity of man's existence on this earth as against the Biblical date, and however much some Brothers may express their disbelief of the ages of time I have men- tioned, they cannot gainsay or go against this geological fact ; it is sufficient proof. I want you to go back with me for a few minutes, so far away in the past, to the time when man had not the articulate language that we have now, and so expressed some of his ideas and thoughts in 1 This is debatable — if this Piltdown skull was in the Pliocene or not."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"150 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Signs and Symbols. Many conclusions arrived at were founded on the observation of the elemental powers and observation of natural phenomena. If you will bear this in mind, you will be able to understand better the reason for the origin of our Signs and Symbols, and why these have continued to be associated and represented in every religious cult with very little or no alteration from the original. Many of our Signs and Symbols were brought on prior to the Stellar Cult ; but it was during this period that the Great Pyramids, as well as the Temples, were built, which are found nearly all over the world. The old Brotherhood was one and the same in forms, rites, and cere- monies, with the same Signs and Symbols in Africa, Asia, Europe, America, and some of the Pacific isles. The Stellar Cult people's Temples and buildings can always be identified, because they were icono- graphic, whereas the Solar people's were not ; they both built with polygonal- shaped stones and monoliths. Therefore you can always distinguish definitely the ages of these Temples and who built them, and the reason was that in the Stellar Cult pre-human types were used, i.e. Zootypes, to represent the Great Architect of the Universe and His attributes ; whereas in the Solar the human types had taken the place of these. Their Temples were of the same form and shape as ours, except"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 151 that they had the Pedestal, which the R.A.M.'s have, and which in the old Temples was always situated in the centre. These two different degrees, as we have made them, were then only one, as can be seen at the Temples of Knossos and those in Central America. The door of the Temple was an equilateral triangle, and therefore a Symbol of Heaven (Fig- 3 5). The Square was a Symbol of Earth ; the whole entrance symbolized passing of the Soul from earth to heaven. The two Pillars at the porch way en- trance of every Temple are specially im- portant in ancient symbolism. Originally these old Mystery Teachers divided the heavens into two divisions, North and South, which was represented by the Pole, or Pillar of Set, in the South— El Shaddai of the Phoenicians ; and the Pole, or Pillar of Horus, in the North, termed the \" Sustainers of the Heavens.\" Sometimes two Eyes were portrayed as the two Poles, or, rather, two Pole Stars. These were the representative symbols of the two gods of the Pole Stars, North and South, called also the Two Judges. The Ideographs of them were Two Jackals, and were later called in Egyptian the two Tatt Pillars, one meaning \" In Strength \" and the other \" To establish \" ; and combined Tattu, which in Egyptian also means \" The place of estab-"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"152 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY lishing for ever.\" The four lines at the top represent the Celestial and Terrestrial Worlds. The next division was symbolized by the division of heaven in two circles, North and South. (These we find in many places in Cornwall and Scotland, and throughout the world.) This was the first and oldest form of the Temple in the world, a circle of twelve stones. After this, the next phase of heaven was depicted by two Triangles ; No. I, Fig. 36, was the Ideographic name and symbol for Set, and No. 2, Fig. 36, was the Ideographic name and symbol of Horus. At a later epoch these two Triangles were joined (see Fig. 8) as a representative symbol for heaven, or the Land of the Spirits or Gods ; and when Horus became Primary God of the North and superseded Set, the Primary God of the South, these were afterwards depicted as Fig. 7, and this was associated with the name of Horus only. It represents, in the Egyptian, \" Ra Harmachus \" ; another name was Aiu, the God of the Double Horizon, which was one of the forms of Horus ; it was from this part of the old Egyptian Eschatology that the Hebrew Cult was founded. These two triangles must be of great interest to you because of the various forms in which they are portrayed — curiously enough, on your own notice sent out I find one form, Fig. 37, which is prac-"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 153 tically the same as Fig. 7, with the all-seeing eye in the centre. These triangles, in another phase, form the five-pointed star (Fig. 38). In this latter there should be a point in the centre, which we have left out, but in the original it was there ; Fig. 37. Fig. 38. it was the point in the centre of a circle (Fig. 39), equal to the point at the top of the triangle or cone (Fig. 40), that was crowned with the star at the summit and has the same meaning as the Fig. 39.

This one, the centre of the six other Pole Stars of Ursa Minor, pr Little Bear, revolved in a circle around this centre one, therefore the Pole Star was a symbol or type of the eternal, because apparently it never changed with time. It was the earliest type of supreme intelligence which gave the law, which was unerring, just, and true, and it became a standpoint in the heavens for the mind of man to rest on at the centre and radiated to the circum- ference (a point within a circle from which one could not err). It was also a type or symbol of the Judge, or Just One. This will give you the origin and meaning of the symbols you use on your stationery, which are associated with these two triangles. The interpretation is that this is the symbol of the Just God who gave the Law ; The Great Architect of the Universe. As regards \" That point within a circle,\" a bad innovation has been made here, on account of not knowing the true gnosis of the Ritual of Ancient Egypt, as this was not the place that all the secrets were com- municated and known ; \" This Centre of the Circle \" represented Paradise. They left the East to go to the West to obtain the secrets of M.M. These secrets were given in \" Amenta,\" which was entered in the West, and traversed until they came out in the East, before they could enter Paradise situated at the North.

The next evolution was the heavens in the form of a Square, and as they portrayed a uranographic picture here so they depicted the earth — thus you have two Squares, the later form of the two Triangles, and it was in this form they built the Temples, a double square end to end, with the cubes in the centre to mark the division between Heaven and Earth. On the top of the cube was a circle of gold enclosing the Sacred figTIi. Triangle, and at each corner was the Ideographic name of one of the Primary Trinity, or the Three Grand Originals (Fig. 41). Thus you see the progressive evolution of the mind of man as depicted by the different Signs and Symbols he used to express his thoughts and beliefs when he had no language as we have now. 1 .

Then we have the Heavens divided into two Circles, the North for Horus and the South for Set. 4. The next is the Heavens symbolized by the two Triangles into the two equal divisions, with the same meaning as the Circles. 5. In the next portrayal, Set, or the South Pole Star, has sunk down below the horizon as the old people came North from the Equatorial Provinces of Africa, where they were born or originated, and the Pole Star North has risen in the Heavens, i.e. Horus has become the highest and supreme one and appropriated all the attributes of Set unto himself ; and now — 6. The Heavens are represented as a Square. The two Triangles merged into one, which has four supports, symbolized as the brothers or children of Horus. 7. The Pole Star North (Horus) represented by one Eye now becomes \" The All-Seeing Eye,\" a type of the Great Judge of All (Fig. 14). These Symbols and Signs were used by these old Mystery Teachers to represent the Great Architect of the Universe and His various attributes when they had no language of words to express their thoughts as we have now. This was part of their Sign Language — their sacred symbols which have"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 157 been handed on from generation to generation to the present day, the interpretation varying some- what with each successive Cult. So many, even learned men, who ought to know better, have stated verbally and in writing that the old Egyptians worshipped many gods, birds, cats, and other animals, etc. This was not so. These old Priests, the forefathers of our Brotherhood, only believed and worshipped One Great God, the Great Architect of the Universe, expressed by various Signs and Symbols. If the Triangle was the sign and symbol of the Great God, it was the Great. God that was worshipped, and not the Triangle. The Triangle was held sacred because it was a symbol made to represent Him. In twenty thousand years' time it is quite possible that those who come after us and find \" the Lamb sculptured in our churches will say that we were worshippers of sheep — which would be just as true as many say of the old Egyptians at the present time. If the Symbol represented the Deity, it was the Deity that was worshipped and not the Symbol. Bro. Hobbs, in a letter to The Freemason, states that I speak derisively of Thomas Payne and others who attribute the origin of the Craft as Druidical. Let me state here distinctly I did nothing of the kind. What I said was that Payne and others stated that these old Druids worshipped the Sun,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"158 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Moon, and Stars, but I say it was not so. These were symbols either representing the Deity or some of His attributes, which the Druids perfectly under- stood, but which the learned men of the present day do not, and have taken the shadow for the substance and mixed them up, which will not help to understand the Wisdom of Ancient Egypt, or give any knowledge or meaning of all you find of the peoples of past ages. Many would wish to know how these have been handed on from the time they came into existence up to the time you found them used in your Lodges. The answer to this, fully set forth, with the proofs, would fill a big volume ; I will, however, try and explain in a few words so that you will be able to think out the details as I have done. To commence with, all the sacred Signs and Symbols first used by these old Mystery Teachers in their Stellar Cult were brought on into their Lunar and Solar Cults, and from the Solar Escha- tology, the earliest Christians, the Copts, adopted them. Some of the original forms have been slightly changed, others were discarded by the later Christians ; examples of this you can find in many old churches here in England ; one in particular, Launceston Church, in Cornwall, is rich in the early emblems which were worked here in stone and built in by the old Druidical Priests, who"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 159 became Christians between iooo and 1500. In Mr. Harold Bayley's books you will find numerous examples. They are also to be found in the churches of the Abyssinians. That the Chinese have them is because these are old Stellar Cult people, who left Egypt at the time that the hiero- glyphic language was undergoing the evolution of having affixes and prefixes added to the original Ideograph, and before the Hieratic and Demotic were evolved. That the Hindoos and Jews have them is because these were Solar Mythos people when they left Egypt, and are still so (in two different forms or epochs of time), so that many are thinking at the present day that all these people have different religions, yet in reality it is not so. Names have changed, language has become reflected instead of monosyllabic, there- fore the majority now express in words, in different ways, what was formerly sign language ; the origin of all was one and the same, and because some have travelled by one road and some by another, and have different tales to tell of the routes by which they travelled, you must not lose sight and meaning of the originals. You can trace them all back the way they came, as you can trace them all from the earliest to the present time — if you will only leave out the dogmas that have been introduced.

None of the common and unlearned were ever admitted to their secrets or Brotherhood, and this is the reason why we do not admit slaves into our Brotherhood. What was the cause of the destruction and supposed loss of all their old Eschatology, or Doctrine of Final Things? When Egypt was at its zenith dissensions arose amongst the Priests, and, as the inevitable result, Socialism followed. No peoples have ever risen to be a great nation and then fallen and been destroyed except for these two primary causes, and no downfall was so great as that of Egypt. Their Temples were thrown down and given over to fire and sword, and their old writings were burned, or lost, or became unintelligible to the destroyer. But we find that remnants of the old Priesthood who were our old Brothers escaped ; others had been established in other countries, as, for example, the Druids in this country and in the North of France and in America ; these again had to flee before the sword. The old faith was never entirely lost, however, but was kept secret and sacred by a scattered few, and you must remember that their Signs, Symbols, and the meaning of their Rituals were only known to a chosen few — men of unimpeachable character,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 161 integrity, and honour, who have been tried and tested. From these few, we, the present Brother- hood of Freemasons, have been evolved ; we have risen out of the ashes of past ages to form a Brotherhood throughout the world again, as of old, with all the same Signs, Symbols, sacred rites and ceremonies. Many innovations have become necessary to replace some of the lost secrets, and to meet the higher state of evolution which humanity has now attained. For instance, for the true password for M.M. — Maat-Heru in Egyptian, meaning one whose voice must be obeyed — we have substituted another ; also in our passwords for grips we have substituted our present for the original — in fact, there are several in the various degrees, but I know all in the Egyptian from the first to the thirty-third, and I do not think it matters now to attempt any change. During the last hundred years the Brotherhood has been striving to raise itself again towards \" the greater standard \" and to attain a higher evolution. This is a short resume of the Past, and there is no time at my disposal to bring forward all proofs of that which I have stated ; indeed, all the proofs that I have found would occupy many large volumes, but in my \" Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man,\" Second Edition, there are more proofs given.

It is written to guide and interest you in the right road to the know- ledge you wish to obtain ; a small path cut through a dense, dark forest, which I hope others will broaden and enlarge. Much has been said lately on the subject of Freemasonry and religion. Many Brethren, and some of them very eminent and learned divines, have stated — and no doubt they would not make the statement if they did not believe it — \" that Freemasonry is not a religion.\" Brothers, my con- tention is that Freemasonry is the greatest, truest, and purest religion in the world, for these reasons : 1. Religion proper commences with and must in- clude the idea or desire for and belief in another life. 2. This belief in another life is founded on the belief of the resurrection of the Spirit. 3. We all believe in one great God, the Great Architect of the Universe. 4. Therefore we all believe in the rising again of the human soul, emerging alive from the body of dead matter. This body of dead matter could not come back or rise again, if disintegrated, but the Spirit could."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 163 5. In our teachings, in our forms and ceremonies which are dramatically performed, we are taught how we should live in this world, and how we should die, to attain that great end of everlasting happiness which is the one object all the Brother- hood profess and desire to attain. Therefore this is the greatest, truest, and purest religion in the world, void of all dogmas, one in which poor humanity can work together in perfect harmony, and one in which there cannot be any dissensions to disturb the fraternal feelings which should always exist between us, and may it ever continue to be the same. We have no history for those who cannot read ancient writings except a decipherment and trans- lation of some of these symbols and workings which I have given, which probably many have never heard of, few have read, and which are ignored by some or adversely criticized by others, who are not acquainted with the knowledge of these decipherments, and who cannot read the writings on the walls. Few Brothers have studied the history and evolution of the human race, and the religious conceptions during the evolution, which alone contain the secret of the development of Freemasonry.

These points are to be highly appreciated ; they enhance the greater solemnity of our ceremonies, and photograph our beautiful Ritual more indelibly on the mind of the initiate ; but if we do not act those principles in our lives outside the Lodge, which we so solemnly promise in the Lodge, what frauds we are ! The past and continuous thought of the majority of our Brotherhood is one of self, rightly when it especially affects themselves — Feasting and Chari- ties. But within the last few years a very bright star has arisen in Freemasonry. There are many in the Craft who are striving to bring about that high ideal of Brotherhood to be a reality, and not a sham, although they have little encouragement from the powers that govern the Order.

Whether the papers are considered good, bad, or indifferent, the results obtained in the end must be to the advantage of the Brethren. Although we are the greatest Charity in the world, and that is the only thing that interests many — which, so far, is right and good — yet that is not Freemasonry, nor will Freemasonry ever be advanced farther in evolution, or coalescing the Brotherhood into one great fraternal and universal whole by it. The One Great Universal Brother- hood, each individual carrying out those sublime tenets he was taught in the Lodge in his daily life outside the Lodge, is what Freemasonry should and must attain. Many Brothers do not think, and therefore do not practise these things outside the Lodge. It is the action of the individual Mason in discharging with great fidelity every duty he has in this life, both outside the Lodge as well as within, that will raise the Fraternity. How can we hope to attain Universal Brotherhood without setting the example in this the mother country to our present Brotherhood throughout the world?

Let there exist a perfect unity of sentiment between you ; or, if there must be a difference, let it be of emulation in the exercise of those good qualities which, while they dignify our nature, add lustre to the highest and beauty to the lowest station. Let the principles and precepts of morality and fervent piety, which are continually ascending from our altars, repress every unkind thought and smooth every asperity of feeling. And why should this not be so? The answer remains with yourselves, and in the action of your daily lives. You can all attain the ideal if you try, and if all strive then the Brother- hood will be a living reality, with the power of governing the world for human happiness. I believe it is only a question of time before our great ideal will be realized.

By your universal combi- nation you possess the dominant power for the advancement, for the good of humanity generally. For Freemasonry to exist there is no way of standing still. It must progress or it must fall. This must be the question for you to answer : Is it to be Past, or Future? Therefore let each one steadily follow that Bright Star which has arisen.

The Sphinx was built by the early Solar people, thousands of years after, and represents Ra Har- machus, God of the Double Horizon. The proof of this is that the Sphinx itself has spoken once, and you will find this on the stele of Tahtmes IV, where it is called the Sphinx of Khepra, who was a form of Harmachus, of whom I <=M11 have to say more later on ; but the whole of the early Solar Cult is portrayed in this figure in Sign lan- guage, and may be easily deciphered and trans- lated by those who understand.

They built the Great Pyramid and many of the old Temples found in Africa, Europe, Asia, America, and some of the islands of the Pacific. Their Priests, who were their learned men, were the old Mystery Teachers of Egypt ; many exodes of them left Egypt and carried all their knowledge of building and their religion to most parts of the world. These were followed by a higher class and developed human — namely, the Solar Cult people. The buildings of the Stellar people can always be identified by their being Iconographic, whereas the Solar and others were not. Therefore, you can always distinguish definitely the ages of the Temples, and who built them. These people were the first to work out the old Astro-Mythology, and it is to this that we owe the origin of many of our Sacred Signs and Symbols.

These were called the two sustainers of Heaven ; also they represented the two Gods of the Pole Stars, and later, in Egyptian, were named the two Tatt Pillars. These two Pillars were always placed at the porchway entrance of every Temple in the world, and represent J. and B. in our Masonic Temples. The next portrayal of Heaven was symbolized by two circles representing a Pre-Zodiacal forma- tion of the Heavens in the Stellar Mythos. Fig. 27 represents the North (Horus) and the South (Set) respectively, which in Temple building were formed of twelve monoliths. Remains of these Circles, with twelve stones to each, may be seen in Wales, Cornwall, Scotland, India, America, and many other parts of the world.

The first phase of the two Triangles was as i, Fig. 6, which is an Ideograph for the name of Set— El Shaddai of the Phoenicians— and represented the God of the Pole Star South, as well as the southern division of Heaven ; and 2, which is an Ideographic symbol for Horus, represents the God of the Pole Star North and the northern division of Heaven. At a later epoch these two Triangles were joined (see Fig. 8) as a representative symbol for Heaven or the land of the Spirits. Sometimes we find these doubled, as in Fig. 21, where the two Double Triangles are surrounded by four Serpents, repre- senting symbolically the four Powers which guard the Land of the Spirits, as in Revelation \" guarded the Throne and around about the Throne,\" called in Egyptian the Khui Land.

The reason why we have two Triangles combined or blended into one symbol, or figure, as on our own Masonic jewels, calls for some explanation. Primordial man was born in Africa ; you will find proofs of this in my book \" Origin and Evolu- tion of Primitive Man.\" About the region of the head of the Nile Valley, or Great Lakes, man could see and mark the two Pole Stars — North and South. The South was associated with Set, and the North with Horus. Then Set was primary God ; his Triangle or Ideograph was as i in Fig. 6. As these people left their old land and travelled to the North, the South Pole Star would sink down below the Horizon, and the North Pole Star would rise in the Heavens and become the only one visible, which was represented by the Ideograph for Horus (2 in Fig. 6). This is the mythical repre- sentation of Shu lifting up the Heavens. Horus was then given all the attributes of Set, and the triangle of Set became blended with the triangle of Horus, and formed these double triangles in various phases, which were associated with the name of Horus only, first in the Stellar Cult and later carried on in their Solar Cult, and some of them afterwards into the Christian doctrines. One combination formed of these two triangles is that"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"174 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY with the All-seeing Eye in the centre (Fig. 42). This form is an Ideographic symbol for Horus, as God of the Pole Star North and South, having the ' All-seeing Eye.\" This originated with these old Stellar Cult people. At the Equatorial Provinces the two Pole Stars could be seen resting on the Horizon, and these were symbolized in one form, as two Eyes, called Merti in Egyptian (Fig. 13). In Egyptian these two Eyes were, therefore, Ideo- graphs for the two Pole Stars ; but when the South Pole Star had disappeared below the Horizon, and Fig. 42. Fig. 43. the North Pole Star had risen in the Heavens, there was only one Eye (Fig. 14). The North Pole Star had figuratively absorbed the South, and this North Pole Star became a symbol or type of the Eternal, because apparently it never changed with time. It was the earliest type of supreme intelli- gence which gave the law which was unerring, just, and true. It was also a type or symbol of the Great Judge, or Just One.

This was always associated with Horus of the Stellar Cult only. There is still another form of the Triangle, or rather a combination of the two, as in Fig. 43, which represents a Star with rive points, a more ancient formation than the previous one, which, in its true form, belonged to the Stellar Cult people only. Many may not at first recognize that this is a combination of the same two Triangles, but if you will follow the mode of formation, as in Fig. 44. Figs. 44 and 45, it will be seen that it is so. The upper part of Set's Triangle (44 aaa) is cut off and attached to or joined to the Triangle of Horus. Also see that the base line or divisional line at the equinox (Fig. 45 b) has been removed or is absent, and there is a reason for this, which speaks for itself, in symbolic language. It portrays graphically that Set's Triangle was given to Horus when he became primary God of the Pole Star North.

I am giving this Symbol and Sign with interpretation and proofs fully, because in my lecture at Chatham, at the Mid-Kent Masters' Lodge, seeing it used on their stationery, I gave a short explanation of it, but there was one Brother who doubted my decipherment. And I see that it is also the jewel of the Hendre Lodge. I there- fore thought it incumbent on myself to bring for- ward conclusive and critical proofs now. Although it is used as a Sacred Symbol by the Jews, it was brought on from the old Stellar Cult. The Jews left out the \" All-seeing Eye,\" and, therefore, tried to convert it into a Symbol of Horus of the Double Horizon, or Ihuh, in their terminology, but the original had the dot or eye in the centre. It was never intended to be a Sign or Symbol of Horus of the Double Horizon originally. It was a Symbol of the abode of Horus, God of the North and South, God of the All-seeing Eye, and proof of this is the fact that it has the phonetic signification of sb aau — in Egyptian, \" Abode of Stars,\" or \" Subdivision of the Celestial World,\" which was situated at the North. You will find this in the list of Ideographs of Bunsen's Dictionary, p. 497. (Fig. 46.) That alone is a sufficient proof.

First because our old Brothers used it, and the Operative Masons still have this Symbol in their ceremonies ; next because this sign was at a later period converted into the Cross which our Brothers of the i8° use (see how this con- version took place in \" Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man \"), and because the interpreta- tion given by the Operative Masons for this Sign is not correct — in fact, quite wrong. The Opera- tive Masons were originally \" The Companions ' of the 17th Nome of Upper Egypt, and were Stellar Cult people ; probably some later genera- tions adopted the Solar Cult, and thus mixed the signs, but retained the true and original Ritual. Some of the exponents of Operative Masonry say that the Swastika is a Symbol of Axial Rotation, and refers to the Pole Star and the rotation of the Great Bear around it ; that it symbolizes the Great Ruler of the Universe, who alone was stationary and stable as the North Star, while all the rest of the universe revolves around Him ! This Symbol or Sign does not mean anything of the kind. It is a pure theory without any founda- tion in fact, except imagination, and I challenge any Operative Mason to bring forward any facts to prove and support their theory. In its original form the Swastika is a symbol of the Four Quarters of Heaven. It is a typical figure of the Heaven that was founded on the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"184 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Four corners, \" according to the measure of a man\" (Rev. xxi. 17), and its origin was derived from the human figure. The proof of this was found in a Prehistoric Grave at Nagada, in Egypt. On one of the seal Cylinders we have depicted the primitive form, which was two human figures crossed. These figures are depicted as in Fig. 59. The four limbs, which eventually became the four feet, or four legs, were at first the two arms and two legs of the human figure. This is the divine man whose image was extended J _ 1J Fig. 59. Fig. 60. crosswise on the universe as a type of creation, and who was Atum in the character of Iu, the Son, in the early Solar Cult. From these two figures other two figures were blended, representing there- from the Four Quarters of Heaven. As proof of this there is still to be seen a stone at Meigle, in Perthshire, with these four figures forming a Swastika, a photograph of which is given in \" Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man.\" Each quarter was given, or assigned, to one of the four Brothers of Horus, who were the four attributes represent-"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 185 ing the four Supports of Heaven. If further proof be necessary, it may be found in the Ancient Mexican Calendar, in the form of the Swastika. On each arm of this is the name of the four Brothers of Horus, who were the four Supports of Heaven, when first depicted in the form of a Square, in Primary Solar Cult, or when Heaven was first divided into four quarters by our old Brothers, who were the Astro-Mythologists of old Egypt. Another form of the Swastika which is found in many countries, India and Cornwall especially, is Fig. 60, which is another portrayal of the form we find in Mexico. The four lines or uprights, having the same length as each arm, represent the four supports, or Brothers of Horus, as the four supports of the four quarters, which proves the truth of this decipherment. This Triangle, then, with the Swastika in the centre is a Symbol for Horus, God of the Four Quarters, or God of the Double Horizon, and has nothing to do with the symbolism of God of the North Pole, or of axial rotation, as the Operative Masons explain. I have brought forward some existing proofs which cannot, I think, leave any doubt in your minds. I have explained this Symbol fully, because it is so frequently found in Wales, which was one of the last places, if not the last place, where the Druids existed in these Isles,"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"186 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY where they lived and practised the old Solar Cult they had brought with them from Egypt. Another form or Symbol for Heaven was the square, Fig. 61. The reason being that the Egyptians, in their progressive evolution from the division of Heaven into North and South, now added East and West, thus forming the Heavens into four Quarters, or a Square, by means of the Swastika figure. As already shown, there were two human figures, Right and Left, so they formed a Right and Left Swastika, as Figs. 62 and 63. Fig. 61. Fig. 62. Fig. 63. They crossed the two human figures, and if these two Swastikas be crossed they form a perfect Square, with four Quarters. In India and other places, where we find the early Solar Cult existing, these two Swastikas are frequently found together as Right and Left.

The point in the centre of a Circle is equal to the point at the top of the Triangle, and this Glyph is equiva- lent to the Eye ; the two are synonymous. In this circle of the Pole Star there were seven attri- butes, called the Seven Glorious Ones, grouped together in the constellation of the Lesser Bear, revolving around the Most High, the Great Judge, the \" All-seeing Eye,\" symbolized by the Pole Star, which was the centre of the circumpolar enclosure of Heaven, or Paradise, situated at the 'North. The Eye, or this dot, or Pole Star, in the centre of the circle, therefore, became a Symbol or type of the eternal, because, apparently, it never changed with time. It was the earliest type of the supreme intelligence which gave the Law, which was unerring, just, and true, and it became a standpoint in the heavens for the mind of man to rest on at the centre, and radiate to the circum- ference — a point within a circle from which a M.M. could not err.

In the i8° there is a room corresponding to this of the old Egyptians. You have been told that you travelled from the East to the West to learn the genuine secrets. That is so ; there you entered the Amenta in the West, travelled back to the East, and came out with all the true and genuine secrets of a M.M.

Many stones and build- ings delineating the single or double Axe are to be seen in this country in Devon, Cornwall, in the Dolmens in Brittany, in Temples in America, and other parts of the world. At Knossos Evans found a Temple in the form of a double square, with three cubes in the centre, one surmounting the other, with this axe Ideograph on each, repre- senting figuratively the Great One of the North —i.e. Horus ; the Great One of the South— i.e. Set ; the Great One of the Centre— i.e. Shu— the three Grand Originals, as in Fig. 4.

It is interesting to understand why these Symbols and Signs are found in many parts of the world at the present day, and still used, not only by us, but some by the Hebrews, some by the Hindoos, many by the Chinese, Japanese, and others found amongst the Totemic peoples in many- places in the world. Without knowing the Astro - Mythology and Eschatology, and Ritual of Ancient Egypt, we can never understand their meaning, or decipherment, or give a true explanation of what these old Signs and Symbols are.

In old Egypt he began to grow in stature and knowledge, and from primitive faith man developed the highest religious doctrines. At first he had not the language as we have now ; many of his ideas were expressed in Signs and Symbols, and it is clearly and distinctly evident that these were used by these old Mystery Teachers to represent the Great Architect of the Universe, and His various attributes, and the doctrines of final things, when they had no language of words to express their thoughts as we have now. As the old Egyptians progressed in knowledge and wisdom, so exodes left and went to most parts of the world— at least, the Stellar Cult people did — and many are extant at the present day, prac- tising and believing in the old Stellar doctrine. From the Stellar they developed into a higher evolution — the so-called Solar Cult — and these went to India, nearly all over Europe, landed at Yucatan in Central America, and travelled down as far as Peru.

Although we use the old Signs and Symbols as ancient types, we have replaced these by a language unknown to our old Brotherhood, in which we have developed a higher Spiritual terminology.

But the origin of Freemasonry dates back to the time when these Signs and Symbols were first formed— six hundred thousand years ago is a low estimate. One of the earliest Temples of the old Brother- hood was established at Edfu, in Egypt, by the Priests of the Stellar Cult. The old Totemic and Hero-Cult Nilotic Negroes had, through evolu- tion, established this cult, with its beginnings of the doctrine of final thingsi' They came up from the south of the Nile Valley, where they had already formed a secret society, calling themselves \" the followers of Horus \" (or \" the black- smiths \"). Descendants\" of these still exist in the Nile Valley — \"the Kaverondo.\" They brought with them the knowledge of working in metals and of brickmaking and building. The Gemi tribe of these were the religious part of this secret society, learned already in astronomical observa- tions and secret doctrines. Horus, their Great Chief in Hero-Cult, was now symbolized as \" The Great God of the North and South.\" Another of his titles was \" The Chief Artificer in Metals.\" \" The Great Chief of the Hammer \" and many other titles were gradually added as evolution progressed for the G.G. of the U. (We have substituted T.C. for Horus — Behutet— which latter was the Egyptian word for"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 209 the first artificer in metals.) These people estab- lished the city of Edfu as their centre, and built Temples for the G.A.U. throughout Egypt, after driving out or exterminating the Pygmy and Masaba Negroes, the original inhabitants (see 4 Origin and Evolution of Primordial Man\"). Thus a brotherhood in two phases was estab- lished, the first being a religious sect, with their Priests, having the astronomical and other know- ledge ; and the second being the Builders, skilled as artificers and brickmakers. Combined, these were called the Mesniti or Mesintu, or the followers of Horus, only another name, as the Christians are called the followers of Christ. From the Ritual of Ancient Egypt, still extant, we find that the old Priests founded and established the Seven Mysteries, afterwards called the Lesser Mysteries, based upon Astro-Mythology. These were after- wards increased to twelve in the Stellar Cult. Of these, the first two were communicated to \" the Builders,\" who were now established in the seven- teenth Nome of Upper Egypt. The Ari by name, and those who were initiated into the First and Second Mysteries, were taken for the builders of their Temples.

These were the original Operative Masons, the descendants of whom still exist, and, although these now have a division of so-called seven degrees, which they constructed out of the two mysteries, the original was simply the First and Second Mysteries. I think you will see that I am correct when I say that they are still divided into two moieties, \" The Blue \" and \" The Red,\" also \" The first four Degrees \" work with their hands, the others \" work with their heads \" — these are known by the two names of Craftsmen and Companions — so really the old division is still kept. The Sacred Signs and Symbols founded and established by the learned priesthood had, however, another meaning and definition from that which the Operatives were taught — \" A Sign Language ' of their own, and in a most profound and religious sense, which was only known to the religious brotherhood, or their Priests, and not to the Builders. It was from these learned Priests that Speculative Masonry took its origin.

During the Stellar Cult, which lasted about three hundred thousand years, the Old Egyptians attained a high state of knowledge, and sent colonies nearly all over the world ; the proof of this can be demonstrated by the remains of their old Temples which have been found, and also their skeletons buried in the thrice bent position, and with a definite class of implements buried with them. Proof of this is afforded by the translation of an inscrip- tion found at Dendera, which also goes to show how far advanced were the Stellar Cult people in arts and writings. The literal translation as the Egyptian words stand is : — ' Was found foundation great in Dendera, in writings old in rolls of kids in the time of the followers of Horus, was found between the wall of brick of the South part in the reign of the King of the Sun -beloved the son of Sun Lord of diadems Phiops.\" This, when translated into modern English, would read : \" That in the great foundation, in Dendera, between the walls of brick at the Southern part of the Temple, were found decayed"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"212 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY rolls of parchment with writings thereon of the followers of Horus.\" I bring forward this evidence that you may not be carried away by enthusiasm, which some Brethren declare I am exceedingly liable to in my own case, and that I put forward theories instead of facts. But let me assure you that I belong to an honourable profession where we are trained to think, reason, and sift the objective and subjective proofs to the bottom. The facts I lay before you are objective and capable of proof. The Stellar Cult was followed by the Lunar, and then by the Solar, and finally by the Christian doctrines. At the time of the zenith of the Solar Cult, at the latest, it is certain that they had estab- lished ten more Mysteries, called the Greater Mysteries, and worked out their Eschatology, or doctrine of final things, and had established their Sign Language and rituals for these. I do not know how, or why, all these have been divided up into thirty-three degrees as we have done, because in all, the Stellar and Solar added together, I can only make twenty-two. In the Stellar there were seven at first, afterwards five more were added. 1 In the Solar ten more were added, but many of these were a different form of the Stellar. It was an attempt to blot out the former cult, but at the 1 The Stellar Mysteries were, however, afterwards subdivided into twenty-four."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 213 same time really bringing it on under a new name, changing the original names by substituting others. We in this Lodge have the old Stellar Mysteries, but when you come to the eighteenth degree and upwards, you change into the Solar with much mixture of the Stellar, and some of the Christian added, so you may be quite certain that ours up to the R.A. are the Stellar or oldest, and, although our traditional history only dates from Solomon's Temple, you can be certain that it existed thousands of years before the time of Solomon. Let me here explain how you may always still distinguish the old Stellar Cult buildings from the Solar, and those which followed after. Wherever you find the remains of two circles, these were Stellar Cult Temples. They were built with twelve monoliths, or twelve pillars for each circle, and were pre-zodiacal, indicating the divisions of heaven into twelve divisions of the North and twelve divisions of the South ; these were two separate circles. The Solar Cult people always built with three circles (or in the form of a Double Square), one representing the North and another the South. The third was placed between, the two circles bisecting each other like links in a chain. These divided heaven into thirty- six divisions. I do not mean you to understand that only twelve stones were used in building each Temple. There were as many used as in other"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"214 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY erections, but there were twelve monoliths, or pillars of special import. These were placed out- side the walls, sometimes inside the Temple. The primary formation of the Temples was round, and sometimes two were built together, one North and one South. These were built when Set was Primary God of the South. An example of one of these can still be seen at Peking ; it is there called The Temple of Heaven, the oldest form found in China. Another exists in Central America, known as the Temple of Set, at Tepe- yollott, Mexico, as depicted in the Borgian Codex. The formation of this Temple is round, and on the top is one of the Symbols or Ideographic names of Set— the God of the South. These two Temples — one from China and the other from Mexico— show that the first form of the Temples was round, and that they were dedicated to Set — the God of the South Pole, previous to Horus — the God of the North. They also show how widely distributed these old Primary Stellar Mythos people were, and that the cult was one and the same all over the world at this time. From evi- dences contained in the Ritual, this Primary Cult lasted about fifty-two thousand years before the change to the North took place. Disbelievers should estimate how long it must have taken man to migrate these great distances, found communi- ties, and erect Temples. Curiously enough, the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 215 Symbol or Ideograph for the name of Set is still used on some of the Government stamps and official paper of some of the South American States. In this country we now call it the Dunce's Cap, or Fool's Cap. The Chinese were Stellar Cult people originally, but now there is much mixture of the Solar Cult with these. The reason why they built in these two circles was because they divided the heavens into two divisions of North and South, portrayed as two circles, as I have already stated. These Temples therefore represented their circumpolar paradise, within which \" the house \" of the G. A. of the U. was situated. Remains of these two circles can be found in many parts of the world where the old Stellar Cult people went. In this country I have recently examined some on Dart- moor, Devonshire. Of course, you would not expect to find anything but remains here now. We have passed through several glacial epochs since these were built, and they would be destroyed by the ice and snow. You will also find three circles in many places. These belong to the Solar Cult people. You will find this fully set forth in the second edition of \" Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man.\" In these circular Temples the altar was circular, and placed in the centre of the building. There were in the primary Temples five steps, afterwards"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"216 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY seven steps, leading up to this. In most cases the Temple was open at the top to the vaults of heaven, so that a \" Plumb Line \" might come straight from the Pole Star to the central altar. The seven steps represent in the Egyptian \" The Khuti,\" or the seven Glorious Ones — attributes of the G. A. of the U., whose house is situated within this cir- cumpolar enclosure. They also represent the seven Great Spirits — the seven Sciences — the seven Eyes —and many other sevens of the Scriptures. The twelve Camps, and the twelve Banners of the Children of Israel represent the original characters in the Stellar Astronomical Mythology, and were given first to the twelve Thrones, or divisions of heaven in the Stellar Cult, and in the Zodiac in the Solar. Thus, at first, they represented twelve Stellar Powers, and that is the reason we find the twelve Stones in these Circles. The original characters in the Astronomical Mytho- logy that were given the twelve Thrones, or Camps, with separate and distinctive Banners in Zootype form, in Egyptian are Set, Horus, Shu, Hapi, Ap- uat, Kabhsenuf, Amsta, Anup, Ptah, Atum, Sau, and Hu. These were the Kamite originals, brought on and converted into the Banners of the Twelve Camps, or Tribes, of Israel.

These are to be found"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 217 all over the world wherever the Stellar Cult existed, and appear under various names. The Temples which were built after these were in the form of the so-called \" double square \"—in the form of our Lodges— and all Temples throughout the world, after the circular, were in that form, which has been retained ever since. Another distinctive character between the Stellar and Solar buildings was that all the old Stellar Cult people's buildings were Iconographic. By that I mean the G. A. of the U. and all His attributes were depicted on these Temples in a pre-human form — i.e. Zootype form. Men at this time had not yet learnt to portray the human form as human, and so these types were depicted as snakes, birds, and other Zootype forms. Whereas at the time of the Solar Cult all the attributes of the G. A. of the U. were portrayed in the human form. The transition stage was during the Lunar Cult. These are the differences which will enable you always to distinguish the one from the other, ever remembering that both built with Polygonal stones and monoliths. Another point I might mention is that the cement used by the old Stellar Cult people was much finer than that used by the Solar. Good examples of each are still extant in South Africa and Central and South America. The fineness of this cement has caused many writers and observers to state that there was no"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"218 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY cement used ; but others, of more acute observa- tion, discovered that there was a very fine cement, which was composed of granite very finely ground, or of the same material as the principal stones were composed of. The Secrets of the Mysteries were to teach man how to live here on earth, how to die, and what he had to pass through after death before he could finally enter Paradise, founded on the belief of the death and disintegration of the Corpus, and the Resurrection of the Spiritual Body for eternity. The many eulogies that have been showered upon Sir Oliver Lodge and the Bishop of London, on account of their recent addresses, prove how very little is known of the Old Egyptian Eschatology. In neither of their addresses was there anything new. In fact, the beliefs they ex- pressed are as old as the Pygmies, as I have proved these primitive people believed in a Supreme Being, an after life, and propitiating the Spirits of their departed friends, as well as the elemental powers. During the time that elapsed from the origin of these Pygmies to that grand evolution of Eschatology of the old Hir-Seshta, they had trained Spiritual Clairvoyants to undergo Hypnotism and communicate with departed spirits. This is still practised by some men of the present day, but it is not given to every one. In fact, very few have sufficient courage and patience to"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 219 attain the power, even if they have a good Spiritual Clairvoyant as the connecting intermediary, which is just as rare. Still, they do exist, and the laws of this do not clash with \" science or religion \" —in fact, you must not only \" be religious,\" but also \" scientific \" to attain this power in its desir- able form. Having gained that power, most secrets of the Celestial and Terrestrial worlds are available, or anything else that is right for one to learn. But there are many things beyond a certain point which cannot be explained for want of adequate language or word, and through lack of corresponding Symbol. But, as in the Egyptian Eschatology, it is possible to discover who are amongst the \" blest,\" and who \" have failed to be justified,\" and who have found that the balance, Maat, has weighed against them. It was under- stood that \" no bad people \" on earth could ever attain this knowledge. It was only \" the good people here ' that have sufficient power to send the earthly living Spirit into the Circumpolar Para- dise situated at the North, and have communion with the Blessed there ; to be \" Maa-Kheru,\" to come in and go out, and to whom all doors are open. The old High Priests of Egypt obtained much of their knowledge in this way, but through the past dark ages, since the downfall of the Egyptian Empire, the secrets have been known to only a very few. Scientists are now beginning"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"220 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY to regain some of these secrets, thinking it is a new- phase in the further development of the human brain. But it is not ; it is old, and has been for- gotten by the general masses of Scientists and Priests. But the Ritual of Ancient Egypt will give more knowledge on this subject than all the present Scientists and Divines combined would dare to give, even if they had the knowledge. The wonderful manner in which these ancient ideas have been preserved and carried to distant parts of the world will be seen by a reference to Fig. 78, which represents Tepoxtecatl, the Mexican God of the Axe. From the Mendoza Codex, No. 1 3, we find that the Mexicans, when they began to spread beyond their Valley of Quauhnauac, made war on Tepoxtlan. They were told that this place was called \" The Place of the Axe,\" and that Tepoxtecatl was the God of the Axe, a Great Seer of the Hammer. Fig. 78 is reproduced from the Mexican painting in the Biblioteca Nazionale, Florence, in which the Axe is depicted in two forms, one in his hand, a double axe, and a single axe in front of him.

The Christian Copts (Priests) still use this emblem, but we have lost it. The Axe is supported by the four Children of Horus, with the House of Heaven (also depicted on the Fan) and the House of Earth — i.e. The House of Earth and House of Eternity.

There are not any symbols of the two Horizons here, because this was written during the Stellar Cult, and the two Horizons did not come into being until the early Solar Cult, when they changed Horus God of the North and South, into Atum-Iu, the God of the Double Horizon, East and West, and he became the God of the Four Quarters, in early Solar Cult in a different form from God of the North, South, East, and West of the Stellar.

I do not think any further proof is necessary to show the correctness of these statements, unless perhaps you would consider a quotation from the Ritual of Ancient Egypt necessary.

If we merely consider the tokens of recognition, the passwords, secret words, and the decorations of the Lodges, according to the degrees into which Modern Masonry is divided, we find that many of them are taken from the V. of the S.L., and are symbolical of events, real or imaginary, some of which are said to have taken place in those com- paratively modern times which followed the decline and destruction of the old Egyptian Empire, and marked the commencement of the Christian Era, others as having occurred before the Christian Cult commenced, others at the building of King Solo- mon's Temple.

During the dark and degenerate ages of nearly five thousand years, records were destroyed ; we have no history of the past hundreds of thousands of years of this world's existence. Socialism crept in after the dissensions amongst the Priests them- selves, followed by fire arid sword, and the destruc- tion of literature, arts, and sciences followed. This has always been the history of past great nations. History repeats itself. But our Brotherhood has inherited a sacred legacy ; after being scattered over the face of the earth and water, we have come together again, in spite of the persecution of the Roman Priesthood, and it now rests with the Brotherhood throughout the world to say if we shall in the future establish that one human"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"230 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Brotherhood as of old, founded on the belief of a Divine Creator, and an Eternal and Everlasting Spiritual Life hereafter, grasping the opportunity to consummate that which must be the dream of every Freemason ; or shall we, through dis- sension, apathy, and want of universal combination with our Brotherhood, further postpone it to future generations? The past evolution of the history of the human race has been an object-lesson to remind us that, without the belief in the Divine Creator, our Brotherhood could not remain cemented together.

XI THE FOUR CARDINAL POINTS As the Four Cardinal Points are brought into prominence in the various Masonic Degrees, and as many very erroneous ideas exist as to the origin and meaning of what is taught with regard to them, their real origin, meaning, interpretation, and symbolisms will be of interest here. The full explanation necessitates reference to some of the decipherments I have already given to prove the association of the progressive evolu- tions of the human race, with regard to the Four Cardinal Points. The Old Mystery Teachers of Egypt mapped out, or divided, the Heavens first into two divisions, South and North. The ' Points \" being the two Pole Stars, resting on the Horizons, as seen in the centre of Africa, \" Points which never changed with time,\" represented sym- bolically as Set and Horus, Twins of the Great Mother, \" the Two Primary Gods,\" symbolized by two Poles or Pillars or two Eyes, and sometimes by two Circles. These also represented Light and 33 «"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"232 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY Darkness, also the two Seasons of the Old Egyptian Year. The old Egyptians first divided their year into (i) the Season of Summer Water, (2) the Season of Winter Drought. Also these were called the two original \" Ancient Ones.\" It was at this time the two Cardinal Points— North and South=Set and Horus— \" first came into being.\" The next phase was Heaven being divided into three divisions, or \" triangular form,\" with the God Shu added to the two above, placed at the Equinox, forming the Primary Trinity. These three represented the first three Sons, or Elementary Powers, born of the Great Mother, and symbolized in Egypt in one form by ' The Water Cow,\" the Crocodile, and the Lion : repre- senting (1) Light, (2) Darkness, (3) the breathing power, or Winds. Also they represented the three Seasons, into which the Egyptians had then divided their year— 1 . The water season, represented sym- bolically by Horus ; 2, the season of wind, or breath of life, and of the Equinoctial gales, by Shu ; 3, the season of Dryness and Drought, by Set ; called (1) the Water Season, (2) the Green Season, and (3) the Dry Season. The Signs and Symbols for which were (1) Water, (2) Grow- ing Plants, (3) a Barn or Storehouse indicating that the harvest was gathered. The names in Egyptian for these Seasons are Se, Pir, Semon.

The Egyptian month was divided into three weeks of ten days each, which obviously corresponded to the Heaven of the Triangle, the tripartite Ecliptic and the three Seasons of Egypt. Many other forms of the first three elementary spirits or attri- butes of the G.A.U. might be mentioned, but they do not concern us here. In the next progressive evolution the Old Mystery Teachers divided Heaven into four Quarters, as a Square with four sides, in which may be traced \" four houses.\" This division into four Quarters was first symbolized by a man and then by the crossing of two men, as is proved by the symbols found depicted in the tomb of Nagada (see Fig. 59). This was the origin of the Swastika, which proves this Sign and Symbol to be that of the four Quarters. At the Cardinal Points, North, South, East, and West, of which the latter two had \" now come into existence,\" were stationed the four Brothers or Children of Horus, as the four supporters and protectors of the Four Cardinal Points, and the supporters and bearers of each Quarter. Therefore we find that ' Two Cardinal Points, North and South \" were first formed, or founded, many thousands of years before the other two, namely East and West.

These are the children of Horus who stand on the Papyrus plant, or Lotus, born of water, in the new Kingdom that was founded for the Father by Horus the Son. Two of these children, Tuamutef and Kabhsenuf, are called the two fishes (Ritual, ch. 113), and elsewhere the followers of Horus are the fishers or fishermen. Horus was teacher of the Lesser Mysteries in his first advent, and teacher of the Greater Mysteries in his second advent. And this is the reason why we find Four Cardinal Points in the Stellar Cult, as well as in the Solar, although it has been often overlooked by Egyptologists. But when Shu \" lifted up the Heavens ' (which I have already explained), the Cardinal Points, East and West, were added to the attributes of Horus, as God of the East and West, as well as North and South, and the four Brothers were assigned to these points. These were called Brothers in the Stellar Cult and Children in the Solar. They were four out of the divine circle of twelve which was established first in the Stellar Cult, and in Ritual, ch. 30, they are referred to \"as being on the side Lord of Horus,\" i.e. with him in his youth, or earthly career.

Thus we have the three Primary in the Triangle and four in the Square = the Seven Great Spirits of Heaven and Earth. The new Heaven was thus estab- lished on the Four Quarters that were founded upon the solstices and equinoxes, and These four (1) Hapi, (2) Tuamutef, (3) Kabhsenuf, and (4) Amsta, were stationed at the Four Cardinal Points.

According to Revelation, \" the four living creatures \" are full of eyes round about and within, and they have no rest day and night, as they are moving round for ever with the sphere.

The vignette to Chapter 148 of Ritual portrays them as the four Eyes, or guiding Stars, one to each Quarter, North, South, East, and West. They are spoken of in the Ritual as the Divine Powers = his children or brothers as the four supports of the future Kingdom (Ritual, ch. 112) and the Four Glorious Ones (Ritual, ch. 92).

The Speculative is the Ritual and Eschatological rendering of these seven, and later twelve, Mys- teries in the Stellar, and all the Mysteries in the Solar, the latter being a continuation of the former, as the result of progressive evolution of thought to a higher degree. The orientation of the Speculative Temples was originally South, then North, and finally East ; they corresponded to the changes from the primary god Set at the South Pole to Horus at the North Pole, and then finally changing from North to East in the form of Atum-Iu. With the Operatives their primary orientation for Temples must have been South first and then changed to the North, because their word \" El Shaddai ' signifies Set, God of the South and not the North, although they still carry on this name as God of the North Pole Star.

This I will show a little later by the Symbols they use and their present explanation of them. I have already mentioned {supra) that the Operative Masons first came into existence at the time when the first old priests built their Temples, that these builders of Temples were the \" Ari \" of the seventeenth Nome of Upper Egypt, and in Egyptian were called \" Craftsmen and Com- panions,\" and that they were initiated into the first and second Mysteries only. The Sacred Signs and Symbols were given them as a guide to know- ledge, how to form and build with various angles, circles and other figures, by which the Architect could, by crossing and placing in various positions, portray for their guidance the buildings for the old High Priests. They were initiated into the first and second Mysteries so that they should keep the secrets of these old buildings. The first Temple was that built at Edfu, and no builders were ever allowed to attend to these matters but those of the \" Ari ' in Egypt. They were all naked at first, except a small piece of bark cloth 18"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"258 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY in front, in the form of a triangle. These Opera- tives included all kinds of workmen required to build these Temples — Blacksmiths, Masons, Car- penters, etc. Remnants of these still exist at the present day in Africa, the Kaverondo Blacksmiths, who possess all the old secrets. Whenever an exodus of these old Stellar Cult people from Egypt took place, they were accom- panied by a full complement of these old builders, or Operatives, as well as by a priest. These priests possessed all the secrets of the mathematical and geometrical figures that could be constructed out of, or by placing together, their Sacred Signs and Symbols in various ways, as well as the Eschato- logical explanation of the same. That is the reason we find all the old Temples in Africa, Europe, Asia, Central and South America were built on the same plans during the Stellar Cult. During the Solar these were changed, and that probably accounts for some of the Solar Symbols now used by these old Stellar Cult Masons ; but although they have some of the Solar Cult Symbols, they still use a Stellar application, or definition, as far as they can to them.

The characteristic Solar Cult buildings are well portrayed and may still be seen at Mitla, Oaxaca ; on these we never find any Iconographic figures — but sometimes find human depictions. I mention these two as good examples still extant, but numerous remains of all Temples of both Cults are found in Central and South America and some in Africa. They bonded the corners in Solar Cult, and at the latter part built arches, but these did not come into existence until the Fourth Dynasty. Hence we never find an arch during the Stellar Cult period, but only lintels. The old Operative Masons show by the Triangle and the Swastika how they discovered the art to build arches.

I drew attention to this in an article published in The Freemason, asking the pertinent question, ' Had they succeeded in their object in preventing the then threatened war? \" as I and others had done some years ago with the Brethren of the United States of America, when the question between us was \" Shall there be war, or no war? \" The Brothers decided that there should be no war then, or ever, between England and the United States of America. The question of our overtures of peace and good- will to the Germans has now been answered in the negative— and the Brethren throughout the world will question why ; also what will be the result and 319"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"320 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY outcome of this war as regards the future, and how it will affect the Brotherhood and the nations now taking part in it. Both questions I will answer for my Brothers. There cannot be the least doubt that both the English and French Brethren were anxious for universal peace. The French Brothers more especially were anxious to be acknowledged as being part of the universal Brotherhood, and to be in \"Entente Cordiale \" with the Grand Lodge of England, and we all rejoiced that they, having acknowledged the Great Architect of the Universe, were admitted into our Grand Lodge as such. We know that at the meeting in London of the English, French, and German Grand Represen- tatives, all professed the same universal sentiments of peace and good-will. Although the German Brethren were eulogistic in their sentiments for peace, and professed a wish for closer ties, their after actions proved that in their hearts this was not so ; they were false to the true tenets of the Brotherhood, to the Great Architect of the Universe, and to the doctrines which they so professed to admire. That this was so is shown by the follow- ing : Numerous German Brethren had invited the French Freemasons to take part in the Seventh International Masonic Conference, which was announced to take place at Frankfort on the i 5th and 17th August, 191 4, and the French Brothers were preparing to: meet the German Brothers on"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 321 grounds of conciliation, and to contribute, to the best of their ability, to the elimination of any misunderstandings that existed— such misunder- standings as arm nations against each other. Nothing was held in abhorrence by the English and French Brothers so much as the prospect of a war, which, whatever the result, could not compensate for its atrocities. On the French side, I do not hesitate to declare that they were free from reproach. During the past two years the question of a Franco -German truce had been discussed in every Lodge in France, and in every case reconciliation had been recog- nized as desirable. The French Lodges have become centres for the propagation of universal peace principles, and any recourse to violence has been universally condemned as a crime which no consideration could excuse. For a long time past the three Prussian Grand Masters have shared the secrets of high councils, and here we have an explanation of their hostile attitude to peace, which they assumed when sub- mitting to their Annual Diet of German Grand Masters the following resolution : — It is within the province of Freemasonry to intervene in all phases of human life as a medium of peace and conciliation. It is therefore its duty to bring every civilized 22"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"322 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY people to an understanding of, and respect for, the peculiarities of other peoples, and to prepare a pacific solution of unavoidable conflicts. But the activities of Masonic organizations must be limited in these matters to an educa- tion of their members in the spirit of Free- masonry, so that they may spread the idea of peace as widely as possible. Any other mode of activity would result in political tendencies, to which Masonry, by the terms of its fundamental principles, must remain foreign. It does not, therefore, belong to the domain of Masonry to support directly the modern pacific movement {called Pacificism). Therefore, this Diet of Grand Lodges invites the German Grand Lodges, Lodges, and Masonic Associations, to abstain from expressing any opinion in favour of Pacificism. The Brethren will not be individually for- bidden to adhere to \" Pacificism,\" on con- dition that they are not, on such occasions, to be publicly known as Freemasons. This proposition was opposed by the five non- Prussian German Grand Lodges. The Prussian Grand Masters then thought fit to forbid the Lodges under their several jurisdictions any further"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY 323 official participation in the International Masonic Conference then being held. Was there not in this anti-pacific attitude an exaggerated fear of touching the domain of politics? It appears rather that Berlin knew the projects of the Imperial Government. The latter had decided to crush France, and was acting in consequence. In these conditions, it became very poor politics to cultivate amongst Germans any pacific sentiments. It was solely on political grounds, therefore, that the Prussian Grand Masters affected to eschew politics. It remains to be asked whether this action is \" regular \" and truly worthy of Freemasonry. Emphatically no ! If at times French Masons have been mixed more than necessary in politics, they have nevertheless, as French Masons, always served a noble and dis- interested cause. Can the Prussian Masons, who have knowingly made themselves accomplices of unworthy politics, make the same claim? The least that can be asserted is that German Masonry has not been on a level with its task. This intellectual elite of a nation, proud of its \" Kultur,\" has not been any more enlightened than a crowd. It has multiplied its platitudes towards an autocratic system, which is losing for Germany the benefit of a century of laborious efforts and brave struggles In the full knowledge of the falsifi- cation of the Ems dispatch, the Imperial dynasty"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"324 THE ARCANA OF FREEMASONRY crumbles with the present untruth.

I do not say for one moment that all German Freemasons were of this one mind in Germany, or that there were not a large number of Brothers who wished for the establishment of Universal Brotherhood ; but that the majority, or those in power, as the Governing Body, were not so minded, there can be no doubt. If the whole of the German Brotherhood had combined together as the Americans did, there would have been no such awful calamity as is now taking place ; but they did not, as we well know, and the destruction of the German Empire will be the result.

After this war there will be a great advance in France of Freemasonry, and that country will eventually be governed by the Brotherhood on the lines of the old Stellar Cult Brotherhood, brought up to date without the dogmas of any of the present-day sects. But the Great Architect of the Universe, who has formed the Natural Laws as well as the Spiritual Laws, punishes and destroys those nations and peoples who do not obey these laws, and although poor humanity is ever struggling to attain a higher type, and does so, yet if any one nation does not follow these divine laws it becomes destroyed and ceases to exist as a great nation. That is the past history of the downfall of all great nations without exception, and it will be so again. And what of ourselves, Brothers? We are the greatest nation that exists at the present time. It is a question if we are as great a Brotherhood as existed for at least two hundred thousand years, as the Stellar Cult people did, when the whole of Africa, part of Asia, Europe, America, and Oceania were all of one Brotherhood.
