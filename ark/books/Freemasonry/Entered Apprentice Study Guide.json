Just as in dreams all persons a nd events are aspect s of the dreamer, so in Freemasonry you are the materials, the worker, and the Holy Temple. Most of the moral and spiritual allegorie s of Freemasonry concerning the “making of good people into excellent people” appear in t he Entere d Apprentice degree, and it has been argued that clues to all Masonic Mysteries are gi ven in the symbolism of the First Degree. The three “Blue Lodge” or basic Mas onic degrees represent the growth of a person from spiritual youth to full maturi ty. The Entered Apprentice represents the Masonic “youth” of anew Initiate into Mas onic Mysteries—not as a beginner, for many who join the Mixed Lodge are extremely developed s ouls, but as one who has come newly to t he Egregore and ceremonial of Freemasonry as a legitimate and valid Masonic Initiate. He or she must “incuba te” in the mystic currents of the Lodge in silenc e until certain internal alc hemical pr ocesses have come to fruition, after which advancem ent to the Second or Fellowcraft Degree is done and t he neophyt e is allo we d to speak for him- or herself in Lodge, presen t lectures, and participate at a higher lev el.

The first allegory is a legendary monument erec ted to Hiram Abif by Kings Solomon and Hiram of Tyre after the third burial of his mo rtal remains. It contains sever al important symbols. The second is a summary of Masonic s ymbols inc luding a repr esentation of the Masonic Altar with Sacred Script ure, Compass, and Square, the three Pillar s of Beauty ( Tiphareth , the Central Colu mn), Strength ( Geburah , the Left Column) and Wisdom ( Hochm ah , the Right Column), representing t he Higher Self of a person in the Kabbalistic Sephirotic Tree, centered at the Heart, and shown with candles in the Temple in conjunction with the Three Great Lights of Freemasonry, which are als o represented by Sun, Moon, and the Venerable Master in the East. The Masonic symbolis m that is used in the Blue Lodge or first three degrees owes its specialized use of architectu ral and building motifs to t he unique histor y of European Freemasonry. Although the or igins of it are complex and s hrouded in obscurity, it seems that in addition to the moral and spiritual allegories developed and carried forward in the stone-working and temple-build ing trades from remote antiquity (possibly before Egy ptian and Roman tim es), specific Bib lica l alle gories of Solomo n’s Temp le probably became important by the thirteenth century when t he Knights Templar worked closely with the Companions of the Craft to build the great Go thic cathedrals of Europe. The Templar Knights were deepl y involved in esoteric East ern and Hermetic spirituality interpreted in terms of Christian m ysticism. These elements became part of architectura l design and, therefor e, of t he Operative Craft. After t he persecution of the Knights Templar, many of them may have been hidden and sheltered by members of the Craft. The sudden development of the Rosicr ucian movement and Hermetic sciences (Alchemy, Theurgy, Astrology, etc.) in t he early s eventeenth century in Eng land coincided with the earliest dev elopment of Speculative Freemasonry, which sh ows close alliances with the work of Bacon, Fludd, and the other occult adepts of the period. While we cannot know exac tly how Freemasonry was connected with T emplarism, Rosicrucianism, and other initia tic schools, it is clear t hat much was preserved in Freemasonic symbolis m, and later in the higher degrees. The Candidate is advised t o read and study Masonic symbolis m on his or her own as much as possib le, and to learn about Templarism, Rosicrucianism, and the Hermetic and initiatic sciences of the Western tradition. A major em phasis of the U.S. Mixed Lodg e is revival of the occult study that characterized Freemasonry at it s European inception as a Symbolic or Philosophic al association.

Le wis Keizer The form of initiation used in modern Freemas onry did not originat e with the speculativ e masonry of seventeenth-centur y England. It was carri ed fo rward from antiquity. The Egyptian priesthood developed s acred rites for the guilds of thos e who specialized in architecture and building. Ki ng Solomon sent for mast er architects and building craftsmen from Hiram, King of T yre. From this we hav e the Mas onic legend of Hiram Abif, Master Builder who was murdered by t hree of his workmen. After the Babylonian Exile s ome 500 years later, Jewish men were trained by the Babylonian Master Zerubbabel to rebuild the Second Temple. This establis hed a traditi on of stone masonry in Israel. We are told in the New Testament that Joseph, the father of Jesus, was a technon , “craftsman,” incorrectly translated as “car penter.” There was little wood growing or otherwise availabl e in the Galilee , but much stone. Joseph was u ndoubted ly a stone mason who also specializ ed in stone and wood carvi ng. He would have been a Master of a Jewish guild, and his first-born child Jesus would have been initiated as an Apprentice into that guild, whic h undoubtedly had its own Je wish s piritual in itiations and teachings based on the Babylonian rites. Regarding the form of Masonic in itiation that has come down to us, it seems to be very ancient. Ovid describes Medea as, “...arm, breast, and knee made bare, left foot slipshod,” and Virgil s peaks of Dido, “...now resolute on death, having one foot bare...” (cf. ISIS UNVEILED, Blavatsky, Vol. II, p. 376). This very specific mode of a ttire is well known to any Entered Apprentice Mason. It is the modality of prepar ation in the Rite of Destitution. It is the dress for the candidate in which he or she undertakes initiation while hoodwinked or blin dfolded and led by cable-tow. Here it appears in a description of ancient Greek initiation, which was under stood to be a sa cred death and rebirth, even as today in modern Freemasonry. The initiatic attire of bare knee, bare br east (shoulder), with one shoe off (“slipshod”) are used in Fr eemasonry to represent spiritual poverty, blindness, and captivity to the illusions of the profane wo rld, from which the candidat e seeks liberation and “more Light.” But in the practices of the ancient m ystery religio ns, in which c andidates d ied and were r aised with their gods, and in the identity of their gods, the modality of “arm, breast, knee made bare and one foot slipshod,” th is symbolized t he passing of a spirit into death for the ultimate purpose of being raised an eternal god. It was the ancient modality of the candidate for initiation in the sacred orgies of certain gods. Medea wa s an adept who undertook initia tion and became a demigoddess. The verses of Ovid preserve for us the uni que modalit y that lives on in Freemasonry. There were many mystery cu lts—Eleus inian, Samothracian, etc.—and there were many modalities of dress for a candi date. The standard that we k now from many of them is the simple white cotton robe. But in the inner circles of ancient guilds (medical, warrior , priestly, builders) there were quite differ ent rites not normally preserved to modern 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons times. In the case of builders, architects, and stone-masons, however, we have a notable exception because ther e has always been continuity down history in the skills associated with temple and other building. These skills and their deposit of spiritual guild knowledge have been transmitted from father to son through initiation. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the guild families skilled in pub lic and temple building fled North to Lake Comacine wher e they establish ed a weel-known and protected community. It was these stone -masons and builders who trained and passed on their deposit of kn owledge to European bui lders, and it was they who were called upon by kings and rulers to over see the building of early and la te medieval structures in Europe and Britain. I t was from them that the Compan ions, who worked for the Knights Templar to build the great ca thedrals of Europe, derived t heir training and their o wn guild rituals, survivals of whic h exist in the Old Masonic Charges pr edating the emergence of symbolic or “speculative” Freema sonry in seventeenth- century England. Undoubtedly the reas on t hat we can find s uch spec ific references to the modality of dress used in Masonic initiation as far back as Ovid is that the Freemasonic initiation itself derives from ancient sources. Here be low I show a copy of t he carving s st ill e xtant at Rosslyn Cha pel in Scotland . The artist renders what is carved in the stone more intelligible . It is a man being led by a cable-tow, hoodwinked and caused to kneel on bare knees to swear an oath on a Bible. This dates from a period after t he Knig hts Te mplar were persecuted and many Knights escaped in the Templar fleet to Scotland a nd Portugal, but at least two centuries before the advent of speculativ e F reemasonry. Apparently the Templars had adopted the Masonic initiation through thei r association with the Companions. The implications of this and other relics from Rosslyn Chapel are that Templaris m may hav e been the historical ves sel that res tored the hi gher meanings of prot o-Masonic initiation in the Western mystery tradition of Europe. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons During the mid-seventeenth century, a generation afte r the public ation of the Rosicrucian Confessio , Cromwell’s Puritans had seiz ed control of England. They beheaded King Char les I, successor to King Ja mes, and embark ed upon a campaign of religious s uppression that ri valed the Catholic Inquistion. Originally the Rosicrucian movement, which em erged from Protestant and Hermetic mysticism, had incurred the enmity of the Catholic powers because it sought t he end of Catholic monar chy. But by the time of Cromwell all esoteric movem ents sponsoring alchemical, theurgical, and other Hermetic researches found themselves on the Puritan hit list as well. Cromwell forbade public gatherings for heretical groups. The ans wer was for Rosicrucians, Templars , and Hermetic mystics to gather in pubs under the legal spons orsh ip of t he Masonic guilds, where they were initiat ed first as aristocratic protectors of Fr eemasonry, and finally as “spec ulativ e” (i.e., philosoph ical) Freemasons. The building tradesmen or “oper ative” Masons now protected their historical aristocratic s ponsors, under whose protecti on they had built the great cathedrals of Europe. Under the cloak of Masonic secrecy, the Speculativ e Masons were able to share alchemical and other re search. Freemasonry as we know it today— not as a building tr ade, but as a moral -metaphysical initiat ic fraternity—began in seventeenth century Scotland a nd England as a clandestine pr e-scientific and esoteric society. Today in Europe, Freemasonry retains its a nonymity. There are no signs indicating the location of a Masonic Lodge as t here are in America. Even t he d oor to the lodge is no t marked. By contrast, The Unit ed States was founded by Master Masons—George Washington, Ben Franklin, and many others. Most U.S. Preside nts were h igh-degree Masons for the first two centuries, and Ma sonic idea ls suc h as citizen elections , democratic government, brotherhood, equality were written into the U.S. Constitution. Even U.S. currency retains Freemasonic sy mbols and imagery. So Masonic lodges are identified by large signs and there is nothing at all clandestine about Freemasonry in the United States. The enmity that Catholicis m and Protestant f undamentalism have for Freemasonry lives on today. Rumors of scandal, conspiracy, and se cret world domination by t he “illuminati” of the Masons are f abricated and spread to the faithful by priests, clergy, and lay leaders. However, most Masonic rites and t eachings are deeply Christian and based o n Biblical stories. Systems of higher degrees like the York Rit e are totally Christian—suc h that Jews and Buddhists cannot feel comfor table and instead choose Sc ottish Rite, which is a lso Christian in orientati on, but less “in your face” about it.

Sinc e World War II Ameri can Masonry was no longer dom inated by educated int ellectuals, but by blue collar workers who knew little if anything of their roots in esoteric Freem asonry. Not only that, but Masonry was a “men’s mystery,” no women allowed, and I was strongly com mitted to male-female equality and partnership. Finally, Masonry was practiced in a racis t way. Very few non- whites wer e ever admitted. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons In 1991 Bishop George Boyer conferred upon me as Grand Master of T:.H:.G:., the Temple of the Holy Grail, all char ters, warrants, and authorities for the Pansophic Rites of Freemasonry. Thes e were a synthesis of Ultra-Masonic and esoteric Masonic orders that were no longer sponsor ed and practiced in late 19 th -century Freemasonry. They represented some twenty-two esoteric Her metic, Rosicrucian, T emplar, and Egyptian initiatic schools of Europe t hat had, at one time or an other, been adapted for Masonic higher degr ees. Boyer had rec eived the authorit ies from Richard, Duc de Palatine, who had receiv ed them from authorized succes sors of John Yarker, who had c ollected them in the late 19 th century. However, for me to activa te them, I was required to be a Master Mason. In 1995 I moved to Bellingham, Washingt on, as founding headmaster for a new priv ate high school. My eye was caught by a sm all notic e in a loc al news paper for the Fairhaven Masonic Lodge. Spirit urged me to vis it the lodge , which I did. As I looked through the exhibits and scrapbooks of lodge ac tivit y, I was happily surprised to see members and their c hildren of many races. As I made more inquiries of the friendly people there, I learned somethin g that convinced me now was the time and place t o become a Master Mason. You see, not long after the founding of the Un ited States, African Americans establish ed their own lodges—the Prince Hall Lodges. Until very recently they were not accepted by the “white” Masonic lodges. In the 1980-90’s, t he lodge into whic h I chose to be in itiated in Bellingham worked with the Grand Lodge of W ashington Stat e and the Britis h Columbia Grand Lodge to advoca te for and successf ully in itiate acceptanc e of Prince Hall Masonry, which is now beginning to achi eve such recognition in many other states for the first time. I found a sponsor, and by the end of the academic year I was rai sed a Master Mason at Fairhaven Lodge of F. &A.M.. Howeve r, there was one part of my advancem ent rite I did not like—the anti-co-masonic vow, in which I promised never to initiate a woman as a Mason. Our lodge was vis ited from ti me to time by the Grand Master of a Frenc h Masonic lodge. He was alway s greeted warmly and acco rded Grand Honors, sitting in the East. He and I engaged in a conversation after my raising as a Master that led to a significa nt collaboration. I complained to him about the anti-co-masonic vow. He rev ealed to me that his was a “mixed” or male-female lodge in Fr ance—one of the several major Masonic obedienc es of the French Grand Ori ent. I knew that my vow had been made a s a member of F.&A.M., and that French and American Masonr y were in amity (unlik e French and Englis h) because of political relations during the American Rev olutionary War. I asked if I could join the Loge Mixte de France , where there was no anti-co- masonic vow and to work with, and initiate, fe male Masons would not break my A.&F.M. vow, as it would be in a different Masonic “obedi ence” or denomination. We began a long collaboration in which he read my w ritings, took them back to France, and finally communicated to me that not only was I welcome to become a member, but the Grand Lodge was considering whether to install me as Grand Master of a new American grand lodge of the Fr ench Mixed Lodge.

At their own expense, t he nine officers of the Grande Loge Mixte de France flew out to California and interviewed me and Bro. Ken K each. After their retu rn to P aris, I was notified that they had decided to offer me the office of Grand Master of the new Grand Lodge to be established in Sant a Cruz if I could assemble se ven Masters to help “light up” the lodge. What would we like to name it? Since our or ientation would be esoteric, we chose the name St. Germain. The same group of Grand Lodge officers again, at their own expense, flew out to California in August, 1997, and worked wit h us all day to set up a proper lodge at the school I had recently built—Popper-Keizer Honors Sc hool. The s even Masters present were me, Ken Keach, Eugene Whitworth, Alberto LaCava, Woody LaCava, Michael Hollenbeck , and Joan Asturizagga. The wo men were Masters in Co-Masonry. At the establishment of the lodge and my installation, we also initiated my future wife Willa Ester son, Tim Storlie, and Deborah Storlie. The officers of the Grand Loge Mixte de France (GLMF) left us with a Constitution, the Frenc h Alchemical Rites, and specific guidelines for capitation (fees). During the following months the new Grand Lodg e St . Germain collected and returned fees to Pa ris, purchased swords and other ritual paraphernalia, and developed it translations of the French rites. Howev er, three of our Masters resigned bec ause they felt the fees were too high, and for other reasons. Communic ation with the French Grand Lodge wa s extremely difficult. We sought direction after the resignation of the three M asters, but GL MF email addresses did not work, telephone num bers were changed or not answered, and the fax number didn’t work. We s ent the capitation funds to the GL MF bank, but it was for the four remaining Masters, not the full seven. Our communic ations abo ut this were never ac knowleged. When we finally hear from them, the Grand Lodge officers were apparently under extreme pressure from growing disapprov al by opponents and their constituents, who were running to replace them in the electi on that fall. Among th e disputed issues—the American Grand Lodge. We were reprimanded for being short with our capitation payments, and a few months later receiv ed notice that the GLMF was formally withdrawing our charter. Shortl y thereafter, as I was told, all or most of the Grand Lodge officers who had dedicated lodge funds to starting the Americ an lodge were voted out of office, and we lost any contact with them. When we received notice that the charter was being withdrawn, we investigated our options. We found that histor ically there were two ways that a new Masonic obedienc e had been established: 1. by charter from nobility, and 2. by unanimous v ote of all Masters of the lodge to withdr aw and reorganize themselves as a new obedience (this was the case with French Co-Masonry or the “Human Rights” Grand Lodge of France, which established male-female Theos ophical Masonry in the late 19 th century). We decided to do both. We voted unanimously t o accept my proposal to establish ourselves as Grand Lodge St. Germain of Pansophic Fr eemasonry, and we prevailed upon Coun t 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons George Boyer to grant us a Pansophic char ter—which made sense becaus e it was he who had or iginally pas sed the authorities on to me. During the winter of 1997 I had put up a web site announcing the new Grand Lodge and conducted hours of conversations with high-r anking Masons from around the country, including Alexandria, Virginia, and a repr esentative of the Ca lifornia Grand Lodge of F.&A.M. I knew that the I.R.S. had gone after ot her mal e-only organizations like the Elks and forced them to open their me mbership to women or lo se non-profit tax status. American Masonry had been preparing its legal defense for th is kind of challenge, whic h it knew would eventually arise. Many high -ranking Masons secretly supported what I was doing. They felt that either 1. a new outlet for fe male Freemasonry would take pressure off the mainline obedienc es, or 2. without the admi ssion of women, Freemasonry was withering away; it is time to change the rules. The final r esolution of all this negotiation was, “Don’t ask; don’t tell.” If regular Masons chose to at tend Pans ophic, they won’t ask, and we won’t tell. In other words, Pansophic will not op erate as a clandestine organization, but it will protec t the confide ntiality of its brother and sister Masons. It will not release or reveal its membership records, and the mainline Masonic obediences will not attempt to investigate membership. That is how it remains today. Our female Masters will probably be recognized in Co-Masonry an d Memphis-Mizraim, but not in the traditiona l male obediences. W e have yet to see ho w our male Masters will be treated. In fall of 1998 I traveled to Australia and insta lled Bro. Elias Ibrahim as Grand Master of the Australian Grand Lodge, and the next year Bro. Dennis Delo rme as Grand Master of the Canadian Grand Lodge. However, Pansophic Freemasonry did not grow. We wer e too few and far between. It was nearly im po ssible to open a lodge of s even masters because of geographical separat ion. We experimented with online an d virt ual lodge meetings, but the technology availabl e in 1997-1999 was not easy to use. Two years after our establishment , I (Bro. Keiz er) automatically rotated to the position of Past Grand Master and Bro. Eu gene Whitworth rotated to t he position of Grand Master. Howev er, he had a stroke that incapacitated him for nearly two years. Pansophic did not grow. Finally in the fall of 2003, I proposed a solution to help Pansophic grow. Knowing that in the eighteenth century ther e had been a tradition of adept grand masters appointed b y nobility who did private initia tions (although this practic ed ceas ed as democratically elected gr and masters became the norm), I proposed that any Master of the Grand Lodge St. Germain could pr ivately accept (with agreement of two other Masters), train, initiate, and advanc e new members if a lod ge quorum could not be assembled. He/she would cons titute a Conventicle which c ould operate as a surrogate lodge until enough Masters had been r aised in his/her immediat e geographical location to carry on full lodge activ ities. As the Conventicle produc es more Masons of any degree, it can operate ritually closer and closer to regular lodge rites —i.e., more officers will exist to operate the rites.

Is this true? 17 th Centur y: THE ANCIENT L ANDMARKS Proof that w omen were made Mas ons in ancient operative lodges Let us begin with the historic al record. The following was sent to me by Brother Bill Edwards in 1995. It consists of a short excerp t from a long talk that the Very Worshipful and Rever end Neville B. Cryer, Past Provincial Grand Mast er of Surrey, Past Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of England, C hairman of the Heritage Committee of York, and member of the Quator Coronati Lodge of Research, gave to the Finger Lakes Chapter of the Philalet hes Societ y in March, 1995. WO MEN AND FRE EMASONRY BY V:. W.: and Rev. NEVILLE B. CRYER MASONIC TIMES, May, 1995, Rochester, New York In 1693 we have the York Manuscrip t No. 4, belonging to the Grand Lodge of York, which relates how when an Appr entice is admitted the ‘elder s taking the Booke, he or she or _shee_ [sic] that is to be made Ma son shall lay their hands thereon, and the charge shall be given. ’ Now I have to tell you, that my predecessors in Masonic Research in England from Hughen and Vibert and from all the r est onward, have all tried to pretend that the ‘shee’ is merely a misprint for ‘they.’ I now am the Chairman of the Heritage Committee of York. I know thes e documents; I’ve examined them, and I’m tellin g you, they say ‘she,’ without any question. Of course, we have a problem, haven’t we ; to try to explain that. My predecessors would not try to explain this; t hey were too male oriented. T he fact remains that, there it is, in an ancient doc ument of a 17 th century date. That this could have been the cas e seems all the more likely as that in 1696 two widows are named as members in the Operative masons Court. Away in the South of England, we read in 1714 -- that’s before the Grand Lodge of England— of Mary Bannister, the daughter of a barber in the town of Barking, being apprenticed as a Mason for 7 years with a fee of 5/ - which she paid to the Company. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons 18 th Centur y: WOMEN AS SP ECULATIVE MASONS Women Freemasons prior to the formati on of the Grand Lodge of England Turning next to the s ubjec t of actual cases of women who wer e made M asons in speculativ e rather than operative lodges, there is quite a bit of evidence to support the contention that this was at one time permitted. The most famous (and best-documented) of these wo men Masons was Mr s. Aldworth, made a Mason in t he 1700s. Here is a brief account of her Masonic career, as written in 1920 by Dudley Wright and posted to the internet in 1994 by William Maddox. WO MEN FREE MASONS BY BRO. DUDLE Y WRIGHT, ENGLAND THE BUILDER, August 1920 Although the Antient Charges forbid the admiss ion or initiation of women into the Order of Free and Acc epted Mas ons, there are known instance s where as the result of accident or sometimes design the rule has been broken and women have been duly initiated. T he most prominent instance is that of the H on. Elizabeth St. Leger, or, as she afterwards became, on marriage, the Hon. Mrs. Aldworth, who is refe rred to sometimes, though erroneous ly, as the “only woman who ov er obtained the honour of initiation int o the sublime mysterie s of Freemasonry.” The Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger was a daughter of the first Viscount Doneraile, a resident of Cork. Her father was a very z ealous Freemason and, as was the custom in his time—the early part of t he eighteenth c entury - held an occas ional lodge in his own house, when he or she wa s assisted by members of his own family and any brethren in the immediate neighborhood and visitors to Doneraile House. This lodge was duly warranted and held the number 150 on the Regi ster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland. The story runs that one evening previous to the in itiation of a gentleman named Coppinger, Miss St. Leger hid herself in the room adjoining the one used as a lodgeroom. This room was at that time under going s ome alterations and Miss St. Leger is said to have removed a brick from th e partition with her scissors and through the aperture thus created witnessed the ceremony of initiation. What she saw appears to have disturbed her so thoroughly that she at once determined upon making her escape , but failed t o elude the vigilanc e of the tyle r, who, armed with a s word stood barring her exit. Her shrieks alarmed the members of t he lodge, who came rushing to the spot , when they learned that she had witnessed the whole of the ceremony which had just been enac ted. After a consider able disc ussion and yielding to the entreaties of her brother it was dec ided to admit her into t he Order and she was duly initiated, and, in course of ti me, became the Master of the lodge. According to Millik en, the Irish Masoni c historian, s he was initiated in Lodge No. 95, which still meets at Cork, but there is no rec ord extant of her reception into the Order. It is, however, on record that she was a subscr iber to the Irish Book of Constitutions , which appeared in 1744 and t hat she frequently attended, w earing her Masonic regalia, entertainments that were giv en under Masonic auspices for the benefit of the poor and 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons distressed.

In his talk to the chapter of the Phil alet hes Societ y, cited above, Neville B. Cryer described the well-known partic ulars of the initiation of Elizabeth St. Ledger (later Elizabeth Aldworth) as a Speculat ive Maso n—and he or she noted that this occurred in 1712, before the Grand Lodge of England was formed—and thus before it w as declared that the exclusion of women was an “anc ient landmar k,” and a s top was put to female participation in the Craft. Numerous other examples of females joining Masonic lodges could be given here (Cryer and Wright cite several each), but la ck of space forbids. The pattern set by Elizabeth Aldworth—of rare and exceptio nal cases of women being made Masons— was the norm from the time of the es tablishment of the GLoE until the 19 th centur y advent of Co-Masonry, a mixed- gender order of the Craft. 19 th Centur y: THE DEVELOPM ENT OF CO-MASONRY A brief history of mixed- gender orders of Freemasonry Here is a history of the Co-Masonic fraterni ty as supplied by Brot her Wright and posted to the internet by Brother Maddox: CO- MASO NRY BY BRO. DUDLE Y WRIGHT, ENGLAND THE BUILDER, November 1920 In 1879 several Chapters owning allegian ce to the S upreme Council of France of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, at the instigation of the Grand Orient, seceded from that allegience and recons tituted themselves as La Grande Loge Sy mbolique de France. One of these Chapters, beari ng the name of Les Libres P enseurs, meeting at Pecq, a village of Seine et Ois e, in November 1881, proposed to in itiate into Freemas onry, Mlle. Maria Desr aimes, a well-known writer on Hu manitarian and wom en suffrage questions, which they did on 14 th January, 1882, for which ac t the Lodge or Chapter was suspended. Mlle. Desr aimes was instrumental in bringing into the ranks of Freemasonry several other well-known women in France, with the result that an Androgynous Masonic body, known as La Grande Loge Sy mbolique Ecossaise was formed on 4 th April, 1893 although it s jurisdiction at that time exte nded over only one lodge, that known as Le Droit Humain, which came into bein g on the sa me day, and wh ich, in 1900, adopted the thirty degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. One of the princ ipal workers in the formation of this new Grand lodge was Dr . Georges Martin, at one time a member and of the Lodge Les Libres Penseurs. The schismatic movement spread to Paris and Benar es afterwards to London, at which last- named place, in Sept ember, 1902, the Lodge “H uman Duty,” now No. 6 on the Co- 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons Masonry Register, was consecrated.

In 1918, accordi ng to Neville Cryer, Elizabeth St. Leger Aldworth’s direct desc endent, Alicia S t. Leger Aldworth, joined the mixed-gender order. By 1922, there were more than 450 Co-Masonic lodges around the world, acc ording to Masonic historian Ar thur Edwa rd Waite, writing in “The New Enclyclopedia of Freemasonry.” There are at present Co-Masonic lodges in at least 50 nations , including the U.S., Canada, Britain, Australia, Greece, Holland, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Belgium, and Venezuela. Androgynous jurisdictions worl dwide inc lude Le Dr oit Humain, based in France, and the American Feder ation of Human Right s, based in the U.S.A.

Lewis Keiz er] GLMF CONSTITUTION Article One: The Grand Mixed Lodge of France is an essentially humanistic, philosophic al, and socially progressive instit ution. It takes as its objectives the search for truth, the study of mora lity, and the practice of solid arity [i.e., mutual support and charitable relief, as in American Freemasonry ]. It works toward material and moral improvement for the intellectua l and social perfection of hum anity. It is based upon the principle of Mutual Toleration, respecting ot hers as well as one’s self. It proclaims the principle of Diversity in opposition to sect arianism and most not ably to all dogmatic influenc e. It defers to the abs olute Freedom of Cons cience, that is, the right of eac h Mason to believe in any particu lar revealed truth [i.e., religi on], or not to believe. [A century ago, the French Grand Orient opened Fr eem asonry to all men of principle b y affirming the right of each person to accept and practic e any form of religion, including non-western forms lik e Buddhis m that do not worship a personal God in t he sense of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic theism, and including st rict atheistic humanists, according t o the conscience of many scientists and social progressives. For this reason the “G” representing God or G eometry is often replaced by the “Eye ” in their symbology. Belief in a Supreme Being is expanded to belief in a Supreme Reality, thus allowing all men of 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons conscienc e to participate in Freemasonry wit hout sacrificing the e ssential m orality and mystery of the Craft. This is a position that must be adopted throughout Freemasonry if it is to bec ome a world-wide, cr oss-cultural institution. GLMF has taken this reform to its logic al, moral, and spiritual conclusion by opening Freemasonry in total equality t o women.] It has this motto: Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity . [Since the French language is practically impossi ble to compose with gender-i nclusive language, as we can do in English, because even the arti cles have gender, Mixed Ma sonry us es masculine forms like “fraternity” to include “sorority” and “master” to include women masters. American Mixed Mas onry will ev entually de velop its use of inclusive Englis h, but women Master Masons wi ll probably prefer “master” to “mistress” or “maestra,” since thos e words perpetuate sexist social identities inappropri ate for contemporary women; for example, a female Concertmaster in a sy mphony orchestra is not called a Concertmistress.] A B RIEF HISTORY The mixed obediences were inaugurat ed in France during the year 1893 by the acceptance of a women, Maria Deraismes, to the male lodge called The Fre e Thinkers of Pecq, which was attached to the most pr ogressive obedience of the age, the Grand Scottish Sy mbolic Lodge. At that time, mi xed French M asonry was opposed by all other obediences , foreign and French, because in t hat age women did not have significant social stature. The first French mixed gr and lodge was created in 1913, but the war of 1914 did not permit the expected development to occur. The Grande Loge Mixte de France, spiritual heir of the 1913 grand lodge, de liberately takes it s place in the lin eage of liberal obediences in the masonic curr ents of France and in the environment of universal F rench Masonry. [Unlike Americ an and English lodges, which do not allow politic al discussion during lodge activities because each lodge contains liberal and conservative members, the French lodge s and even entire obediences are often organized by political philoso phy—liberal or conservative. One high ideal of French Freemasonry is the responsibility of each member to participate in political p rocess. For example, after the Vatic an had publically encour aged anti-masonic views, the grand lodges of three Frenc h obedienc es recently dem onstrated in full Masonic regalia against a papal vis it to France. This would never be done by U.S. or Englis h Freemasons.] ITS PRINCIPLES Inasmuch as it is a liberal obedience, the Mixed Lodge refers in its Constitution to the betterment of society as a necessity simu ltaneous with the indiv idual perfection of its members. It upholds the abs olute freedom of individual consc ience, suc h as the the right of each person to practice a religion of hi s or her choice, or to practice no religion. It promotes the rights of diversity or pluralis m within social ethics, such that it is oppos ed to all forms of societal discrim ination [i.e. rac ism, as well as prejudice or discrimination by gender, sexual pr eference, age, religion, etc.], and is especially opposed to all influenc es of [religious or politic al] dogmat ism. Being nationally unified and constituted according t o the French Rite that is practiced in all its official ceremonies, it also hosts lodge meet ings of div ers traditional rites that eac h lodge is at liberty to chose for itself. [Each lodge is sovereign with respect to t he rites it uses. It has been admitted to activ e membership in CLIPSAS [an internationa l confeder ation of M asonic hig her degree s which is now undergoing reorganization], an organiz ation for international coordination 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons or liberal obediences. [Mem bers of the Mi xte Lodge, which is a Blue Lodg e of the first three degrees, have access to the higher degrees t hrough inte rnational agreements with other sovereign obediences.] A PLURALISTIC STRUCTURE France hosts many different Masonic obe diences, some restricted to men, some to women, and some that acc ept both men and women into their lodge meetings—the mixed or c o-masonic orders. The Grande Mixed Lodge of France permi ts its lodges t o freely constitute their membership—male, female, or mixed, each according to the choice of those who constitu te the lodge. T he Grand Mixed L odge of France is the only French Masonic obedience that permits these choices of open structure for each lodge, which is an innovation in the French Masonic scheme. A DEMOCRA TIC STRUCTURE In an obedience like the Gr and Mixed Lodge of France all f unctions are elec tive, none appointed, and eac h is elected by the members. The funda mental group fun ction is a lodge com posed of men and women gathered to dis cuss contemporary problems an d search out their solutions, bot h individually and colle ctively. Delegates elected from the lodges ass emble together to communally define the great t hemes of reflection for the obedience. [Each year the Gr and Lodge asks all the constituent lodges t o devote time to the solution of specific problems.] A Counc il of the Order of the obedience has the role of engagement and coordina tion among the lodges, but not their direction. [Eac h lodge is sovereign wit h respect to membership, focus, and ritual.] SELF-IM PROVEM ENT THROUG H CONT ACT WITH OTHERS Too often in contemporary life one’s contac ts are limited to profession al associat es and friends. Belonging to a Masonic lo dge allows men and wo men to expand their horizons, whether social, economi c, professional, polit ical, or cultural, sharing together their ideas in a group [”on t he level”] apart from which they might never have such encounters . Each lear ns from the other, wit hout anyone being obliged to adopt his or her thought. BUILDING THE SOCIETY OF T OMORROW T OGETHER In a period in whic h individuality prevails , youth with its generous ideas of social harmony, and of the absence of racial or sexual segregation, aspires to a truly just and interdependent society. It is tow ard the buildi ng of this society for tomorrow that Frenc h Masons work in a relations hip totally in dependent from social powers and political institutions, studying in thei r lodges by us ing the means of wor k in which men and women maintain highly frat ernal and inclusive c ollaboration to mitigate agains t intellectual, economic, and dogm atic narro w-mindedness. These Masonic lodges ar e laboratories for ideas about future society. SYMBOLISM A symbol stands for or suggests something else by reason of relationship or convention. Or, a symbol c an be said to be a vis ible sign of something invis ible, as an idea, a quality. For example, a stop sign is a symbol which, by convention, t ells a drive r 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons to apply the brakes and stop. A stop sign als o is a symbol of traffi c rules an d regulations and, third, it is a vis ible s ign of the idea of or derly traffic flow, safety, and other “invisible” ideas. Each symbolic Masoni c ceremony offers s o much more than meets the eye at the time, that a study of the subject is intriguing as we find new meanings while following our search. Where our Ritual Ca me From Classicists, philologists, and historians of religions know that the initiatic rituals of Freemasonry are very ancient. T he rituals of Discalceation , Destit ution, the Cable Tow, and nearly all other as pects of Freemasonic Initiation can be found in ancient Egyptian, Near East ern, and Brahmanical initiatiator y ritual. The symbols of Freemasonry are those of ancient Greek, Roman, and ev en more ancient temple builders. It is clear that the rites and symbols of European Freemasonr y have descended from far more ancient brotherhoods and sis terhoods, although t he Ma sonic romances about direct lineages from Solomonic or Egyptian “f reemasonry” are not historical. Masonic “research” in earlier cent uries made unrealistic claims ab out the antiquity of European Fr eemasonry that have s ince been corrected, but the work of people like Brother John Yarker, who examines pre-Masonic initiation, is receiving renewed interest. The origins of Eur opean Masoni c Ritual are lost in the mi st of seventeenth-century history. There is muc h evidence link ing the development of Specul ative or Philosophical and Non-Operative Fr eemasonic lodges wit h adepts like Lor d Francis Bacon and the early Rosic rucians of England. It is accepted by researchers that at least two degrees were as early as 1659. Three degrees are fi rst mentioned in 1726. The compiler of the English Rit ual was u ndoubted ly William Pres ton. This Ritua l has been refined an d polis hed, without being basic ally changed in character in the nearly two cent uries since Preston first used it in London. Before that time the European Ritual was a continuation of the practices and customs of the day-to-day work of t he Operative Freemason. The emphasis gradually shifted from the practical to moral and spiritual v alues as the Accepted, Speculativ e, or Non- Operative Masons began to outnumber the Oper ative brethren in t he Lodges. In early days there may have been only one Degree and a Ma ster’s part, which covered all of the areas now separated into three degrees—m oral (Entered Apprentice), intellectua l and mathematical skills (Fellowcraft), and the highe r privileges and skills of a Free Mason (Master). Late r , three Degrees were used. In 1813, the United Grand Lodge of England declared and pronounced that pure Ancient Masonry consists of three degrees and no more, those of the Entere d Apprentice, the Fellow Craft, an d the Master Mason, including the Supreme Order of the Holy Roy al Arch. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons PART I TRADITIONAL I NSTRUCTION I N PREPARATI ON FOR THE E.A.

Answ ers to all questions in or der a re to be found in the lessons. The Hol y Saints John Freemasonry, long ago, chose as its patro n saints, John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. By doing this, the Brethren were st arting a tradition that their patron saints belonged t o a Lodge and this Lodge must have been in the city of Jerusalem. By this tradition, all Lodges s ymbolically came fr om one at Jerusalem and therefore, every Mason hails from such a Lodge. By coming from this mystical lodge he or she proves that he or she hails from a “j ust and lawfully constituted Lodge.” Biblically, John the Baptist’ s martyrdom is an example of unshaken firmness to the principles of right and an inflexible fidelit y to God. John the Evangelist constantly admonished cultivation of brotherly love. T he mysticism of his visi on undoubtedly led to the inclus ion of him, along with John the Bapt ist, as Patron Saints of Masonry. One was educated, one was zealous. Both were Godly, both were virtuous. According t o the Charter of Larmenius (whi ch may contain authent ic portions extant from early medieval times, especially those sections in Greek), the Knigh ts Templar received c landestine Apostolic Succession from the Gnostic Johannite Church of Asia Minor. If Freemasonry contains some part of the traditions of the Knights T emplar, as many historians think, the Johannine h agiology may have originated among the Johannite Gnostics of the Byzantine Empire. In any cas e, the Holy Saints Mary--the Mother of Jesus and the Magdalene—are the feminine t ypes of the same s ymbolic m eani ng in Christian t radi tion. Many other counterparts, male and female, can be adduced from all spir itual traditions. European Freemasonry, however, arose in the context of Christian Bibl ical s ymbolism, and that is the reason for the reference to the Holy Sain ts John in Freemasonic ritual. Like the Holy Bible, however, these saints represen t greater universal meanings than those of cultural Chr istianity and mu st be understood as such. The Candi date Must First Be Prep ared Within His or Her Heart The heart is the center of humanity’s affect ions, afflictions, and desires. If one is clean and clear within, hi s or her life will r eflect that c ondition, but the reverse is als o 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons true. Freemasonry is conc erned with the buildin g of character in one’s life. Working toward this goal must begin withi n one’s hear t for, if the heart is not ready, Masonry cannot expect to make an impressi on on the mind. True in terior understanding and wisdom develops from within the heart. Therefore, each candidate who comes seeking light must be prepared in his or her heart, and that is where a Mason is first initiated. The Preparation Room: The Chamber of Reflection Symbolic ally and literally, worldly wealth and honors are not require d to join a Lodge. All your material pos sessions are left in the preparation room and you enter, or are reborn, with neither more nor less than all Masons who have gone before you. Your entrance is accomplis hed by form, ceremonies, actions and words to impress on your mind wise and serious truths. Most are based on truths found in world s criptures and great philosophical works. The candidate must sit al one in silence and darkness surrounded by Masonic symbols of mortality and mysti c philosophy in order to meditate upon the deeper interior meanings that Masonic In itiation has for him or her. This is the function of the Cham ber of Reflection. Dul y and Trul y Prepared Being duly and truly prepared refers to the w earing of special garments furni shed b y the Lodge in order to emphasize our concern with a man’s inte rnal qualities rather than his worldly wea lth an d honors. By wearin g the gar ments of humility, the candidate signifies the sincerity of his intentions. Ask and You Shall Receive The spiritual promise becomes a reality - “Ask and you shall receive; Seek and you shall find,- Knock and it s hall be opened unto you. “ 1. You asked for membership bec ause Ma sonry does not believ e in coercive solic itation. 2. You sought admission of your own free will. 3. After you knocked, all that Freemasonr y is obligated to offer was opened to you. The Hoodw ink The Hoodwink represents t he darkness in which an uninitiat ed man st ands as regards Masonry. Its removal suggests that we do not consc iously know the great things of life, but discover and realiz e them —sometimes as revelation. They always exist, regardless of the bli ndness of any indiv idual. Also, had y ou become refractory and refused to participate in the ceremonies of the degree - you may have been led out of the Lodge without having beheld the interior thereof. The Cable-Tow The Cable-Tow is a sy mbol of the ex ternal restraints whic h are plac ed upon the life of man. It has been c ompared symbolica lly with t he u mbilica l cor d necessar y to begin life, cut when love and c are replace its need after bi rth. Masonically, it is purely symbolic, and its length differs for various brethren. It is now almost universally considered the 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons scope of a brother’s ability. It also symboliz es the voluntary and comple te acceptance of whatever Freemasonry may have in store; its removal, after obligati on, indicates that thi s symbol is no longer needed, since the candidate has assumed the irrevocable ob ligat ion of the degree. The Rite of Discalceation Bein g uns hod, that is, taking o ff ones shoes , symbolizes humility an d that we ar e about to walk on clean or holy ground. This ri te is found in the Bi ble (Exodus 3:5, God said to Moses, “put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground “ And in the Book of Ruth, “...A man pluck ed off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testim ony in Israel. “ You have walke d the same path as millio ns before you throughout the centuries. They have been judged, as will you, not by worldly wealth and honors but by humility, faith and sincerity. The Entrance The entrance into the Lodge includes everyt hing that happens at the Inner Door and is intended to teach the impor tance of initiation as th e symbolic birth of the cand idat e into the world of Masonry. You knocked on the door which was an swered from within. After you and your guide ans wered sev eral questions, you were admitted into the Lodge. The ceremony of entrance signifies birth or initiation and symboliz es the fact that the candidate is entering a new world, the worl d of Freemasonry, there to live a new and perhaps different life. T he sharp instrument symboliz ed the one real penalty f or violation of the obligation, t he destructive consequenc es to a man for being faithless to his vows, untrue to his trust, which is moral-sp iritual d eath or failure. This is symbolize d by the E.A. (Entered Apprent ice) hand-sign used in the Lodge, which is known as the “deux guard.” PART II THE CE RE MONY The Recep tion The reception of the c andidate into the Lo dge room is intended to symbolize that the obligations he or she wil l ass ume are solemn, and there is a penalty if they are violated. It also reminds man that everything he or she does has a consequence, eit her in the form of rew ard or penalty. Form of a Lodge The form of a Lodge is a rectangle. It ext ends in length from East to West and in breadth from the North to South. The Ea st in a Masonic Lodge does not necessarily mean the actual point of the compass. The East in the Lodge is the station of the Worshipful-Master from which he or she di spenses light and instruction to all his 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons Brethren. The other poi nts, West, South, and North are lo cated in proper relation to the station of the Master. Pra yer No person should ev er enter upon any great or important undertaking without first invoking Divine Blessing. Pr ayer is an important part of Freemasonry. Lodges are always opened and closed with a pr ayer and prayer is often used in our ceremonies. Our prayers are always non-sec tarian and not specific ally J udeo- Christian, as we offer our supplic ations to the “Gr eat Architect of the Univ erse” or “The Supreme Grand Master.” We understand the Di vine Presence to include Hierarchy, higher worlds, an d intermediary beings such as angels, bodhis attvas, ascended mas ters, avatars, and the divine guides of humanity--all of which is in tended in the monis tic prayer to the Great Architect. Thus prayer is meaningful in Ea stern, Western, philo sophical, and shamanic spiritual traditions. Although a belief in the Judeo-Christian God is not required for Masonic m embership, the Freemason must be a philos ophical moni st who recognizes the need and benefit of communion with a Higher Nat ure than his or her own ordinary conscious mind. The Rite of Circuma mbulation Circumambulation means to walk around some central point or object. In Masonry the act is patterned after the mo vement of the sun as it is seen from the earth in the northern hemisphere, moving from East to West by w ay of the S outh. The candidate’s journey around the altar enables the Brethr en to observe that he or she is properly prepar ed. He or she is stopped in t hree locations, a reference to the three gates of King Solomon’s Temple, to be examined as to his intentions and fitness to continue. Masonic lif e is shown as a progressive journey , from station to st ation in search of attainment, and that we as Masons, should cont inually search for more light. Another is the idea of dependence, and M asonry teaches us, simply and unmistakably, from the first step to the last, that we live and walk not by sight, but by faith. An equally significant ceremony is that of approaching the East. The East is the source of light, that station in the heavens where the sun appears to dispe l the darkness. Masons are free children of light and truth--therefore, w e face the East. The Altar 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons The central piece of furniture in the Lodge is t he altar. Upon it res t the Holy Book of Spiritual Law, square, and compasses--the Three Gr eat Lights of Masonry. The altar is symbolic of many things. Its location in the center of the Lodge, symbolizes the plac e which t he Grand Architect has in Ma sonry and in ev ery person’s life. It is also a symbol of the Heart. T he candidate approaches the altar in search of light and also assumes his obligations there. In the presence of Divine Hierarchy and Brother-Sister Masons, he or she offers himsel f to the service of t he Great Architect of the Universe and to humankind in general. The altar is the point on whic h life in our Masonic Lodges is focused. The principles for which the Three Great Lights stand shoul d serve to guide ev eryone’s th oughts an d actions both in the Lodge and abroad in the world. The Oblig ation The Obligation is the heart of each degree. When the candidate repeats t he obligation and seals it, he or she has solemnly bound him self to Freemasonry and assumed cert ain duties whic h obtain for the rest of his or her life, even if he or she should som eday leave the Fraternity. Taking of the Obligation is the visibl e and audible evidenc e of the candidate’s sincerity, The Obligation itself has a tw o-fold purpose. It bi nds the candidate to Freemasonry and als o protects the Fraternity against som eone rev ealing secr ets which deal with modes of recognition and symbolic instruction. The candidate should understand that the great tr uths which M asonry teaches are not secret, but the signs and words Freemasons us ed to identify brethren of the craft are considered secret and need to be treated accordingly. Now let us examine th e obligation. You might be tempt ed to feel, since the obligation is a part of the ritual, and sinc e m uch of the ritual is sy mbolic. that the obligation is also symbolic and not to be taken lit erally. This is not tr ue. With the exception of the penalties, which are, of course , symbolic, the whole of the obligation, both t he pos itive 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons and negative points, is to be taken literally. You took this obligation of your own free will. You wer e of sound and adult mind and were competent to accept fu ll responsibility for your acti on; you were free to withdraw before taking it. If afterwards you should be charged with violating any of the points you cannot seek to evade the consequences by pleadi ng ignorance or inability at the time you gave the pledge. This is in keeping with Freemasonry’s attitude toward the candidate throughout. In short, it is determined t hat at every step you are co mpetent and responsible for every promise you make and ev ery pledge y ou gi ve. T his is important, because there is, in Mas onry, a set of rules whic h regulate the indiv idual’s c onduc t as a Mas on. Thes e lay down what is expected of you in conduct, define Ma sonic offenses, and af fix certain penalties. The foundation of ou r disciplinary law is the obligation taken in the three degrees. These obligations are taken by y ou as binding without limit of time; that is, you accept them for the remainder of your natural life. You may possibly, in the future, withdraw yourself from the Fraternity, or by it be susp ended or e xpe lled, bu t that will n ot ease yo u of your promise, because you made that pledge, not as a Lodge member. but as a person. The Great Lights of Freemasonr y One of the Great Lights of Freemasonry is the Book of the Sa cred Spiritual Law as represented by the Holy Scriptur es of all religi ons, and it is an indispensable part of the furniture of the Lodge. In the U.S., it is usually symbolized by the Holy Bible of Old and New Testaments, but if a candi date is of a religion not r epresented by the Holy Bible such as Buddhism or Hinduis m, he or she may take his or her obligation upon the writings he or she considers sa cred to his religion or co nscience. T his is to ensure that his obligation will be bi nding upon his or her conscienc e. Non-religious c andidates may take the Oath upon the Constitution of the Mixed Lodge. Ultimately, each per son takes the Oath upon the Book of Life that is inscribed in the Heart. No Lodge in this country may stand officia lly open unless the Holy Bible or other symbolic Book of the Sacr ed Law is opened upon its altar with the Square an d Compasses displayed thereon, indicating t he Degree in which th e Lodge is working by the way in which they are arranged. The open Book signifies that we should regulate our conduct according to Divin e Spiritual Law, because that is the rule and guide for our l ives Freemasonry opens the Great Light upon her alta r, not as one book of one faith, but as the Boo k of the Will of t he Great Archite ct. Our myster ies are not just for any on e Lodge, or nation, or rel igion but bind humanit y together throughout the world. The Squar e is a symbol of mora lity, truthfulness and honesty. To “ act on the square” is to act ho nestly. The Compasses are a symbol of restraint. of skill, and of knowledge. The Square and Com passes are seen and recognized by the general public as the symbols of Freemasonry. Penalties f or Violatio n of the Obligation We again reiterate that the physical pen alti es incurred for willful violation of the Masonic Obligation are purely symbolic. The Maso n who v iolates his O bligation w ill s ubject himself to Masonic d iscipline 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons which c ould include t he loss of membership in the Lodge and Fraternity, either by suspension or expulsion. He or she will also lose the respect of other Masons. The abov e mentioned penalties are retained in our ritual to impress upon the mind of each Brother and Sister how ser iously a v iolation is r egarded by the members of the Fraternity. The Obligations are voluntarily assumed, and ev ery means possible is used to impress the new Mason with the solemnit y and the necessity for faithful performance of them. The Rite of Salutation The Rite of Salutation, in which t he candidate salutes each station, is not only a test of his abilit y to give the proper salutes, but is symbolic of his respect for and obedienc e to all just and duly constituted authorities. The Rite of Investiture You were presented with a white apron. The Apron has been used since ancien t times, and it has taken many for ms among the various Lodges and Grand Lodges in the world. We usually associate the apr on with Freem asonry, but it was us ed by more than the operative s tonemasons. The apprentice stonemason wore his apron with a bib held in place by a strap around his neck. The Apron also signif ies the Freemasons are workers rather than drones; builders rather than obstructionists. Both the s ymbolic lambskin material and t he white c olor of the Apron make it an emblem of innocence and purity . When the Ap ron is presented to the candidate it is described as being “...more anc ient than t he Golden Fleece or Roman Eagle, mor e honorable than the Star and Gart er.” These are the honored royal decorations of Ancient Rome and Medieval England. The Apron is deemed a badge of distinction. 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons The Working Tools The Working Tools, presented to the cand idate, are those us ed by the ancient operative craftsman in the erection of buildings.

This is als o true of a man’s mind and his c haracter. Each man ha s his own proper place in society -- as a worker, as a c itizen, as head of a family, as a neigh bor, as a Lodge member. Will he or she fi t into his proper place or will he or she be a misfit? The ans wer will be decided by how thor oughly and intelligently he or she uses on himself the methods and influenc es that are necessary to give correct shape to his life. These methods and influences are symbolized by the Working Tools. In sum, the 24 inch gauge teac hes us to properly divide our time, while the gavel or hammer teaches us to reshape our character. The Rite of Destitution The Rite o f Destitutio n, in which the c andidate discovers he or she has nothing of value about his person, presents clearly the obligation of every Mason to rec ognize and allev iate, s o far as his resources permit, the distress of his fellow men, particularly his Masonic brothers.

The Northeast Corner The northeast corner is the traditional locati on of the cornerstone or foundation stone 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons of a building. Both the stone and its location signify a be ginning. The Entered Apprentice is plac ed at this point, midway between the darknes s of the North and the light of the East, to signify th at he or she has begun his Masonic life. He or she has left the darkness of the North which symboliz es lac k of knowledge of the Masonic lif e, and is moving toward the light of knowledge which co mes from the East. Thus the Entered Apprentice has laid the foundation st one of his Masonic life and must now build his character from the light of the teachings which abound in the East. Certainly by now y ou are aware that Fr eemasonry is a Fraternity devoted to Brotherhood and Sisterhood. To maintain Brotherhood among its members and to work for it in the world at large is t he reason fo r its exis tence. The erection of a Gothic Cathedral in medieval times called for ma ny workmen. The building was erected according to a plan, and this required that each man govern his work accordingly. A group of people thus organized, all wor king harmonious ly toward the same end, constitutes a Brotherhood; this Masonic Brot herhood and Sisterhood, therefore, instead of being the result of a mere vague as piration, is the product of the practice of the art s of harmony, cooperation, humility, and shared vision.

Worshipful is from the Old English and means “worthy, honored.” The Master is chosen by the Brethren, as hav ing sufficient wisdom, int egrity and Masonic knowledge to govern the Lodge properly. Why is the Master’ s station in the East? Symbolic of the world of nat ure, the sun rises in the East to shed light upon the earth, so it is the duty of the Mast er to be an elected custodian of Masonic knowledge for his or her Brethren. Why does the Master wear a hat in a Masonic Lodge? The Worshipful Master alone is privileged t o wear a ha t in Lodge, a contemporary relic of the ancient cus tom whereby the king remained covered, while his subjects were obliged to uncover in his presenc e. This custom is not used in the Pansophic Lodges. 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons PART III THE LE CT URE King Solomon’s Temple The frequent references to Ki ng Solomon’s Temple in t his and other Degrees lea d to the false c onclus ion t hat the Fraternity was founded by Solomon. An organized craft of Operative Masons did not come into exist ence until many centuries after the reign of Solomon. Our ritual is based upon Mas onic legends connected wit h both Solomon and the Temple at Jerusalem whic h has hel ped enrich the symbolism becaus e European s were Chris tians. The Temple, however, is a univ ersal symbol of perfection and a representation of the idea that man is actually a temple of God. It has roots in ancient temple building. The universality of Temp le symbolism can be seen in the remarkable resemblance between, for exam ple, the aer ial view of the legendary Solomon’s Temple extant in T emplar drawings from the th irteenth century, and m andalas of Hindu and Tibetan deities from the same view of the same period. The Sanctum Sanctorum or, Holy of Holies of King Solomon’s Te mple, wher e the Ark of the Cov enant sat, was the residing plac e of God. The destruction of the Temple an d the loss of man’s inherent oneness with God is the legendary start of a search for Divine Truth. The Great Work or Magnum Opus of the Master Mason is to morally, ethically, and spiritually upbuild and rein tegrate him- or herself, thereby to recover the Imago Dei or Divine Per fection of Perfected Humanity through resurrection into conscious and incarnate s piritual life- -both for the individual and societ y. T hus he or she is a “builder” of self and Humanity, which is the Div ine T emple, and the Working Tools are allegorie s of the moral and ethical aspects of this work. The Charter or Warrant The Charter is included in the Lecture in order to outline the need for le gality and uniformity in the actua l workings of Masonry. The Char ter gives cr edib ility to the Lo dg e and establishes its legality. Inspection of the Charter of a Lodge by one seeking admittance as a visitor is a privilege whic h the Master may grant or withhold at his discretion. It is not an absolute right. High Hill o r Lo w Dale The ancient meeting places of Lodges, and of other religious observanc es, were secret and considered to be on holy ground. The high hill or low dale was easier t o guard against cowans and eaves droppers. A co wan is an impost er posing as a Mason, while an eavesdropper wishes to learn our secrets. The Lodge The Lodge is a symbol of the World. The sy mbol means that in its scope and extent, Freemasonry is as broad as human nature and as wide as humankind, and that, as a spirit and ideal, it permeates the whole life of every true Mason, outside the Lodge as well as inside. Its shape, t he “Oblong Square,” is the ancient conception of the shape of the world. It is a world within a world, differ ent in its laws, customs, and 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons structures from the world wit hout. In the outside world ar e class distinctions, wealth, power, pov erty, distress. In the Lodge al l are on a level, and peace and harmony prevail. Jacob’s Ladder The ladder is a symbol of the continuity of heaven and earth, Divine and human. The extens ion of love bey ond the gr ave, into eternity, is both beautif ul and ver y Masonic, since brotherly lov e is one of the great teac hings of Masonry. Most of all, it represents Spiritua l Hierarchy. Jewels of the Lodge The Lodge has six jewels. The Square, Level, and Plu mb are considered to be immov able bec aus e they are always in t he East, West, and South, worn by the three princ ipal officers of the Lodge. The Square teaches morality, the Level equality, and the Plum b rectitude of life . The three movable jewels are the Rough Ashlar, Perfect Ashlar and the Trestle Board. T he Rough Ashlar is crude stone as it is taken from the quarry and symboliz es an uneduc ated man. The Perfect Ashlar is stone that has been s quared and tested by the tools of the Entered Apprentic e and Fellowcraft and symbolizes humanity educated in Masonic principle. The Trestle Board is used by the master workman to draw h is designs upon, and is a symbol of perfection or the spirit ual board on which man lays out his plans to build his “living stones” into a temple to the Supr eme Architect of the Universe. The Ornaments of the Lodge The Ornaments of the traditi onal Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel and the Blazing Star. The Pav emen t, which is made up of tiles of black and white, illust rates the good and evil that is within each m an and that con stitutes the balanc ing polarities which char acterize manife st existence. The Tessel is the border that surrounds the mosaic pavem ent, and the Bl azing Star is a s ymbol of the presence and power of Divine Reality in the life of man. Pansophic lod ges may adopt other ornamentation. The Three Principal Tenets of Masonr y The three principal tenets of the Mason ar e Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth and shape the way Masons should ac t in their rel ationships with others. The Four Points of Entrance A Mason has four points of entrance. T hey are illustrated by the Four Cardina l Virtues of Temperance, Fort itude, Prudence, and Justice. By the Four Cardinal Virtues the Mas on is given a code of conduct, including a temperate Life; avoiding excess in all things; bravery in the face of strife a nd conflict ; careful thought before acting; and ev en-handedness in deal ing wit h others.

Chalk, Charcoal and Clay These are symbols of the freedom of choice man has at his disposal to make his own decisions; the need for zealous dedication of pr inciples; the inevitability of our death; and the return of our bodies to t he embrace of the Earth.

T he char ge identifies those duties, as the sy mbolism explains some of the meanings of the degree he or she has just completed. In the old Charges it is laid down as a f undamental law of the ol d Craft that “a Mason is peaceable, subject to the civil powers wherever he or s he resides or works, and is never to be concerned in plots and conspi racies against the peace and welfare of the nation.” T his, of course, is open to interp retation in t he case of progress and social revolution. A reading of the Dec laration of I ndependence demons trat es the gravity that colonial Masons used in consideration of the revolutionary act of political s eparatism— most of the document details the profound reasons for the decision, which has come only after a long and difficult hist ory of atte mpting to work with the British governmen t. Revolutionary Masons like George Washingt on were not quick-tempered hotheads, a nd they were not reparative. Fr ank lin was z ealous to build re volut ionary unity, solidarit y, and cooperation from all thirteen colonies with phrases like, “If we don’t all hang together, we’ll all hang separ ately!” It was only after th is unity had been ac complished in the creation of a new democratic coloni al government by ratification of the Declaration of Independence that revolutionar y Freemasons wer e able to s upport the goals of the Revolutionary War, and even then there were many Freemasons who remained loyal to England. At the time the Old Charges were wri tten, the people had no voice in their government. They were ruled by kings, and often the dynasty to which a king belonged was challenged in its right to ru le by some other dynasty. A rebellion or a revolution was the only method by whic h a gover nm ent could b e changed. Almost every organization, including churches and colleges , took sides with one dynasty against the other. Ma sonic law took the position that this system of warring parties was hurtful to mankind and a great danger to the people, and that it ought to be replaced by the principle of good will a nd peaceable cooper ation. Instead of quarreling as to what the government should be, our political parties are i n contention as to what a go vernment should do; and instead of deciding which one should triumph by means of rebellion, our par ties make use of political campaigns. While thes e campaigns usually do not res ult in the s heddi ng of blood, they sometimes result in a great deal of bitter ness. In this modern situati on our Craft conti nues to take the same position that it took i n an earlier time. It believ es that these bitter, partisan contentions are hurtful to the people, subv ersive of s ound government, and that the welfare of the State c an best be secured by goodwill, toleration and a patient, friendly cooperation. Although Masons should and do vote their convictions, Freemasonry refuses to participate in parti san politics exc ept in extrem e cases where Freemasonry or its univers al humane principles are under a ttack by forces lik e Naz ism or relig iou s fundamentalism. We can now define the Masonic conception of citizenship. It m eans that in all relations with the community and the State, a Freem ason is m otivated and controlled by 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons the principle of frater nalis m an d sororalis m; which means that as one of the people, he or she works for and with the pe ople in a s pirit of goodwill and for the gener al good. He or she is to apply fraternalism to all. A Mason might be an active worker in some political party. It is for him to decide what party it is, but as a Mason he or she will n ot hate those who differ with him no r enter unjus t intrigues against them . He or s he will not set up his own party in oppos ition to the public good, nor will he or she seek fo r supporters among his Brethren. He or she might be an activ e member of a religious denomination , but as a Mason he or she will not be actuated by denominati onal prejudice or int olerance; nor w ill he or she be a party toward making war on any other religious community, howev er much in error he or she may deem it to be. In his soc ial life, he or she might belong to any circle he or she wishes and enjoy the companionship of s uch as pleas e him, nob ody els e having the right to dictate; but as a Mason he or she will not consid er his own circle abo ve others, or despise those who may not be as fortunate as he or she is in his social relations - for such snobbery is repugnant to the principles of fraterna lism, and it is not “on the level.”. Also, it is possible that he or she might feel a pride of race, might cherish the traditions of his own people, might love it s language and pr efer its customs. If so, nobody has a night to forbid him, for it is right and honorable in ev ery person to respec t his own blood; but as a Mason he or she will not, theref ore, despise others of a different race, nor seek at their expense t o exalt his own, for there is nothing m ore non-Masonic than racial prejudic e. Freemasonry leaves it wholly to us to decid e what form our citizens hip shall take and where we shall find our own place in the great structure of public lif e. You will now understand why neit her a Lodge, nor a Grand Lodg e, nor any groups o f Masons, as such, ever interferes with matters of church, state, or society, o r joins one party against another. However, it is not in consist ent for the Craft to perform such services for the community as stand by co mmon consent on a level beyond partisanism . The Language of Freemasonr y Candidates often ask why t he language of Freemasonry is so different from that which we normally use . The Ritual of Freemasonr y is a product of the early decades of the 18 th century. It contains m uch of the language of that century, and other words and phrases from the very old works that have been incorporat ed in to the Ritual. This is why the ritual language of Freemasonry is written and spoken as it is. How to Act in Lodge Masonry has a formal etiquette of its own. A certain level of dec orum is required at all times and the Master is always in char ge. Unlike most other organizations, the Master has a great deal of latitude in t he way he or she conducts his Lodge, and his or her decisions can be appealed only to Grand Lodge. The gav el in the hands of t he Master of the Lodge is one of the s ymbols of authority by whic h he or she governs. When the gav el is s ounded in the East, at the beginning of Lodge, the Brethren must come to order. Two raps call the Officers to their feet, and three raps mean that all Br ethren must stand. One r ap seats anyone in the Lodge who is standing. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons If the Master addresses you by name, aris e, face the East, and listen to his instruction. If you wish to speak, arise, face the East and wa it until t he Master recognizes you or your proxy (if you are an E. A.); then address y our remarks to him. When entering or retiring from an open Lodge, you must always approach the altar, salute the Master and then go about your business. When prayers are given, all Masons stand in the attitude of prayer . No Lodge can be opened, st ay open, or be clos ed, without prayer which is o ffered by the Master or Chaplain. The prayer should av oid offense or sectarianism in the Lodge. At the end of the prayer, each member resp onds with the words “So Mote It Be”, which means “So May It Be”. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS OF PANSOPHIC FREEMASONS PHILOSOPHICAL MISSION: The basic mission of this new mixed Masoni c obedience is to pres erve, study, improve, develop, practice, and perpetuate esoteric spiritua l a nd initia tic degrees a nd schools associated w ith Pansophic Freemasonry and oth er spiritual traditio ns, such as the Eastern schools, as part of the general Masonic prac tice of social and se lf-improvement, and to revive the universal a nd spiritua l traditions of Freemasonry as they w ere originally practiced by speculative or philosophical Ma sons w ithin the context of Rosicrucian , Templar, Kabbalistic, Gnostic, an d other esoteric European schools.

THE OFFICERS OF THE LODGE The “Worshipful” or Venerable Master The Master (the term used for both men and women) is the embodiment of the Lodge. He or she is elected at a stated meeting in early September by the members of the Lodge f or a one year term. In the local Lodge his word is fina l; so his duty is one o f awesome r esponsibility. He or s he must be a person good and true. He or she must obey the moral law, cheerfully conform to the laws of the nati on, submit to the constituted authorities, prom ote the general good of soci ety and help our craft in knowledge and growth. He or she must be a person who w ill be courteous to the Brethren (the term used for both sexes) and fait hful to the Lodge. He or she respects genuine Br ethren and discounts impos tors. He or she must be watchful that no person can be regularly made a Fr eemason or admitted a mem ber of his Lodge without previous notice or due inquiry into his or her character. He or she must protect his Lodge by not receiving any one into it wit hout first having them produce proper credentials satisfying him or her as to their privilege to do so. The Master must promise regular attendance on the com mittees an d communications of the Grand Lodge, and that no new Lodge c an be formed without the permission of the Grand Lodge and further, that no recognition ought to be giv en to an irregular Lodge or anyone initiated into such a Lodge. Being Master of a Lodge requ ires keeping the “comfort” or best, highest, and greatest good of the Craft as a high priori ty. The Master has, at his disposal to help him, an entire corps of officers. It is the Master’s responsibility to see to it that the officers conduct themselves in a manner set forth by t he code and bylaws. He or she also is in charge of all new candidates entering into the Lodge, making certain their degrees are conducted in the proper manner. It is also the Master’s duty, at the time he or she assumes his office, to have an outline and hopefully, an enti re agenda, or in our ow n Masonic language, a trestleboard of his year of activities. The Senior Warden: In Line for Venerable Master Next we v iew the Senior Warden in the We st, who also is elect ed by the members of the Lodge t o serve a one year term. He or s he is like t he vice pres ident of a company. He or she stays well versed regarding the Lodge and its affairs. In the event of the absence of the Master, the S enior Warden assumes the dut ies and responsibilities of the Master. The Senior Warden’s regular dut ies, other than those already mentioned, are to carry out the wishes of the Master and to assist him in a regu lar and well governed Lodge. At his in stallat ion, the Senior Warden is reminded that his station is one which functions on the level, which teac hes that we are des cended from the same stock, partake of the same nature and share the same hopes a nd though distinctions 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons among men are necessary, yet no em inence of station should cause us to forget that we are all Brethren. Also, the Senior Warden’s regular attendance at stated communications is essential. The Junior Warden: In Line for Senior Warden We next come to the Junior Warden in the S outh who is elected for a one year term. His or her office is lik e that of a second vic e president of company. In the event of the Senior Warden’s absence, the Junior Warden move s to that station. The jewel of this office is the plumb, which admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations, to hold the scales of justice i n balance, to observe the just distinction between intemperance and pleasure and to make ou r passions and prejudices coinc ide with the line of our duty. The Junior Warden is com mitted to t he superint endence of the Craft during the hour of refreshment. He or she also is committed to regular and punctua l attendance at all meetings. The Orator or Lecturer: In Line for Junior Warden The Orator is guardian of the Constitution and General Rules of t he Mixed Lodge. After a lecture or discussion, he may summarize c onclusions or proposals for voting. H e reports on communications from the Grand Lodge. He or she sits i n the Orient or East. The Treasurer: May Also be Secret ary : In Line Follo wing Secretary The Treas urer is elected by the membership for a t erm of one year. It is his duty to receive money paid to the Lodge from the hands of the Secretary, keep a correct account thereof, and pay the same out by or der of the Master and consent of the Lodge. The Secret ary: In Line for Orator The Secret ary also is elected for one year . It is his duty to observe the will and pleasure of the Master in reco rding the proceedings of the Lodge, transmit a copy to the Grand Lodge when required, rec eive all monies paid into t he Lodge, paying the same to the Treasurer taking his receipt therefore. His good inclination toward Masonry and his Lodge will induce him to discharge his duties with fidelity. This office may be combined with that of Treasurer. The Grand Expert and T yler: In Line for Treasurer or Secretar y The Expert sits inside to the West at the entrance to the Lodge as Tyler, or one who guards the entrance to insure that only duly and truly init iated Freemasons are admitted. In a larger Lodge, the Tyler will work with t he Expert as a separate officer sitting at the Portal. With the Ceremonial Master, t he Grand Expert accompanies Brethren and dignitaries on their sunwise proc ession to the East. The Ceremonial Ma ster: In Line for Grand Expert The Ceremonial Master formally introduces visi tors to the Venera ble Master, directs all ceremonial work, distributes and receives t he voting balls or ball ots together with any written material. OTHER OFFICERS: Not Necessaril y in Line for Previous Positions Other officers in a lar ge Lodge are the Guardian, the Archivist or Librarian, the Architec t 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons who ov ersees inv entory and floor setup, T he Master of the Banquet, the Gatekeeper, the deacons who serve the officers on the floor for large gatherings. The Hospitaller This is the officer in charge of Masonic charity and public service. The Com mission on Finances This consists of the V enerable Master, Wardens, Secr etary, Treasurer, and three elected Commissioners. The Com mission on Masonic Solidarity This consists of the Vener able Master, Orator, Grand Expert, Hospitaller, and three elected Commissioners. It ov ersees charitable works and re lations with other Masons. OPTIONAL APPOINTED OFFICERS: The Chapl ain We next are introduced to the Chaplain, who is appointed, whose duty it is to perform those solemn services which we should c ons tantly render to our Infinite Creator and which, when offered by one whose holy pr ofession is t o point to heaven and lead the way may by refining our souls , strengt hening our v irtues and purifying our minds, prepare us for admiss ion into the society of those abov e, whose h appiness will be a s endless as it is perfect. The Senio r & Junior Deacon s Next are t he Senior and Junior Deacons, who are appoi nted. It is the duty of the Deacons to attend the Master and Wardens and to act as their prox ies in the activ e duties of the Lodge, such as in the reception of candid ates into the degrees of Masonry, the introduction and accommodation of visitors and to see that the Lodge is duly tyled. The Senior & Junior Ste wards We now come to the Stewards, also appoin ted. Their duties are to see that the tables are properly furnished at refreshment and that every Br other is suitably provided for. The Stewards als o assist the Deacons and other officers in performing their duties. These are very important times for them, for they are now being ev aluated by those in higher office, who will be in search of their own corps of officers. The Musician The Musician is also appointed. Under the di rection of the Worshipful Master, he or she conducts the musical services of t he Lodge. As harmony is the strength and support of all institutions, t he Musician prov ides musical strength and support to every gentle and ennobling emot ion of the soul. The Ty ler The Tyler, who is appointed, guards the avenues approaching the Lodge. A Lodge is said to be duly tyled when necessary prec autions ha ve been taken to guard against 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons intrusion by cowans, eavesdroppers, or other unauthorized persons. A cow an is described as one who tries to masquerade as a Mason. He or she is one who has not done the work, but says he or she has in order to ga in admission. An eav esdropper is one who tries to steal the secrets of our society. If a Brother or Sister comes to Lodge and want s to be admitted, the Tyler sees that he or she is properly clad, and t hen vouches that he or she is qu alified to enter. It is the duty of the Tyler to inform the Junior Deac on when a qualified Brot her or Sister wishes to enter the Lodge and to let the him or her know on which Degree the Lodge is working. Unlike English and American lodges, the Mixed Lodge does not require the Tyler to sit outside of the door, but he or she sits in Lodge. There you have them, the entire corps of o fficers. Each takes part in all three degrees, indicating the amount of time and hard work that goes into the operation of a well gover ned Lodge. From the Steward’s station to the Ma ster’s place in the East there may be at least seven years of time and work, but each Past Master looks bac k on his years with a sense of joy and satisfaction. The Rights of an Entered Appr entice Mason In a sense, Master Masons always remain Entered Apprentices; we are learners, seekers after knowledge; the teachings of the degree remain always in effect; its obligations, subject to additions in the succe eding degr ees, continue to be binding; and our interest in the Craft as a whole must always inc lude it. As an Entered Apprentice Mason, you have, therefore, an immediate and personal interest in our subject, and our discussion should lead you to s ee that it has a permanent and important interest for every Mason, however long it may have been since he or she received the first degree. It is the duty of the Entered Apprentice to learn the required po rtions of the degree thoroughly, not only because he or she must prove himself proficient in order to advance, but also because they contain Mas onic teac hings of f undamental importance that remain forever binding on every Ma son. The first degree is not a temporary stopping place to be forgott en when the next degree is reached. It is perfect and complete within its own, incorporat ed as a part of your Masonic lif e. There are literally millions of Masons in the world--appr oximately three millio n in the United States. You do not know them; th ey do not k now you. Unless a person can prove he or she is a Mason, he or she c annot visit a Lodge where he or she is not known. Hence the requirement that an Entered Apprent ice learn the work well is in his or her own interest. But it is also in the in terest of all brethren, wherever dispersed. They may find it as necessary to prove them selves to him or her as he or she may need to prove himself or herself to them. If he or she does not know the work, he or s he cannot receive proof any more than he or she c an give it. While you will find later that there are sl ight differences in the ritual wo rk of various Grand Jurisdictions and Masonic Obedience s, still the essentials are identica l in all. Currently, U.S. Mixed Masons have visita tion privileges with other Co-Masonic and the Mem phis-Misraim lodges. An Entered Apprentic e cannot v ote or hold offi ce. He or she is no t entitled to walk in public Mas onic processions. T he public a ssumes that every man therein is a fu ll- fledged Mason, and judges eac h one and the Craft accordingly. An Entered Apprentic e may not visit or sit in a Lodge except when opened on the First Degree, and since all business of the Lodge is conducte d in the Third Degree, he or she has neither voice nor vote. However, it is the policy of the Mixed Lodge to open all meetings in the First 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons Degree. Entered Apprentices may not speak directly in the meet ings except through the appointed Master Mason. This is a dis cipline to develop s ilence and forethought, and it teaches the Appr entice to listen and hear before developing thought that is worthy of communication in the Sacred Lodge envir onment. No matter how developed and knowlegab le an Apprentice might be, in Lodge he or she has the status of a neophy te until enough tim e and regul ar attendance in Lodge has passed that incubation and maturation withi n the m ystic currents of the Masonic Egregore c an do its work. Advancement to Fellowcraft repr esents the maturation of that development, and with it comes the right to speak for oneself in Lodge. This normally requires on solar year of full participation in the Lodge. Nevertheless he or she possess es certain important rights and privileges. He or she has the right to be ins tructed in his work and in matters pertaining to his degree. He or she has the right to apply for advancement to a higher degree. He or she possesse s modes of recognition by which he or she c an make himself known to another Entered Apprentice as well as bret hren who have advanced to addi tional degrees, and he or she has the privilege of using t hem. He or she or a near re lative may request a Masonic burial; however, it is a pr ivilege not an absolute right. Complete f aithfulness to his obligation, and implic it obedience to the charge, are among his or her most important and lasting responsibilities. An Entered Apprentice i s still on pro bation, a Mason in the making, p assing thro ugh a p eriod of trial and testing, his or her relations hip to the Cr aft like that of the student to t he graduate. Therefore it is his or her duty to be obedient, trusting himsel f without question to his guides, and in a spirit of hu mility, be q uick to respond to th e in structio ns of the Lodge office rs. It is not for him or her to question what he or she find s or enter into arguments, or set himself up as a critic. The clue to his position is fu rnished by the word “Apprentice” which means learner, and his chief task is, therefore, to learn. 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons The Respo nsibilities of an Entered Apprentice Mas on These, als o, are very fe w. He or she must: 1. Keep secret certain rit uals entrusted to him or her; 2. Conduct him- or herself with proper decorum; 3. Try to learn as much about Masonry as possible; 4. Pass the proficiency test; Optionally he or she may: 1. Attend each Ente red Apprentice Lodge; 2. Visit another E.A. Lodge with his m entor or other Masonic friend; 3. Memorize and present additional ritual of the E.A. degree; 4. Read and r eport on a Masoni c book or public ation; 5. Help the Stewards prepare and serve the refres hments at any degre e meetings. In Conclusion Freemasonry preserves secre cy about its work; it meets behind tyled or guarded doors; over its principles and teachings it th rows a gar ment of symbolism and ritual; it s Art is a mystery; a wall great and high separ ates it fr om the outside world, it is a world in itself, standing silently within the world. No r is its work easy to understand. Difficult, complex, yet increasingly fascinating as one grows in Masonic k nowledge, it is carried forward in the high and responsible regions of the religious, moral, and intellectual life. The petitioner who knocks at our doors may have very slight knowledge of what lies within and brings wit h him littl e or no previous preparation. Once ins ide he or sh e discovers that Masonry stretches before him or her like a great continent across whic h he or she must make a long and often diffi cult journey to reach his goal. The journey begins on the night he or she receives hi s Entered Apprentice Degree; the task of learning Masonry, of becoming skilled in it s work, and of fa shioning his life according to its requirements and philosophy, is still before him or her. In asking you to learn all the duties and pr ivileges of an Entered Apprentice Mason, we als o urge you to think of apprenticeship in a larger sense. It is not difficult for a person to become a member in name only, but we want your ambition to extend far beyond that perfunctory state. We believe that you desire to become a Mason in fact and reality; bearing our name has been your motive in seeking our fellows hip ‘ If this be true, we both urge and advise y ou not to be c ontent with the letter and outward form i n your beginning period, but to apply yours elf with freedom, fervency and zeal to th e sincere and thorough mastering of our Art. So to do is to be an Entered Apprentice Mason in spirit and in truth. The Entered Apprentice Proficiency Before you can be passed to the Degree of a Fellowcraft, you will be required to show that you understand t he Entered Apprentice Degree. The purpose of the proficiency is to help you become acquainted with the principles of Masonry and the details of your initiation. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Gran d L odge St. Germ ain      Pans op hic Fre emas ons THE ENTERED APPRENTICE Test Questions Symbolic Instruction To be researched an d answ ered after Initiation as an Entered Apprentice TEST QUESTIONS Write brief answers to these and submit to the Mentor of the Lodge. 1.
