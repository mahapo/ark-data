[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" 1 O N THE A NTIENT AND P RIMITIVE R ITE OF M ASONRY (M EMHPIS - M IZRAIM ) A COMPLETE history of this Order would necessarily involve an account of most of the Rites prevalent last century which devoted themselves to Templary, Theosophic, Hermetic and Occult research . Suffice it for this article to give the reader a general impression upon the more important points of the Rite. The leading fact is, that prior to the year 1721 some of the English Masons of the York Rite, which last century was known as a Templar Tie o f Seven Degrees, were well acquainted with the ancient mystical language of those occult fraternities who boaster the gnosis , or wisdom of old Egypt, and were the, in 1721, addressed as the ‘higher class’ of Masons. The Continental brethren developed this Hermetic element to an almost incredible extent. Martinez Paschalis, who was a German, of poor parents, born about the year 1700, after having acquired a knowledge of Greek and Latin at the age of sixteen years, journeyed to Turnkey, Arabia and Damascus, and obtaining imitation into the Temple Mysteries of the East, upon his return, established a particular Order of Rose - Croix, or Elected Cohens, which influenced greatly all the Masonry of his century, and especially some of the Orders from which the Rite of Memphis drew its inspiration. The basis of the Antient and Primitive Rite, or Order of Memphis, for they are one and the same, is to be found in the ‘Rite of Philalethes,’ or Lovers of Truth , an Order promulgated about the year 1773, and identical in i ts principles with the ‘Primitive Philadelphes’ or Lovers of Mankind . On this, as a groundwork, was established, in the year 1814, at Montauban, France, by the Brothers Samuel Honis, of Cairo, Gabriel Mathieu Marconis de Negre, the Baron Duman, the Marqui s de Laroque, Hypolites Labrunie, and J. Petit, a Grand Lodge of the Disciples of Memphis. In the same year was published as the ‘Orient of Memphis’ the Hieroglyphic of Master of Master, which claimed for the Oriental, or Egyptian Rite, that it was the on ly true system of Masonry, and fortified by unquestionable authority. Whatever was the aim of the authors of this pamphlet, it is noteworthy that the Rite, of which we now treat, employed its language and philosophy almost verbally in its ceremonies. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 The Disciples of Memphis continued work at Montauban for a short time until the Grand Lodge fell into abeyance, and was then revived at Paris in the year 1839, as one of the subordinate bodies of the recently constituted Sovereign Sanctuary and United Grand O rient of the Antient and Primitive Rite of Memphis, which had published its statutes, and extended to Marseilles and Brussels in 1838, flourishing, with various vicissitudes , until now. In the year 1857, the Illustrious and Enlightened Brother Jacques Et ienne Marconis, Grand Hierophant, (son of Gabriel Mathieu Marconis), inaugurated the Rite in person at New York, with Illustrious Brother David McClellan as Grand Master, and afterwards, in the year 1862 (when he had united his privileges with the Grand Lo dge of France), chartered it as a Sovereign Sanctuary, with the sanction of the said Grand Lodge, the Patent being visèd by the Grand Master Marshal Magnan, and sealed with the seals of the said Grand Lodge, Illustrious Brother Harry J. Seymour being appo inted Grand Master General. On the 3 rd June, 1872, the said Sovereign Sanctuary of America granted a Charter for the Sovereign Sanctuary 33°, in and for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the following officers appointed under the said C harter were installed by Illustrious Brother Harry J. Seymour, 33 — 96°, in person, at Freemason’s Hall, London, on the 8 th October, 1872, viz.: — Illustrious Brother John Yarker, 33 — 96°, Grand Master General. Illustrious Brother Michael Caspari, 33 — 95°, Gran d Chancellor General. Illustrious Brother Samuel P. Leather, 33 — 95°, Grand Treasurer General. Illustrious Brother Charles Scott, J.P., 33 — 95°, Grand Inspector General. Illustrious Brother Patrick John Graham, M.A., LL.D., 33 — 95°, Grand Keeper of the Golden Book. Illustrious Brother A. D. Loewenstark, 33 — 95°, Grand Secretary General. This body, in the year 1875, sanctioned the conferment of the Rite of Mizraim upon Members of the Rite of Memphis, the former having now no separate governing body in this count ry. It is unnecessary to follow this history in detail, as full information can be obtained from the ‘ Constitutions, &c., Public Ceremonial, and History of the Rite ’ (John Hogg, London). "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 The Rite is divided into three series, and subdivided into seven cl asses, which form the schools which are to teach the Masonic knowledge, physics, and philosophies which have an influence upon the happiness and moral and material well - being of temporal man. The First Series teaches morality; that study of himself which e ndows the Mason with the beautiful name of philosopher, or lover of wisdom, by which is understood that triumph over the passions which represents the union of virtue with justice and liberty. The neophyte is taught the signification of symbols, emblems, and allegories; he is impressed with that need of natural assistance which nature has wisely willed that we should relatively hold to each other, and the extension to others of that mutual love and tolerance which forms the true and stable basis of all soc iety. The Second Series teaches the natural sciences, philosophy, and history, practically giving an explanation of the poetic myths of antiquity, and the state of nature most convenient to man. The Third Series makes known the complement of the historic p art of philosophy, including the immortal elements of the human mind, with those divisions of science which are named occult or secret; it develops the mystic and transcendent part of Masonry, and admits the most advanced Theosophical speculations. Each of these Three Series is divided into two classes; thus constituting, with Craft Masonry, or the Lodge, seven classes. The Second Class , or College , explains the Masonry of the first Temple. The Third Class , or Chapter, that of the Second Temple. The Four th Class , or Senate , develops Hermetic or Rosicrucian Masonry. The Fifth Class , or Areopagus , Templar Masonry. The Sixth Class , or Consistory , is a school for instruction in the ancient myths, dogmas, and faiths. The Seventh Class , or Council , teaches t he religious mysteries of ancient Egypt. Originally these three series, of Seven Classes, we a collection of ninety degrees drawn from all known Masonic Rites, of which the first thirty - three were identical with those of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish R ite, but, in the year 1865, the Grand Lodge of France, in order to simplify the working, reduced them to thirty working degrees, of which the first twenty ceremonies are similar to degrees of the A and A Scottish Rite, and the remaining ten ceremonies are practically selected from the subsequent fifty - seven degrees of the old Rite of Memphis."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 A short description of these thirty - three degrees will convey all the knowledge which we are permitted to give in a work of this character. There is the less reason t o extend this condensation as the attentive student will gather from our ample description of other Rites whatever is applicable to this Order. FIRST SERIES (CHAPTER) The first tow third degrees are not conferred by the Rite, but the aspirant for the highe r degrees must be a Master Mason under some constitutional and regular Grand Lodge. DISCREET MASTER This is the name of the fourth degree, and commences the second class. The Most Wise represents Solomon; the Knight Senior Warden, Hiram of Tyre; the Knigh t J. W., Zarbud; the other officers represent Zadok; Stolkin; Benaiah; Zobah; Jehosophat; Adonhiram; Ahishar.

The instruction is as to the relationship of man to God. SUBLIME MASTER is the name of the fifth d egree. The Chapter is divided into two apartments, representing King Solomon’s Chamber of Audience, and the mausoleum of H. A. B. The cordon is crimson, edged with gold lace, and the jewel is three triangles interlaced. The ceremonial refers to the inter ment of the heart of H. A. B. in a tomb secretly erected for that purpose, upon which the aspirant, as Johaben, intrudes. The instruction refers to the intimacy which exists between divine and human nature. KNIGHT OF THE SACRED ARCH is the name of the Six th Degree. The Chapter represents the Audience Chamber of King Solomon. In the East is suspended the sacred delta, to right and left are two pillars supporting an arch, on which are painted nine signs of the Zodiac. In the second apartment are nine arch es, with certain Hebrew inscriptions, and in the midst is a delta, resembling that suspended in the Orient. The cordon is purple, edged with gold lace, and the jewel a double triangle, with a triple tau at the bottom of it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 The ceremonial refers to the pr eparation for Solomon’s Temple, when the workmen discovered the temple of nine arches erected by Enoch before the flood. Reference to this tradition will be found in the ‘Book of Enoch,’ brought by the traveller Bruce from Abyssinia, and translated by the Archbishop of Cashel; this is curious, as the degree is without question more ancient that the rediscovery of the lost Book of Enoch. The degree also explains the assistance which King Solomon received from the Mysteries of Egypt. The moral is, that lab our in the Nine Mystic Arches of the Great Cause is necessary to those who would know truth. KNIGHT OF THE SECRET VAULT is the name of the seventh degree. The Most Wise represents Gedaliah; the Knight S. W., Seraiah; the Knight J. W., Zephaniah; the other officers represent Jeremiah; Shealtiel; Iddo; Jozadak.

P., and the jewel is a sabre. The ceremonial has reference to the return of Zerubbabel from the Court of Cyrus, as a Persian knight, to rebuild the Second Tem ple. We learn from it to combat the vices and passions which dishonour humanity. KNIGHT OF JERUSALEM is the name of the ninth degree. The Most Wise represents Nehemiah; the Knight S. W., Darius; the Knight J. W., Ezra; other officers represent Haggai; Jo shua; Ananias. The cordon is sky - blue, edged with gold fringe, the jewel, a gold medal having on one side a hand holding a balance in equilibrium, and in the other a two - edged sword and two stars."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 The ceremonial represents the journey of Zerubbabel to the court of Darius, and the famous contest as to the relative strength of wine, the king, women, and truth, after which the neophyte discovers the symbolical jewels. KNIGHT OF THE ORIENT is the name of the tenth degree. The cordon is black edged with red, t he jewel a medal in the form of a heptagon. The ceremonial refers to the period of revival of the Mysteries, and the following from the Book of Maccabees. ‘And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying: Whoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me. Then there came unto him a company of the Assideana, who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as are voluntarily devoted unto the law. And Judas Maccabeus, with nine others or thereabouts, withdrew him self into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains.’ KNIGHT OF THE ROSE C ROIX is the name of the eleventh degree. The collar is red, embroidered in gold, the sash white, and the jewel a pelican feeding its young, between the compasses, upon the quarter circle. This well - known grade represents that period when the Temple of Jehovah was sullied and forsaken in Zion, and its members were wandering in the woods and mountains, overwhelmed with grief and the deepest sorrow; labouring for the new law of love, a nd terminating their work in the discovery of those three sacred principles, Faith, Hope, and Charity, which were to rule all nations under the mystic INRI, here interpreted according to universal moral principles. The history teaches that community which existed between the Egyptian and Jewish mystics. All the grades in this Rite are unsectarian. SECOND SERIES (SENATE). KNIGHT OF THE RED EA GLE is the name of the twelfth degree of the Rite and the first of the Senate, and commences the Fourth Class. The cordon is black, and the jewel an eagle in red and gold. The ceremonial is an introduction to Hermetic philosophy, and the neophyte is purified by the four elements. It bears some resemblance to the degree conferred by the modern English Rosicrucian Socie ty, either the latter has been derived from it, or both have drawn from a more ancient source in common. The orator’s discourse is a learned dissertation upon ancient initiation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 KNIGHT OF THE TEMPLE is the name of the thirteenth degree. The cordon is re d, and the jewel a square and compasses with the letter G on a delta.

The interior of the Tabernacle is decorated with the banners of the twelve tribes. The cordon is red, and the jewel a brazen serpent twined round a tau cross. The ceremonial has reference to the brazen serpent which Moses erected in the wilderness, and to the foundation of the grade by a Western Knight in the time of the Crusades. The orator’s discourse is a learned exposition of serpent myths and a description of the serpent worship of ancient peoples. In America there is an immense serpentine mound, with the serpent in the act of vomiting the egg, an Egyptian symbol frequently used in this rite. KNIGHT SAGE OF TRUTH is the name of the sixteenth d egree. The Senate is hung with black, having a brazier of burning spirits in the centre. The cordon is black, and the jewel a circular medal having on one circumference the twelve names of the Egyptian months, and on the other the twelve emblems of the Z odiac."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 The ceremonial teaches that God and truth are one, and man’s happiness is of his own creation.

The orator’s discourse is an elaborate h istory of the Templars. KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL MYSTERY is the name of the nineteenth degree. There are in the Senate nine banners of the principal faiths of the world in form of a camp. The cordon is black, and the jewel is a medal representing a camp, in t he form of a nonagon.

The Orator’s Charge is a history of the Mysteries. PATRIARCH OF MEMPHIS is the name of the twenty - eighth degree.

This is prepatory to the next degree, and the Neophyte learns three grand secrets — how to enjoy long life, wealth, and genius; he undergoes certain trials, and is then consecrated as an Elect who has attained the Apex of the Mystic Egyptian Delta.

Swords, with red sword - belts, are worn in all the grades. When fully worked, the ceremonial of this grade represents the great Egyptian Judgement, as found in the Book of the Dead, and transferred traditionally to Christianity. The continuity and consistency is thorough from the moment the Neophyte enters the Pronaos to make his demand, and overruns the Sanctuary of Spirits , until triumphantly received and crowned in the Temple of Truth as an adept who, by the practice of virtue, has rendered himse lf eternal, a demi - god.   1 i.e. an octagram of two interlaced squares."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 GRAND DEFENDER is the name of the thirty - first degree.

The Orator’s discourse is a summary of the degrees through which the candidate has passed before reaching this exalted rank. The degree is very sparingly conferred, but the only q ualification is that the aspirant should show zeal in promoting the Rite."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 In conclusion, we may add that although all these thirty - three degrees have a full Ritual which admit of being easily worked in three sectional divisions, with the same officers for each division, yet in practice it seems easy to reduce them to a few triplets, without in the least impairing the design of the Rite, as follows: 6° — 8° — 11° — Sacred Arch Knight of the Sword Rose Croix } An application of the An - cient Mysteries to the Mys teries of the Jews 12° — 16° — 17° — Red Eagle Sage of Truth Hermetic Philosopher } The same, as applied to the Rosicrucian Schools. 18° — 19° — 20° — Knight Kadosh Royal Mystery Grand Inspector } The same, as applied to the Order of Templars 27° — 28° — 30° — P atriarch of Isis Patriarch of Memphis Sub.

It recognises the legitimate degrees of all other Rites, and extends the hand of fellowship to all alike. It admits the Hindoo, Parsee, Hew, Mahommedan, Trinitarian and Unitarian Christian, breathing only pure masonry, clarity, love, and mutual tolerance; adoring T. S. A. O. T. U., and teaching the immortality and happiness of the immortal soul. Its government is strictly representative. It relies upon masonic worth, ability, and learning, rather than so cial standing and pecuniary qualifications, and seeks to extend masonic knowledge, justice, and morality. It levies only a small capitations fee upon the members admitted to its thirty degrees. It admits only Master Masons in good standing under some con stitutional Grand Lodge, and prohibits all interference with Craft Masonry.

XXIII of the third edition of Jeremiah How’s The Freemason’s Man ual (London: John Hogg, 1880). It is possible that it was not by How but added by a later editor based on (or quoted verbatim from) manifestos or other public material of the A. & P. rite (in cap. XXIV , a general survey of Masonic rites, the author is som ewhat scathing about the Rite of Mizraim: “The names of the degrees, in this more than any other of the rites, prove that the founders must have sorely tested their inventive faculties. They appear indeed to have been driven to their wits’ end, for the fo rty - ninth and fiftieth bear the very expressive titles of ‘Chaos the First and Second’ ... At the fifty - fifth and fifty - sixth the comic element predominates: they are the ‘Washer and Bellows - blower!’ ... [the rite] is altogether too complicated and diffused ev er to be practised.”). The history as given should be considered the ‘authorised version’; on other accounts, the reduction to 33° was the doing of Harry Seymour, and occasioned a schism in the order with a group under Calvin Burnt continuing to work the full 96° rite. Further information on the Antient and Primitive Rite is comparatively scarce; never being particularly numerous, it escaped the numerous ‘exposés’ to which the Scottish Rite and other systems have been subject. The complete ritual was prin ted by John Yarker as Manual of the Degrees of the Antient and Primitive Rite in the 1880s, which work has to the best of my knowledge not been reprinted. Yarker also published Lectures of a Chapter, Senate and Council of the Antient and Primitive Rite wh ich contains the teachings of the degrees in the traditional question - and - answer format, and Masonic Charges and Lectures which contains the Orator’s discourses and lectures for most, possibly all, of the degrees. The latter two works have both been issue d in facsimile reprints by Kessinger Publishing. T.S. "}]
