That a new edition of this book should be issued at this time is perhaps, the best answer as to what kind of a reception so serious a view of modern Freemasonry, and so high an estimate of Ancient Mysteries as is herein set forth., might receive. It has not only attracted attention and excited inquiry, but met the unqualified approval of certain high Masons. Sir Albert Pike’s greatest work, restricted to the mem- bers of the craft, obtained but one hundred and fifty sub- scribers, If Mystic Masonry quadrupled this subscrip- tion list before the date of publication, the reason is to be sought, not in the superior quality of the book, but in the more popular form in which the subject is handled, in the removal of all restrictions as to subscribers, and still more, from the fact that a widespread interest has of late arisen in regard to these subjects; offering, as the author believes, the grandest opportunity presented to real Masonry for more than a thousand years, for pre- senting its sub1im.e philosophy to the world for the up- lifting of humanity. Mystic Masonry is, to a considerable extent, a com- pilation. It was not the author’s purpose to become an innovator, but rather, in a modest way, an inspirer and renovator, and for this purpose he but repeated state- ments that had already been made by those high in Ma- sonic authority, statements that had been overlooked or forgotten, and that needed to be remembered.

He wrote those things which he evidently believed his Masonic Brotherhood ought to know, and as he had divested his mind of all selfish motive or hope of gain, so must ‘he be exempt from the charge of plagiarism. He drew very largely, in many places, from the writings of Abb6 Constant, better known as Eliphas Levi, whose writings then existed only in the French language, and which undoubtedly contain the most profound knowledge of the Occult Sciences and the Ancient Mysteries given to the world since the days of the Old Initiates. As the present author has observed, in the body of this book, it matters far less whence these truths have been derived than what they really mean, although no reader is bound to accept the interpretation put upon them by any writer or commentator. Yet every intelligent inquirer may dis- cern their general reasonableness, the logical sequence of the whole as revealing a profound philosophy of Na- ture and of Life, and the beneficent influence they must exert if universally diffused and generally adopted amongst men.

SYMBOLISM. Symbolism began with the first communication of ideas among men, It is the outward sign of an inner concept-a word, an image, a gesture which tells, to the one who is of the inner circle, the story of a secret and often arbitrary association. No subject is more interesting or more comprehen- sive than the evolution of Symbolism from the mists of prehistoric times to the established methods of keeping human records today. Primitive man worked out a very elaborate and com- plex system for the explanation of life and social inter- course. It is replete with symbolism. Inside of the general circle of social structure, there are many smaller circles of secret societies, priestly, martial and political, which honeycomb every tribe and nation from the dawn of human time. Anthropologists, archaeologists and all the students of man and nature from savagery to our higher civiliza- tions, have filled the world with books that are the in- terpretations of symbols. It is a far cry from the rain-making gourd of a Dyak medicine man to the prayers of a modern man-of-God for rain, but it is a study in symbolism that covers the range of human development. One of the most interesting and obscure phases of symbolism is the difference in meaning of symbols to those within and those without certain societies-this is the esoteric and exoteric phase of symbols. Masonry is probably the greatest social and fraternal structure in the world. It has taken much of its sym- I 1 ix"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"x SYMBOLISM holism from the heritage of the ages, and much of it is very obscure even to the initiates.

The object of the author of this book is to show the relation between Free-masonry and the Mysteries of An- tiquity. This much, at least, is implied by the title of the book. That there is both a historical and philosophical thread uniting these departments of human thought and action is well known to every intelligent student of Ma- sonry, no less than to all students of Symbolism and Mysticism. One traveler, in the wilds of South America, records the fact that he found there an ancient road-bed running over mountain and valley for hundreds of miles. By whom this ancient structure was built is a matter of conjecture. It is now broken by time, with great gaps here and there, and forest trees obliterating its pathway, but it every-where shows the designing hand of man, In like manner when we undertake to follow the land- marks that connect the ancient wisdom with modern times, we must not look for uninterrupted threads, yet nevertheless will the careful student find the lines of transmission unmistakable, and the interruptions no bar to the proof of transmission from age to age. Masonry deals largely with the ethics and symbolism of the Ancient Mysteries. The writer believes that through the well-timed efforts of Masons to-day the grandest achievements in knowledge ever gained by m+n, which were originally concealed in the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, and in time became lost to the worId, may be again recovered. In the strictest sense this knowledge has never really been lost, as there have always existed"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xvi INTRODUCTION those who were possessed of the Great Secret. It was originally veiled in order to conceal it from the profane, and written in a universal language of Symbolism that the wise among all nations and throughout all time might read it, as it were, in their own language. It was also written in parable and allegory, so that the unlet- tered and common people might not be deprived of its wise precepts, and of its force in shaping character, dis- sipating ignorance, and inspiring hope. This Ancient Wisdom is the fountain from which Masonry takes its rise. The true Science of Symbolism in time became lost; the Temples of Initiation fell into decay, or were destroyed by priests and potentates, jealous of their in- fluenee. For many weary centuries men have been try- ing to recover the lost key and to restore the ancient wis- dom from the parables and allegories in which it had been concealed. But progress in this inverse order is not only necessarily slow and uncertain, but all such attempts have,, more or less, given rise to fantastic flights of the imagination, and resulted in confusion, rather than in enlightenment. The result has been to bring the whole subject under contempt and to make the name “mysti- cism” mean something vague and uncertain, if not alto- gether foolish, to those ignorant of its true meaning. “Remember,” says Bro. Albert Pike, “that the lessons and ceremonies of these degrees (those of the Blue- Lodge) have been for ages more and more accommodat- ing themselves, by curtailment and sinking into common- place, to the often limited memory and capacity of the Master and Instructor, and to the intellect and needs of the Pupil and Initiate; that they have come to us from an age when symbols were used, not to reveal but to conceal: when the commonest learning was confined to a select few, and the simplest principles of morality seemed newly discovered truths: and that these antique and ‘simple degrees now stand like the broken columns of a roofless, Druidic temple in their mutilated great- ness: in many parts also corrupted by time, and disfig-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xvii ured by modern additions and absurd interpretations.“- Morals and Dogma, p. 106, Here, then, are two causes that have operated to ren- der the old wisdom difficult of recovery, viz., conceal- ment, and ignorant alteration or misinterpretation. To these must be added a third source of obliteration, viz., the direct efforts of interested parties to utterly destroy all records. “Let one only think of the thousands, and perhaps millions of MSS. burnt; of monuments with their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols pulverized to dust; of the bands of early hermits and ascetics roaming about among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert and mountain, valley and highlands, seeking for and ready to destroy every obelisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay their hands upon, if it only bore the symbol of the tau or any other sign borrowed and appropriated by the new faith l .-and he will then see plainly how it is that so little has remained of the records of the Past.“-&cret Do&h, p. xl., vol. I. Every intelligent and unbiased Mason is more or less aware of these facts, and of the great difficulty attending all efforts to recover the Lost Word, and to rebuild the City and Temple of the Lord,-a glyphic that has many meanings. The author of this book desires to aid all that he can in this noble and glorious undertaking. In the effort to bring about such a result it is not contemplated that any innovations whatever should be introduced into Masonry as now organized. If the sublime philosophy which is the heritage of Masonry shall become universally diffused and rendered capable of apprehension by all intelligent persons, not only among Masons, but every-where, its beneficent influence may thus become universal among men. In this way may be hastened the rise of that Great “Republic of which every Nation is a family, and every individual a child.” It will be very naturally questioned whether any thing"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":". . . xv111 INTRODUCTION can be definitely ascertained regarding the Greater Mys- teries of Antiquity, inasmuch as they were always con- cealed, never revealed to the profane, never published to the world, and only recorded in glyphic, parable and al- legory. It has already been shown that all attempts to discover the real secret by running backward from para- ble and allegory have resulted in confusion and discour- agement. The interpretations resulting have been as fantastic and varied as the genius of each investigator; had any of these been possessed of a universal key to symbolism, or a complete philosophy of the Secret Doc- trine, the result might have been very different. The solution of this question is not only greatly simplified, when investigation is guided by such a philosophy, or a complete key, but the investigator has the positive as- surance at every step that he is on firm ground. But a far more important consideration remains to be noted. There is a tradition in the far East, and to be often traced more or less vaguely in the West, that the Great Lodge of the Magi, the Adepts, the Perfect Mas- ters, known and designated also by many other names, has never ceased to exist; that this Lodge has often, though secret and unknown, shaped the course of Em- pire and controlled the fate of Nations. Knowing al- ways the line of least resistance, and when and how to act, and having always in view only one object, viz., the Progress of Humanity and the Brotherhood of Man; de- spising fame and worldly honors, and working “without the hope of fee or reward,” they have concealed their la- bors, and either influenced those who knew them not to do their work, or worked through agents pledged to con- ceal their very existence. To the public generally, this may be a matter of little interest or importance, as the character of the work done must be the sole criterion by which that work is to be measured. But to Masons, it should be of interest, as showing what it is to be indeed, a Master Builder. It will reveal to them the meaning and goal of human evo-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTR~DUCTI~N xix lution, and give them the unqualified assurance that that evolution is being now aided by those who know, as it ha.s not been for many centuries. Such work has now become possible, because of a cycle of liberality and en- lightenment, when the workers are not likely to be sacri- ficed to the Moloch of bigotry and superstition. Grant- ing that such Masters exist, and that they are possessed of profound knowledge, that they are ready to help the world, the world must be ready and willing to receive such help, if it is to be benefited by it, instead of destroyr ing its agents. Guided, then, by a complete philosophy; armed with a key to symbolism, and aided by these Grand Masters, the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity may be restored and made to tell their hoary secrets for the benefit of the coming age. The object of this book is to give an outline of such work; it is introductory, and, to some extent, explana- tory, but by no means exhaustive. It is not based upon any authority beyond the author’s sincere convictions and capacity to apprehend the subject. The Mason who is ready to dig deeper and fill in the outline here fur- nished, is recommended to read carefully, if he has not already done so, Albert Pike’s great book, Morals and Dogma. The historical method of research is not followed in the compilation or writing of this book, although histor- ical facts are herein recorded. It is of far less impor- tance to determine whence Masonry has been derived, than what it really teaches. In answering this question, it may be justly charged that the author has put his own interpretation forward, not against facts or history, but in the face of what may be regarded as insufficient his- torical proof. To such a charge he would reply, first, that no well-authenticated history of Masonry is known to exist ; there being only isolated facts, or fragments, recording the existence of certain organizations or move- ments at different times, and their disappearance on ac- count of inward dissension or outward persecution,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xx INTRODUCTION Then another movement would spring up, at another time and place, and perhaps under a different name, though evidently working on the same ,general lines, only to meet with a similar fate. One writer makes the state- ment that fully eight hundred different degrees have thus, from time to time, been introduced to the Craft as Masonic. In no case does there exist any reliable con- secutive history of these various movements. But even if such history existed, it would but little serve the pur- pose of the present work, as will be readily seen from what has heretofore been said regarding all these at- tempts to discover the Lost Word, by reading backward from the outer form of Symbolism. Such a history would be curious and interesting, as showing the fertility of the human imagination, and its proneness to regard as valuable that which is curious and fantastic, because it is concealed. Mere vulgar curiosity and secrecy alone have never yet been the pass-words to the Adytum of real Initiation. On the other hand, such a history, did it really exist, would be tinged with a touch of pathos, on account of the many sorrowful disappointments it would have to record, in the case of earnest souls seek- ing, with sincerity and in truth, for the “Lost Word of the Master,” only to be overwhelmed at last by disap- pointment, or to be publicly executed as malefactors and enemies of State or Church. Such histories as exist well deserve, in many cases, the designation of “organized fiction,” and almost invariably record merely the opin- ions of those who were friendly or unfriendly to such movements, with a corresponding dearth of facts. For these reasons, no specially historical character is attempted to be given to this work. One of the strong points urged by the writer is the logical inferences drawn from such facts as are known to exist, and the general spirit every-where admitted as pervading the Ancient Mysteries in their original purity. That such organizations should exist through all time and yet be without a history seems at first a strange paradox. The"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxi enemies of Masonry will urge this fact as a reason for rejecting all that is herein contained, ignorant of the fact that few histories of any people or any epoch are better founded. Foremost among these detractors or deniers will be found the bigoted sectarian and the mod- ern materialist. With each of these, the real genius of Masonry. is in perpetual conflict. For the first, the uni- versal and unqualified Brotherhood of Man, is a dead letter, for he believes that only himself and his chosen associates can be saved. For the second, the materialist, the recognition of the Divine Architect of the Universe, in Masonry, as the “Principle of Principles,” and belief in the immortality of the Soul, will prove an equal stumbling block. Fortunately, the number of bigoted sectarians and the out-and-out materialists is few. The historical deficiency referred to is by no means without a parallel. That superstructure known as Christianity has, it is true, many historical phases; of dogmas the most contradictory; of doctrines promulgated in one age, and enforced with vice-regal authority, and severe pen- alties for denial and disbelief, only to be denied and repudiated as “damnable heresy” in another age. In the meantime, the origin of these doctrines and the personality of the Man of Sorrows around which these traditions cluster receive no adequate sup- port from authentic history. What, then, shall we con- clude regarding the real genius of Christianity? Is it all a fable, put forth and kept alive by designing men, to support their pretensions to authority? Are historical facts and personal biography alone en- titled to credit? While everlasting principles, Di- vine Beneficence, and the laying down of one’s life for another are of no account? Is that which has inspired the hope and brightened the lives of the down-trodden and despairing for ages a mere fancy, a designing lie? Tear every shred of history from the life of the Christ, to-day, and prove beyond all controversy that he never existed, and Humanity, from its heart-of-hearts, would"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xxii INTR~D~JCTI~N create him again to-morrow and justify the creation by every intuition of the human soul and by every need of the daily life of man. The historical contention might be given up, ignored, and the whole character, genius, and mission of Jesus, the Chrisb, be none the less real, bene- ficent, and eternal, with all of its human and dramatic episodes. Explain it as YGU will, it can never be ex- plained away ; the character remains ; and whether His- torical or Ideal, it is real and eterna.l. This digression serves to illustrate a principle of in- terpretation. The Traditions and Symbols of Masonry do not derive their real value from historical data, but from the zr,niversal and eternal tru.ths which they em- body. Were they historical episodes only, the world in its cyclic revolutions would long ago have swept by them and buried them in eternal oblivion. These great truths, obscured and lost in one age by misinterpretation or per- secution, rise, Phcenix-like, rejuvenated in the next. They are Immortal Ideals, knowing neither decay nor death. They are like a Divine Image concealed in a block of stone (the rough ashler), which many artists assail with mallet and chisel, square and compass, only, per- chance, to release a distorted idol. Only the Perfect Master can so chip away the stone as to reveal in all its grandeur and beauty the Divine Ideal, and endow it with the breath of life. Such is the building of character. The fable of Pygmalion and Galatea is, after all, more real than history. The thread of history is not in iso- lated facts, joined by conjecture, and warped to the igno- rant, bigoted, and time-serving opinions of men. The real thread is to be sought in the theme that, runs through the symphony of creation; in the lofty Ideals that inspire the life of man, and that lead him from the clod and the lowlands, where hover the ghosts of super- stition and fear to the mountains of light, where dwell forever inspiration and peace. Such ideals are the Christ,, Hiram, and the Perfect Muster. It is doubtful whether any portion of the present or-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION . . . xx111 ganization of Masonry, as such, can be traced further back than the middle of the 17th century. The great Masonic revolution of 1717, and the Constitutions of 1723 and 1738, seem to have brought into existence the present organizations ; which, by no means uniform throughout the world, have, nevertheless, very much in common. There were indeed earlier organizations, often unknown and unsuspected, and operating under differ- ent names, while using the same glyphics and symbolism; but no direct connection has been clearly shown to exist between these organizations and those of the present time. But as our pursuit is philosophical rather than historical, and our appeal rather to reason than to au- thority, we need not go into these matters further than may be necessary as land-marks in following our philo- sophical thread. A distinctively Christian character is now given to some of the Masonic degrees in Europe and America. Without the slightest opposition to the Christian re- ligion, as such, it can readily be shown that a sectarian bias of any kind is an innovation, wholly unwarranted, and entirely contrary to the genius of Masonry. Mason- ry, on the broad principle of toleration and brotherhood, can exclude neither Jew nor Gentile, Parsee nor Buddhist from its ample fold. Masonry is chiefly indebted to the French Jesui.ts for the distinctively Christian character of some of its degrees. The templar degrees are purely sectarian, and can in no sense claim that universal char- acter which recognizes the fraternity of all religions, and finds fellowship with all men., as brothers of one common humanity. No genuine Mason, imbued with the spirit of liberality, will treat any religion with derision or con- tempt, or exclude from fellowship any Brother who be- lieves in the existence of God, the Brotherhood of Man, and the Immortality of the Soul. This Catholic spirit is the very foundation of Masonry, and any departure from it is un-Masonic, and subversive of the ancient Landmarks and Genius of Masonry. If the Catholic 1"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xxiv INTRODUCTION Priests have the right to Christianize Masonry, so have Jews, Buddhists, or Mohammedans., an equal right to transform it to fit their own creeds; and such trans- formation in every case deprives Masonry of its univer- sal character. While it can not benefit the creed to which Masonry is made to conform, it will, in the end, destroy Masonry itself. True Masonry has, for ages, held aloft the torch-light of Toleration, Equity and Fraternity. The bigoted sectarian, whoever he may be, divides the world into two classes; those who, with zeal and blind faith, accept his dogmas and those who do not. The first he calls “brothers,” the second class he regards as aliens, if not enemies. Masonry, while adopting no+ religion and no form of doctrine or creed as such, or as formu- lated by any one religion, recognizes certain basic prin- ciples embodying the ethics taught in all religions. Every Mason may formulate his creed to suit himself, and may institute such forms of worship as may seem to him desirable or beneficent. Now, that the old creeds are every-where losi*ng their hold and falling in pieces, it is more than ever necessary to show that one of these have ever been a legitimate part of Masonry; that while Ma- sonry antagonizes none, it can adopt none as Masonic. This impartial spirit is the basis of that impartial jus- tice illustrated in more than one Masonic degree. “The distinction between the esoteric and exoteric doc- trines (a distinction purely Masonic) was always and from the very earliest times preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous time of Orpheus. And after the time of Alexander they resorted for &&&ion, dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools; to those of Egypt and Asia, as well as those of ancient Thrace, Sicily, Etruria, and Attica.” The real source from whence the Ancient Wisdom came was Persia and old India, the Mother of Civiliza- tions and Religions, and of the esoteric and concealed wisdom. In this book it is not attempted to explain all of the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxv symbols of Freemasonry, or to completely unfold the philosophy of the Secret Doctrine. Such an undertaking would transcend both the time and ability of the author. ‘The aim is rather to show a few points of contact, to outline methods of interpretation, to convince the un- biased reader that in the ancient mysteries lies a mine of wisdom far beyond all modern achievement, and to invite the co-operation of Masons in upholding these Ancient Truths. To recover the Lost VVord is to revive the Ancient Wisdom, and this will facilitate Universal Fraternity and Universal Progress, more than all other agencies now in our possession. In its ritualism and monitorial lessons Masonry teaches nothing in morals, in science, in religion, or in any other department of human knowledge or human in- terest, not taught elsewhere in current forms of thought, or by the sages of the past. In these directions it has no secrets of any kind. It is in the ancient symbols of Freemasonry that its real secrets lie concealed, and these are as densely veiled to the Mason as to any other, unless he has studied the science of symbolism in general, and masonic symbols in particular. In place of the term Mystic Masonry, the term Symbolic Masonry might have been used alone, but just here lies the whole secret, a profound mystery, and few Masons up to the present time have had the interest or the patience necessary to such investigation. This is a fact, and not intended as either a criticism or a reproach. If lacking a knowledge of the profound meaning of masonic symbolism, and its transcendent interest and importance, Masons have al- lowed the whole organization not only to fail in all real progress, but to degenerate, that is indeed a reproach. The number of individuals admitted to fellowship in the various degrees cannot atone for such degeneracy, but on the contrary it irather emphasizes it. The author of this book is perfectly well aware that such a treatise will not be popular with a certain class of Masons. They are almost certain to regard it with contempt and to under-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxvi INTRODUCTION take to frown it down. They will make the statement, which is perfectly true, that no such meaning has before been explained to them, and that no such philosophy is found in the monitorial instructions of the Lodge. The author can not, therefore, be justly accused of revealing any of the secrets of the Lodge unlawfully. The most profound secrets of Masonry are not revealed in the Lodge at all, They belong only to the few. This again, if admitted as a fact, will seem an injustice. But these secrets must be sought by the individual himself, and the candidate is debarred from possessing them solely by his own inattention to the hints everywhere given in the ritual of the Lodge, or by his indifference to the sub- ject. If he prefers to treat the whole subject with con- tempt, and to deny that any such real knowledge exists, it becomes evident that he not only closes the door against the possibility of himself possessing such knowl- edge, but he also becomes impervious to any evidence of its existence that might come to him at any time. 1x3 has no one but himself to blame if he is left in darkness. On the other hand, there is a large and increasing number of persons among Masons who really desire more light; who are satisfied that there must be other and profounder meanings behind the ritual and ceremonies of the Lodge. Some of these have taken the hint and “Journeyed Eastward” in search of Light. The play made upon the word, “light,” in the Royal Arch, and in almost every other degree; the three greater lights, and the three lesser, ought to teach every intelli- gent Mason that Light, and the trinity, or -triangle of lights, have a profound meaning, or else that the whole ritual is a meaningless farce. Aside from all interest that any individual Mason may find in the subject for his own enlightenment, it is obviously his duty, while preserving unaltered the usages and land-marks of the order, to advance the interests and fame of Masonry it- self by every just and benevolent means in his power. The names that are honored in the traditions of the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION xxvii Lodge and in the history of the Order, belong to those who have thus achieved enduring fame, and they are held aloft in the ritual of the Lodge as worthy of all emulation. But, shall neither the present nor the future add anything to this roll of honor? or, if need be, to the list of martyrs ? Are the dnys of noble deeds past with Masonry forever ? and the need of self-sacrifice and de- votion altogether a thing of the past? There was never greater need than at the present time: never so great an opportunity as now for Masonry to assume its true place among the institutions of man and to force recognition by the simple power of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth, based upon philosophy such as nowhere else ex- ists outside of its ancient symbols. If the majority of Masons do not realize the true significance and value of their possessions, there is all the more need for those who do to speak out, even in the face of discouragement and detraction, and do their utmost to demonstrate the truth. Does any intelligent Mason imagine that the guilds of practical Masons of a century and a half ago originated the order of Freemasons? There were indeed Archi- tects, and Master builders among them,, but the great majority of Masons were far more ignorant, as manual servants, than the majority of such builders are to-day. Freemasonry is modeled on the plan of the Ancient Mys- teries, with their glyphics and allegories, and this is no mere coincidence; the parallels are too closely drawn, Bro. Pike came to the conclusion, after long and patient investigation, that certain Hermetic Philosophers had a hand in the construction of the organization of Free and Accepted Masons, and if they embodied in its symbolism more than appears on the surface, and far deeper truths than the superficial student readily discerns, it was evi- dently designed that future generations should discern and use these profounder secrets. The evidence in this direction is not only conclusive, but overwhelming, though only fragments of it can be here adduced. In brief, then, the real secrets of Freemasonry lie in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"l . . XXV111 INTRODUCTION its Symbols, and the meaning of the symbols reveals a profound philosophy, and a universal science, that have never been transcended by man. The author of this book is not presumptive enough to claim that he has exhausted, or altogether apprehended, in its entirety, this old philosophy. He has, however, found such interest in its study, and it has opened to him such a mine of wealth, with such treasures revealed at every step, that he desires to share these precious jewels with his fellow craftsmen, that they may also go further, and from the secret vaults bring forth for inspection other and greater discoveries. These jewels have not been concealed by accident, but by design, in order that they might, in some future age, be restored. Even the stone that was rejected, and became lost in the rubbish, not only bears an emblem, and contains a mark, but is it- self, from first to last, with its surroundings, method of restoration, and final use, a symbol. It is the center of a five-pointed star, which is the kabalistic sign of man. In one direction, it symbolizes the five senses, lost in the rubbish of passion and selfish gratification.

So long as the struggle for bare existence involves, as it does to-day, the greater part of the energy, time, and opportunities of man, he will never discover the real meaning of Manhood, or the purpose of human existence. Even this much may be discerned from physical evolu- tion alone; from the study of the human brain, in which there is a continually increasing portion of gray sub- stance set free from the functions incident to the preser- vation of the physical structure, and evidently designed to be appropriated to separate and higher uses. Mere"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2 MYSTIC MASONRY intellectual activities alone, connected with the physical plane, with the maintenance and enjoyment of life, will not explain the philosophy of cerebral development. It is largely for this reason that the offices of the encepha- lon are so little known to-day. There are latent powers and almost infinite capabilities in man, the meaning of which he has hardly yet dreamed of possessing. Nor will leisure and intellectual cultivation alone reveal these powers. It is only through a complete philosophy of the entire nature of man and the capacities and destiny of the human soul, supplemented by the use of such knowl- edge, that man will eventually come into the possession of his birthright; and from this “general infancy”-as Browning puts it -begin the journey from real manhood to perfection. Two conditions at the present time stand squarely in the way of such achievements: first, anarchy and con- fusion, the result of s&-khness in all social relations. This condition can be overcome in but one way, viz., by the recognition of the unqualified Brotherhood of Man; not as a theory, a religious duty, or a mere matter of sentiment ; but as a fact in Nature; a universal and Di- vine Law; the penalty for the violation of which is prea cisely the conditions under which humanity now suffers. The second condition, which has given rise to “Con- fusion among the Workmen” in building the social tem- ple and the individual habitation of man, is false ideals; inefficient methods of education; and almost total ig- norance of the existence and the nature of the soul. The result of this ignorance may be seen in the fact, that not one individual in a million who has both leisure and op- portunity, makes any real advancement in the evolution of the higher po,wers; or is even cognizant of the fact that he is a LIVING SOUL. Old age is filled, not only with infirmities, but with miseries without number.

What life ought to be, is often conceived from our many failures. What it might be, is dimly perceived from the intuitions of the soul which the struggles and selfishness of existence have failed to entirely obliterate. These things ought not so to be, nor need they longer be, if earnest men and women would seek diligently, first for the cause of all our ills: and secondly, for a sufficient remedy. This remedy is to be found, first, in KNOWL- EDGE. Second, in Service of the Truth. Let us now ex- amine a little more in detail some of the conditions un- der which we suffer. The present is proudly designated as the Age of Sci- ence. The art of printing, the power of Steam and Elec- tricity in applied science; the Conservation and Corre- lation of Energy, and the Theory of Evolution in specu- lative science, with the resulting details, constitute the greater part of our real discoveries. One machine is made t.o do the work of a score or more of men, while t,he laborers who have been thus displaced have no adequate share in the profits of mechanical invention. Those who work with their hands are no longer artisans, but gener- ally machines, a necessity as to different details for which no machine has yet been invented. The work of the la- boring classes is thus reduced to the routine of dru3gery without the hope of advancement; and, therefore, with no other incentive than to keep the wolf from the door. A manufactured article which, when completed, serves more often to foster extravagance and luxury than to supply a necessity, passes through many hands before it is completed. The laborer is glad even thus to serve, be-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"4 MYSTIC MASONRY cause idleness means starvation, and still the Army of the Unemployed is an ever-increasing host. The occupa- tion of the common laborer is even more precarious than that of the mechanic or the artisan. Is it any wonder, then, that in times of financial uncertainty, when thou- sands of laborers are out of employment and threatened with starvation, unable to apprehend the real causes of their suffering ; naturally envious of those who are sup- plied with all the luxuries of life, and knowing that something is radically wrong somewhere to produce all of this inequality and injustice, band together to secure what they conceive to be their rights by force? But all this concerns mere physical existence, though the effects are seen on every plane of life. With regard to the Science of Man, and all that concerns his origin, nature and destiny, individually or collectively, neither science nor religion has taught us any thing. Science has given us the slogan- “the survival of the fittest,“- a mere scientific phrasing of the motto of the Robber Barons, that “he may seize who hath the power, and he may hold who can.” In the industries of life the result may be reduced to one word, COMPETITION. In manufac- ture, in trade, in all professions-even the Clerical pro- fession-in schools, every-where, COMPETITION, Strife, and “the survival of the fittest.” “And this to fill us with regard for man; With apprehension of his passing worth, Desire to work his proper nature out, And ascertain his rank and final place.” So far our boasted ci v!lization is, on a gigantic scale, a Car of Jagarmatha, and it crushes heads and hearts as relentlessly as the wooden idol of our heathen brothers, only, American-like, we do the killing by wholesale. Are not nearly the whole of the energies and activities of life directed to and expended upon the physical plane alone? And has not the struggle for existence increased with the great majority, in spite of all our boa&d prog-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 5 ress, our boasted science, and our Christian Civilization? We have neither the time, the energy, nor the disposition to discover the real meaning and aim of life, because all our energies are absorbed in the bare maintenance of existence. “Ah! small is the pleasure existence can give, When the fear we shall die only proves that we live.” If real knowledge of the nature of the soul and the des- tiny of man had never existed, our present condition would be pitiable in the extreme; but when it is demon- strated that this knowledge once existed, that it was first degraded by selfishness and then lost by design, and that for centuries designing Priests, many of whom would have disgraced a scaffold, but who have been canonized as sai.nts, have done their utmost to deprive humanity of this knowledge, what shall the humanitarian say? Shall he preach Universal Brotherhood and Toleration, and yet seek revenge on the priesthood? A thousand times, no! but rather leave priest and proletariat to set- tle their own affairs and go their own way, and go to ’ work ou?-selves to recover the lost knowledge, and when recovered devote it absolutely to Humanity. The most hopeful sign of the times is the humanitarian work being done by thousands of well-disposed persons who appreciate existing evils, and desire to get rid of them. In very many instances, however, the results at- tained are by no means commensurate with the energy or the sacrifice employed, for self-sacrifice is a virtue not altogether unknown to Christendom. But in very many instances these humanitarian efforts resemble an attempt to destroy a Upas tree, which being cut down every day grows again before morning.

It ought some time to occur to us that society is all wrong, or that something is radically wrong with all our meth- ods. In the aggregate all the profits derived from scien- tific discoveries and from labor-saving machines has to be returned to the criminal or indigent classes. The only thing that we can boast of as a result is an increase in the number of millionaires; and these, as a class, instead of being the fruition of a higher evolution are almost without exception the very flower of a Civilization of Competition and Selfishness. They have crea.ted an aris- tocracy of wealth, very often by gambling or stealing, and determine the criterion of what i;; calied “good SO- ciety,” viz : extravagant display and vulgar pretentious- ness. What then is really the matter with our boasted civ- ilization ? The answer is, IGNORANCE and SELFISHNESS; it is the result of the “Sin of Separateness.” If in our social and political affairs the foregoing are the results in spite of all scientific progress, and in the face of our boasted “Christian Civilization,” in the in- tellectual realm, or in educational matters, are we any better off? Let us see. One of the first lessons the child is taught in school is Competition. It is instilled into every child at an early age that he should aim to be at the head of his class, and his exertions are continually incited to get ahead of his fellows. Many a young man or young woman graduat- ing from literary institutior=s and carrying 02 the prizes for proficiency or scholarship are mental wrecks all the rest of their lives. Nor are the subjects taught, or the branches of learning mastered, such, in a great majority of instances, as are of any great practical value to the student in after life. The amount of technical forma- tion acquired is often useful in the so-called learned pro- fessions ; but in the ordinary walks of life more often fall into disuse, and seldom serve the purpose of open- ing the higher avenues of knowledge, or putting the in-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 7 dividual in possession of a real knowledge of himself. Herbert Spencer mentions five objects to be attained in the education of children: That education which pre- pares for direct self-preservation ; that which prepares for indirect self-preservation ; that which prepares for parenthood ; that which prepares for citizenship; and that which prepares for the miscellaneous refinements of life. These objects set forth by one of the most pro- found writers of the present time, may be seen to pertain to self-preservation and “getting on” in life, the last ob- ject may, by implication, have a Social bearing; but any higher knowledge, designed to put man in possession of his real powers and to promote the evolution of the soul, are not even mentioned. In all our religious instruction, from childhood, and through all the ministrations of religion in after life, we are taught to look very sharp after the salvation of our own souls; and this in the face of the statement that a very large proportion of the human race will eventually be utterly lost, or damned, for all eternity! Science completes the picture by trying to demonstrate that the struggle for existence is a necessary condition of all im- provement ; and that only the sharpest tooth and the longest claw can survive. The ideal thus held aloft by both religion and science is SELFISHNESS. Self-preserva- tion is regarded as the \"FIRST LAW OF LIFE.\" The result is MATERIALISM in the strictest and broadest sense, and this has paralyzed, where it has not utterly destroyed, all higher ideals. Is it not reasonable to suppose that if we were pos- sessed of real knowledge we might so govern our actions, and so shape our lives as to avoid the pitfalls of igno- rance, and set our feet on the line of the higher e.volu- tion? Religion offers Faith, with a system of rewards and punishments, and inculcates Charity, which is more often interpreted as the giving of alms; but religion does not give us Knowledge. Science offers a theory, or a working hypothesis, but still does not give us Knowledge."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"8 MYSTIC MASONRY So long as it requires all of our energies to barely main- tain existence on the physical plane, and to help those who can not do even that, unaided, we have little oppor- tunity to seek for higher things. The complicated system under which we are working is the result of many centuries of ignorance and super- stition, and of many generations of evil-doing, and these results can not be changed in a day. Many of our mod- ern institutions, covered over, as they are, with abuses and injustice, are, nevertheless, so deep-rooted that they will have to work themselves out to the bitter end of pain, sorrow, and, probably, through lawlessness and blood- shed. This need not be, yet it would be impossible to convince all at once, a sufficient number of individuals who are involved in these institutions, of the real cause of all our misery, and, at the same time, to induce them to co-operate AT ONCE to remove the cause. Such a thing is not to be expected, because of universal unbelief as to the existence of the remedy proposed; hence, retribu- tive Justice will have to work out its own results. Is it really necessary that rnankind should forever re- main in ignorance, and forever repeat the same follies, and invite the retribution that we have invoked? In the following pages, two sources of knowledge have been pointed out, viz., Masonry and Philosophy, and these have been shown to take their rise, either directly or indirectly, from the Mysteries of Antiquity. The Un- qualified Brotherhood of Man is the basis of all ethics, and the Great Republic is the Ideal State. If these con- cepts were accepted and acted upon, there would result time, opportunity, and the power to apprehend the deeper problems of the origin, nature, and destiny of man. “Man is not man as yet.” What he may be, and what he might do, under favor&ble conditions, is very seldom even dreamed of. We never build beyond our ideals. We habitually fall below them. There are a few persons in nearly every community with whom the struggle for existence is reduced to the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 9 minimum; and, undoubtedly, the majority of these are women. Having a competency against want, or being amply provided for, they really have leisure for study and self-improvement ; and many of these engage more or less in charitable work. But possessing no high ideal beyond the meritoriousness of charity and the self-ap- probation which it brings, and having no real knowledge as to the nature of the soul and the laws of its higher evolution, they fritter ’ away their opportunity in luxury and self-indulgence, which they feel is justified by the tribute they have already paid to charity. The result is, that they are habitually consumed with ennz&i; and they are as unstable as water in the search for a new sensa- tion or a new excitement. If the majority of these are women who determine the standards and usages in what is called “society,” the ideals of their male associates are far lower than theirs, and the men are saved from ennzti by the diversity of Club Life or the necessities of business. The common laborer who finds continued employment is really less miserable oftentimes than these sons and daughters of fortune, who generally lose all zest in life, whose old age is filled with misery over their vanished youth, and whose lives are frequently cut short by paresis, where they do not degenerate into imbecility. It is one of the most hopeful signs of the time that amonE this favored class an increasing number are found devoting them- selves, their time, energy, and money, to the betterment of the condition of the masses. F&incarnation being true, these servants of humanity are laying by a store of good Karma, which is literally “treasure in heaven,” and which must inevitably secure for them still broader op- portunities and greater power fx good in another life; and best of all, they are unfolding the higher spiritual perceptions. Nothing so shrouds the Higher Self in man as selfishness, and this is the reason why so few persons are possessed of the direct perception that what is true, is True, and that what is false, is False."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"10 MYSTIC MASONRY There has been for a long time a very widespread and increasing conviction that Education would prove a panacea for all our evils; and that if we could begin with the young, and have the training of children, we could eventually reform society, even though these children might be the offspring of vicious parentage. That “we must educate or we must perish,” contains, no doubt, a great truth; but it is offset by another saying: “Educa- tion can not repair the defects of birth.” What real education is, how and when it should begin, and what, under the *most favorable circumstances, it may be ex- pected to accomplish, we do not yet perceive. The say- ing that it takes at least three generations to make a Gentleman contains a truth, even if the criterion as to what constitutes a real gentleman may be uncertain or dc- fective. And again, the saying, that the education of a child should begin at least nine months before it is born, shows that prenatal conditions and influences are at least recognized as existing. But in this last direction, viz., as to tile environment of the Mother during gestation, the Ancient Greeks knew far more than we, and enacted laws to prevent physical deformity from being propa- gated or even seen. The result was physical symmetry such as the world has seldom seen. Now when all these problems are studied in the light of re-incarnation the greater part of all obscurity dis- appears. Such study teaches us what the Ego is, and exactly what is determined by heredity, and what are the individual and inalienable possessions of the Ego itself. It teaches how, by a law as blind as that of gravitation, because it is always absolutely just, and as inflexible as Fatz, thz Karma of the child associates it with the Karma of the parents, whether on the score of virtue or of vice. If both vice and virtue adhere to the Ego as the result of all former living, and are manifest in the tendencies of the individual, one way or the other, then the parentage, in any case, can only furnish the neces-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 11 sary conditions of expression; the opportunity to work out the innate tendencies. Now the thing that education can and ought to change, is these innate tendencies. This is the only genuine reformation; and a great step toward this is gained by improvement in individual environment. If, however, it be considered that all environment is the result of Karma under natural law, it will be seen that the most unfortunate and hopeless environment might sometimes afford the very conditions of reformation. It can be imagined that a really intelligent and aspiring Ego, brought by Karma into these unfavorable conditions as the result of its own acts in a former life, would not oilly put forth all of its energies to rise, but would be forever- more repelled by such degrading influences as now sur- round him, and flee from them as from a pestilence. Here we come face to face with the real problem of education. How shall we educate? With the children of the poor, and even with many of those of the middle classes, the ordinary curriculum of School and College often serves to inculcate ideas of luxury and contempt for labor, and results, in many instances, in idleness and dissipation. Many parents are ambitious that their chil- dren should be educated, in order that they may escape from hard work, and have an easier time in life than they have had themselves. In morality, or ethics, the children are taught certain precepts, or are required to recite certain religious formula, such as the Creed or the Catechism; they are very seldom, however, taught un- selfishness or self-conquest. The result is that the in- nate perceptions of the child, which are naturally far keener than most people are aware of, and which, invaril- ably, unless cultivated, become blunted with age and worldly experience, are utterly disregarded, or they are blunted by the very system of competition in education to which reference has already been made. It may thus be seen that it makes all the difference in the world how"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"12 MYSTIC MASONRY we educate, and that Ideals here are of more importance than almost anywhere else. It is true that in some of the newer colleges, methods are being introduced which foster individuality, and which cultivate the natural preceptions to an extent hitherto almost unknown. This method must necessarily result i;l putting those students who are so fortunate as to come under its influence in possession of their own faculties, and in making them aware of their own capa- bilities. This method must neeessarib favor a strong Individuality in the student. Kow, if this can be supple- mented by a further knowledge of the Latent Powers of the Soul and with the true ideals of the higher evolution, the result will be something not yet apprehended by t.he majority of educators. In discussing the question as to what kind of knowl- edge is of the most use, Herbert Spencer places Scientific Knowledge in the first category; not alone for its prac- tical results, but on account of tl;le ideals to which it mav ” give rise, and the broader apprehension to which it may lead. “Only the sincere man of science,” he says, “and not the mere calculator of distances, or analyzer of com- pounds, or labeler of species; but him who through lower truths seeks higher, and eventually the highest-can truly know how utterly beyond, not only human knowl- edge, but human conception, is the Universal Power of which Nature, and Life, and Thought are manifesta- tions.” In like manner Professor Huxley makes the consum- mation of Science to be t,he discernment of the rational order pervading the universe. It is, then, our methods that are most at fault and our ignorance that holds us down. It is this higher knowledge toward which all useful and rational acquirement tends; and why should our efforts cease short of the very highest? All education that does not tend in this direction, with the final goal consistently and continually in view, is false, and is necessarily a fail-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 13 ure. Now, this higher knowledge is a knowledge of the Soul: of its origin, nature, powers, and the laws that govern its evolution; and this is precisely the knowledge which modern scien ce fails to aEard, but which Ancient Science taught in thz Mysteries of Antiquity. All pre- liminary study znd training led up to this-“The real measure of a man.” Just as all life is an evolution, so is all real knowledge an initiation; and it proceeds in a natural or&r, and aivances by specific “degrees.” The candidate must always be worthy and well qualified, duly a::d truly prepared. That is, he must perceive that suc’il knowledge exists; muzt desire to possess it; and must be willing to cake wlnatever personal sacrifice is nccezsary for its acquirement. He must have passed be- yonci the stash? of blind belief or superstition, the bondage of fear, the age of fable, and the dominion of appetite and sense. This is the meaning of being “duly 2nd truly prepared.” He must have proved his fitness in these directicns, no less thaIi the absence in him of that subtler form cf iz~tellectual selfishness which comes from the roszesiz^;ion of knowl;dgz, and the desire for do- mimozl through it over others ICSS highly endowed, for selfish purposes cf his own. His motive, therefore, alone, can determine that he is “worthy and well qualified.” It is true on every plane of life, that in the process by which k::owledge is acquired-always by experience- man becomes the thing which he knows. That is, know- ing is a progressive becoming. There results, therefore, a continual transformation of the motives, ideals, and perceptions cf the individual, whenever in his daily ex- perience in life he is placed on the lines of least resist- ance or the Natural Order of Evolution. This is the really scientific and philosophical meaning of all Initia- tiox. Ey referring to the chal;ter in which the Principles and PZaetles of Life are considered, it will be seen that the principle just stated is the logical deduction from the idea of Microcosm and Macrocosm, or the philosophical concept that man is Involved from Divinity, and Evolves"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"14 MYSTIC MASONRY with Universal Nature; and that, therefore, his evolu- tion runs pari passu with that of the earth he inhabits. There is so much of the commonplace that passes with us for knowledge, and that is so utterly void of compre- hension, that unless one is familiar with this line of thought he will not readily see the truth and bearing of the statement, that man always becomes that which he really knows. Here lies the reason why the mere incul- cation of moral precepts so often fails entirely in trans- forming character; and why there is so much lip-service. In his travels through China and Thibet, Abbe Hut gives a graphic account of the traveling traders whom he en- countered. He depicts their shrewdness in trade and their general air of friendliness, and .declaxes that the slogan forever on their lips was that “All men are brothers,” but this did not prevent them from taking every possible advantage of their customers; so easy is it for a moral precept to degenerate into mere slang. Conscience is the struggle of the understanding in assim- ilating experience ; it is the effort of the individual to adjust precept with practice, or in other words, Con- science is that living, active process, resulting in the growth of the soul, and in the increase of man’s power to apprehend truth. In the Ancient Mysteries, Life presented itself to the candidate as a problem to be solved, and not as certain propositions to be memorized and as easily forgotten. The solution of this problem constituted all genuine initi- ation, and at every step or “degree” the problem ex- panded. As the vision of the candidate enlarged in rela- tion to the problems and meaning of life, his powers of apprehension and assimilation also increased proportion- ately. This was also an evolution. It may reasonably be supposed that the lower degrees of such initiation con- cerned the ordinary affairs of life, viz., a knowledge of the laws and processes of external nature: the candi- date’s relation to these through his physical body, and his relations, on the physical plane, through his animal"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"PRTNCIPLES OF EDUCATION AND ETHICS 15 senses, and social instincts, to his fellow-men. These matters being learned, adjusted, Mastered, the candidate passed to the next degree. Here he learned theoretically, at first, the nature of the soul; the process of its evolu- tion, and began to unfold those finer instincts that have been so often referred to in certain sections of this work. If he was found capable of apprehending these, and kept his ‘cvow” in the preceding degree, he presently discov- ered the evolution within him of senses and faculties per- taining to the “soul-plane.” His progress would be instantly arrested, and his teachers would refuse all fur- ther instruction, if he was found negligent of the ordi- nary duties of life; those to his family, his neighbors, or his country. All these must have been fully discharged before he could stand upon the threshold as a candidate for the Greater Mysteries; for in these he became an un- selfish Servant of Humanity as a whole; and had no longer the right to bestow the gifts of knowledge or pow- er that he possessed, upon his own kinsmen, or friends, in preference to strangers. In the higher degrees, he might be precluded from using these powers even to preserve his own life. Both the Master and his Powers belong to Humanity. If the reader will but reflect a moment, how the tantalizing Jews called upon Jesus to “save himself and Come down from the cross,” if he were the Christ, it may be seen that this doctrine of Supreme Selflessness ought, long ago, to have been better apprehended by the Christian world; for while it is a Divine Attribute, the Synonym of the Christ, it is latent in all humanity, and must be evolved as herein described. That which makes such an evolution seem to modern readers impossible, is, that it can not be conceived as be- ing accomplished in a single life, nor can it be. It is the result of persistent effort guided by high ideals through many lives. Those who deny Pre-existence may logically deny all such evolution. There must, however, come a time when the consummation is reached in one life; and this is the logical meaning of the saying of Jesus-IT IS FINISHED."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY. “The whole world is but one Republic, of which each Nation is a family, and every individual a child.

No one, however, at all familiar with the subject,, will for a moment undertake to maintain that nothing is left to be accomplished. It is, indeed, something grand and sublime to have conceived such an ideal, and to have striven in any measure toward its realization ; and this, Masonry has done from its earliest history. There is a thread of tradition connecting modern Ma- sonry with the most ancient Mysteries of Antiquity. The ancient landmarks may be discovered in every nation and time. “Notwithstanding the connection that so evidently exists,” says Dr. Rebold, “between the ancient Mysteries and the Freemasonry of our day, the latter should be considered an imitation rather than a continuation of those ancient Mysteries; for initiation into them was the entering of a school, wherein were t,aught art, science, morals, jaw, philosophy, philanthropy and the wonders and worship of nature.“-REBo~D’s History, p. 62. The universal Science and the sublime philosophy, once taught in the Greater Mysteries of Egypt, Chaldea, Persia, and India, and among many other nations of antiquity, is a dead letter in modern Freemasonry. The intelligent Mason, however, should be the last person in the world to deny that such wisdom once existed, for the simple reason that the whole superstructure of Masonry is built upon the traditions of its existenc.e, and its ritual serves as its living monument, Proficiency in the preced- ing degree is every-where made a reason for advance- ment in Masonry. This proficiency is made to consist in the ability of the candidate to repeat, word for word, certain rituals and obligations already passed, the mean- ing or explanations of which constitute the lectures in the various degrees. The usage at this point, in the United States at least, serves rather to secure the rights and benefits of the Lodge to those entitled to them, and to withhold them from a11 others, than to advance the ea.t~:? i - date in real knowledge. In other Masonic jurisdi~L;~;-&,,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"18 MYSTIC MASONRY however, a different custom prevails. Of the Belgium Lodges, for example, a Brother writes as follows: “Our Lodge, called ‘La Charite,’ at Orient Charlevoi, is under obedience of the great Orient at Brussels, and has the Scottish Rite. No Mason is supposed to know any thing of the ritual by heart. Questions and answers are read out, especially at initiation. The work of the Mason is supposed to be interior work in himself, before it can become exterior labor. So in order to obtain his degrees he has to do some work of his own, and no one is supposed to learn any thing by heart, except words, signs and pass-words. Now I have to tell you that every Mason is supposed to do some literary work on general subjects concerning the welfare of man, human institu- tions, sociology, history, philosophy, philanthropy, etc., etc., and it is such work that a young Mason is supposed to do. Then, after reading these papers, they are dis- cussed by all the members of the Lodge present, perhaps for three or four meetings, until the subject seems to be exhausted. This develops, in the young Mason, his in- telligence and his moral feeling.” As will be shown in a later section, this method con- forms tb that pursued in the Lesser Mysteries of Ari- tiquity, which were preparatory for the Greater Mys- teries. It should be borne in mind that in modern Freemason- ry, in the Ancient Mysteries, and in all of the great Re- ligions, there was always an Exoteric portion given out to the world, to the uninitiated, and an Esoteric portion reserved for the initiate, and revealed by degrees, ac- cording as the candidate demonstrated his fitness to receive, conceal, and rightly use the knowledge so im- parted. Few professed Christians are, perhaps, aware that such was the case with Christianity during the first two or three centuries. The following quotations from Albert Pike’s great work may therefore be of interest. On page 541 (et seq.) he says : “This, in its purity, as taught by Christ himself, was"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 19 the true primitive religion, as communicated by God to the Pat,riarchs. It was no new religion, but the repro- duction of the oldest of all; and its true and perfect mo- rality is the morality of Masonry, as it is the morality of every creed of antiquity.” St. Augustine says : “What is now called the Christian Religion existed among the ancients, and was not absent from the human race until Christ came, from which time the true re- ligion, which existed already, began to be called Christian.“* St. Augustine was Bishop of Hippo, born in 347 A. D., and lived near enough the time of Christ to know where- of he wrote. But to continue our quotations from Morals and Dogma: “In the early days of ‘Christianity, there was an initia- tion like those of the Pagans. Persons were admitted on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of the doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initiates were consequently divided into three classes: the first, Auditors; the second, Cate- chumens; and the third, the Faithful. These doctrines, and the celebration of the Holy Sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrecy. These Mysteries were divided into three parts: the first styled the Mass of the Catechumens; the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The celebration of the Mysteries of Mythras was also styled a Mass, and the ceremonies used were the same. There were found all the sacr&ments of the Catholic Church, even the breath of confirmation.” . l “The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after the time of the Apostles, practiced the Mys- teries with t.he old Egyptian legend.

They all claimed” - (Gnostics, Marcosians, Ophites, etc.) - “to possess a secret doctrine, coming to them directly from Jesus Christ, different from that of the Gospels and Epistles, and superior to those communications, which, in their eyes, were merely exoteric. This secret doctrine they did not communicate to every one; and among the extensive sects of the Basilideans, hardly one in a thou- sand knew it, as we learn from Irenaeus. We know the name of only the highest class of their initiates. They were styled Elect, or Elus, and ‘Strangers to the World.’ They had at least three degrees-the Material, the In- tellectual, and the Spiritual, and the lesser and greater mysteries ; and the number of those who attained the highest degree was quite small.” “In the Hierarchiae, attributed to St. Dionysus, the Areopagite, the first Bishop of Athens, the tradition of the sacrament is said to have been divided into three degrees of grades -Purification, Initiation, and Accom- plishment or Perfection -and it mentions also, as part of the ceremony, the bringing to sight. The Apostolic Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bishop of Rome, describe the early church, and say:’ ‘These regulations must on no account be communicated to all sorts of per- sons, because of the mysteries contained in them.’ ” It is interesting to contrast the utterances of early Bishops of the Christian Church with the Bulls and An- athemas of excommunicat,ion of later Popes, hurled against the Masons for entertaining the same doctrines and practicing the same rites.

We appeal to your Thra.cian and Eleusinian mysteries; and we are specially bound to this caution, because if we prove faithless, we should not only provoke Heaven, but draw upon our heads the utmost rigor of human displeasure.” Clemens, Bishop of Alexandria, born A. D, 191, says, in his Stromata, that he can not explain the Mysteries, be- cause he should thereby, according to the old proverb, “put a sword into the hands of a child.” He frequently compares the discipline of the Secret with the “Heathen Mysteries as to their internal and recondite wisdom.” Origen, born A. D. 134 or 135, answering Celsus, who had objected that the Christians had a concealed doc- trine, said : “Inasmuch as the essential and important doctrines and prilzciples of Christianity are openly taught, it is foolish to object that there are other things that are recondite; for this is common discipline with that of those philosophers in whose teachings some things were exoteric and some esoteric; and it is enough to say that it was so with some of the disciples of Pythagoras.” The formula which the primitive church pronounced at the moment of celebrating its mysteries, was this: “Depart ye Profane ! Let the Catechumens, and those who have not been admitted or initiated, go forth.” Archelaus, Bishop of Cascara in Mesopotamia, who, in the year 2’78, conducted a controversy with the Manichaeans, said : “These mysteries the church now communicates to him who has passed through the introductory degree.

This is what the uninitiated are not permitted to contemplate; and how should it ever be proper to write and circulate among the people an account of them.” St. Gregory Nazianze:?, Bishop of Constantinople, A. D. 379, says: ‘(YOU have heard as much of the mystery as we are allowed to speak openly in the ears of all; the rest will be communicated to you in private; and that you must retain within yourself.” . . . “Our mysteries are not to be made known to strangers.” The foregoing quotations are from Pike’s MO&S and Dogma, pp. 141, 142, 143, 144 and 145. To this list of witnesses are also added St. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, A.

The Mystery of Christ received a new interpretation after the first Nicene Council, and as the Church sought dominion, it lost the Great Secret, and since then has denied that it ever existed, and don? all in its power to obliterate all its records and monu- ments. While we are concerned with Masonry rather than Christianity, it is, nevertheless, necessary to show the coz?ncctin, 4~ links, in order that the “Ancient Land- marks” mzy not only be discerned, but correctly inter- preted. Neither Christianity nor Freemasonry is the direct and liTzeal dzseendant of the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, but both are imitators, and both have failed to preserve the Key of interpretation, and are generally unaware that such a Key ever existed. My contention is not against either JJasonry or Christianity, but for thz rejuvenation of both, through the restoration of the Secret Doctrine to each. Modern Masonry never pos- sessed the Key, whiIe many of the early Christian sect3 had it in their pocsession, but in time lost it through worldliness, the greed for earthly dominion, and the de- cay of Spirituality. Something further may be shown as to the origin of the Christian Mysteries. In the year 525, R. c , Cambyces, called “the mad,” led an army into Egypt, overran the country, destroyed its cities, palaces and temples, scattered its priest-initiates, and reduced the country to a Persian province. Many of its priests took refuge in Greece, and conveyed thither the Egyptian Mysteries, which Pythagoras had journeyed to Egypt to obtain half a century earlier. In the time of Plato, a century later, the Mysteries were in a flourishing con- dition, and in them he learned his sublime philosophy. At the beginning cf our era the mysteries had declined. There remained, however, the Gnostics, the Essenes, and the Therapeutiae of Alexandria, and from these the Christian mysteries were undoubtedly derived. The"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"24 MYSTIC MASONRY Neoplatonists, headed by Ammonius Saccus, undertook to preserve the primitive revelation, and the utterances of the Christian Bishops to which I have referred, show how the Secret Doctrine was adopted from the earlier mysteries by the primitive Christians during the first three centuries of our era. After the first Council of Nice, A. f)., 325, little more was heard of the earlier doc- trines, and with the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria, Catholic supremacy and the dark ages oblit- erated the primitive wisdom in Western Europe, as it was also overrun by hordes of barbarians from the north. The principle seats of learning were the convents. Com- ing now to the dawn of the 16th century, and the great Protestant Reformation, we find Johann Trithemius, Abbot of St. Jacob, at Wurtzburg, celebrated as one of the greatest of Alchemists and Adepts; and Cornelius Agrippi and Paracelsus were his pupils. John Reuchlin, a famous Kabalist of that time, and counted as one of the most learned men in his day in Europe, was the friend and perceptor of Luther, and Luther’s first public utterances were a course of lectures on the philosophy of Aristotle. A strong effort was made to revive the an- cient wisdom, but the age was too gross and super- stitious, and the reformation resulted in centuries of blind belief, and the suppression of the Secret Doctrine. Modern Freemasonry honors as its ancient great teachers Zoroaster7 Pythagoras, Plato, and many others, and in some of its degrees gives a brief summary of their doctrines. Masonry, in a certain sense, includes them all, and has adopted their precepts. They were all ini- tiates in the mysteries, and fundamentally their doc- trines were the same. All taught the existence of the G. A. 0. U., the immortality of the soul, and the un- qualified Brotherhood of Man; and with these primitive and fundamental truths Masonry is in full accord.

The past two or three centuries at most will include the whole of the history of modern Freemasonry. The organization is recent, but its principles, when clearly defined, and intelligently interpreted are eternal, and are in full accord with the greater mysteries of antiquity. The foregoing running comment on some of the an- cient landmar’ks will enable us to draw comparisons and derive interpretations of Masonic symbols and glyphics from ancient mysteries, and so to discover the science and philosophy that constitute the genius of Masonry. Instead of being an imitation of the nlysteries of An- tiquity, Masonry should become their Restoration and Perpetuation through the coming centuries, not by re- laxing its discipline, or changing its ritual, but by deep- ening the learning, intensifying the zeal and elevating the aim of .every Brother throughout the world."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III. THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY. The traditions, glyphics and ritual of Freemasonry cluster around the building of the temple; the legend of the widow’s son, Hiram-abiff, who lost his life in the defense of his integrity, and the search for the Lost Word of the Master. As the candidate progresses, de- gree after degree, he is furnished with the working-tools suited to his degree of knowledge and proficiency, given instruction as to their use; the lesser and greater lights are revealed and explained; and through all, each outer form, or material thing, is shown to be a symbol of a deeper mystery, a concealed potency. This is, in brief, the language and the philosophy of symbolism, or the exoteric, and the esoteric garb of Truth. The method itself, outside of all details or ap- plications, has a deeper scientific significance than most persons are aware of. This method of instruction is not fanciful or arbitrary, but conforms to the process of Eternal Nature in building an atom or a world; a daisy or a man. Cosmos has evolved from Chaos, and yet Chaos remains the Eternal Potency; what Plato called the “‘Wo~*Zd of Divine Ideas,” This will be more fully explained in a subseque;lt chapter. For the present, it may suffice to say, that from primitive space, primordial ether, or what modern science might call, the Matrix or origin of the “nebulous mass,” the earth and all that it contains has evolved. The essential form, or idea of all things ; the potency or force ; and the matter as we now discern it, must have existed in primordial space."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 27 Therefore, these two always exist, viz., the inner potency, and the outer act; the concealed Idea, and the outer form; the inner meaning, and the outer event. Each is in its turn a symbol of the other. Hence the saying on the Smaragdine Tablet, as above so belozu. All outward things are therefore symbols, or embodiments of pre- existing Ideas, and out of this subjective ideal realm all visible things have emanated. This doctrine of emana- tions is the key to the philosophy of Plato, and that of the Gnostic sects from which the early Christians derived their my&cries, This fact is mentioned here in order to show the deep foundations of the glyph& of Masonry. In the Ritual of Masonry, King Solomon’s temple is taken as a symbol. The building and the restoration of the temple at Jerusalem are dramatically represented in the work of the Lodge, and in the ceremony of initiation, by a play upon words and parity of events, and applied to the candidate, with admonition, warning or encour- agement, as the drama unfolds. The measurements and proportion of the temple are dwelt upon in order to bring in the science of numbers, form, and proportion, so manifest in architecture, and to connect thsm with the “spiritual temple” with which they all have the same, though less obvious, relations. The symbolism is fitted to ideal relations, rather than to actual existences or his.- torical events. SOL-OM-ON represents the name of Deity in three languages, and the biblical history is doubtless an allegory or myth of the Sun-god. There is no reliable history of the construction of any such temple at Jeru- salem, and recent explorations and measurements have greatly altered the dimensiorls as heretofore given. Hiram Abiff is dramatically represented to have lost his life when the temple was near completion, and yet it is recorded that after the completion of the temple he la- bored for years to construct and ornament a palace for the King. Add to these facts the statement that the temple was constructed without the sound of hammer or any tool of iron, and it is thus likened more nearly to"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"28 MYSTIC MASONRY that other “Spiritual Temple, not made with hands, eter- nal in the heavens,? and the literal and historical fea- tures disappear, and the symbolism stands out in bold relief. Masonic Lodges are dedicated to the Sts. John ; one of whom, the Evangelist, opens his Gnostic Gospel with the Greek philosophy of the Logos, the principle of emanation already referred to; and the other, the Seer of Patmos, writes a book symbolical of ancient initia- tions, which many a non-initiate has tried in vain to in- terpret. It may thus be seen that there is a deep signifi- cance in the dedication of Lodges to the Sts. John. Take, for example, Revelations xvi, 16: “And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length, and the breadth and the height of it are equal” (a perfect cube). “And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, ac- cording to the measure of a man, that is an angel.” The language is evidently a veil, designed to conceal the real meaning from the uninitiated. As the measure of man; that is, a perfect man, or “angel,” we have the cube as a symbol of perfect proportion. Hence a Square Man. The temple of Sol-om-on; the Cubical City-which un- folded becomes a CTOSS, and hence the “measure of a man”- all these refer to the work of regeneration, or in- itiation.* The rebuilding of .the temple after the plan drawn upon the Tressel-board, by which it shall be like that spiritual temple, not made with hands, plainly re- fers to initiation from which results perfect proportion and perfect harmony. In a later section of this work this mathematical and geometrical basis of virtue and wisdom, or knowledge and power, will be further explained. It is unknown to the Craft of Masonry ex- cept in its bare outline and cruder symbolism: it is no- where hinted that there is an inherent relation and full equivalent between absolute mathematics and spiritual power. * See Plate XIII."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 29 “A very limited knowledge of the history of primitive worship and mysteries is necessary to enable any person to recognize in the master mason, Hiram,, the Osiris of the Egyptians, the Mithras of the Persians, the Bacchus of the Greeks, the Atys of the Phrygians, of which these people celebrated the passion, death and resurrection, as Christians celebrate to-day that of Jesus Christ. Other- wise, this is the eternal and unvarying type of all the religions which have succeeded each other upon the earth. In an astronomical connection, Hiram is the representative of the Sun, the symbol of his apparent progress, which, appearing at the south gate, so to speak, is smote downward and more downward as he advances toward the west, which passing, he is immediately van- quished and put to death by darkness, represented, in following the same allegory by the spirit of evil; but, returning, he rises again, conqueror and resurrected.“* After a long and very learned discussion of the pho- netic and philological meaning, use, and derivation of certain god-names, Albert Pike says, page 79: “KHURUM, therefore improperly called Hiram, is KHUR-OM, the same as Her-ra, Hermes, and Her-&es, the personification of Light and the Sun, the Mediator, Redeemer and Savior.” And, again, page 81, he says: “It is merely absurd to add the word, ‘Abif ,’ or ‘Abif,’ as part of the name of the artificer. Abin (which we read Abif) means ‘of my father’s’ . . . ‘formerly one of my father’s servants’ or ‘slaves.“’ As to the Fellowcrafts concerned in the conspiracy, they are shown to have more than one meaning; astro- nomically this relates to the signs of the Zodiac, the “three wicked ones” representing the winter solstice or death of the year, and consequent subjugation of the Sun-god! Other meanings will be shown further on. “IS it an accidental coincidence,” asks Bro.

Pike says: “This word could not be pronounced except by the letters; for its pronunciation as one word was said to make Earth tremble and even the angels of Heaven (ele- mentals) to quake with fear.” The. aim of the writer at this time is to show the gen- eral connection of Masonic glyphics with those of ancient times. The real meaning will appear further on. As already declared, modern Masonry being but an imitation of ancient genuine Mysteries, the writer has no design of reading into it a. meaning which can not be fully verified. For the greater part, modern Masons are dealing with symbols, the Key for the real interpretation of which they never possessed, or even suspected that it existed. It remains for the future to determine whether any considerable number of our Masonic Breth- ren really desire to possess in fuller measure the Living Truth which the dead-letter text conceals. That Living Truth exists, and is as accessible to every Mason as is the dead-letter or the dumb-show under which it masquer- ades in every Lodge. As to the sprig of Acacia, Bro. Pike says: “The genu- ine Acacia also is the thorny tamarisk, the same tree which grew up around the body of Osiris. It is a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the Idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur, and of it the ‘crown of thorns’ was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of life; for it has been known, when planted"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 31 as a door-post, to take root and shoot out budding boughs above the threshold.” Here, again, we see a symbol ages old, revived and adopted in many forms, and further, that Immortality was not “brought to light” for the first and only time by the “Man of Sorrows” of the Christians; yet in every case is the symbol none the less true. Whether any of these sun-gods or Redeemers were historical characters or not, the symbolism teaches every-where the same eter- nal truths: the Resurrection and the Life; Redemption and Immortality. After being obligated and brought to light, the candi- date in the third degree is bantered with the statement that undoubtedly he now imagines himself a Master Mason. He is informed not only that such is not the case, but that there is no certainty that he ever will be- come such. He subsequently starts on his Journey for the discovery of the Lost Word. The method by which he undertakes to obtain it, and the names of the three Fellowcrafts already referred to as brothers, have a very deep significance. After many trials, he receives a sub- stitute, which he is to conceal with great fidelity “till future generations shall discover the lost word.” The method by which he receives and is ever to trans- mit or use even the substitute, is made exact and definite, and guarded by solemn obligations. The meaning of both the great secrecy and the use of the word are left entirely to conjecture, beyond the statement that it. is a sacred name, and must never be profaned, or taken in vain, or carelessly used; and I ventured the opinion, that not one Mason among ten thousand has ever been able to discover why. The force of the obligation is therefore in the oath and not in the reason.

This tradition of the Inef-able name is brought into Masonry from the Hebrew Kabalah, and how it became lost is partly hist.orical, at least. The ancient Hebrew Priests evidently undertook to fit to the names of their tribal-deities the symbolism and traditions of the far East. If the Master’s Word were really a word at all, the Deity of the Hebrews might perhaps represent it as well as any other. It is a question of phonetics, however, rather than mere orthography. Beneath the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch lies concealed the science of the Kabalah. The Anathemas threatened for him who should alter, by a single letter or ‘(Yod,” the outer text, had therefore a deeper meaning. The priests of many nations of antiquity were initiates in the Mysteries, and as such they were Monotheists, while the ignorant masses were idolaters. The monotheism of the Jews was of a robust character, and their priests and prophets had. a hard time to preserve their people from the seductive polytheism and abominations of surrounding nations. The Ineffable Name was not only concealed, but “terrible as an army with banners.” Jehovah was jealous, re- vengeful, vindictive toward the evil-doer, and tolerated no rival in the broad expanse of Cosmos. In no religion of antiquity is the anthropomorphic image of Deity so strongly defined, and the Creator of man and worlds made so exceedingly human. The Kabalah, on the contrary, embodying considerable of the true and ancient Secret Doctrine, held a different idea of Divinity. While carrying the tradition, there- fore, of the lost word as the Ineffable Name of Deity the symbolism was taken as literal fact, and the people who were commanded to “make no graven image” ended by making a gigantic idol, half Moloch and half Man. Amid such contradictions, the symbolism adopted from the purer and gentler Aryans was ill at ease and far from home. Rev. Dr. Garrison claims in a “Contribution to"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 33 the History of the Lost Word,” appended to Foot’s Early History and Antiquities of Freemasonry, that the four- syllabled name, Jehovah, was held by the Hebrews as the Ineffable, and that Adonai was used as a substitute. The Highpriest once every year, at the time of the atone- ment, entered alone into the Holy of Holies and there re- peatcd the name. The name was thus withdrawn from and finally lost by the common people. This is ingenious and too literal to cover the case. The old query, “What is in a name?” is, after all, not so easy of answer; or the answer might be, “every thing or nothing,” according as you understand it or look at it. Before the introduction of the Masoretic points or indices of vowel sounds, the consonants were read by metrically intoning the text. The principle of the Mantram was therefore known to the Highpriest at least, and, therefore, the Word, the Name, that known in all its plentitude and used with power, “caused the whole world to shake,” may have been used or invoked in the Holy of Holies by t,he Kabalistic Hierophant. Some who read this may be even yet so ignorant of the potency of sound as to smile at the credu- lity and gullibility that indites it; and yet so supersti- tious over the letters of a name as to believe them more sacred in one form than another! Notwithstanding, it is the letter that killeth, and the Spirit (the breath) that maketh alive. The consonants composing the Hebrew alphabet are about as sacred as so many wooden blocks. If one knows how to arrange the blocks, and endow them with life, so that they may “bud and blossom like Aaron’s rod,” that of course is a very different matter. “There are dangers inseparable from Symbolism which afford an impressive lesson in regard to similar risks attendant on the use of language.

That the Christ-life and the power that made Jesus to be called Christos, Master, whereby he healed the sick, cast out devils, and foretold future events, is the same Life revealed and attained by initiation in the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, is perfectly plain. The disrepute into which the Divine Science has fallen has arisen from its abuse and degradation. In the middle ages, and in fact, in every age there have been dabblers in magic; sorcerers and necromancers, who, possessing some of the secrets, and imbued with none of its beneficence, have used their knowledge and power for purely personal and selfish ends. Hypnotism and Phenomenal Spiritualism are sufficient illustrations of the power to which I refer, and the abuse to which it may be put. Magic, per se, is always a Science, and up to a certain point it may be cultivated without regard to its use, or the well-being of man; although any abuse of it is fatal to the magician. The popular idea is that education consists largely in the cultivation of the intellectual powers. An average standard of morals is always recommended by educators, and its outer form is illustrated by religious ceremonies. I3ut intellectual cultivation alone, no matter to what ex- tent it may be carried-and the further it goes in this one-sided way the worse for all concerned-is in no sense an evolution.

He works “without the hope of fee or reward.” Discerning that knowledge is power, designing and evil men desire to possess ,both knowledge and power for entirely selfish purposes, It may be readily discerned that the more knowledge and power a purely selfish man possesses, the more inimical to humanity he becomes. He can do less harm if kept in ignorance. This is es- pecially the case in regard to those deeper sciences which deal with mind, and influence the thoughts and actions of others. Suppose one were able to hypnotize large numbers of persons at once, and compel them to do his b.idding ; and that his motives were not only selfish, but all results injurious to his agents. Such a person would be a Magician, and, as his motive would be purely selfish, a “Black Magician.” Modern Science, purely material- istic in its aims and conclusions, has always, till very re- cently, ridiculed the idea embodied in Magic, and were it not for the fact that it has been compelled to recognize, under the name Hypnotism since the time of Braid, the very force which it denied and condemned in the days of Mesmer, it might be difficult to find a palpable and un- deniable illustration of what kind of power is involved in Magic. But Hypnotism is not even the alphabet of the vocabu- lary known to the real Master or Magician. It is but an empirical dabbling in a power of gigantic proportions, the key to which makes of its possessor either a Savior, or a Destroyer of his fellow-men.

The traditional Lost Word of the Master is a key to all the science of Magic. The knowledge of the Master is not empirical. It does not consist of a few isolated formula by which certain startling or unusual effects can be produced. The Magician’s art is based on a science far more deep and exact than modern physical science has yet dreamed of, and back of this science lies a philos- ophy as boundless as Cosmos, as inexhaustible as Time, and as beneficent as the “Father in Heaven.” If the Masonic meaning of Master: Perfect and Sublime Mm- ter: Prince Adept: etc., is less than I have indicated, then it is a roaring farce, or a stupendous humbug. The conception of Masonry is true, but it has adopted or imi- tated the ritual and glyphics of a science, the key to which not one Mason in ten thousand possesses, and hence the tradition of the Lost Word has a literal, no less than a symbolical meaning. The “Substitute” is given to the neophite- “till future generations shall find the True Word.” The question now propounded to ev- ery “obligated,” or so-called Master Mason, is-is the present the generation in which that which was lost shall be found? and each must answer for himself singly ; just as he entered his lodge, first saw the light, and took his obligation; just as every real Master, or “White Adept,” has done since the beginning of time. There exists in Masonic literature many learned essays on the history, orthography and phi!ology of the Lost Word; but I am acquainted with no treatise that apprehends the nature of the real secret like that of Brother Albert Pike in his great work, and yet, if he knew the whole secret, he con- cealed it at last, The more immediate source from which the legend is imported into Masonry is the Jewish Kabalah, derived doubtless from the Chaldean and Zoroasterian form of the Secret Doctrine; the principles and methods of which"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"38 MYSTIC MASONRY were unfolded by the late lamented Bro.

Running all through the Talmud are found references t.o the Secret Wisdom, while the Sohar, the Kabalah Denudata, and other Kabalistic works are all written with a veil designed to conceal the secret from the uninitiated, and to be meaningless without the key. Bro. Skinner’s discoveries were the reward of genius, made as the result of stumbling on one of the keys that ‘IUnloek the Golden Gates of the Palace of the King.” His discoveries lay the foundation for a systematic and scientific study of the Kabalistic form of the Secret Doc- trine which lies concealed beneath the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch, and which no Commentary has ever re- vealed or intended to reveal. Perhaps another genera- tion of Biblical Hebrew Scholars may discard their pre- conceptions, prejudices and superstitions of the mere verbiage of the text sufficiently to desire to discover the real meaning of the Pentateuch, as to the creation of Men and Worlds.

In secret crypts, alike inacces- siblti to the vandal hand of man, aend the corrosion of time azd decay, these treasures are said to be preserved. All human progress runs in cycles. Modern material- istic science has had its brief day, and Philosophy has already undermined its foundations. The new age will show a genuine revival of Philosophy. The immortal princip e 1 s enunciated by Plato, clothed in modern garb of thought, less involved and dialectical, will again command the attention of the thinking world. Every one is aware that the source of Plato’s knowledge was the Mysteries; he was an Initiate, and on almost every page reveals the obligation he is under not to be- tray to the common people t*he secrets taught only to initiates under the pledge of secrecy. The foregoing digression seemed necessary in order to show the real basis for the traditions of the Lost Word, and to put beyond cavil, at least with the more rational, the idea that the Master’s Word is a real thing, the genuineness and power of which is not overdrawn in the parables and glyph& of Freemasonry. “The True Word of a lY!ason is to be found in the con- cealed and profound meaning of the IrLeffcc,bZe Ngs?ne of D&J communicated by God to Moses” (rather by the Priests of Egypt.---%), “and. which meaning was long lost by the very precautions taken to conceal it.

He Was and Is all that Was, that Is, and that Shall be; in whom all else lives, moves, and has its being.” “‘This was the great Mystery of the Ineffable .Name, . l . and of course its true pronuncia- tion and its meaning became lost to all except the select few to whom it was confided ; it being concealed from the common people, because the Deity, thus metaphysically named, was not that personal and capricious, and as it were, tangible God in whom they believed, and who alone was within reach of their rude capacities. . . . This was the profound truth hidden in the ancient allegory and covered from the general view with a double veil.

But to continue our quotations : “There is a Life-Principle of the world, a universal agent, wherein are two natures and a double current of love and wrath. This ambient fluid pervades every thing. It is a ray detached from the glory of the Sun, and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the cen- tral attraction. It is the body of the Holy Spirit, the Universal Agent, the Serpent devouring his own tail.” (See the Seal of the T.

The doctrine of Moses and the prophets, identical at bottom with that of the ancient Egyptians, also had its outward meaning and its veils. The Hebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions; and they were written in Sym- bols unintelligible to the Profane. The Pentateuch and the prophetic poems were merely elementary books of doctrine, morals or liturgy ; and ,the true secret and tra- ditional philosophy was only written afterward, under a veil still less transparent. Thus was a second Bible born, unknown to, or rather uncomprehended by, the Christians” (of later times), ‘czl collection, they say, of monstruous absurdities; a monument, the adept says, wherein is every thing that the genius of philosophy and that of religion have ever formed or imagined of the Sublime; a treasure surrounded by thorns; a diamond concealed in a rough dark stone.” “One is fiiled with admiration on penetrating into the Sanctuary of the Kabalah, at seeing a doctrine so logical, so simple and at the same time so absolute. The neces- sary union of ideas and signs, the consecration of the most fundamental realities by the primitive characters ; the Trinity of Words, Letters and Numbers; a philoso- phy simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the World; Theorems more complete and luminous than those of Pythagoras; a theology summed up by counting"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 43 on one’s fingers; an Infinite which can be held in the hol- low of an infant’s hand; ten ciphers and twenty-two letters, a triangle, a square and a circle-these are all the elements of Kabalah. These are the elementary prin- ciples of the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world.” * And so we might go on quoting from this real “Master of the Veils,” this genuine Prince Adept among Masons, whose great work, even as a compilation, is a monument more enduring than brass, and more honorable than the crown of kings. If he did not comprehend to the last veil all that he transcribed-and he too used veils--he discerned enough to teach him how to find the whole. It may thus be seen that the Holy Bible as one of the Great Lights in Masonry has a very profound meaning when coupled with the tradition of the Ineffable Name, or Lost Word. The object set before the neophite in his search for the Lost Word, is, that he may travel in foreign coun- tries and receive Master’s wages.? This gi.yphic in its outer form is taken from the guilds of pra&ical Reasons of two or three centuries ago. The law? -&en govxning the Mark of a Fellowcraft or a Master Builder were very strict, and the Mark was never bestowed unworthily, and when received was a passport among builders over a wide domain. But in a deeper, or Kabalistic sense, the Master’s Word, which entitled its possessor to Master’s wages, was a very different thing indeed. The wages of the real Master were the satisfaction and thz power that flow from the possession of real knowledge. Knowledge is power only when one comprehends that which he pos- sesses, and is, therefore, enabled to use it for the pur- poses that lie nearest his heart. Era, Pike shows con- clusively that the power of the Word lies in the knowl- edge of the Philosophy which is its perfect synthesis. * Morals mid Dogma, p. 415. + The wages c>f a real Master is Knowledge and Pozuer to travel where he will in space."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"44 MYSTIC MASQNRY This is, in part, the meaning of “knowing how to pro- nounce the Word.” As already stated, the Kabalah of the ancient Hebrews, which Moses derived by initiation into the mysteries of Egypt and Persia, and which Pike and many others de- clare was identical among the Hebrews, the Egyptians, Hindus and other nations of antiquity, was known as the Secret Doctrine. The reason for such a name is fully revealed in what has been shown hitherto. What Pike says regarding the relation of the Pentateuch to the Kabalah, is true of the exoteric scriptures of every na- tion of antiquity. How many generations of imbeciles or materialists, think you, my Brother, would it require to recover it? The great majority of mankind in every age not’ only do not possess the secret and the power of the Master’s Word, but are incapable of comprehending it. We do not know a thing because we are told that it is so. Let the gods shout the truth of all the ages into the ears of a fool forever, and still forever the fool would be joined to his folly. Here lies the conception and the principal of all initiations. It is knowledge unfolded by degrees in an orderly, systematic manner, Istep by step, as the capacity to apprehend opens in the neophite. The result is not a possession, but a growth, an evolution. Knowl- edge is not a mere sum in addition; something added to something that already exists; but rather such a pro- gressive change or transformation of the original struc- ture as to make of it at every step a New Being. Real Knowledge, or the grcwth of Wisdom in man, is an Eter- nal Becoming ; a progressive transformation into the likeness of the Supernal Goodness and the Supreme Power. Initiation and Regeneration are synonymous terms, The ritual of Freemasonry is based on this .natural law, and the ceremony of initiation illustrates, at every step, this principle, and if the result attained is a pos- session rather than a regeneration, in the great majority"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 45 of cases, the principle remains none the less true. The mere ixulcation of moral principles, or lessons in ethics, and their symbolic illustration and dramatic representa- tion, are by no means in vain. These appeal to the con- science and moral sense in every man, and no man has ever been made worse by the Lessons of the Lodge. By these “rites and benefits,” the Freemason is, above all men, in our so-called Modern Civilization, the nearest to the Ancie-t Wisdom. He has possession of the territory in which lie concealed the Crown Jewels of Wisdom. He may content himself, if he will, by merely turning over the sod and gathering only a crop of husks or stubble. He may dig deeper and find not, only the Keystone of the Arch, the Ark of t:le Covenant, the Scroll or the Law, but, using the spirit concealed in the wings of the Cheru- bim, he may rise untrammeled by the rubbish of the temple, and, meeting Abhim face to face, learn also to say I am that I am ! Does this read like a rhapsody, and are the Land Marks, traditions, and glyphics of Free- masonry nothing more ? The real temple referred to from first to last in Mason- ry as in all ancient initiations is the Tabernacle of the Human Soul. It is built, indeed, without the sound of hammer or any tool of iron. It is like (made in the likeness of) that other, spiritual temple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; for the old philosophy (Kabalah) teaches that the Immortal Spirit of man is the artificer of the body and its source of life; that it does not so much en- ter in, as overshadow man, while the Soul, the immedi- ate vehicle of the Spirit, inhabits the body, and is dissi- pated at death. The Spirit is Immortal, pure, and for- ever undefiled. It is Christos, or Hiram, the Mediator between the Soul, or physical man, and the Universal Spirit-the Father in Heaven. The “poor, blind candi- date,” that is, the man of sense, immersed in matter, would learn the lnefSabZe Name, and obtain the Lost Word, and, seeking a short-cut, “climbs up some other"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"46 MYSTIC MASONRY way.” He would have wisdom without self-conquest, power without sacrifice. He will not listen to the voice of pleading, “Be patient, my brother, and when the temple is completed, if found worthy, you shall receive that for which you have so long wrought.” No! he will have it now! and he silences the pleading voice, an& de- feating only himself, flees into the deserts of remorse and calls upon the rocks to hide him from the pursuit of his accusing conscience. Hiram (Christos) is resurrected. Being immortal, he can not really die. No sin of man is final. Realizing his error and purified by suffering, the spirit in man being again lifted up, even defeat gives promise of victory, and he receives a Substitute for the Lost Word. He hears, however faint or dim, the Divine Harmony. Future generations, that is, further trials and more sincere endeavor, promise greater reward. He Ifearns to “know, to will, to dare, and to keep silent.” Brotherly love, Relief and Truth; Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Mercy-all the Virtues and all the Beatitudes are inculcated. The candidate is taught, not merely to tolerate an- other’s religion, but to respect it as his own; though still adhering to that into which he was born. To make rea- sonable this obligation, he is shown through the Kabalah or Secret Doctrine that, at the heart of every great re- ligion, lie the same eternal truths. Forms and observ- ances only differ. The Irzeffable Name is spelled in many ways, yet the Word is one and eternal. Masonry is not only a universal science, but a world-wide religion, and owes allegiance to no one creed, and can adopt no sec- tarian dogma, as such, without ceasing thereby to be Masonic. Drawn from the Kabalah, and taking the Jew- ish or Christian verbiage or symbols, it but discerns in them universal truths, which it recognizes in all other religions. Many degrees have been Christianized only to perish ; as every degree eventually will if circum- scribed by narrow creeds, and dwarfed to the bigoted apprehension, so as to exclude good men of any other"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE GENIUS OF FREEMASONRY 47 communion. Is Jesus any the less Christos, because Christna was called “the Good Shepherd?” or because the Mexican Christ was crucified between two thieves? or because Hiram was three days in a grave before he was resurrected? Are we not as selfish in our religion as in our other possessions? Then why is man, while cherishing as his most sacred possession, the religion of his fathers, eternally seeking to degrade and destroy that of his Brother? The Great Republic, to which Bro. Pike refers, is the Ideal of Masonry; the Genius that hovers like a protect- ing angel over the Lodge. Make it impossible for a Jew or Parsee, Buddhist or Brahmin, to enter any Lodge without witnessing the profanation of his sacred altars or contempt for his religion, and the angel hides her face and retreats from altars already profaned by unbrother- liness. Masonry is the Universal Religion only because, and only so long, as it embraces all religions. For this reason, and this alone, it is universal and eternal. Neither persecution nor misrepresentation can ever de- stroy it. It may find no place in a generation of bigots; it may retire for a century; but again comes a Master Builder with the Key to the “Shut Yalace of the King,” throws open the blinds, lets in the light, kindles anew the fire on the sacred altar, clears away the rubbish, when behold! the tesselated pavement is as bright. as when it first came from the quarries of truth, the jewels are of pure gold and brighten at the touch, and the great lights are undimmed and undecayed. “When the candi- date is ready the Master appears.” And yet men are so foolish and so vile as to imagine that they can destroy this heirloom of the ages: this heritage from the Immor- tals! No age is so dark as to quench entirely the light of the Lodge; no persecution so bloody as to blot out its votaries; no anathemas of Popes so lasting as to count one second on its Dial of Time! These, one and all, serve only to keep the people in darkness, and retard the reign of Universal Brotherhood. Therefore for humanity -"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"48 MYSTIC MASONRY the Great Orphan- the real Master laments. He smiles at the passions of Popes or Kings and pities the folly of man.

For ages Kings, Popes and Synods have done their best to kill this Secret Doctrine by anathematizing or burn- ing its Masters. The Jesuits got possession of its Lodges, transformed out of all recognition many of its degrees, and made of them an abject tool of the Sacer- dotal hierarchy. l3ut at last the Jesuits became glutted with gold and impudent with power, and the Church became frightened and destroyed or banished the destroyers.

It is equally demonstr&le that this Secret Doctri.ne was the real foundation of every great Religion known to man; that only the initiated Priest or Hierophant knew the real doctrines in any case, and only these, as a rule, in the earliest history of each religion. Furthermore, the Sacred Books of all religions, includ- ing those of the Jews and the Christians, were and are no more than parables and allegories of the real S~z’ecU Doctrine, transcribed for the ignorant and superstitious masses. All commentaries written on these Sacred Books, whether on those of Moses, the Psalms a-d the Prophets of Judaism, the Gospels of ‘the Gnostics and Christians, or those written on the Sacred Books of the East-the Vedas, Puranas, and Upanishads-all either make confusion more confounded when written by one ignorant of the Secret Doctrine, or, when written by in- itiates, but ring the changes on, or further elaborate the parables and allegories. It is, furthermore, easily demonstrable that the Secret Doctrine came originally from the far East, and is the Primitive Wisdom Religion. Its earlier records are Y~OW found in India and Thibet; thence it seems to have trz+ cled to Ethiopia; thence to Egypt and Chaldea.

The present humanity, in many quarters of the globe, has evolved on the intellectual plane so far that there now exist a very large number of persons capable of appre- hending this old philosophy, and, at the same time, capa- ble of understanding the responsibility incurred in mis- using or misinterpreting it. A large number of persons have reached, on the intellectual plane, the state of man- hood ; and are capable of partaking of the “fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil.” There is, there- fore, no reason why this old philosophy should be longer concealed. On the other hand, there are reasons why it should be known. Empirical knowledge has advanced in certain directions into the realm of Psychism, and the arts anciently designated by the term Magic, and it is imperative that the dangers that attend these pursuits should be pointed out and demonstrated, in order that they may be avoided by the beneficent, and that the igno- rant or innocent may be afforded protection. How far these mod.ern inroads into Occultism or ancient Magic extended very few persons seem to realize. It is there- fore high time that the philosophy of the East should illumine the science of the West, and thus give the death blow to that intellectual diabolism, and spiritual nihilism, known as Materialism, and this only the Secret Doctrine can accomplish. Grave responsibility, however, is in- curred by such a revelation. Those who, like the profes- sional Hypnotists and the Vivisectionists, have sinned, perhaps ignorantly, and thus have been unconsciously “Black Magicians,” will eventually find no avenue of es- cape. Ignorance can no longer cover their inhuman or cruel practices.

They have waited for millenniums, and their, time has come. “To recapitulate ; the Seeret Doctrine was the univer- sally diffused religion of the ancient and prehistoric world, Proof of its diffusion, authentic records of its history, a complete chain of documents, showing its character and presence in every land, together with the teaching of all its great Adepts, exist to this day in the secret crypts of libraries belonging to the Occult Frater- nity.” As to the danger of revealing these doctrines to , the profane : “The danger was this, Doctrines such as t5e planetary chain, or the seven races, at once give a clue to the seven- fold nature of man. For each principle is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race; and the human principles are, on every plane, correlated to seven-fold occult forces* -those of the highest planes being of tremendous power.” “No one styling himself a ‘scholar,’ in whatever department of exact science, will be permitted to regard these teachings seriously.

Every careful and unbiased stu- dent of history knows why the Secret Doctrine has been heard of so little since the days of Constantine. An exo- teric religion, and belief i:l a personal God blotted it out for self-protection ; and yet, oh, irony of history! the very Pentateuch conceals it, and for many a student of Kabalah of the coming century, the seals will be broken.

In the last analysis, both Space and Consciousness elude us. What they are ICY se, we shall never know. We may as well take them as facts in our experience, and in analyzing that experience, both Con- sciousness and Knowledge will expand. “What is that which was, is, and will be, whether there is a Universe or not: whether there be Gods or none? asks the Senzar Catechism. And the answer made is- Space.” Now space is not Nature, nor is it Deity. Space may be said to contain nature or creation, and to conceal Divinity. It is therefore the point of emanation and the vanishing point. The Occult Catechism contains the following questio::s and answers : “What is it that ever is?” “Space, the eternal Anupadaka” (parentless) . “What is it that ever was?” “The germ in the Root.” “What is it that is ever coming and going?” “The Great Breath.” “Then there are three eternals ?” “No, the three are one.” “That which ever is, is one; that which ever was, is one; that which is ever being, and becoming, is also one: and this is Space.” For clearer understanding on the part of the general reader, it must be stated that the Occult Science recog- nizes Seven Cosmical Elements-four entirely physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi-material, as it will become visible in the air toward the end of the Fourth Round, to reign supreme over the others during the whole of the Fifth. The remaining two are as yet absolutely beyond the range of human perception. These latter will, how- ever, appear as presentiments during the 6th and 7th Rounds respectively.

The Fifth Element, now advocated quite freely by Science, is not the Ether hypothesized by Sir Isaac Newton-although he calls it by that name, having asso- ciated it in his mind, probably, with the Ether, ‘Father- lY!other of Antiquity. As Newton intuitionally says : ‘Nature is a perfect circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids, fixed things out of volatile, and volatile out of fixed. Subtle out of gross, and gross out of subtle.’ Thus, perhaps, may all things be originated from i3tie& (Hypoth. I, 615.) * It is interesting to notice, in this connection, that New- ton was familiar with the writings of Jacob Boehmen, the “Teutonic Theosopher,” and that among Newton’s posthumous papers were found copious notes and trans- lations from his works. As to the “Races,” referred to in the above quotation, it need only be said in passing, that the Secret Doctrine declares that in the evolution of humanity there are to be seven Races, of which ours is now the fifth, and that, each race makes seven rounds on our planetary chain, of which rounds the present race is now in the fourth, with here and there a “fifth round- er” appearing. The Secret Doctrine teaches, not only the immortality of the soul, but. the perfectibility of humanity by orderly evolution on this Earth. This doc- trine concerns the general evolution which the present work touches only incidentally; it is complicated, and necessarily so. There are three fundamental propositions that under- lie the Secret Doctrine. (a) “An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle on which all specu- lation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception, and could only be dwarfed by any/ human expression or similitude. It is beyond the range and reach of human thought-in the words of Mandukya, “unthinkable and unspeakable,” This Infinite and Eter- --.- * Secret Doctrine."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"56 MYSTIC M~~~NxY nal Cause-dimly formulated in the “Unconscious” and “Unknowable” of current European philosophy-is the rootless root of “all that was, is, or ever shall be.” . . . In Sanscrit it is “Sat.” This “Beness” is symbolized in the Secret Doctrine under two aspects. On the one hand, Absolute abstract Space, represent- ing bare subjectivity, the one thing which no human mind can either exclude from any conception or conceive of by itself. On the other, Absolute abstract Motion representing “Unconditioned Consciousness.” “Spirit (or Conscious- ness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded, not as izldependent realities, but as the two facets or aspects of the Absolute, which constitutes the basis of conditioned Being whether subjective or objective.” “Considering this metaphysical triad” (the one reality, Spirit and Mat- ter) “as the Root from which proceeds all manifestation, the ‘Great Ereath’ assumes the character of precosmic Ideation.” (Plato’s T;‘-Jorld of Divik Ideas.) “It is the fo,ns et origo of force and of all individual consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelligence in the vast scheme of Cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, precosmic root-substance (Mulayrakriti) is that aspect of the Absolute which underlies all the objective planes in Nature.” (b) The second of the three postulates of the Secret Doctrine is : “The Eternity of ‘the Universe in toto as a boundless plane: periodically ‘the playground of num- berless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappear- ing,’ called ‘the manifesting stars’ and the “sparks of Eternity,’ ‘The Eternity of the Pilgrim’ (the Monad or Self in man) is like a wink of the Eye of Self-Existence. ‘The appearance and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux and reflux.’ ” The third postulate is :-(c) “The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Uni- versal Over-Soul, the latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Soul-a spark of the former-through the Cycle of In- carnation (or Necessity) in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term.” . . . “The piv- otal doctrine of the Eastern philosophy admits no privi- leges or special gifts in man, save those won by his own Ego through personal effort and merit throughout a long series of Metempsychosis and Reincarnations.” * Every soul must ‘(U’ork out its own salvation,” and “take the Kingdom of Heaven by force.” Salvation by faith and the vicarious atonement were not taught, as now interpreted, by Jesus, nor are these doctrines taught in the exoteric Scriptures. They are later and ignorant perversions of the original doctrines. In the Early Church, as in the Secret Doctrine, there was not one Christ for the whole world, but a potential Christ in ev- ery man. Theologians first made a fetish of the Imper- sonal, Omnipresent Divinity; and then tore the Christos from the hearts of all humanity in order to deify Jesus; that they might have a God-man peculiarly their own! All the ancient Mysteries had the true doctrine, and the early Christians had it. Masonry, uncontaminated by the disciples of Loyala, had and has it also. The one Immutable Principle, referred to in the first proposition, (a) is called in the Kabalah, Ain Soph: the word Ain meaning “nothing.” This is not Jehovah, or Adonia, or the G,A,O,U; for it is not itself creative, but the cause of Creation. (“Causeless Cause.“) The Jewish “creators” (plural) are the Elohim; the “Priccipalities and Powers.” In this conception of Di- vinity lies *the secret of the INEFFABLE Name, i. e., the NAMELESS. ‘The Lost Word is to the Master who pos- sesses it and knows how to “pronounce” it, what the Logos or creative power is to the NAMELESS. Hence the real Master creates, and in this sense is a god. This will be further shown in connection with the Seven Principles and the Nature of Man."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The second proposition-the Eternity of the Universe in Loto-reveals the law of cycles and the “incessant” work of creation. In other words, the creative process never had a be- ginning, and will never have an end. There is one end- less sueccssion of U;liverses. ‘Worlds and Solar systems continually appear and disappear.

Masonry derives its genius, its inspiration, its glyphics, and its traditions from this philosophy as taught in the Mysteries. How short-sighted and time-serving, then, must, it be for Masonry to allow its Grand Traditions, its priceless in- heritance to be dwarfed and overlaid by illogical inter- pretations, derived from records that were in the beginning, and before being disfigured by ignorance or cupidity, only an allegory of the true doctrines, prepared by “those who knew” for the ignorant masses, who de- manded a sign and could never rise above a fetish. This is like bartering a magnificent diamond for a lump of common clay. Shall Masons now complete the folly by trying to convince themselves and oth.ers that the clay is the only diamond. How much one’s idea of Ged colors all his thoughts and deeds, is seldom realized. The ordinary crude and igno- rant conception of a personal God more often results in slavish fear on the one hand, and Atheism on the other. It is what Carlyle calls “an absentee God, doing nothing since the six days of creation, but sitting on the outside and seeing it go!” This idea of God carries with it, of course, the idea of creation, as something already com- pleted in time; when the fact is that creation is a process without beginning or end. The world-all worlds-are being “created” to-day as much as at any period in the past. Even the apparent destruction of worlds is a crea- tive, or evolutionary process. Emanating from the bosom of the All, and running their cyclic course; day alternating with night, on the outer physic4 plane, they are again indrawn to the invisible plane, only to re-emerge after a longer night and start again on a higher cycle of evolution. Theologians have tried in vain"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"60 n’lYSTIC ?+&LSGNRY to attach the idea of immamnce to that of personality, and ended in a jargon of words and utter confusion of ideas. A personal Absolute is not, except in potency. God does no-t; think, but is the cause of Thought. God does not love, he is Love, in the perfect or absolute sense; and so with all the Divine Attributes. God is thus the concealed Logos, the “Cause!e:<s Cause,” the “Rootless Root.” God never manifests Himself (to be seen of men). Creation is His manifestation: and as creation is not complete, and never will be, and as it never had a beginning, there is a concealed or unrevealed potency back of and beyond all creaticn, which is still God. Now, Space is the most perfect symbol of this idea of Divinity; for it enters into all our concepts, and is the basis of all our experiences. We can not fathom it, or define it, or exclude it from a single thought or experience. Space is boundless, infinite, unfathomable, unknowable : in all, over all, through all. We know that It Is: and that is all we know about It;. , But are not these just the attributes that are assigned to the Absolute and Infinite Deity? and t;hey are all negations. God, says the Kabalah, is No Thing. But the Theologian will hasten to say that this is pure Pan- theism. It is no more Pantheism than it is Atheism, for, as already shown, the Ain Soph is before and beyond Creation or Cosmos. It is not God deduced or derived from Nature, but precisely the reverse; nature derived from God, and yet God remains “the same, yesterday, to-day, and forever”-the CHANGEXJZSS. The stability of nature is derived from the unchangeableness of God. God never tires, is not exhausted at His work, needing r&. That were so human as to be childish, and the idea, perhaps, originated from the cyclic law found in the Kabalah of the “Davs and Nights of Brahm,” the “Manvantaras and Prala”yas,” or periods of “outbreath- ing” and of “inbreathing” in the cycles of evolution. Hence the parable, given to the ignorant or the pro- fane, of God’s working and then resting. If the reader"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 61 will but reflect a moment on his own process of breath- ing, he will find that the inbreathing (inhalation) and the outbreathing (exhalation) are equal, and equally active processes, although so different, each being the opposite of the other: each, in its turn, the cause of the other. Stop one, and the other ceases also. The more one reflects on this symbol of the Great Breath which creation is, the more will he understand of both Eternal Nature and his own being. But it may be asked : is man to be deprived of all idea of Personality except his own? By no means. God as the Author of Being, is the Author of Personality. He personifies Himself, i. e., expresses that potency of Him- self ,which personality is, through Man. The Hand of Providence is always a human hand. Humanity is both the vehicle and the agent of what man has called the Providence of God. Humanity iuz t&o, then, is the only Personal God; and Christos is the realization, or perfection of this Divine Persona, in Individual conscious experience. When this perfection is realized, the state is called Christos, with the Greeks, and Budd!xa, with the Hindoos. Hence the Christ is at-one with the Father, “Be ye perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.” Humanity in toto ! What is it? Is it the generations of the present age? or of any age in the past ? or of the future? and these alone ? Justice rules the Universe, and is the foundation of all Law. Justice is the “King- dom,” the “Permanency” of Deity. Humanity, there- fore, means every human being ever born, in any age, or to be born in coming ages on this Plunet. All are “in the hollow of His hand.” One God, One Law for all! else there is no Justice. And if it shall be done unto each according to the deeds done in the body; if as a man soweth so shall he reap, the only logical deduction is Law governing action and de- termining results according to Absolute Justice, And this the Kabalah, the Secret Doctrine and Masonry, and"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"62 MYSTIC MASONRY all Sacred Books, and all Religions, every-where teach. By taking the symbols for the thing symbolized, men have made contradictions out of details, and then built up a system of final rewards and punishments, attaching to acts in time; and claimed their unreason and injustice as binding to all eternity. The result is Atheism and Materialism ; for there is an instinct in man, as part of his Divine inheritance, and that instinct is an innate sense of Justice. Destroy this, and the result is Atheism, pure and simple. Destruction of the sense of Justice has honey-combed the churches, and been the parent of mod- ern Materialism. It is true that Materialism is not the logical, but the actual result. The issue is not logically between an Unjust God and no God, but between a God that is inconceivable because Unjust; and a God that is conceivable because Just, and therefore the issue of the Supreme Reason. But this philosophical concept of Divinity has another I and still wider bearing. It concerns not only man’s per- sonal life, but determines his relations to his fellow men. It is the basis of ethics and furthermore co-ordinates all his experience and all his knowledge, and this leads to true wisdom. “To know God is the Supreme Wisdom.” It will be urged by modern Theologians that this view dethrones Christ. To this objection the answer is that any other view orphans Humanity. It is far more im- portant that men should strive to become Christs than that they should believe that Jesus was Christ. If the Christ-state can be attained by but one human being during the whole evolution of the race, then the evolu- tion of man is a farce and human perfection an impos- sibility. Jesus is no less Divine because all men may reach the same Divine perfection. Again, it will be urged, “There is no other name given under Heaven or amongst men whereby ye can be saved.” But this is the Ineffable Name, which every Master is to possess and become, and salvation and perfection are synonymous.

That which the orthodox Christian will find to oppose to this view is not that it dethrones or degrades Christ, but that it disproves the idea of Christ as their exclu- sive possession, and denies that all other religions are less Divine than their own. We have brought the same selfishness into our religions that we indulge in regard to our other possessions, such as wife and children, and houses and land, and country; and the same partisan spirit as in our politics, and this more than any thing else appears to justify selfishness in general, militates against the Brotherhood of man, and prevents the found- ing of the “Great Republic, composed of many Nations and all people.” This idea of Universal Brotherhood which was a cardinal doctrine in the Ancient Mysteries -as it is involved in the first postulate of the Secret Doc- trine, and openly declared in the third; and which is equally given the very first rank in Masonry-+is the logical deduction from our idea of Divinity, and’ of the essential nature and meaning of Christos. Humanity, in toto, as already explained is the personification of the Divine in Creation, and the idea of exact and universal Justice regards each individual of all the myriads con-= stituting Humanity with equal favor. There are no fa- vorites in the Divine Conception. Justice of God toward all implies Justice toward each other amongst men. This principle of Justice is Law Universal, and this principle of Brotherhood and the perfectibility of man’s nature through evolution necessitate Reincarnation. The num- ber of souls constituting Humanity, though practically innumerable, is, nevertheless definite.

It is true that neither Science nor Religion has openly formulated the foregoing creeds, but they are fair deductions from the postulates assumed, the logical results of a Nature with- out Intelligence ; and a. God who creates Laws only to annul them at His own good pleasure! Reconciliation between Science and Religion thus becomes impossible, because each is a contradiction to itself. But a reconciliation was reached in the Secret Doc- trine ages ago. The old universal Wisdom Religion was scientific to the last degree; for beneath both Science and Religion was the Philosophy which discerned the orderly proc- esses of Eternal Nature, with no “missing links” in Evolution, and no caprice or contradictions anywhere in Cosmos. The First Postulate of the Secret Doctrine, already re- ferred to, lays the sure foundation of this old Philosophy. An Omnipotent, External, Boundless, and Immutable Principle, co-evil and co-extensive with Space: in All, through All, and over All: Divinity Immanent in Na- ture: Alike the Eternal Cause and Result, each without beginning or end, and each alternating forever! Law in Nature is the Permanency, the Unchangeable- ness of the Divine Being. Intelligence in Nature is the Harmony of the Divine Order. Hence, the “Kingdom,” the “Foundation,” the “Crown,” the “Beauty,” etc., of the Kabalistic Sephira, or Divine Attributes of Ain Soph, the Boundless. The doctrine of Emanation, taught by Plato and held by the Gnostics and the early Christians, gave the key to cosmic and human evolution. Plotinus said : “God is not the principle of Beings, but the Prin- ciple of Principles.” Universal Substance, Universal Energy, Universal Law, Universal Life, Universal Intel-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"70 MYSTIC MASWR~ ligence are all emanations or manifestations of the One Principle. This is not Pantheism, but pure and unadulterated Theism. The All is ONE, and that One is Divinity. Spinoza came, perhaps, as near the truth as any one since the days of the old Initiates. Every atom of matter as every “spot” in space is full of Divinity. There is neither time nor place where He (“It”) is not. The Priest-Initiates among the Hebrews knew this doc- trine, as they had it from Old Egypt (“Moses was skilled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians”), and neither Jeho- vah nor Adonai was the Nameless or the Boundless. Here, in the First Postulate, lies the complete recon- ciliation of Science and Religion. Through the Divine Imlnanence in Nature, and within all, Space concealed. every atom of matter is endowed with Life and Intelli- gence and bound by Law. Evolution is a Formation, Transformation, and Reformation, in endless succession, with the outposts of Creation continually drawn upward toward the center in Divinity. Or, Space Involves Di- vinity, and Evolves Cosmos. At the center of every atom or Sun lies Divinity (Unity) ; at the circumference un- folds Nature (Diversity) ; and these two are forever One and at-one. How any rational mind can fail to see in this philoso- phy a complete Reconciliation of Religion and Science, it is difficult to understand. In the beginning, when a world emanates, or begins to manifest visibly, space becomes turgid (called “curds” in the old Hindoo Cosmology) with substance. The in- visible becomes visible. This is the first “Matter,” and it is called Akasa.

This primal energy is called Fohat, “the mys- terious link between Mind and Matter, the animating principle electrifying every atom into life.” We have now Matter, Force and Motion, with Law as the Guiding intelligence (active) and Consciousness (latent) as Cos- mic Ideation, unfolding the Plan; and all these in perfect concord evolving the Symphony of Creation. Of course this Cosmogenesis can be here but roughly outlined. We have then Akasa, as the Universal Substance, and Fohat, as the Universal Energy, with Intelligence guid- ing them, Consciousness back of them, and the Roots of all in the Concealed Ain-Soph, the Unknowable. Profes- sor Crooks has taken a long stride in this direction in his metaphysical excursion in search of the “Origin of the Elements,” and in his postulation of Protyle. He has further touched the septenary key in the order of the emanation of the so-called elements known to modern science. It would be impossible in a work such as this, and equally out of place, to undertake to trace the process running through millions of years by which a planet is evolved; how the turgescence gives rise to denser sub- stance, “set on fire” by friction (Fohat) , and how the “Fire-Mist” cools and hardens into Matter on our plane. Though apparent Chaos, here is Cosmos, order and formation, as much as now may be discerned in this pres- ent state of our Earth. The real Chaos is Space, which is but latent, potential Cosmos, or Creation asleep. Trac- ing this process of world-building from the “beginning,” the O;ze (negative), abstract Space and absolute Ab- stract Motion (the Ineffable Name, or Deity, lying still back of these, “Nameless” and never manifesting), now become active, and here lies the first “Manifestation,” a duality : “Father-Mother ;” Spirit and Matter; Con- sciousness and Intelligence. From a latent or potential duality, space and motion, there arises an active mani- f ested duality. Taking latency as the One, the First Logos, we have thus the first triad, or the “Second Logos.” As differentiation goes on the first Triad be-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"72 MYSTIC MASONRY comes the Modulus.

This is the key-note of all that follows ; the pitch, the rhythm, and the harmony of Creation: The first octave in the song of the Morning Stars. The first septenary ix the Universal Spectrum of Color: and the first expres- siox of the Form into which Matter is molded. To synthesize all these movements in one word we have Fohat as the agent; and ViZwation as the manifestation. The Master who knows the pitch, quality and amplitude of this first vibration, who can produce this first sep- tenary of sound, color, and form, can by so doing raise his Consciousness to that first or seventh (according as we count from above downward or the reverse) plane. Such a one knows how to pronounce the hefable Name. It is not only a matter of pure science, dealing with laws of rhythm; a fact, and not a tradition or a sentiment, but it implies absolute At-One-Ment in knowledge and power between all that goes to make up what we call man and all that we call Nature. It is the consummation of hu- man evolution. Hence said the Christ: “It is finished.” In giving himself to the world the perfect at-one-ment was attained. In the ethical sense, that is, oza the plan2 of relations of man to man, the Word is Renunciation, or self-sacrifice. In the Hindoo tradition regarding the Master’s Word there are seven ways of pronouncing it, each involving a different potency and a different result.

The triangle in the square symbolizes potential Being, before evolution : Man in the Garden of Eden. The square in the triangle symbolizes regeneration; the puri- fication of the lower earthly nature so that it may “as- cend to the Father ;” return to Paradise. This is sym- bolized by the careful position of the compass and square in relation to the Holy Bible. While the ‘three Great& lights, and three Lesser lights again make a double tri- angle ; one greater-because, above, one lesser-because below, which every Mason will understand. A few years ago these explanations would have seemed to the great majority of persons purely fanciful. But since the recent progress in electricity and photography; since thought and emotion like light and shade have been photographed by light emanating from the human body directed by the human Will, the philosophical synthesis of the forces in man is the next step in the search of sci- ence for the mystery of man. It is precisely this synthesis which Masonry possesses in its Symbolism, and we can only read the one by the light of the other, and check both by facts derived by experiments as science advances. Passing now from these broader metaphysical aspects to the complex nature of man, and we have also the key to his entire nature and evolution.. V?e begin with the fact of consciousness. Man is not merely a bundle of organs or faculties: he is essentially ONE. What else can be the meaning of the phrase “Made in the image of God?” M’an is the image, God the reality. Divinity deposits a center of consciousness and this evolves into man. Just as in Cosmogenesis, latent consciousness as abstract"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 75 absolute motion, became with abstract space the Cosmic duality. We speak of this center of consciousness in man as a “spark of Divinity.” What Divinity is to Cosmos this spark is to man. Concealed, never mani- festing itself, but giving rise to all manifestations in man, it is the apex of the triangle, while Life and Thought are the other two angles. Starting, then, with this metaphysical concept, we have the Divine Ego, the Higher Self; a metaphysical ab- straction, it is true, like the zero in mathematics, or like Motion and Space, yet the cause lying back of all phe- nomena, the potency of a!1 actuality. This is the Ego; the Thinker; the “I am I,” in man. So far, it is not conscious, but consciousness; or the cause of it in man’s complex nature. It is the “All-seeing Eye.” It is Christos, potentially. It is Conscience; the “Sun of Righteousness,” in man’s world of being. It attaches to the body and the lower life through mind, of which it is the potency, but not the act; the Thinker, but not the Thought. Mind is the immediate vehicle of consciousness, as matter is called the vehicle of Force. Thus, from the three postulates of the Secret Doctrine we have, first: Divinity, and Nature at one; second, we have Spirit and Substance as the dual principle from which all Force and all Matter proceed; third, Religion and Science, are consistent, each with itself, and in per- fect harmony with each other; fourth, we have a philos- ophy of the origin, nature, and destiny of Man, agreeing with, and fortified by all previous concepts. The First Postulate teaches the origin and essential nature of all things. The Second Postulate teaches the Law of Cycles, and the process of world-building. The Third Postulate teaches, in harmony with the First and Second, the “fun- damental identity” of all souls with the Universal Over- Soul; Brother-hood and the Laws of Karma and Rein- carnation, which are the factors in Human Evolution. Going back, now, to the First Postulate, we find One"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"76 MYSTIC MASONRY Principle with whatever “aspects” or “manifestations” the human mind may conceive, and all things, all prin- ciples, potencies, powers, derived from or manifestations of this One: whether it be Matter or Spirit; man or beast; angel or worm; ever?/ thing from the One; and, after all manifestation, as before, the One is concealed; inexhaustible, unknowable. We know and can know only Its garment, Its manifestations. Man is called the Microcosm, or little world. The One is in him, as in Nature, the cause of his Being; and as in the Macrocosm, or great world, the One manifests as the many by an orderly descent or differentiation, so in man, from the one principle we have first a triad, and then a quaternary. The three evolve four, making seven. Then from the first seven, “seven times seven,” making the “49 fires”* of the older Hindu philosophy. Before the reader declares this conception to be altogether fanci- ful, let him turn to the investigations of modern physical science regarding Color and Sound. ’ Helmholtz esti- mated that between the highest rate of vibrations giving rise to sound waves apprehensible to the human ear, and the lowest vibration of Light, giving rise to the red of the Solar Spectrum, there would intervene about thirty- four octaves of consonant or dissonant vibrations; and unless there are great gaps in nature, these thirty-four octaves are concerned in producing the phenomena of Nature. It has, furthermore, been demonstrated that there is an exact equation between color and- sound vi- brations ; and that colors have their complementary tones, and to-es their complementary colors. In other words, we may see sounds and hear colors. The modern theory (very old) of the Correlation and Conservation of Force, designates the various forces, as “Special Modes of Motion:” that is, definite vibrations. All colors, sounds, and forms in nature, are the result of definite vibrations. Matter exists on different planes, 4’ See Plates I and II."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 77 having different densities, different atomic or molecular structure, and hence different vibrations. Change the plane, or rather transfer matter from one plane to an- other, and you change the inherent or normal vibration. Reverse the process, and change by any means the vibra- tion, and you transfer the matter involved to another plane. We must go further. Observation and experi- ment have shown that as to these various planes we have not a single form of matter, with a single form of vibra- tion, but every plane is complex and compound. All the colors of the spectrum, and all the tones in a musical scale, are resolvable into consonant series of octaves (septenaries) . Hence on all the planes above referred to, there is an interpenetration of planes and vibrations. On each plane there is a dominant chord to which all vibrations conform. Just as we may have in an octave or throughout a symphony a dominant chord. The order of this interpenetration, however, is from above down- ward. The higher penetrate the lower, while the lower are only latent in the higher. Take, for example, seven planes of which the highest (seventh) represents spirit, and the lowest matter or physical substance. The first or lowest plane is altogether illusory, It has no perma- nent or real existence. It is not only in continual motion and continual change (Formation, Dissolution, and Re- formation) but these are its characteristics. Under cer- tain conditions it disappears (dissolves) from the 1st plane entirely, and passes to the Zd, and to the 3d, the 4th, and so on. The greatest activity is on the higher planes, and is greatest on the highest; till all merge in, or return to, the One, and Changeless, from which they emanated. All known phenomena in nature testify to the existence of such a law. Hence the saying in the old philosophy : “Nature prefers that matter shall be eter- nal on the higher planes only.” The grossest physical substance, therefore, is pene- trated or saturated with all the higher substances and energies. These are held to subordinate positions by the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"78 MYSTIC MASONRY dominant chord, which is, say, “F,” and so are latent or active as the theme unfolds, or as the combination varies. Can any one imagine such a complicated condition and such coordinate results as all the time occur, and yet be- lieve that there is no absolute law governing the whole process? It is not difficult in a general way to formulate the law. Take the first, or lowest plane. It is penetrated by matter of plane No. 2, the next higher. Let us say that each plane represents matter and force, the Cosmic du- ality. The so-called Force, of plane 1, is the so-called substance of plane 2. Put plane 2 is in its turn satu- rated by the substance and energy of plane 3. Hence the force or energy of plane 2 is the substance of plane 3, while the Force side of plane 3 is latent on plane 2, but active on plane 3. The Law, therefore, may be thus formulated : From highest to lowest, the lower is the vehicle (Upadhi) of the higher; and each plane in the ascending order derives its Force or Energy from the Substa.nce of the next higher. In the last analysis, where all are merged in the ONE, Substance and Energy are seen to be but two aspects of the One Eternal Prin- ciple; the “Father-Mother” of the old philosophy. Passing now from these general considerations to the organic nature of man, and applying these universal laws to his physical, sensuous, intellectual, moral, and spiritu- 21 nature, we shall find that they shed a flood of light on the problem of his nature, origin and destiny. It is well to bear in mind that our idea of God, and our theory of Religion (theology) were the starting points in this philosophy. To deny the existence of God, or to conceive one as illogical, unjust, capricious, personal, and endowed with all human infirmities, equally lead to con- fusion, ignorance and discouragement, if not to despair. This philosophy, here but crudely outlined, is not only the foundation of all the sacred books of all religions, but, while it was in them concealed beneath parable and allegory, in the Mysteries of each religion it was taught"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 79 openly, and constituted the theoretical part of the genu- ine Initiations. Before undertaking to show how far this philosophy is embodied in the symbols of Masonry, ill the Building of the Temple, and the Legend of Hiram, it will be necessary to further unfold the teaching in re- gard to the complex nature of man. Man may be viewed from two standpoints : as a con- crete whole (an Individual, a conscious unit), and as an aggregate of organs and faculties. Anatomically, man is composed of fluids, tissues, and organs. The fluids are resolvable into inorganic and organic compounds, and resolvable again into elements. The tissues and organs originate from cells, these from molecules, and these again are supposed to be composed of atoms or so-called elements. Physiology classifies the functions of man as organic-mere association of tissues endowed with life like the plant, hence sometimes called vegetative func- tions: as Animal-viewed from the sensuous plane, and common to all animal life : as Intellectual, in which are generally included the Moral and the Spiritual. Con- sciousness is usually regarded as incidental, according as it appears or disappears on the physical plane. It has already been shown that in the Secret Doctrine, Con- sciousness is regarded as the permanent or basic factor in man’s Being. It is never destroyed, never suspended, but may retire from one plane to another. In this sense it may be withdrawn from the physical plane. This old theory of the Ego, or Thinker, and its planes of con- sciousness on any of which it may be latent or active during its connection with the body, makes it possible or thinkable that the Ego may, in its states of conscious- ness, transcend the limits of the physical body alto- gether, and furnishes a conception of the nature and ex- istence of the human Soul. These elements of truth, be it observed, are derived from the phenomena and experi- ences of the Ego in the physical body, and the key to the problem lies in the planes of Consciousness. It is be- cause modern materialistic science has overlooked the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"80 MYSTIC MASONRY importance, and failed to understand the philosophy of Consciousness, that it denies or is agnostic regarding the existence of the soul. It should also be observed, that we do not put forth a theory of Consciousness as a work- ing hypothesis, but start with Consciousness as an em- pirical fact in all human experience. Regarding the na- ture of consciousness itself, we are agnostic enough to suit the Spencers and Huxleys of Science, for we have posited it as the highest point in the nature of man; a “spark” from the Unknowable ; the “forever Concealed.” As to changes in states and extension of the bounds of consciousness, this has already been proved empirically in the experiments in hypnotism. Beyond the field of touch, outside the range of sight or sound, as applied to the ordinary functions of the senses, Hypnotic Subjects have been influenced by the silent will, and become con- scious of the unexpressed thought of the Hypnotizer, Thus, even modern materialism with its mechanical working hypothesis has worked up to’ the problem of consciousness. Had any thing been wanting in this direction, the clues, at least, have been furnished by the experiments in Psychic photography of Dr. Baraduc, reported in the French Academy of Medicine, and many other experi- menters are working on the same lines. If the reports are true, Dr. Baraduc has proved by photography the ex- istence of the Ma7~avi-Rupa, the thought-body known to many Adepts of antiquity. Long before this, Mr. J. M. Rusk, of McConnelsville, Ohio, photographed a “thought form” by the light resulting from a strong concentration of the Will. Instances might be multiplied, but enough evidence has already been adduced to give the death-blow to Mechanico-materialistic hypotheses of modern science, and to open the door for the Psychic Science of the East.

THE SECRET DOCTRINE (CONTINUED). The Septenar/y Nature of Man. We may speak of Life, of Will, of Desire, and of Love as Principles manifesting in Nature and recognized by results. In themselves they may have no definite form, yet are they none the less potent. These principles may take the form of the body of man, as water takes the form of the vessel that contains it, which, if congealed, retains the form of the vessel. Still is it true that water as a body has no definite form’ of its own. So it is with the principles we are considering. They are metaphysi- cal concepts, not tangible things, but they are causes that lead to tangible results. It has already been stated that each principle is cor- related to a plane, a planet, and a race; and that the human principles are, on every plane, correlated to seven fold occult forces. It has already been shown how the substances of different planes interpenetrate with the “dominant cho’rd” determining the vibration on any plane. As to the general method of evolution in man, or the relation of Anthropogenesis to Cosmogenesis, it may here be noted that in the various processes of “cooling and hardening,” by which the Earth has reached its pres- ent state from the “Fire-mist,” or “nebulous mass” rec- ognized by modern science, long ages are consumed and various definite stages are reached. The Secret Doctrine teaches that man, like the earth, existed potentially in the fire-mist, and that he has evolved downward into (82)"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 83 matter, pari pccssu, with the earth he inhabits, and of which he is an integral part. Each human being is, therefore, a miniature earth (Microcosm) evolving within the greater earth (Macro- cosm). This is one of the meanings of Ezekiel’s “wheels within wheels.” In a metaphysical sense, every so-called atom of matter is composed in the same way, and is go- ing through a similar process. It may thus be seen that the key to the whole process of evolution is Analogy. It must naturally result from such a process, and from man’s intimate relation to every principle, process, and plane that he epitomizes the whole; and that through ex- pansion of consciousness, and differentiation throughout his long experience, when the consummation of evolution is reached, man will be at one with the ALL. Knowing and being will be ONE in him. Hence, he will be a god in the Platonic sense. This is precisely the view set forth by Herbert Spencer as the consummation of human evo- lution where absolute power and supreme knowledge re- sult. Place over against this view of the infinite possi- bilities and transcendent destiny of man those of any of the exoteric religions, or of materialistic science, and the old Wisdom Religion stands alone as the Divinest Revela- tion ever made to Humanity. During the life of man in the animal body on the physical plane, he is composed of the seven principles. These are Atma, Buddhi, Manas, Kama, Astral Body, Life Principle, and Physical Body. (The order in which they are here named is from highest to lowest, or from spirit to matter.) The first three, namely, Atma, Buddhi, Manas, are symbolized by a triangle. This is the oldest “Trinity” known to man, and is the origin of all the “Trinities” in all the exoteric Religions of the World. As already shown, the INEFFABLE NAME written in the Triangle refers to the One Universal Principle, antedating creation, and lying back of all evolution, Christos is called the Word, but is not AIN SOPH. Atma in man represents Ain Soph in Cosmos. Hence it is"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"84 MYSTIC MASONRY called a “Spark of Divinity;” they are one in essence. Atma, Manas, and Buddhi represent Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When Christ “ascended to the Father,” he raised his consciousness to the seventh or Atmic Plane, and became in fact (no longer in essence only) ONE WITH GOD. These three principles in man compose the Spiritual Soul; the Immortal part of man; while Atma-Buddhi constitute the Higher-Self, the latent or potential God in man. The lower quaternary Body, Life-Principle, Form- Body and Kama (or Desire), are symbolized by a square. To make it plain, let us say that the triangle incarnates in the square : that is, the Soul (spiritual) “descends in- to matter.” It has already been shown in a previous chapter what is the orderly relation of the seven prin- ciples. The Body is the vehicle of Life; Life is the ve- hicle of the Astral Body; the Astral Body is the vehicle of Kama; Kama is the vehicle of Manas ; Manas is the vehicle of Buddhi; and Buddhi is the vehicle of Atma. This is the orderly relation or sequence of the principles. But as already shown, man is not a mere aggregation of principles, any more than he is a conglomerate aggrega- tion of atoms, molecules, or cells. Just as atoms form molecules ; molecules, cells ; cells, tissues ; tissues, organs ; and organs, the whole body; so the Principles, while pre- serving a similar orderly sequence, in relation to each other, are, at the same time, organized in relation to the whole. That is, the Ego, the Thinker, unites with its vehicle, the Body. Physiology has determined that certain functions are performed by certain organs, r,lnd that certain tracts are sensory, and others motor: that there are co-ordinating centers of motion, or of sensation, like the cerebellum, the medulla, or the sensory ganglia; and has assigned thought, memory, reason and volition, to the cerebrum, But neither physiology nor modern science has been able to arrive at the slightest conception as to what Mind, or Soul, really are, beyond functions of organs, or results of"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 85 organization. Empirical facts in Hypnotism show proc- _ esses actually taking place that can not be classified un- der Amy known physiological law. The point at which the Triangle touches the Square; that is, where the Spiritual-Soul forms its connecting link with the Physical-Body, is through Mind. Kama (the fourth principle, appetite, desire, passion, etc.) is not found in the upper triangle, but is the first in the square, or lower quaternary; and Kama has been called the ve.h,icZe of Manas. We have thus resulting from this association Kama-Manas; and the eentral organ of this conjoined or dual principle is the human brain. Here is the union of Thought and Sensation; or Knowing and Feeling; the union of the desire to know with the desire to feel. Here is, furthermore, the origin, seat, and na- ture of self-consciousness in man. On the upper side of the point of union we have the YWill; on the lower side, Desire. This union of Manas with Kama, or Mind with Desire, is called the lower mind (Lower Manas), because it always involves the personal equation. Let the union exist, but the desire be entirely sllhordinate and imper- sonal, and the Higher-Mind becomes free. The terms of the personal equation are united with, or merged in the next higher. This is At-One-Ment of the lower man with the Divine: or Christ at-one with the Father. So long as the lower mind is held in bondage by desire, man can not seek or discern the Good or the True. He in- quires, “What is good for me?” Freed from Desire, or the personal bias, he inquires after and seeks for that which is good or true in itself. When this condition is reach.ed and habitually maf i.ltained, the square is said to be inclosed in the triangle. The whole lower nature is said to be at one with the Divine, or Spiritual Soul. Man’s knowledge and power are no longer confined to, or circumscribed by, the lower plane, or the physical body ; but, transcending these by Regeneration (self- conquest), and becoming perfect in Humanity, man at- tains Divinity. In other words, he becomes CHRISTOS."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"MYSTIC MASONRY 86 This is the Evolution ; process by meaning, aim, and consummation of Human and this Philosophy defines the one-only 7 which it may be attained. The Perfect Man is Christ: and Christ is God. This is the birth-right and destiny of every human soul. It was taught in all the Greater Mysteries of Antiquity, but the Exotcric creeds of Christendom derived from the parables and allegories in which this doctrine was concealed from the ignorant and the profane, have accorded this Supreme Consum- mation to Jesus alone, and made it obscure or impossible for all the rest cf humanity. In place of this, ths grand- est doctrine ever revealed to man, theologians have set up Salvation by Faith in a man-made Creed, and the Au- thority of the Church to “bind or lose on Earth or in Heaven.” Law is annulled; Justice, dethroned ; Merit, ignored ; Effort, discouraged ; and Sectarianism, Athe- ism, and Materialism are the results. All real Initiation is an internal, not an external proc- ess. The outer ceremony is dead and useless only so far as it symbolizes and illustrates, and thereby makes clear the inward change. The ceremony instructs, but it can not transform. To transform means to regenerate; and this comes by trial, by effort, by self-conquest, by sorrow, disappointment, failure; and a daily renewal of the con- flict. It is thus that man must “work out his own salva- tion.” The consummation of initiation is the Perfect Master, the CHRISTOS, for these are the same. They are the goal, the perfect consummation of human evolution. Now, with this idea of human evolution, and in the light of modern science, what is it. to be a Master? Not a mythical Master, not one so holy, so Divine, so incom- prehensible as to be the object of blind worship alone, and impossible to be imitated, an Idol, a Fetish, but one indeed to reverence, to love, and, above all, to approach and imitate; an Elder Brother, a Compassionate Teach- er, a Helper of the Human Race.

At every step he has loved and helped humanity more and more, and sought his own desires less and less. Grown familiar thus with all the lower planes of life by sore trial, by bitter con- flict, by frequent defeat, by hope deferred, almost de- spairing, he has at last renounced self utterly, and so become “dead to the world.” This is the “Great Re- nunciation.” An Infinite Compassion for all that lives takes possession of his soul, and an infinite peace settles within his spirit. “Relieve thou not that sitting in dark forests, in proud seclusion and apart from man; believe thou not that life on roots and plants, that thirst assuaged with snow from the great Range; believe thou not, 0 Devotee, that this will lead thee to the goal of final liberation.” “‘Step out from sunlight into shade, to make more room for others.” . . . ” ‘Tis from the bud of Renunciation of the Self that springs the sweet fruit of final liberation.” “The selfish devotee lives to no purpose. The man who does not go through his appointed work in life has lived in vain.” ?30 shalt thou be in full accord with all that lives; bear love to men as though they were thy brother-pupils, disciples of one Teacher, the sons of one sweet mother.” “Compassion speaks and saith: Can there be bliss when all that lives must suffer?

Turning now from the ethical side of the problem to the scientific, let us see what happens as the conscious- ness of man remounts from the lower animal-self toward the spiritual soul; from the physical toward the higher planes. We have shown Mind (Manas) to be the connecting link between the “Upper Triad” and the “Lower Quater- nary.” When man has once passed the .+lane of Sav- agery in his evolution, Mind becomes more and more ap- parent as the battle-ground of his evolution. He gradu- ally relaxes tooth and claw, and, first, by instinct, then by cunning, and finally by reason and design, pursues the struggle for existence. He changes continually his code of ethics, for he is continually compelled to compro- mise, and he finds that he can retain more, by relinquish- ing a part. His very selfishness leads him to combine and co-operate with his fellows. At last his sympathies expand. By and by he learns that a “fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.” He reciprocates, and at last becomes generous. During all this long and weary struggle his mind is enlarging, and his consciousness ex- panding. He creates for himself a world of Thought. It is unreal and unsatisfying, because so impermanent; and yet he struggles on. He reflects over his varied ex- perience; seeks causes, and discerns principles. He rea- lizes the saying, “My mind to me a kingdom is;” “On Earth there is nothing great but Man: In Man there is nothing great but Mind.” Or, the older saying, “All that I am is the result of what I have Thought.” Mind is like an alembic in which are precipitated all experiences. By evolution man is continually climbing upward to higher planes. His five senses are adjusted to observa- tions and experiences of the physical plane; but he has other experiences. The senses are narrow and circum- scribed; yet even these become refined. His tastes alter, his tendencies ascend. He is reaching outward as his sympathies expand, and upward, as his ideals become"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 89 higher. There is revealed to him a whole world of ex- perience in which the lower senses play no part: A world of aspiration in which Self is not the goal. The very physical bounds of self are loosening, expanding, disappearing. Hitherto he has been conscious of flashes of intuition; of knowing things he has seemingly never learned. He sees inner meanings, and senses subtler powers. Not only in visions and intuitions of the day, but in dreams of the night he has experiences beyond the bounds of sense. He learns the power of Thought. By conquering Self, his Will becomes strong. By subdu- ing passion, his mind becomes clear. He has premoni- tions of coming events; for all events and thoughts and things exist first on higher planes, and are precipitated thence into matter. He becomes clairaudient and clair- voyant. He has broken the bonds of Self and now func- tions on higher planes. As his senses and organs on the physical plane made him Master there of brutes, and of physical nature, even so on the higher plane, the senses and organs evolved by the same Evolutionary Law of experience and choice, make him, on the higher plane, Master of men and of higher Nature. All the time he is evolving organs and functions, and dealing with matter and force. Just as experience and reflection taught him the laws and processes of the physical plane, so his ex- panded and refin.ed experiences and intuitions (spiritual perceptions) teach him the laws of the higher plane. But, says the physiologist, on the physical plane man has evolved physical organs which bring him in contact with Nature on that plane. Even so it is on all planes, for analogy is the key of interpretation, “As below, so above.” Deep within the recesses of the skull, lying at the base of the brain, is a curious little structure known as the Pineal Gland-with the Restiform bodies. Modern physiology assigns to it no function. Des Cartes called it “the seat of the soul.” In the average individual it is small and apparently useless, though its focalized posi-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"90 MYSTIC MASONRY tion and symmetrical relations to surrounding structures would seem to assign to it some very important office. It presents a different appearance in the very young, the very old, and in the idiotic, from that found in the prime of life, health, and vigor. It has been called “The Third Eye.” The Ancient Hindoos called it THE EYE of SIVA, and it should be borne in mind that Siva is the third per- son in the Hindoo Trinity, and is the Renewer, or Re- generator (not simply the Destroyer). The action of this little “gland” may be likened to the bridge of a vio- lin, It renders the nerve chords more tense, and thus raises the vibrations of the brain tissues. It is atrophied, and therefore dormant in the average individual, because the relaxed chords (using a symbol) correspond to the vibrations on the physical plane; and it is one of the well-known laws of physiology that every organ will bei come atrophied from disuse. Going back to our problem of Consciousness, we find Mind to be the changes in our states of consciousness: orderly, when governed by the Will, and guided by Rea- son; disorderly, when swayed by the passions, or led by caprice. All the so-called Senses are differentiations of the One-Sense-Consciousness (Apperception) . Reference has elsewhere been made to empirical proof that in the case of Sight, and Hearing; or, Light, Color, and Sound, the vibrations are consonant and inter- changeable. Now it can easily be seen that if the one- sense (consciousness) has differentiated into several Senses, so-called, in man’s “descent” from higher to lower planes; on his “ascent” from lower to higher planes, the differentiations must gradually disappear, and one center may combine and synthesize two or more Senses. This is precisely what happens in the case of hearing and seeing, or in the vibrations producing sound and color. Since empirical science has demonstrated the fact, the theory may now, perhaps, no longer excite only a sneer; for it must be borne in mind that the fore-"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 91 going is one of the theories taught in the Ancient mys- teries. Here then is the physiological, no less than the philo- sophical basis of Clairvoyance and Clairaudience. The EYE of SIVA is, in fact, an All-Seeing-Eye; for it practically annuls Space and Time as concepts on the physical plane. Whether or not modern Masonry has any such tradi- tion, or any such metaphysical or scientific concept re- garding thz All-Seeing-Eye so conspicuous in its sym- bolism, such, at least, is its meaning in the Secret Doc- trine of Antiquity. A real Master, then, has the Eye of SIVA, the pineal gla::d, dormant in others, is active in him; and the vibra- tions of his brain correspond to the synthesis of sound and light. Henceforth, for him, Space and Time are no lo:lger illusions, as he lives in the ONE and is Master of all lower planes. Says the Voice of the Silence- “Alas, alas, that men should possess Alaya, be one with the great Soul, and that possessing it, Alaya should so little avail.” “Unless thou hearest thou canst not see.” “Unless thou seest thou canst not hear.” “To hzar and see, this is the second stage.” So much as to the meaning of the word MASTER, and the methods by which Adeptship is attained. Now, as to the nature of the Power he possesses, or, the Master’s Word. A man’s words express his ideas, and reveal his character. In this sense the creative power of Deity is called the Word of God, or the Logos; and the whole process of creation, being an outward ex- pression of Divinity, is called the Logos. “There is in Nature one most potent force, by means whereof a single man, who could possess himself of it, and should know how to direct it, could revolutionize and change the face of the world. “This force was known to the ancients.

The “Radiant matter” of Profes- sor Crooks, the Cathode ray of Roentgen, and other ad- vancements in psychic photography, the 1Ma~avu Rupa of Earaduc, and, greatest of all, t.he discoveries of J. W. Keely, trench so closely on the “elementary matter” of the old Alchemists and the Akas of the more ancient Adepts of old India, that a student of occultism need no longer be afraid to reveal himself. There is an old legend which declares that the ancient Atlanteans, not those of Plato’s island which was a frag- ment of the great continent, but of the Continent which sank, it is said, 50,000 years ago, possessed the secret of this “most potent force,” referred to by Cro. Pike, that they were great Magicians, and that they did thus “change the face of the earth,” as Bro. Pike declares possible, and that the sinking of the continent was the result. Perhaps, if our “rain-makers” succeed in solving a little further the problem of vibrations in their rela- tions to atmospheric changes, this and many other ancient “Fables” may seem less fabulous to modern %ci- entific materialism.” When it is stated that these ter- * Morak and Dog ma, p. 734."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 93 rible forces exist, and may be known and utilized, people are not scandalized in this age of dynamite. But when it is also stated that the knowledge of these forces is con- cealed from all but trained Adepts who have demon- strated their unqualified beneficence to man, and that in the hands of vicious, unqualified, or ignorant persons, they are capable of working untold misery to man, the statement usually excites derision. If this embargo were removed, doubtless mankind would not long remain in any uncertainty as to the exist- ence of the terrible VRILL of Bulwer Lytton. If it were revealed to the Spanish Generals or the Cuban Rebels at the present time, the contest would soon be ended on that unhappy island. This force is the universal Life agent, as Bro. Pike says, “wherein are two natures and a double current of love and wrath.” This ambient fluid penetrates every thing. Hence it is the “First Matter” of the Alchemists. It is concentrated in man as the magnetic living force directed by the Will. He who knows its “chord of maw” or the “key-note” of its vibrations can, by his Will, waken it from Space and send it in mighty waves to do his bidding. The real Word of the Master, therefore, in a scientific sense, is this tone-key by which the “Princi- palities and Powers of the Air” can be made to do his bidding. That any one should possess such power and withhold its use, is not easily conceived by the average man of to-day; and that such a Master should also con- ceal his own existence, seems altogether incredible to an age of Syndicates and Trades Unionists. Such a power would, indeed, b? a knockdown argument in all competition, and furnish a very ready way of settling all disputes. The ethical training to which reference has been made, and which began at the first step of initiation, preceded all scientific training in the ancient mysteries; and the Masters are spoken of by Plato, Iamblichus, and many other writers, as the “Immortal Gods.” But it must not"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"94 MYSTIC MASONRY be concluded that because the real Master does not enter into competition on the physical plane, or parade his gifts for the applause of men, that he makes not use of his sublime Wisdom and transcendent Powers. It would be childish to use such powers for display, to awe the ignorant, or to amuse the curious; and such Men have long since put away childish things. From their secure retreat on the inner or higher planes of being, they in- fluence, but do not dominate the affairs of men; and many a beneficent movement is due to their timely aid. According to our conception of energy as correlative throughout Nature’s boundless domain, Fohat is the syn- thesis of all the so-called forces of nature. It is “Cosmic Electricity Endowed with Intelligence.” In the mani- fested Universe, Fohat is “that Occult electric vital power, whieh, under the Will of the Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms, giving them the first impulse which becomes in time LAW.\" It is “the Constructive Force of Cosmic Electricity.” Fohat has “seven sons, who are also his brothers.“‘$ ‘--These are Electricity, Magnetism, Sound, Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc. What modern science calls the “modes of motion,” can fairly be called definite vibra.tions. The forces just named all manifest an the lower physical plane, That is, we see there their effects. If back of all forces there is One Force, and if this one force diXerentiates first into seven, and these seven are in their turn divisible into other Sevens, we get the idea that the Solar spectrum and the musical scale reveal the 'CTNIVERSAL MODULUS; and that what is known to exist in the realm of Light and Sound, must also exist in the realm of Electricity, Chemism; and, in short, with every force and on every plane in Nature.? If, therefore, one can discover the rate of vibration, the quality and amplitude of the “wave-length” in any given case, he will hold the Kez,! to that plane. *: See Plate I. f See Plate I."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 95 Fohat is not only the synthesis of all known forces, and endowed with intelligences, but, potentinZll_r, before differentiation begins, is the Author of the Law of all subsequent correlations, differentiations, or action what- soever. If this view is considered carelessly it might seem to involve materialism or pantheism. But such is not the case. When one realizes that Fohat is one of the highest of the Elohim, or Builders, the Creators spoken of in Genesis, the direct agents cf Divinity through which the Ancient of Dnz~s or Ain Soph creates, this view will be seen to be spiritual to the last degree. The first impulse of Fohat becomes, in time, the law of all subsequent vibration. Fohat is, moreover, in the Secret Doctrine, likened to a.n “Intelligent Force moved by Will.” As the various forces and planes in the constitution of man are derived from and correspond to similar forces and planes in Nature, it can readily be seen what potencies are latent in man; and that the possession of the knowledge of these planes and forces, and a Trained Will to use and direct them, would naturally constitute one an Adept, or Master. The mere power of thought or of the imagination, with a strong concentration of will-power, would, at all times, enable a real Master to say, “take notice thereof, and let it be done.” The ig- norant would naturally say: “What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the waves obey him?” It is said of the Word A. l .U. l .M ‘. that it has seven meanings applicable to seven planes, requiring, there- fore, seven keys; and similar traditions exist with re- gard to the TETRAGRAMATON of the Kabalah-“He who maketh the Earth to quake and angels and men to trem- ble” -even Jehovah. For the ignorant and superstitious, this has one meaning. For the intelligent student of Kabalah, it has many and very different meanings. The physical plane, that of the body of man, is such by virtue of the co-ordinate vibrations of all the principles"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"96 MYSTIC MASONRY that enter into its construction. The physical exists by virtue of the maintenance of the Key or dominant chord of that plane. As long as this key can be maintained in perfect concord, health exists. Whenever the harmony is disturbed, disease results; and when the key can no longer exist, dissolution of the organism occurs, and death is the result. The problem of genuine initiation, or training in oc- cultism,?=onsists in placing all the operations of the body under the dominion of the Will: In freeing the Ego from the dominion of the appetites, passions, and the whole lower nature. The idea is not to despise the body, but to purify it: Not to destroy the appetites, but to elevate and control them absolutely. This mastery of the lower nature does not change the Key of the physical nature as such; but subordinates it to that of a higher plane. Without this subordination, the clamorous lower animal nature drowns out all higher vibrations; as if in an orchestra, the bass-viols and the drums only could be heard; and noise, rather than harmony, would result. Hence the old saying - “He that conquers himself is greater than he who taketh a city.” From such mastery of the lower nature by intelligent effort and Will power, there results not only peace, the silencing of the clamorous lower nature, but clearness of vision and power of discernment. There results also a sense of freedom and of power, and a certainty of Knowledge. In the Bhagavad Gita this training is called Yoga, and is defined as equal-mindedness and sTciZl in the performance 0 f actions. It is distinguished from Hatha Yoga, which is mere straining after special powers (me- diumship); and is called Raja Yoga; that of the Kingly or Divine sort; and is every-where portrayed as a per- manent subjugation of the whole lower nature. It is, in fact, in science and in a philosophical sense, the higher evolution of man. Whatever is gained in one life in this direction is carried over to the next incarnation; while all apparent gain of “powers” in Hatha Yoga (medium-"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 97 ship) is lost in future births, or else is a detriment to evolution. The potency of the planes in man increases from the lower to the higher, and the whole process we have been considering consists symbolically, in “placing the square within the triangle :” that is, of so purifying the whole lower nature as to make it at-one with the higher. The mind that functions through the physical brain, gov- erned by the senses and appetites, and that first gives man self-consciousness, now moves one plane higher. Passion no longer rules the man and blinds him to uni- versal laws and higher principles. The Higher Self in man, called his “God,” or Christos, was formerly “cruci- fied between two thieves;” namely, the Higher and Lower Manas. Hence the saying, “when I would do good, evil is present with me.” As the body is crucified (a symbol of death and suffering), the Christos says to one of the thieves-“’ This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.” This refers to the Higher Manas, now freed from the lower nature. The other “thief,” or the brain mind is left to perish with the physical body of Christos on the Cross of Time. It may thus be seen how the bat- tle-ground of man’s lower nature with the higher is the mind, and that self-conquest and the higher evolution are synonymous. The process of this evolution can be ex- pressed in mathematics and terms of exact science. Hence the old saying in the Bible--“1 praise thee with my lips, I know tiot the nu,mt)wx” Silence the dominant chord of the lower animal nature, and change the vibra- tion to that of the Higher Mind, and “Thou shalt become as gods knowing good and evil.” This change of vibration, with ;. knowledge of the dominant chord and the combination of the key-board directed by the Will, is the discovery of J. W. Keely. The Roentgen ray is one of the “seven forces” into which light, sound and electricity are divisible.

He has been seen to make his whole body lumin- ous. Since the experiments of Von Reichenbach have been verified, and the “illusion-body” photographed, such a result can no longer be declared to be a scientific im- possibility. It should be borne in mind that our entire philosophy as related to man proceeds from the empirical fact of Consciousness, with appeal taken at every step to the facts of experience. Our theory does not consist in any speculation or assertion regarding the nature of con- sciousness itself, but rather in using both facts and experiences in the natural order of their relations. In t,he case of the Master or Adept, the same potencies and processes are involved as in ordinary evolution; and none others. The different results arise from the fact that in the case of the Adept, these ordinary processes are no longer trammeled or delayed. “The Wise Ones tarry not in pleasure-grounds of senses.” “The Wise &es heed not the sweet-tongued voices of illusions.” “Thou shalt not let thy senses make a play-ground of thy mind.“‘b It may thus be seen that neither causes nor results are involved in an untried “working hypothesis.” This philosophy not only explains the nature and ori- gin of all the CHRISTS of history, as the result of evolu- tion under natural law, but these all stand as “Land- marks,” pointing out “the Way, t.he Life and the Truth,” in the journey of the soul, and the immortal destiny of man.

Initiation therefore must be seen to be both evolution- ary, and regenerative; and not a mere empty farce or a dead ceremony, Taking now this evolutionary process as a fact, we may profitably consider further the change that occurs in the structure of man’s complex organism as evolution proceeds. We have shown Mind to be the active theater in which the real battle is fought for the supremacy of the Higher or Spiritual-Soul, as distinguished from the lower Animal--Soul. “‘Thou shalt not let thy senses make a play-ground of the mind.” No doubt many who have read this sentence have regarded it as a moral precept only. Ignorant, per- haps, of the fact that there is not only a philosophical concept, but scientific facts and Laws back of all moral truths. The mind is the realm of thought, and the sum of all experience on both the physical (senses and feelings), and metaphysical (reasorr, imagination, Will, intuition, etc.) sides of Consciousness. Experience may be called the moving panorama of events in the conscious life of man. Thought is, therefore, the changes i;n our states of consciousness. Thought is the active movement, and consciousness the passive theater of the varied experi- ences of life. Consciousness is, therefore, to the life of man what Space is to the existence and movements of Cosmos-the ALL-CONTAINER. The Ego is a self-centered “ray ;” a focus; the “mathematical point” in conscious- ness. That which the nucleus is to the living cell, the point from which all forces and movements emanate, and to which all counter-movements and forces tend, such is the Ego-the Thinker in man. The first point to be made in real initiation is for the Thinker to control the thought. Instead of passively and lic!plcssly receiving all suggestions that come from the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"100 MYSTIC MASONRY physical senses, or appetites ; or all that come from am- bition, selfishness and pride; he selects, and chooses, and Wills what thoughts shall come. In this manner he ac- quires mastery over his own mind, and frees his will from the dominion of Desire; or rather elevates and puri- fies Desire. He is no longer hag-ridden by vagrant thoughts; or a victim to the ghosts of a remorseful mem- ory, or a depraved imagination. That one can thus choose the subjects of his own thoughts is really within the experience of every one when he comes to reflect upon the subject. But few people are aware that the mind can be divested of all thought. on the, physical or brain- side of experience.. Yet what is revery, or day-dream, or absent-mindedness ? We have only to analyze and reflect on our ordinary experiences in order to see how natural and really common place are the operations of these occult laws. When this process is intelligently conceived and per- sisted in, the mind grows clear and the Will strong, and for this change there is a physical basis and a scientific law; and there must be corresponding changes in the physical structure. This change occurs on the Kamic plane, which is now subordinated to Reason and Will; and also in the Astral or Form-body, which is the vehicle of Kama (passion and desire). This Astral body is the mold or pattern around which the physical structure is built, which it precedes and survives for a short time after death. In relation to the molecules and cells which constitute the tissues of the body the Astral structure is Atomic. The Astral body of each separate incarnation is the immediate result of the thoughts and experiences of the preceding life; modified, however, by all previous lives. It is invisible to ordinary vision, but, fortified by the strong dregs of Karma, in a gross and passionate in- dividual, it may appear as the Ghost or Wraith seen at times near cemeteries. Tt has also much to do with the “ghosts” and “materializations” of the Seance rooms. This Astral principle, like all the other seven (really six,"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 101 exclusive of the highest) is seven-fold in its constitution in man; and it is the lowest of which we have been speak- ing. This Astral is one of the principles of the “square,” or lower quaternary, and is not, therefore, the real spiritual soul, or immortal part in man. With this crude outline of the Form-Body we may now return to the process of regeneration. The change re- sulting from self-mastery and the subjugation of the lower animal nature, strengthens the Form-Body and liberates it from the physical shell. Instead of this As- tral or Form-Body saturated with the gross animal spirits (kama) being.held to the vibrations of the mere animal and physical nature, and thus holding conscious- ness to the key-note of the physical plane, involved in the lower animal life, the vibrations are now raised one plane higher. The action of the Pineal Gland and Resti- form Bodies heretofore described, now come into play with the purified and liberated Form-Body. The physi- cal body is still the vehicle of the Ego on the physical plane; but it is no longer a dark prison-house with ani- mal lust and pride as Goalers. It is a common experi- ence, and often consciously so, that we “journey when we sleep.” We go out of the body and visit scenes, and gain experiences during the sleep of the physical senses, but it is rare that we remember, or really understand what happens, for the reason that all that we know as memory concerns the brain on the lower side, Now, in case of the growing Adept these experiences become con- tinually more frequent and lucid. He retains disCnet recollection, and understands more and more of what oc- curs. By and by he observes the process of “going out” and “coming back ;” and at length learns to repeat the process at will; a perfectly natural evolution, be it ob- served. The story of Peter Ibbetson gives an exceeding- ly graphic and philosophical description of this “double consciousness,” which is more than justified by the phe- nomena of Hypnotism and Somnambulism.

He has, moreover, “put the last enemy under foot.” He has, by self-conquest and Will, conquered Death. These are they whom Plato and the old Initiates call the IMMOR- TALS. At the death or dissolution of the physical body such a one is not precipitated into a new world, as a helpless infant is born into the physical with organs un- developed, and functions untried ; but, already familiar with the inner realm from experience, he preserves eon- sciousness on that plane and is there like an adult on the physical plane. It is true that he can not function or manifest on the physical plane as before, for he has now no longer the physical body. But he has learned to live so little on that plane, and found thereon so little of real enjoyment, that unless he has a special work to do for humanity, or an obligation to discharge to others, he finds nothing to regret in dving. He has fulfilled the Law of Necessity (Karma) by obeying it ! “This is peace, To conquer love of self and lust of life, To tear deep-rooted passion from the breast, To still the inward strife.” “For love, to clasp Eternal Beauty close ; For glory, to b)e Lord of self, for pleasure To live beyond the gods; for countless wealth To lay up lasting treasure.” “Then sorrow ends, for Life and Death have ceased; How should lamps flicker when their oil is spent?

The knowledge possessed by such a Master, and the power which he finds subject to his Will, are derived, as in all ordinary eases, from the whole range of his ex- perience. One has only to use good judgment and thcughtful observation in experimenting along the lines indicat.ed, and to go but a little way to become convinced cf the truth involved in the philosophy of self-conquest. It is no “go-as-you-please” evolution. It is rather using the Will and subordinating the lower nature to accom- plish “the Will of God concerning us;” in place of ring- ing the everlasting changes in sensation and ennui life after life upon earth. In comparison with the ordinary process of drifting with any tide, it is, indeed, a forcing process; but the force is derived from the higher nature, and the result is plainly within the law of man’s moral and intellectual life. The term Atitral-Body has been used because it is somewhat familiar to Western students. The term is a very loose one at best, and the plane and structure to which it refers are so metaphysical and complex that it is difficult to find terms in which to describe it. The con- ception of what we ordinarily call “matter and force” is, moreover, entirely inadequate in dealing with such prob- lems. Electricity, for example, is not simply a “mode of motion,” or a “fluid,” but a correlate involving life and intelligence, with latent consciousness, and moved by Will : a duality in itself, according as it manifests as the substance of one plane or the ener,qy of another. Furthermore, the prob?em of consciousness as related to Snace and Time already pointed out, makes it diffisult to put in exact terms the experience of the Ego on the supra-physical planes.

Synchronous vibrations now occur between the centers of consciousness in the Astral-Body and the whole Astral Plane ; just as before, this synchronism existed between the physical body and the physical plane in relation to physical consciousness. The Astral-Body, therefore, need not leave the vicinity of the physical, or “travel through space,” to take cog- nizance of events elsewhere transpiring. This, further- more, remains true, even in cases where the apparition of the individual is seen at great distances from where the physical body is, at the time, reposing.* Thought is, in every case, a vibration molding substance into definite forms. Whenever we think of a person near or far, we create a thought image of that person. This form necessarily varies according to the clearness of memory cr imagination, and the strength of Will. Fur- thermore, our thought is characteristic of ourselves, and in thinking intently of a distant object or person, a thought-form of ourselves may appear at that place. This may occur and be visible to others, and exist un- consciously to ourselves. With a person of trained hab- its of thought, who thinks clearly and connectedly, and who is possessed of a strong will; who knows, also, how to fix and hold the thought on an object or a person, the projection of the Thought-Body, as above described, be- comes a comparatively easy matter. Such an Illusion might or might not be perceived by another; nor, except in the case of an Adept, could the individual causing the Illusion be certain himself whether his experiment had been successful or not. While these facts have been familiar to students of occultism for ages, they have seldom been discussed in print for the reason that such discussion could do no good * Dr, Baraduc has demonstrated this, by the “Thought-Body,”"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE 105 and would only excite ridicule. But now that modern scientific experiment trenches so closely on the subject, the discussion may not seem so unprofitable. In a communication from Paris dated June 27, 1896, a description of psychic photography is given as pre- sented to the Paris Academic de Medicine by Dr. Baraduc : “Dr. Baraduc explains in part his methods of psychic photography, which seem simple enough. The experi- menter locks himself in a dark room where he has pre- viously placed a sensitive plate. After seating himself and divesting his mind of vagrant thoughts and delibera- tions, and after steadying his nerves, he concentrates all his ideas on a certain image, be it man, beast, or inani- mate object, and it will be found that the accuracy of the image will be in proportion to the power of his will. If no other image has intruded, a perfect likeness will have been obtained. In conclusion, Dr. Baraduc says that not every body has this power to control his volition, and in order to succeed, a strong imagination is absolutely nec- essary, and an energetic Will indispensable.” Mr. James M. Rusk, of Ohio, reports the same result from a similar experiment made by himself and con- firmed by Colonel De Rochas. The only new feature in these experiments is the in- troduction of photography and the consequent fixation of the images, and this result is, of course, of paramount importance to materialistic science. Ten thousand per- sons will be convinced by a fact or an ocular demonstra- tion, where one will perceive the truth from reason, philosophy, or intuition.

Some re- mained for a lifetime in the lower degrees, unable to progress further on account of constitutional defect or mental and spiritual incapacity. The Mysteries un- folded the Building of Worlds, the Religion of Nature, the Brotherhood of Man, the Immortality of the Soul, and the Evolution of Humanity.

Patterning af- ter the Sanctuaries of the Ancient Mysteries, and founded on the principle of the Universal and Unquali- fied Brotherhood of Man, they have held aloft the Torch of Liberty. If in later times class distinctions and color lines have divided the craft, the Lodge has never re- sorted to persecution, or been the agent of oppression. When these veils that have for the time obscured the true light are removed, and every man is regarded for his intrinsic worth alone, and Masonry is indeed and in truth no respecter of persons, then will this great or- ganization enter on an era of prosperity such as is its heritage from all the past, and its right by the simple power of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. The traditions of Masonry in later times exclude woman from participating in the work of the Lodge, but not from all the rights and benefits of the Craft. The reasons that have led to the exclusion of woman need not here be discussed. A sufficient answer to all advo- cates of Androgynous Masonry may be found in the his- tory of all attempts to establish or to revive it.

In this work of the Lodge woman could have been of no service. While every true Mason is the most loyal of men to every office of woman, as Mother, Sister, Daughter and Wife; as Companion, Friend, and 1;lspirer of man, he would have been trammeled by her presence in.. the Lodge, and she would have received no benefit by being admitted. When, however, the days of Ritualism alone are ended, when from the one duty of guarding the altars and lighting the camp-fires, Masonry resumes its prerogative as Teacher and Enlightener of mankind, and the Philosophy of Nature and of Life are unfolded in its Schools and Colleges as with the Maji of old, and when with no fear of persecution from time-serving Po- tentate or Creed-ridden Priest, the Light may shine for all, then will the doors of real initiation be as open to woman as to man, as was the case in the schools of Pythagoras as shown by Iamlichus. The Ancient Wis- dom concerned itself largely with the Souls of men, and undertook to elevate the earthly life by purifying the Soul and exalting its Ideals. It teaches that souls are sexless; and that the sex of the body is an incident of gestation. No civilization known to man has ever risen to any great heights, or long maintained its supremacy, that debased woman. Indeed, the Secret Doctrine dem- onstrates with unmistakable clearness that sexual de- basement in any form is the highway to degeneracy and destruction of both man and woman; and of Nations quite as certainly as of individuals. The most debased and horrible chapters in human his- tory are recorded in scientific works by medical experts. Atavism is here exemplified as nowhere else.

If any one doubts this, let him read,-if he can- some of the scientific medical works on Sex-perverts, and then consult the attendant physicians of the insane and the symptoms and records of Lunacy. “The first lesson we are taught in Masonry is to be good men and true.” And the first declaration made by the neophite in Masonry is that he comes to the Lodge to “learn to subdue his passions, and improve himself in Masonry,” i. e., to engage in the building of a fit temple for an indwelling soul. It may thus be seen that all the traditions and usages of Masonry agree fully with the philosophy of the Secret Doctrine as to true Initiation, and that both are justified by all experience, by all history, and by all scientific dis- covery and advancement up to date. These ancient in- stitutions, derided, anathematized, misrepresented, per- secuted and suppressed, as they have been for the last fifteen hundred years, will, in the age that is now dawn- ing, demonstrate their beneficence and their power; and the marvel will be, that the ignorance and brutality of man could have so long succeeded in suppressing them. It is true, even yet, that among otherwise intelligent per- sons the majority do not believe that any such Fountain of Knowledge has ever existed. They are looking alone to the future, and waiting, and they hail with delight every new discovery in science for the betterment of man. It will be for all such the greatest of all discov- eries that “to go back to Plato is to make progress,” and that the Egyptian, Chaldean, and Hindoo Mysteries had, ages ago, exhausted all philosophies, apprehended all sciences, and recorded their priceless treasures of wis- dom in glyphic and allegory for the benefit of the latest generations of the human race. By and by, even our scientists will, like weary and disappointed children, be- come tired in tryin, u to do it all over again by them- selves, and then they will no longer turn a deaf ear to the Immortal, though silent, Voices of the Past, But how, some one may ask, were the Ancients, even before"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE SECRET DOCTRINE-- 113 the dawn of what we call history, enabled to make such transcendent discoveries ? If, in the preceding chapter, the present author has succeeded in presenting even a faint outline of the meaning of the word MASTER, and what Initiation really accomplishes, the inquirer will not have far to seek for an answer to his question. The Se- cret Doctrine declares that it is the result, not of the vain guesses, or the tortuous investigations of ignorant men, but of the recorded and carefully tested experiences of generation after generation of trained Adepts and Perfect Masters, the Advance-guards of Humanity in ev- ery age. Things are not true because they are old, but old because they are true. Immortality belongs to Truth and not to error. A thing is not true because God hath said it, or is supposed to have said it; God said it because it is true: and the whole manifestation of Nature is thus the UTTERED WORD OF DIVINITY. The Master who is ut-one with both Nature and Divinity discerns the truth, and teaches and records it for all future generations of men. But it is only in an age of freedom and enlighten- ment that the voice of the Master can be heard; but it should be ever remembered that the sole authority of the Master is in the Truth; and not the authority of Truth in the Master. Just here lies the distinction between Religion and Superstition. The masses will ever seek a sign, but the one only sign of the Master is his service to humanity. “He who can best work and best agree” is called a Master. Service and Harmony: these are the sign-manuals of the real Initiate. The Ignorant may worship as a god him who can produce signs and won- ders, and when weary of worship return to wallow in the mire, forgetful of the miracle.

THE GREAT LODGE. The profound secrecy surrounding the Ancient Mys- teries, and the obligation of secrecy imposed upon every initiate into the Masonic Fraternity arise from many causes, and varying conditions, some of which have al- ready been pointed out. In times of political oppression and ecclesiastical persecution it became necessary to con- ceal the identity of all members of secret fraternities; and, as far as possible, th.3 principles of the order were also concealed for mutual protection. When to be known as a Mason or an Occultist was to be hunted down like a criminal, to be imprisoned for life, or perhaps to be tortured and burned, men naturally concealed their con- nection with the Lodge, or their interest in the Secret Doctrine. There is probably no degree in Masonry to-day that has not been invaded by members of re- ligious orders like the Jesuits. Those who are familiar with the principles of these Sodalities are well aware that under the plea that “the end justifies the means,” no member of these bodies would hesitate to take any obli- gation imposed, in order to possess himself of a coveted secret that might support the power and maintain the prerogative of his Sodality, knowing in advance that ab- solution for the crime of perjury in violating his sacred obligation would not only be assured him, but that he would b? applauded and perhaps canonized for his zeal and his devotion to religion, as many a Saint in the cal- endar has been canonized in the past upon far less “Saintly” grounds."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE GREAT LODGE 115 In the face of all so-called exposures, and all betrayal, Masonry pursues the even tenor of its way, and tyles its lodges as carefully, and inculcates its obligation of se- crecy just as though apostacy were impossible, and per- jury a crime unknown to the code of civilized communi- ties. Notwithstanding all so-called exposures, it would be exceedingly hazardous for any one, except a regularly initiated B.rother, to attempt to gain admission to the Lodge ; and no possible motive can be assigned why any honest man should desire to receive the rites and bene- fits cf the Lodge excqzt in the order and under the con- ditions prescribed. But after all other reasons assigned for the secrecy of the Lodge, probably the tradition that such was always the rule in the mysteries, has had more to do with concealment than any thing else; and the real reason for concealment in the mysteries has been herein previously shown to be on account of the power that at- taches to the real knowledge possessed by the Master. The penalties imposed for violating the solemn obliga- tions voluntarily taken, may, at times, have been literally rxecuted by the agents of the Lodge in medieval or pre- Christian times; but in modern times these awful penal- ties have undoubtedly been substituted by “the execra- tion of all honest men azd Masons.” In genuine initia- tions into the really occult mysteries, the penalties for unworthiness in any and all directions consisted in the apostate becoming the victim of the powers he had him- self invoked. He had created a Frankenstein which he was no longer able to control, and it destroyed him. Hence, thz warning was true and necessary, but the real method of its execution was disguised, except that it was portrayed as terrible. Too little is known as yet in the West of genuine occultism, to make further explanation intelligible. All space, and every plane of nature is full of Life and Intelligences, and Bulwer’s “Demon of the Threshold” may be neither a joke nor a romance, as many cases of obscession recorded in the annals of Medi- cine and Spiritualism abundantly prove. The “Princi-"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"116 MYSTIC MASONRY palities and Powers of the Air,” of which the ApostIe speaks, and of which the Kabalah treats very fully, are the Elementals described, though but blindly, in ancient occult literature. When the real nature of obscession is understood, and the character of these depraved entities becomes known, it will be discerned how little is to be gained, and how much is to be risked by invoking them. Here lies the reason why mediumship should be discour- aged and regarded as a disease, or, at best, a misfortune. Real Seership is a very different thing indeed from ob- scession in any form. If Seership be compared to the Ecstasy of an innocent and happy child, obscession may be likened to the delirium of drunkenness or madness. Some idea may be gained, perhaps, from the foregoing of the source and character of the penalty for the viola- tion of obligations assumed by the Neophyte in the mys- teries. In the “Mystery of Cloomber,” Conan Doyle por- trays the “idea,” but makes the execution of the penalty at once fantastic, horrible, and impossible. No real Mas- ter, even such as he portrays, could ever play the bung- ling part of executioner, such as he depicts, but would leave the criminal to the snares and devices of his own creation. The imagination of the novelist can hardly supply the philosophy of true occultism. The stories that have come down to us of the magnifi- cent pageantry, and the almost superhuman trials at- tending initiation into the Mysteries, from those of ancient Egypt down to Tom Moore’s Epicurean, all per- tained to the various degrees of the Lesser Mysteries. The secrets of the Greater Mysteries were never written or told. What they were can only be surmised from a complete philosophical knowledge of what initiation really means, and some idea as to what the last : IApreme revelation may be. This has probably never been be- trayed in any individual case, nor is it likely that it will ever be revealed, because, as shown in the preceding chapters, it is the meeting face to face with one’s own god the Higher Self, latent in every man, but now wholly"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE GREAT LODGE 117 revealed. It conce.rns the things “impossible to utter,” of St. Paul, an Initiate. The philosophy of the whole process may, however, be fairly apprehended as the consummation of the Higher Evolution of Man. Thus philosophy, for him who can understand it, takes the place of the whole of the instruction of the Lesser Mys- teries, except such practical experience and final train- ing of the neophite as enable him to enter the Greater Mysteries. So far as mere teaching is concerned, or the apprehension of what is to be done, and how, philosophy is the teacher, and is better fitted to the present intel- lectual age than any other form of instruction. When a School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity is established, worthy and well-qualified neophites will doubtless receive not only instruction, but practical training. Hitherto in this work hints, outlines, suggestions, and running comments or relations only have been given; and every intelligent reader must have observed the dif- ficulty of describing that which was never intended to be revealed. We may now undertake to give a diagram or a picture of an idea running through all history like a theme in a musical composition. The idea crops out here and there in history, but it is not history for reasons already made clear. The full-page diagram (see Frontispiece) is a Symbol of the Secret Doctrine, and some of its principal ramifications and seats. Like all symbols, it is not the thing symbolized; and, as already declared, it is not a history of the Great Lodge and the Secret Doctrine. If it should by and by be shown that the Great Lodge, his- torically, had its first seat in Egypt, or in Ethiopia, which is possible, instead of in Old India, or in Ireland, which is not impossible, or on the Continent of Atlantis, which is more likely still, it would not make any difference with our diagram, which, as already repeatedly declared, is not designed to represent history, but the ilzfEuence of an Idea upon the Civilizations and Religions of the world."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"118 MYSTIC MASONRY When the true and complete history of what are called the British Druids is written, the legends of the now “Unhappy Emerald Island” will be deciphered, and the beautiful legend of Venus rising from the Foam of the Sea will not be the most grand or beautiful of Ireland’s stories. On the scientific presumption that every effect must have had an adequate cause, we have the right to assume that the Landmarks of Masonry, and the traditions of the Secret Doctrine, are not without foundation in fact. Furthermore : the further back we go in history, and beyond history, the grander become the monuments of the Secret Science. Pythagoras and Plato found all their knowledge ready-made in the Egyptian and Babylonian Mysteries. The deeper we delve into the past the grander become these Ancient, Monuments. The Zodiac and the Pyramids alone, by the knowledge they betray of Astronomy, Mechanics, Mathematics and Architecture, demonstrate the existence of a science in pre-historic times such as we moderns have not yet been able to imi- tate, or even to read. We are like miners following a vein of gold in a crevasse of the rocks. Precious ore crops out here and there, and is again concealed; it grows richer as we proceed, till the conviction becomes irresistible that deep in the bowels of the earth, or be- neath some mountain range, there must be a great “pocket,” the real source of all this buried treasure. The analogy is complete, and the reasoning scientific. But if the ancient monuments on the physical plane are un- impeachable, and those in the heavens unapproachable, they are still more transcendent in the Intellectual and Spiritual realms. There is not a religion, a science, or a philosophy, known to man, that can not be traced back to Old India ; with this difference, however, that we have only the fragments, the broken columns, or the dis- jointed images of a complete and perfect structure as it once existed. The oldest books or written records known to us to-day, such as The Egyptian Ritual of the Dead,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE GREAT LODGE 119 and the hymns of the Vedas, have scarcely yet been spelled out by their letters. Such translations as have been given us are both superficial and literal, and the inner meaning, always expressed in symbols, seldom ap- pears at all. The interpretation that has heretofore been put upon them by Philologists, few of whom can rank as Symbologists, and not one of whom in Europe is a real Occultist, is that they are the crude imaginings of a primitive people who knew nothing of science, and who were devoted to superstition. These translators have achieved fame as *‘Great Orientalists,” and they have un- doubtedly done a great work in introducing ancient lan- guages to modern times, and in doing their best to interpret ancient belief, but in nearly all instances these orientalists have been biased by the traditions and false lights of modern Christendom. In another chapter of this work it has been shown what infinite pains have been taken by ignorant Monks, and by zealous Ecclesi- astics, to obliterate these ancient records, and to deface them by interpolations and forgeries in order that the Christian records and traditions might stand unchal- lenged. The best of our Orientals are, even unconscious- ly, influenced by the results that have been thus achieved. When western students are capable of apprehending, and ready to receive the true interpretation of the ancient symbolism, it is possible that native scholars who not only know Sanskrit, but who are thoroughly familiar with the Secret Doctrine, may be found to enlighten them. Take a single instance. The Atomic Theory, known to have been more or less familiar to certain ancient Greek writers, has made great progress in Modern sci- ence, But in no form conceived by Modern science- and the forms have been many and contradictory, has this theory proved competent to account for all of the phenomena observed. It has remained for us, therefore, still an Hypothesis and not a Law. The Atoms of Mod- ern Science, whether conceived as solid, fluidic, gaseous,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"120 MYSTIC MASONRY or etheric, -for they have been imagined to be all of these-are, nevertheless, regarded as clead atoms. Even when conceived as mere neutral centers, or “matremati- cal points,” they are still far removed from Life or In- telligence. Leibnitz conceived them as Monads, each a living mirror of the Universe, every Monad reflecting every other. “Compare these views,” says a modern writer, “with that in certain Sanskrit Slokas translated by Sir William Jones, in which it is said that the crea- tive source of the Divine Mind.” . . . “Hidden in a veil of thick darkness, formed mirrors of the atoms of the world, and cast reflect%on from its own face on every atom.” When we have learned more of Radiant Matter, and the Roentgen Ray, we shall have come far nearer this old Atomic Theory, and Matter will no longer be re- garded as “dead and inert.” The Hymns of the Vedas were doubtless the original allegorical form of the Secret Doctrine, and the Rishis- called “gods,” but really Sublime and Perfect Masters- were their creators. Ante-dating the Vedas, then, was the Great Lodge of Adepts, who created the Religion, inspired the Civiliza- tion, and taught the profound Science that made old India great. If only traditions and broken monuments remain, these still outrank all modern achievements of man. The ancient government was Patriarchal; the Ruler was also a Master Initiate, and the people were regarded as his children. In those ancient days a Reign- ing Prince considered it not beneath his dignity to go into the desert alone, and sit at the feet of some inspired recluse, in order that he might receive more light, which he would again dispense to his people. Instead of teach- ing superstition and idolatry, when the real meaning of the Vedic symbolism is revealed, it will, perhaps, be found to be the thinnest veil ever imposed between the Sublime Wisdom and the apprehension of men. The old gods were the symbolical or personified attributes of Na-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE GREAT LODGE 121 ture, through which man was taught to apprehend the existence of the Supreme Spirit. This was not Poly- theism, nor Idolatry, but a system of teaching that which could not be altogether defined, and of pointing to that which must forever remain unknown, and Unknowable, by the aid of symbol, parable, and allegory. No word- painting known to man seems half so beautiful as some of these ancient parables and allegories. Not only was every oblation of love and duty portrayed, and every joy of home and affection illustrated, and the most com- mon duties of life, feats of valor, devotion, and self- sacrifice depicted, but in a language so musical, and in rhythm and meter so perfect, as to make the whole re- cital more like a symphony than a poem. The whole composition was a mantram. On nearly every page of the ANUGITA it is said-in relation to this or that-“they relate this ancient story, in the form of a dialogue, which occurred”-so and so. If India to-day is like an old woman in her dotage, and her Priests have turned IIarpies to devour her re- maining spiritual life, the record of primeval greatness can never be dimmed or destroyed. In the olden time the Brahman was indeed “twice- born,” and it was the second birth alone that made him BRAHMAN. The parables, then, were not invented to con- ceal the truth from those who could apprehend it, or to keep the people in ignorance in order that the Priests or Ruler might preserve their power. Power came not from the people, but from the possession of supreme knowledge, and this knowledge, continually exercised and exemplified, was the badge of office and the sign of au- thority. To such a Priesthood the people rendered most willing obedience. The doors of Initiation were open to all who had evolved the capacity to “Know, to Dare, to Do, and to Keep Silent,” in regard to that which should not be prematurely revealed. With the light of the Great Lodge standing in the midst, the Religion of the people was a perfect repre-"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"122 MYSTIC MASONRY sentative of Science and Philosophy, in which supersti- tion and idolatry found no place, hence the symmetry in our diagram of the old Wisdom-Religion. The Religion of India being thus inspired by the Great Lodge was expressed in the Hymns of the Vedas. This was the old Brahamanism, the Religion of BRAHM; the Father-Mother of All. But in time the Priesthood became corrupt; the people forsook the ancient worship. Then came Chrisna, and later Buddha, to restore that which was lost. The Brahmins, now no longer “twice-born,” but a priestly caste, jealous of power, since they were no longer real Masters, arose in rebellion, and the mission of Buddha largely failed in India, and found its principal converts in Ceylon, in distant lands, and the isles of the sea. The religions of Egypt and Chaldea had back of them the same Secret Doctrine, or Mysteries; and they were also both Scientific and Philosophical. But Egypt and’ Chaldea repeated the folly of India, and perished with the degradation of their religions. Traditions of the Secret Doctrine still existed, and Masters like Hermes, Zoroaster, Confucius, and Laotse appeared in different lands from time to time to revive the old religion under new names, and often under a different form of symbo- lism. Pythagoras and the Schools of the Persian Maji for many centuries kept the true light burning. The conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, as already referred to, completed the ruin of the land of the Pharaohs, and Pythagoras and Plato became the links between the old philosophy and the Christian Era, together with the Jewish Kabalah, derived jointly from the Mysteries of Egypt and Chaldea, though more largely, perhaps, from the latter. From the Essenes, the Schools of Alexandria then in all their glory, from the Kabalah and the philosophy of Plato, the Christian mysteries were derived. During the first three centuries of our era these doctrines flourished;"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE GREAT LODGE 123 but were finally crushed by the conquests of Constantine, and then came the dark ages. The Religion of Jesus was in every respect that of the Mysteries; it was the same old Wisdom-Religion, though the ethical features were more pronounced, as being most needed among what was called “a generation of vipers,” and a “stiff-necked and rebellious people.” The ethical teachings of Jesus in time gave place to Priest-craft and Sacerdotalism; to worldly power, and conquest; and the religion of Constantine was finally replaced by the “Holy Inquisition,” a religion of torture and bloodshed. The Sufis, among the conquering Mohammedans, knew the Secret Science, but their power paled in the presence of the “Sword of the Prophet.” Freemasonry, though not a lineal descendant of the ancient mysteries, may justly be regarded as a connect- ing link between the ancient wisdom and modern times. While imitating many of the ancient rites and cere- monies, and preserving many of the ancient landmarks, and transmitting to modern times a Grand Ideal, Mason- ry stands as one of the greatest benefactors of the pres- ent age. If it has preserved only the broken fragments of ancient grandeur, it has, nevertheless, cherished and honored these as a priceless inheritance. Will Masons really undertake the noble and glorious work of rebuild- ing the City and Temple of the Lord? Will they unite to restore the primeval wisdom and glory? Will they search diligently among the rubbish for the “Stone that the Builders rejected,“* and for the “Lost Word of the Master?” Alas! who can say? There is another link to our chain of evidence and line of transmission. The grips, signs, and pass-words by which a Mason recognizes a Brother pertain to, the Lesser Mysteries.

Hence it is that the Student of the Sxred Science or Occultism, though not himself an Adept, learns to recognize by un- failing signs those in the present or ix the past who really know the true wisdom. Its signs and symbols are not the stolen Shibboleths by which the real student can be betrayed. Every Mason knows enough of the picture language or Art Speech to be able to speak of many things in the presence of others without revealing the secrets of the Lodge. Even the criminal classes have their dialects or patois. History is full of pretenders in Occultism. Preten- sion alone is a sign of ignorance, and the proposition to “sell the truth” is always a sign of fraud. There are, however, many names in history that have been covered with obloquy, and their possessors charged with fraud and imposition, who were, nevertheless, genuine Adepts, if not Perfect Masters. We must distinguish between self-conviction that comes from the pretender’s own mouth and those accusations that come from others and are unsupported by evidence. The pretender is often loaded with honors and found rolling in wealth, as the reward of deceit and lying, of fraud and corruption, which he is shrewd enough to conceal. On the other hand, the real Master is often gibbeted by the populace and anathematized by the church, because he is neither time-serving nor willing to barter the truth for gold.

AN OUTLINE OF SYMBOLISM. A man standing by a horizontally revolving wheel might be taken as a symbol of every vessel made of clay, whether for honor or dishonor. Every detail of ornaT ment or of shape might hold a legend, an allegory, or a parable; or indicate a use; but the Potter at his wheel would be a universal and all-including symbol; a pic- torial expression of creative thought in man. The Chinese written-language is nothing more than symboli- cal writing, each of its several thousand letters being a symbol. This pictorial expression of an idea or a thought, this Art,-Speech, is Symbolism. When the sym- bols are of familiar things, and as various as human experience, the knowledge conveyed is common. When the symbols are few and simple, whether commonplace or grotesque, like a point, a circle or a square, or a dragon, or a man with horns, the knowledge conveyed is not for the masses, but for him alone who holds the key. Take the following simple series; a point . , a circle 0, a point within a circle 0 ; the circle horizontally divided 8 ; the lower half again divided @ ; the upper half di- vided @ ; a Cross within the circle @ ; the cross alone -,- +- J-- ; and we have the series emanating from the point and the circle. If, now, any process in Nature can be found to unfold in the same orderly manner, then any one of the series of symbols would be found to sym- bolize a definite stage in the process of nature. Hence, the meaning of the symbol would expand, just in propar- tion as one’s knowledge of the natural process increased."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"AN OUTLINE OFSYMBOLISM 129 If nature’s planes are seven, and each plane seven fold, there would come to be groups of symbols pertaining to each plane, and a key to each group. Take, for example the symbol 8. Aside from the philosophical meaning as the third in the series (0 0 @) of Mother-Nature with- in Infinitude, it represents a universal law of proportion, and the exact mathematical ratio of the circumference to its diameter throughout nature; applicable alike to the circle of a pin-head or a sun. Here then would be a symbol in Mathematics or Geometry, correlating Space and Time with Form and Proportion. Such a symbol would, however, have little meaning except to the philos- opher or the Mathematician. To the latter the Greek 7~, or the proportion 1:314X9, or to the Kabalistic 113 :355, would at once recall the original symbol and the whole series. If, in addition, our Mathematician knew the dif- ferent ratios of vibration incident to the three planes of evolution, represented by 0 0 8, he would have the key to occult physics, and could forecast results, measure effects, and induce changes beyond the ordinary plane of crude matter. The simple series to which I have referred will illus- trate the whole science of symbolism. Added to this science of Symbolism there is an Archaic Art-Speech by the use of which a double meaning is given to language, so that the most ordinary form of speech may be used to convey a deep scientific or philo- sophical meaning. This gives rise to the allegory and parable, the outer form of which may convey to the ig- norant a lesson in ethics, and to the learned a principle in science. The most complicated form of this sym- bolism and Art-Speech known to modern times is, per- haps, the Jewish Kabalah, from which most of the glyphics of Freemasonry are derived. The object of the present work is not to explain all these symbols, for that would require a volume on symbolism, and have but little value when written except to the curious. Perhaps the most familiar symbol of a Mason is the"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Square and Compass, fcmnd i-1 ewry Lodge, and worn as a badge of fraternal recognitioll. We are told in the Lodge that the Square is an instrument with which the practical Mason measures and lays out his work, but we as free and accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of squaring our conduct with the golden rule, with principles of right and justice, etc. So also with the Compass; the practical use is made symbolical of the higher mcral ob- ligation, to circumscribe our desires and keep our pass- sions within due bounds. l3ut Masonry is “a system of Morals illustrated by Symbols,” and s-mething wmre; and there is hence a science and a philosophy concealed in the symbolism of the square and compass. This may be outlined as follows. The Square with its one right angle and its scale of measurements applies to surfa.ces and solids, and deals with the apparently fixed states of matter. It represents solidarity, symmetry and propor- tion; and this involves the sciences of arithmetic and geometry. The Compass with movable angle set in the Lodge at an angle of 60°, applies to the circle and the sphere; to movements and revolutions. In a general sense, the square is a symbol of matter, and the earth; the Compas’s, of Spirit and the heavens. In the Lodge the square and compass cross each other, and this fact is made a symbol of progression, from the degree of En- tered Apprentice to that of Master. The compass is set at an angle of 605 and is representative of the move- ments of Spirit, and, if crossed at a certain distance from the angle will produce an equilateral t.riangle; the three angles and the three sides equal, it now represents perfect equilibrium, or proportion. * “For the Apprentice, the points of the compass are beneath the Square.

The lectures on the several degrees, explain the m&hod by which the Compass (Spirit) may gain dominion over the Square (body and passion) through the greater activity of Spirit, ‘“in circumscribing our desires, and keeping our passions within due bounds.” The perfect equilibrium of spirit and matter, is symbolized by the six-pointed star, * which is again only ancther form of the Square and Compass, each now having a base-line from which to form a triangle.

What real initia- tion is, has been outlined in a previous chapter. These symbols, when correctly interpreted, serve two purposes. First: they reveal a complete philosophy of the Creation of the Universe and of Man, unfolding all essences, pow- ers, and potencies, and their mutual relations and cor- relations. Second: they unfold the process of Initiation as synonymous with the uninterrupted evolution of man guided by knowledge and design along the lines of least resistance. In the third degree the candidate imperson- ates Hiram, who has been shown to be identical with the Ghristos of the Greeks, and with the Sun-Gods of all other nations. The superiority of Masonry at this point over all exoteric Religions consists in this: All these religions take the symbol for the thing symbolized. Christ was originally Iike the Father. Now He is made ~~e~t~c~Z with the Father.* In deifying Jesus the whole of humanity is bereft of Christos as an eternal potency within every human soul, a latent Christ in every man. In thus deifying one man, they have orphaned the whole of humanity ! On the other hand, Masonry, in making every candidate personify Hiram, has preserved the original teaching, which is a universal glyphic.

Yet such is undoubtedly the case. This old philosophy shows what Christ as a glyphic means, and how the Christ-state results from real Initiation, or from the evolution of the human into the Divine. Re- genera.tion is thus given a meaning that is both appre- hensible and attainable ; both philosophical and scientific ; and at once ideal and practical. In the Tetragrammaton, or four-lettered name of Deity, the Greek followers of Pythagoras found a glyphic by which they both ex- pressed and concealed their philosophy, and it is the He- brew tetrad IHVH, or “Yod, h6, vau, h6,” that is intro- duced into Masonry with the Pythagorean art speech. The devout Hebrew, in reading the sacred Text, when he came to the tetrad IHVH, substituted the word Adonai (Lord), and if the word was written with the points of Alhim, he called it E&horn. This custom is preserved in Masonry by giving the candidate a substitute for the’ Master’s Word. The Hebrew tetrad “Yod, h6, vau, h6,” is produced by repeating the “h&” The root word is a triad, and the quaternary is undoubtedly a blind. The Sacred word is found in the mysteries as a binary, a tri- nary, and a quaternary; as with the Hindoos we have the OM, and the AUM, indicating different methods of pro- nouncing the Sacred name. The Pythagorean Tetraktys is represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4=10, and by points or “Yods” in the form of a triangle;* this is called the “lesser tetraktys,” while a triangle composed of eight rows in the same form and containing thirty-six “Yods,” or points, is called the “greater Tetraktys.” This corre- sponds to the three lesser lights, and three greater lights of the Blue Lodge, though the monitorial explanations in the lodge are, to say the least, incomplete. In the Pythagorean philosophy both the lesser and greater tetraktys are represented by equilateral triangles, and the points, in either case, form the angles of a series of * See Plates V and VIII."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"AN OUTLINE OF SYMBOLISM 135 lesser triangles. In the lesser tetraktys these triangles are altogether nine, or three times three. In the greater they count forty-nine, or seven times seven ; and in each case the series runs, from apex to base, I, 3, 5, for the lesser, and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, for the greater tetraktys. or by a series of odd numbers; while the points, before the triangles are formed, run consecutively, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. These symbols were thus used as “odd” and “even,” to carry a philosophical meaning, and to illus- trate the doctrine of Emanation. In the Pythagorean system Spirit is every-where rep- resented as the Universal. “All multitude must neces- sarily issue from One,” and that one is Spirit. All em- anations and subdivisions must therefore be related to the One by absolute geometry (perfect forms) and ab- solute mathematics (perfect numbers and movements). In the 47th Problem, so famous in ancient philosophy (see Plate XI), and far older than Pythagoras or Euclid, we have a symbol of the perfect proportions between number and forms; between spirit and matter; and be- tween universals and particulars; and this is a constant symbol in .Masonic Lodges. In the Pythagorean Triangle, or tetrad (see Plate V) , this same philosophy is symbolized.

The triangle series is of odd numbers; the squwe even. The ten “Yods” occupy all the upright tri- angle divisions.” (Quoted, with plate, from print by Fred. G. Plummer.)

It originally consti- tuted the Art-Speech, or glyphics, in which that philosophy was expressed, and to understand the one is to recover the other. This philosophy bridged the gap between mind and matter through apprehension of the one underlying Law. It connected Physics with Meta- physics through the Science of Mathematics, or the rela- tions of Number to Form, or of Equilibrium to motion. The Adept knew tht? relations between the movements (vibrations) that produce thought, those that produee form, those that produce color, and those that produce light and sound, and the number of these in each case. The source of all these is a Trinity; the form of emana- tion a septenary. Hence the play upon the formula “thre,e times three” and “seven times seven.” The first postulate of this philosophy has been shown in a previous chapter to be Abstract Space, and Abstract, absolute Mo- tion; and this absolute motion is that of the Primordial Atoms, thus constituting “the center which is everywhere and the circumference which is nowhere;” i. e., fills all space. It is necessary, however, to remind the reader that these “Atoms” are not those of modern Science, or those that compose what we call Matter, for the reason that they are, one and all, endowed (potentially) with Consciousness, Life, and Intelligence, and are equally world-builders and man-builders. They are the vehicles and the basis of all Law in Nature. They form alike the moving panorama of thought and the tides of the rest- less sea: The beating of the human heart, and the rev- olutions of Suns and Solar Systems; the breath of an infant, and the “Breath of Brahm.” There is universal and eternal Unity and Equilibrium in the midst of uni- versal diversity ; Perpetual Involution of Spirit or es- sence, and endless evolution of form and variety; and back of all, the ONE ETERNAL PRINCIPLE, unknown and forever unknowable, without beginning, without end, without change.

This Spark of Divinity in man is his consciousness, and this in a previous chapter we have postulated as a fact, nothing more. This brings us to the origin of the Tetraktys, the ori- gin of the Ineffable Name, the Lost Word. The Hebrews seem to have derived their Tetraktys from the Chaldo- Egyptian Mysteries, and these may be traced to the Zoroastrian Fire Philosophy, till finally the Word is A:.U:.M:. In both Persian or Zend and in Sanscrit, the three letters are found in many names that designate fire, flame, Spirit, essence, etc. This again is a glyphic or form of expression. Every emanation is a trinity; and Fire, Flame, and Light are the most perfect synthe- sis of this tri-unity. Consider the expressions, “The Lord is a consuming fire;” “ Since God is light, and never but in unapproached Light dwelt from eternity,” etc. The symbol is found in all Scriptures, but only in the Mysteries ~2s the meaning thus symbolized made known. Here, then, is the’origin of all the trinities found in Ma- sonry, the plainest of which are the trinities of Light, and the most superficial explanations are found con- nected with the three lesser Lights of the Lodge. “The Primitive Holy Symbol composed of three letters, in which the Vedic Triad is comprehended, ought to be kept secret like another Triple Veda.

The legend of the Lost Word and the Potency of the Ineffable Name are inseparable. They are the glyphics of Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained ; ‘or of the Fall and the Redemption of man. So also is the legend of re-building the temple, a glyphic of Initiation, which is the same as Regeneration and Evolution. This ancient Wisdom belongs in a special sense to Masonry, for it has done most of any organization of modern times to preserve the ancient landmarks, and has honored and protected the sacred symbols. If Masonry has made only a superficial use of these hoary secrets, and their deeper meaning is still unknown to the craft, it is equally unknown to all others, except as the result of genuine initiation. One may know that a thing exists, where it is to be found, and that it is above all price, without knowing, to the last analysis, what it is.

The foregoing pages can justly be called fragments only of the Secret Doctrine and of the Symbols of Free- masonry. A systematic treatise on either of these sub- jects would necessarily include the other. The Secret Doctrine is the complete Philosophy of Masonic Sym- bolism. So long as this philosophy is unknown to the Mason, his symbols are, to a great extent, dead letters, the work of the lodge a dumb show beyond its moral pre- cepts, and the Genius of Masonry for the members of the Craft is largely the spirit of self-interest, mutual support, and physical enjoyment or revelry, the latest embodiment of which is the “Mystic Shrine.” But there are some among the members of the Craft-and how many time alone can determine-who believe that Ma- sonry means far more than this, and who have already discerned in its symbols and traditions something of their real meaning. Many of these have found partial clues which served to keep interest alive while searching for plainer meanings and deeper revelations. In retrac- ing the steps by which these ancient symbols and their profound philosophy have come down to our own time, more and more obscured with every passing century, students have gathered a large number of facts, a great mass of traditions and general information, all of which have been variously interpreted by different writers on Masonry.

What real benefit can it be to any one to demonstrate that five or ten thousand years ago the same curious myths and meaningless symbols existed in the Mysteries of Egypt, or were taught by Pythagoras and the followers of Zoroaster? Such, however, is not the genius of Freemasonry. The real secrets of Masonry lie concealed in its Sym- bols, and these, constituting as they do a Picture Lan- guage, or Art Speech, are made to carry a complete philosophy of the existence and relations of Deity, Na- ture, and Man.

There is an old occult maxim which declares that- “Nothing is concealed from him who knows,” No Mason is bound to conceal that which he has never learned in the Lodge. All else he receives as he learns any thing, places his own estimate upon its value, and becomes individual- ly responsible for its use. It must be a matter of con- science, and be weighed in the balance of duty, and every one must abide by the result. If Masonry has lost the Royal Secret, or if it never possessed it, or if it was wrenched away in the very name of Religion little more than a century ago, all the same, it belongs to the Craft as the Heir-apparent of the Old Wisdom. But the time has come when no cable-tow can bind it. It now belongs to Humanity equally with the Mason. To this end has it been preserved throughout the centuries. What a future lies before Masonry should it determine to enter into its birth-right to possess it. Thoroughly organized as it is, and counting its membership by tens of thousands, rehabilitated in its ancient wisdom, it may"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"144 MYSTIC MASONRY become an irresistible force in shaping the present civilization, and in influencing the future destiny of Man. All else has perished from the civilizations of the past. Wisdom alone is imm.ortal of all the possessions of man. Of all the achievements of Classic Greece nothing is so well remembered to-day as the school of Pytha,goras, and the Philosophy of Plato, and these but embody and were founded upon the Royal Secret of ev- ery Prince Adept Mason. To restore the Royal Secret would be a work, which, when completed, would be to our present humanity what the supporting Columns are to the Lodge: Wisdom, Strength and Beauty. (Knowl- edge, Power and Harmony.) It would introduce new methods, and motives, and new ideals ,into modern edu- cation, and give us in a few generations other Platos. If we create the conditions the results are sure to follow. Here lies the reward for all the trials and persecutions to which Masons have been subjected in the past. Here we may build the monument of all its Heroes and Martyrs. We may so build that seeing it they would rejoice that they suffered to the end. Bacon dreamed of a great “In- stauration,” a recovery of knowledge, and possession of wisdom from Inductive Philosophy alone; but on such lines it must be forever a dream. The old Philosophy is both inductive and deductive, through the perfect equilibrium of Reason and Intuition, or Experience and Aspiration, and is scientific to the last degree. It will give us as a result Knowledge and Power without op- pression ; Religion without superstition ; Universal Lib- erty, Toleration and Fraternity ; Universal Compassion ; Peace on Earth, and Good-will to Man. Of course it is in the province of Masonry to elect, if it chooses, that its symbols shall have only a superficial meaning in the Lodge. It may admit that it has adopted from the ancient mysteries the glyph& and parables that once served to embody and convey the most corn- plete and profound philosophy, and, while adopting these symbols and the ancient art-speech, confine their use and"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 145 interpretation to such lessons of equity, morality, and fraternity, as are to be found in all exoteric religions. The author of this book would be the last to ignore or to belittle the value of ethical or moral precepts. But these are the basis of conduct, not the crown of exist- ence; the beginning, not the end of wisdom. Man’s “general infancy,” as Browning puts it, only begins when his code of ethics is complete, and when he is perfected as man. To spend the greater part of his days in transgression and repentance is not Man’s “ob- ject served, his end Attained, his genuine strength put fairly forth.” Masonry not only nowhere denies this deeper mean- ing to its symbolism, but many writers have admitted it and expatiated upon it, but very few seem to have been able to discern the real meaning. They have generally failed because of sectarian bias, which dwarfed their vision and narrowed t.he ancient Wisdom Religion to the bounds of a modern creed, while the genius of the ancient wisdom is universal and all-inclusive. To deny or to ig- nore any but the most superficial view is to adopt such conclusions as those arrived at by the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, who makes of the Coffer in the Kings cham- ber of the great pyramid of Ghezeh, only “a corn-bin !” It is to profane the holy vessels, and at last to materialize all spiritual things. It may justly be doubted whether any man for the past century and a half has done so much toward restoring Masonry to its birthright as Grand Master Albert Pike. IIis writings are a mine of wealth too little known to the great majority of Masons. The recent Jesuitical attack on his memory is not only a palpable and sensational lie, but it should serve to arouse every Prince of the Royal Secret to a deeper knowledge of the value of Bro. Pike’s work. That work not only abounds in the clearest exposition of all the Masonic virtues, and reveals a mind incapable of base- ness, but, passing beyond these to the full stature of Nanhood, grasps those eternal principles which underlie the building of Cosmos and the evolution a.nd regenera-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"146 MYSTIC NIASONRY tion of man. The charge that such a man, breathing rev- erence to truth, love to man, and aspiration toward light in every sentence of his voluminous writings, could de- scend to bestiality and grovel in convulsions at the feet of a confessed devil-worshipper, is worthy of his real ac- cusers; and yet such is the voluminous attack recently made in the pages of a leading New York daily. The attack but thinly veils the old time assassins of the he- roes and martyrs of Masonry, and is designed to frighten the ignorant and superstitious into fresh hatred of Masonry. This hysterical “Granddaughter of Astarte” is herself a victim, if she has any real existence at all of the same nefast body, and is only a fit subject for a mad- house. History repeats itself; and this fresh attack upon Masonry, while it can not tarnish the fame of the hon- ored dead, should warn Masons that even in this enlight- ened age the minions of the Prince of Darkness and the Father of Lies have not renounced their allegiance or forgotten their cunning. Persecution is to the Truth what the winds and the rains are to the sprouting oak. These but sink deeper the roots of conviction, and spread wider the leaves that are for the healing of the Nations. If Masons will but pass from refreshment to labor and unite in rebuilding the City and Temple of the Lord of Truth, recover the Lost Word, and rehabilitate the an- cient Wisdom, she may paraphrase the saying of Macaulay in his essay on Barere, and apply it to all her enemies : ‘&We therefore like his invectives against us much better than any thing else he has written. . . . It was but little that he could do to promote the honor of our country; but that little he did strenuously and con- stantly. Renegade, traitor, slave, coward, liar, slanderer, murderer, hack-writer, police-spy-the one small service which he could render to England was to hate her; and such as he was may all who hate her be.” Masonry need not fear the hatred of such, and only such will hate her if she enters into her priceless inheritance, bears aloft her banners and emblazons with light her time-honored Landmarks.
