Confidential Information shall not include: (a) information after and to the extent that it is generally available to the public, (b) information after and to the extent that it is furnished to member by a third party not under any obligation to the Rite regarding its disclosure. Member agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of or pertaining to the Rite or Rite’s Contacts to any person, corporation, or firm without the Grand Hierophant’s prior written consent. Member further agrees not to reproduce in any manner any of the Rite’s Confidential Information or any Confidential Information of the Rite’s Contacts without the Rite's prior written consent. Member further agrees not to make use of such Confidential Information except on the Rite's behalf, and only then with written approval from the Grand Hierophant, whether or not such information is produced by Member's own efforts. Member understands and agrees that his confidentiality obligations under this Section shall continue both during membership, while considering the question of joining and after suspension, expulsion, demit, or abandonment until such Confidential Information becomes generally available to the public through legitimate means. It is understood and agreed that specific information which Member may receive, observe, perceive, create, develop, or learn while a member of the Rite shall not be deemed to be generally available to the public merely because such specific information is embraced by more general information that is generally available to the public. Member further agrees that during the term of this Agreement with the Rite for any reason, he will not: Disclose any information relating to the Rite, its officers, rituals, including, but not limited to, information regarding the financial affairs, business systems, plans, strategies or operation of Rite, to any third parties without the prior written consent of the Grand Hierophant or as required by applicable law; Induce or attempt to influence any member, consultant or agent of the Rite to terminate their membership relationship with the Rite.

All rights reserved. No part of this document may be reproduced, republished, or mirrore d by any means without prior permission in writing from the copyright holder. Non-Competition Covenant . The Member covenants and agrees that the Member will not engage for any reason in any activities in competition with the Rite, including the provision of marketing or consulting services and products to any existing or prior member or prospective member known to Member, or to other entity in competition with the Rite either as a member, an independent contractor, or as a 5% or greater owner, member, partner, or lender for that entity. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under the applicable state law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable state law, such provision shall be effective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder or such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Assignment . Member acknowledges that the acts to be rendered by him under this Agreement are unique and personal and Member may not assign any of his rights, interest or benefits or delegate any of his duties or obligations under this Agreement. Any attempt to assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or of such rights, interests, and benefits contrary to the foregoing provisions or the levy of any attachment or similar process thereupon shall be null and void and without effect and, at the option of the Rite, this Agreement may be immediately terminated. Entire Agreement .  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and contains all of the agreements between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all other agreements, either oral or in writing, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended or revoked only by a written agreement executed by Member and the Rite. No change, modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same is in writing and signed by Member and the Rite. The waiver by either party hereto of any of the terms and conditions hereof or any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a general waiver of any such terms and conditions or permit subsequent breach by any party. General . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, permitted successors and assigns and shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Georgia. Specific Performance and Consent to Injunctive Relief . Irreparable harm should be presumed if Member breaches any covenant in this Agreement. The faithful observance of all covenants in this Agreement is an essential condition to Member's status, and the Rite is depending upon absolute compliance. Damages would be very difficult to ascertain if Member breached any covenant in this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to protect the proprietary rights of the Rite in many important ways. Even the threat of any misuse of the information regarding the Rite would be extremely harmful, since that information is essential to the business of Rite. In light of these facts, Member agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction should immediately enjoin any breach of this Agreement upon the request of the Rite, and Member specifically releases the Rite from the requirement of posting any bond in connection with temporary or interlocutory injunctive relief, to the extent permitted by law.
