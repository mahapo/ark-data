Which was a surprise; because Freemasonry is suppose to be a male dominated secret society. So why would an organisation that has steadfastly refused to allow fema le members within its ranks fo r hundreds of years, use Goddess symbolism? It didn't make sense. I am myself am not a Freemason so any knowle dge and understanding from this book, only comes only from my interpretation of Mason symbols. Thoug h I have had a deep inte rest in Goddess religions for nearly 30 years, so I am looking at Freemasonry from this point of view. Yet if my interpretations of the symbols are correct, they tell a very different stor y about Freemasonry, than what the general public is led to believe. Goddess worship is not usually connect with Freemasonry, yet they even had the audacity to erect a giant statue of a Sun Goddess in New York harbour, which they called the Statue of Liberty. Since then I have discovered I am not alone in realising there is a hidden Goddess within Freemasonry. I have since gone on the Internet a nd by simply typing - Goddess, Freemasonry - in a search engine I have found web sites saying very much the same thing. Many it seems from ex- Freemasons. Though I have to say, these people seem to have a different perspective than what I have. Mostly they seem to be fundamentalis t Christians who believe strongly that the Bible is the word of God. Then they become Freemasons and were shocked to di scover that its roots are Pagan. Some of these men have gone as far as accusing Freemasons of being Satanist. Now personally I am not a Christian myself. I very much believe in the teachings of Jesus but disagree with many of the teachings in the Old Testament and in the later teachings of his apostles. I have studied, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Paganism, Su fi, New Thought, New Age and mysticism and learnt from all these different spiritual teachings. I believe the difference between religions is cultural. So no one religion or sect has a greater truth than a nother, because different spiritual teachings fit the mindset of different cultures and people. My main interest is the ancient worldwide religion of the Great Mother, which I believe has been preserved in the Tao-Te-Ching, the Hindu sect Tantra , the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament and now it seems in Freemasonry. So this is the viewpoi nt I have, when I look at Freemasonry symbols. I don't have any interest whether the Freemasons are non-Christian or even Devil worshippers. I am dubious about the conspiracy theories that Freemasons secretly rule the world. Though I don't reject this all together, as a surprisingly large number of politi cal, industrial, banking and religious leaders seem to be Freemasons. I have no doubt that the Freemasons do work be hind the scenes influence world events, but I doubt if Freemasons are completely united in their aims and I don't believe its leaders are the evil supermen as portrayed by conspiracy theorists. You only have to look at the state of the world is in to realise that the world is ruled by very medioc re people with limited intellig ence and imagination. I suppose many people prefer the idea they we are ruled by evil supermen than the thought that we could be ruled by people who are out of their depth and don't real ly know what they are doing. Yet I also have to admit that the world today is far better ruled, than back in the Middle Ages, so I do see signs of progress. The main focus of this book is to show how Freemasonry uses the symbolism of a very ancient Goddess religion that goes back to the Neolithic age. So its roots may be very ancient. Though whether Freemasonry in a Goddess religion in reality, or th ey have inherited ancient symbols they no longer understand, I don't know. The truth is probably a mixture of both, as I will explain later. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 I was once accused by a Freemason of being too simplistic in my interpretation of Mason symbols. This Mason symbolic drawing called, See Light, answers this criticism as it's meaning is K.I.S.S (Keep it simple stupid). We see two seekers searching for the Sun Goddess, one path is full of symbolism and complex ideas, while the other path is clear and leads straight to the Sun Goddess. The highly educated Mason with all this complicated ideas is on a path that leads no-where. While the other seeker is has his eyes fixed firmly on the Sun Godde ss and looks no-where-else and his path leads straight to Her."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Chapter One THE COMPASS AND THE SQUARE The drawing above is called Faith, Hope and Charity. As in ot her Mason drawings Faith, Hope and Charity are represented by angels or Goddesse s. In this drawing we only see two Goddesses or angels so where is the third? The secret meanin g within this drawing is that the third Goddess is Compass and Square imagine in the middle of the drawing. So why is does this image represent a Goddess?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 5 The Compass and Square image is probably the most popular symbol in Freemasonry. The fundamentalist Past or Ron Carlson, who has spoken about Freemas onry in evangelical churches in many parts of America, claims that the square represents the earth, the compasses represent the sky, and the square and compasses when united, represent the sky impregnating the earth with its showers. He goes on to state that this is a symbol of sexual intercourse. The official Freemason line is they are just tools of the Masonry Trade. Within the space made by the square and compass so metimes a letter is put there. Mostly it is a G though sometimes it is an M or F. So what do these letters mean? Masons claim that G is the secret name of God. Which is a mystery in itself because clearly G would stand for God, so it is not a mystery at all. To make it a mystery suggests it must be anot her name. Masons themselv es claimed that G stands for geometry. This is because Freemasons refer to God as the Great Architect and you need geometry to create a complex building like a Church. It has been claimed that the Presbyterian minis ter, James Anderson, introduced the word \"Great Architect\" into Freemasonry in 1723 and that he got it from the works of John Calvin, one of the founders of Presbyterianism. Also the idea of geometry comes from the physics of Isaac Newton who showed that the movement of planets was caused by scientific laws and not by the hand of God as previously thought. Newton used geometry to calculate the movement of planets so if we replace geometry with God we would then assume that Freemasonry is an atheistic or ganisation. As atheists claim that God didn't exist, used the physics of Isaac Newton along with the later Da rwin's theory of evolution to prove that the world was created by blind chance. Though the irony of this is that Isaac Newton was a very religious man and would completely reject this claim. Freemasonry is certainly not an atheist society and they even banned people from joining it who are atheists. In my opinion both the Great Architect and Geometry are really very poor names for the Creator. After all there is a vast difference in planning a building and creating life. They are names that wouldn't satisfy a person who has the imagination to wonder at the diversity and complexity of life and the universe. A better explanation comes from Gera ld Gardner who was not only a Freemason but also the originator of modern Witchcra ft. At the end of a article about Witchcraft he was to write. - The Myth of Witchcraft seems to be the story of the goddess here quoted. I am forbidden to give her name, so I will call her G. If that is true, then it gives us a clue to the meaning of the Compass and Square image. A Diamond shape frames the letter G. This shape must be important because Masons use the same shape using other tools. As we can see on the previous pa ge, where knives and forks are used to make the same shape, which is strange because knives and forks are certainly not Mason tools. This then suggests that the shape that the objects makes, is more important the than objects that make the shape. So what is this shape trying to tell us? The V or triangle shape seems to be used a lot in Freemason symbolism. An example of this is another important Mason sy mbol of the Trowel which off course is another triangle shape. In Stone-Age excavations archaeolog ists and palaeontologists have discovered many V"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 and triangle shaped symbols and it seems they represen t the triangle of a women's pubic hairs. While the diamond shape is similar to an open woman's vagina. We can find an example of this is the images of the Sheela-Na-Gig. [Drawing by Kathy Jones] The image called Sheela-Na-Gig, a nd is found, believe it or not, on ancient Christian Churches in Britain and Ireland. It is claimed by Christian Priests that this image was used to frighten away demons. Which might make sense to a Chris tian minded person who belie ve sex and everything to do with it, is \"dirty\" and evil. Yet to the ancients this was once a holy and sacred image. Many of these images are found on Churches dedicated to St Bridget. Who was once the pagan Goddess Brigit. It has also been claimed that when the Christian Church first built the first stone Churches the workforce still followed pagan beliefs. So the workers were able to incorporate many of the pagan gods and goddesses within the decoration of the churches . As well as coded messages of pre-Christian teachings, so it seem the Church at the time didn't then have to power to prevent this. It has also been claimed that these pagan stonema sons were the first Freemasons. Freemasons today don't mind admitting that the Compass and Square symbol is also a disguise version of the Hexagram shape, if you put two hor izontal lines across the points of the compass and square. So why did the Freemasons in the past, need to disguise its shape? Although in the last 200 years the Hexagram has gained reasonable respectability as the Star of David in Judaism, in pre-Christian times"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 it was used by Pagan religions. So back in medieval times it would have been seen as a pagan symbol which would warranted a visit by the Inquisi tion, for anyone who dared to displayed it. The Hexagram consists of 6 sides, 6 points and 6 smaller triangles, thus 666. Before Revelations in the Bible was written, 666 stood for the Triple Goddesses as 6 was a sa cred number, and is still as holy number in Hinduism and Buddhism. So the story of th e Beast 666 in Book of Revelations was an attack on Goddess worship as 666 was also used to represent the Triple Babylonian Goddess Ishtar whom Revelations calle d, \"The Great Whore Of Babylon\". Hex is also associated with Witchcraft as it is another name for a Witch's spell and in German a Hexen is a Witch. The Hexagram is very ancient and was used to represent sexual love. As we can see one triangle of the fema le pubic hair and the other triangle of the penis and two testicles, they are then joined together in sexual union. If you take away the two horizontal bars you once again have the diamond shape similar to an open vagina. The Hexagram is still used today by the Hindu Tantra as a symbol of sexual intercourse. Judais m only adopted the Star of David as late as the 18th century, so they may not of known its original meaning. In our Judeo-Christian world we assume that sex and religion don't have anything to do with each other, because we have been taught, that sex is a sin. But in the ancient past sex was seen as a very sacred act, because it creates life. This is true even in Hinduism today as whole temples are devoted to the sacredness of sex. As was also the vagina, because pre-historic people believed that the whole world was born from the womb of the Great Mother. For this reason they worshipped the vagina as the source of all life. The later patriarchal religions made sex a sin and claimed that the vagina was, \"unclean\" as an attack on the earlier Goddess religions. To many Christian minded people these carvings from India would be seen as obscene. When an cient people believed that the Great Mother created the universe it was easy for them to imagine the Great Mother giving birth to the world. For this reason everything associated with giving birth became very sacred. When humans first became self aware they began to ask themselves, \"What created the world?\" It then would be natural for them to assume that the intelligence that created our world would be feminine. This is because if we look at animal a nd human life we find that life is created within the bodies of females. In fact it must have seem to our ancestors that women had great magical powers to create life like this. So it would be logical for them to assume that the whole of creation was born from the body of what they called, \"The Great Mother."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 The carving below comes from India and represents the worship of the yoni. Even in modern times in Tantra, the yoni is seen as a sacred and revered ob ject. This belief it seems gave women great power and status in human societies, because if the Creatrix was female then all women were created in the image of the Great Mother. The belief also made women very holy because it was only women who could create life in the same way the Great Mother had done. This is seen clearly in the many images found in Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites. Where they show images of the sex-act, the genitalia of women represented as V of a women's pubic hair or slit symbols and the very many naked images of women themselves. The picture that comes from these ancient times is that people then regarded the sex-act, menstruation, childbirth and breast-feeding as all be ing very sacred. When these images were first discovered in the 19th and 20th centuries male scientists just dismissed them as \"fertility symbols\". But since then very large numbers of these symbols and images that have been found in many parts of he world. This has made some people realise that these were the images of a major worldwide religion. Some palaeontologists have speculated that people in the Stone Age were unaware that the sex act produced childbirth. So women suddenly producing children would be seen as a wondrous miracle. They also went on to imagine that when men realised this role in conception, he no longer worshipped women as magical beings and took over the role of Creat or himself. To support this theory we do find in Ancient Egypt that the God Atum created the world in an act of masturbation. The problem is that we do find the sexual act portrayed in Stone-Age art. Al so the numbers 13 and 9 are important numbers in cave art. There are 13 menstrual cycles or moon months in a year and it takes on average 9 months for a baby to conceive and be ready for birth. So the people the n, may not be as daft as we assume they might be. Also the input of men in the act of creation can be over in a few seconds, (wham, bam, thank you ma'am). Which is not anywhere equal to women carrying a foetus for nine months, the pain and drama of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 childbirth itself and then the ability of the women to feed the newborn baby from her breasts. Not to mention all the mysteries of menstr uation, which was seen as something very holy and sacred in ancient societies, and something as unclean a nd taboo in later patr iarchal societies. So we can see from this, that the ancient religion of the Great Mother would be a very feminine religion and empathise the feminine and maternal ins tincts of compassion, caring, nurturing, loving and creativity. This is supported by the fact that in the first civilisations of the Neolithic age, warfare and violence against other people was completely unknow n. Archaeologists only begin to find weapons of war, fortifications and images of violence in the la ter bronze and iron ages. Where it seems people began to worship male warrior Gods. It seems that men started to began to dominate our world about five thousand years ago through violence and conquest. They then also created male dominated religions that made the Creator a male and claimed that the sexual act, menstruation, childbi rth and breast-feeding were all unclean, sinful and taboo. This was to undermine the role of women. Ev en today few women dare to breast feed in public, while back in the 1950s and 60s male doctors all but banned breast feeding claiming that cow's milk was better for human children! It was only later, scientif ic research showed the obvious fact that that human milk was best for human babies. As it had been discovered that mothers pass on their immunity to disease through the breast milk. Unfortunately th ere is still resistance because mothers are still not encouraged to keep breast-feeding too long, and to sw itch to cow's milk as soon as possible. In spite of the fact that the research shows that mothers keep on feeding their immunity to the baby right up to time the baby is weaned. Also more modern research shows that feeding babies cows milk contribute to cot baby deaths. Some Christian women, even now will after giving birth still go to priests for a cleansing ritual, to clean them of the \"sin\" of childbirth. Children also go through the cleansing ritual of baptism, which originally was to clean them of the sin of being, \"born of women\". So we can see through patriarchal attitudes an attack on the importance of women's roles. As Feminists have pointed out so often, child rearing is the most devalued work in our society. When some Feminist in the 1960s and 70s suggested that women should be paid to bring up children they were laughed at and ridiculed. After all bringing children and caring for them is clearly not as important as the activities of men. Like generals who have trillions of dollars in which to buy exciting toys like machine guns, flame throwers, napalm bombs or nuclear weapons. So this is the difference betw een matriarchal and pa triarchal religions. The feminine Goddess religions were about the celebration of whole act of creation from the sexual act to giving birth and breast-feeding. It also empathised the maternal in stincts of women of compassion, caring and love. The masculine religions on the other ha nd have throughout history have b een about the glorification of violence. Where religious wars have been commonplace and still go on even today. The irony of this is that in Christianity, Jesus preached love and compassion yet Christianity has been one of the world's most violence religions, throughout it's history. This has been the great tragedy of the last five thousand years. While humans believed that the Great Mother created the world; the feminine mate rnal instincts of compassion, nurturing and love became the ideal for everyone. Then people began to question this belief and accept that our Creator could be male. This allowed pe ople to accept masculine principles and instincts of competition and aggression. In time this was allowed to grow until it turned into violence, and conquest. Creating the world we know throughout recorded histor y of war, oppression, poverty and suffering. Modern scholars claimed that Goddess religions where only fertility cults because of the way ancient peoples used to worship images and carvings of vaginas. Probably with their Christian bias they may of thought that they were all sex-mad in these Goddess Religions. Now many Freemasons claim that their roots are very ancient, going back to the first civilisations. The first civilisations were created in the Neolithic times where we find people then still worshipped the Great Mother. The V and the diamond shapes we see in the Compass and Square symbol are similar to what has been found in ancient Palaeolithic and Neolithic art. So it suggests that the Freemasonry secret name of God would be Goddess. This then would be a true secret because Freemasonry is suppose to be a male dominated organisation where women were not allowed into it until recent times. Also as Freemas onry originated in Christian countries they wouldn't want to be seen worshipping a Goddess in a sex-mad fertility cult."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 10 The word God comes from the ancient Indo-European languages and originally it meant vagina. So God was originally a female deity and only became a male later on. (The word \"man\" was also feminine in ancient Indo-European languages, and only came used for the male sex later on.) Even in North Indian today \"Khod,\" (God) means Vulva; Fe male Organ of Regenera tion, Creation and Eternal Beginning. So the secret name of God would be the Great Mother or Great Architect as the Freemasons call her, in coded form. It would also make sense of why some Freemasons have put the letter M in the space between the two tools because M would stand for Mother, which is the Ancient name for the Goddess. The word Mother is common in all ancient languages like Ma-ma, Mu, Mah, Maa, Mtat and Mana. They all mean both a mortal mother and the Great Mother. New initiates of Freemasonry are told to search for the, \"lost Word\" which is apparently the real name of God. In the third degree in itiation they are given a clue and told to look, \"to that bright and Morning Star\". Now the Morning Star is Venus who was a Roman Goddess. Though the Morning Star was also once called Lucifer, the god of light which people who claim that Freemasons are Devil worshippers, latch onto. Yet long be fore the creation of Lucifer it was the Babylonian Goddess Astarte who was the Morning Star. Further back in time she was known as the \"Queen of the Star\" and the Ancient Great Mother. (Jesus was also called the Morning Star in Revelations in the New Testament.) So this is why, in the first drawing in chapter one, the two angels represent Faith and Hope while Charity is represented by the vagina/Goddess symbol. There also could be another meaning in this picture. Perhaps the two angels were Faith and Charity, while the central image is Hope. Hope would then represent not only a Goddess but Freemasonry as well. Suggesting that it is Freemasonry that gives us hope in returning us to the non-v iolent religion of the Great Mother. There are even more feminine symbols in the compass and the square or the knife and fork symbols. Because the top half clearly shows the letter W and we have the letter M at the bottom. The first letter of woman is W and first letter of Mother is M. Symbols of the zigzag goes back to palaeontology art and it seems this sign means water. It is from the zigzag we get the letters W, M, Z and N. It also represented female vagina moisture and the fluid that surrounds a baby in the womb. The Trowel is another popular Masonic symbol. It is also a triangle shape and so can represent the pubic hair triangle of women, wh ile the handle is a phallic shape. Meaning the Towel can represent sexual intercourse or in more mystic terms, \"The two becoming One\". The fact that Towel is placed in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 11 front of the Compass and Square symbols suggests th ey both mean the same thing. The compass along with the Square creates a diamond shape similar to the shape of a open vagina, and just to rub it in, the hinge of the compass can also represent a woman's clitoris. A tree branch is also used frequently in Freemasonry symbolism. The Olive branch also a sign of peace. Another meaning is that ancient Goddess religions had sacred groves because they had a high regard for trees. Which suggest they were life-affirming religions. As well as understanding the importance of trees in preventing soil erosion, something that was never quite understood by later patr iarchal religions and institutions, who cut down sacred groves as an attack on Goddess worship. This dislike of trees is even evident today, where rain forests are being cut down at an alarming rate in South America, South East Asia, Africa and Australia. This Mason symbol on the left, is regards as blasphemy by fundamentalist Chris tians who were once Freemasons. This is because they were told that the circle represents the vagina and the point the penis, inserted in the vagina. Then to make matters worse we have the Bible above the circle/vagina symbol. Yet this is not unusual in Mason symbolism, as they use Goddess symbolism with the Bible in other of their symbols. As we can see in the image below. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 12 Chapter Two THE GODDESS AND THE BIBLE The square and compass in these images are laid in the centre of the spine of the book and this implies another feminine symbol. Where the two pages meet in the spine is a valley suggesting a closed vagina within the compass and square space. The above image could be seen as a form of bl aspheme because if the square and compass image is a Goddess symbol then what is it doing on the Holy Bible? The entire Bible is all about a male God and ignores Goddesses completely. What is not so we ll known is that the Ancient people of Israel used to worship Goddesses and what seem to be the names of pagan Gods in the Bible are in fact Goddesses. Scholars have found that the Godde ss Asherah appears 40 times in nine books of the Hebrew Bible - Exodus, Deueronomy,. Judges, 1-2 Kings, Is aiah, Jeremiah, Micah and 2 Chronicles. Asherah is a very ancient Goddess, in the anci ent Ugaritic Texts she is called, \"She Who Gives Birth to the Gods.\" Which is similar to what Roman Catholics say about the Virgin Mary in calling her, \"The Mother of God\". Asherah is also called \"she who treads on the sea\", which is exactly what Jesus Christ did, in the New Testament. In fact scholars ha ve revealed that much of the Old Testament is about a religious war between the followers of the Goddess Asherah and the followers of the God Yahweh. In the end it was the followers of Yahweh who won, a nd it was they wrote the Bible, as we know today. Even in the New Testament there are Goddess overtones. We today only know about four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Yet before Christianity became a state religion it seems there were about 150 different Gospels. Some of th em were about the Goddess Sophia whom it seems searched for her brother/lover Jesus in much the sa me way as the Egyptian Goddess Isis searched for her murdered lover Osiris. Other Gospels gave a more prominent role to Mary Magdalene and claimed there were female disciples. One Gospel was written by Mary Magdalene and called the Gospel of Mary and some scholars claimed that this Go spel had its name changed to the Gospel of John. Which is very interesting as Freemasons hold St John in high rega rd. There is even a form of Johannis Freemasonry, which claims John as more important than Jesus. Is this a smoke screen? And it is Mary Magdalene they regard as more important? To have Mary as John also makes sense of contr oversy within John's Gospel, as it suggests John had a very close and loving re lationship with Jesus. Though the idea the John was Mary Magdalene, would be rejected by homosexual Christians who believe th at John and Jesus were homosexual lovers. Although it is not mentioned in the official Bi ble, there is a well-known story that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. Although there is no writte n proof of this in the Bible or in the Gnostic Gospels, so it would be easy to dismiss this story. Yet it also has to be remembered that when Christianity became a State religion there was at the time a vast amount of Christian text that the State officials had access to, most of which was destroye d and only what we know today as the New Testament was saved. Though in more recent time, parts of th e Gnostic Gospels have also been found. So it could be possible that references of Mary Magdalene being a prostitute might be in these destroyed Christian writings. If we take this story seriously what does this mean? We know that Jesus did mix with prostitutes, tax collectors and the general outcasts of society. So is this then could just another example of his tolerance and compassion? This might be one explanation but prostitute had another meaning back in Biblical times."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 13 It is clear in the Old Testament that the prie sts of the god Jehovah ha ted the Priestesses of Goddess temples. We know this from the story of Je zebel. She was Queen of Israel but she worshipped the Goddess Astarte. For this, the followers of Ya hweh murdered her and her followers. Later on her daughter Athaliah also became Queen and she also worshipped Astarte and again she was murdered. In an attempt to slander Prie stesses of Goddess the priest s of Yahweh referred to them as Temple prostitutes because it was known that in many G oddess Temples they used sexual rituals. Although they didn't say that this was because in Goddess reli gions, sex was seen as a sacred act of creation. So in calling Mary Madgelene a prostitute, it strongly suggests that she was in fact a priestess of a Goddess religion. The Gnostic Gospel called Pistis Sophia (Sophia was the Goddess of wisdom) is about a dialogue between Jesus and Mary Magdalene whom he calls, \"dea rly beloved\". In one dialogue Peter complained to Jesus that Mary Magdalene dominated the conversa tion with Jesus but Jesus rebukes him. In another Gnostics text called \"Dialogue of the Saviour\" she is portrayed as a very wise Woman who understood Jesus completely unlike the rest of Jesus' disciple s. So it seems that Mary Magdalene was a very important member of early Christianity, to the degree that some modern scholars have suggested that she and Jesus were married. We know from the Bible that Jesus spent most of his childhood in Egypt. A very important Egyptian religion of the time was the religion Isis and Osiris. Like Jesus, Osiris was a god who was murdered and then returned from the dead. Many scholars have commented on the similarities between Jesus and Osiris, as both gods were known by there followers as the Good Shepherd. One of the symbols of Osiris is the Shepherd's crook and it is also symbol of rank for Christian Bishops. The image of Jesus's mother Mary holding him as a baby is also the same image of Isis holding her baby Horus. Both Jesus and Horus traditionally have the same birthday of 25 December. Also in Christianity prayers are finished by the words Amen, which comes from the Egyptian God Amom. So was Jesus trying to introduce an Egyptian religion into Israel? It all does indicate that perhaps both Jesus and Ma ry Magdalene were trained priest and priestess in Egypt, probably in the Goddess religion of Isis. Then they were sent as missionaries to convert the savage Israelites to a more compa ssionate Goddess religion. They knew that to preach a Goddess religion would mean that they would be quickly killed. So they converted their religious beliefs to fit in with the beliefs of the Jews. This meant that they turned the Compassionate Mother Goddess into a loving father God. Perhaps Jesus may have fooled the common peopl e in doing this but he clearly didn't fool the priests. They were probably very aware he was preaching a Goddess religion and when they got the chance, had him crucified. From the way Jesus reacted to his betrayal and execution, he knew he was on borrowed time, and was clearly prepared to die for his beliefs. What happened to Mary Magdalene afterwards we do not know. It seems she did survive so she probably continued what Jesus started and secretly continued the teachings that both of them created. It is of interest that Christianity came back to Egypt where it grew into a strong religion until Christianity became the Roman state religion. Then the Roman Chri stians had all the Egyptia n Christians slaughtered who didn't follow the Roman version of Christianity. Destroying also all the Egyptian Christian text, which only a small amount has survived today. Th is result is the Roman version of Christianity becoming more like a Jewish religion. As they put more empathise on the Old Testament than the teachings of Jesus. So the Christian Church largely ignored the compassionate Goddess teachings of Jesus until modern times. When archaeologists excavated Ancient Pale stine and the area around it, the Canadian archaeologist John Holiday claims that, \"biblical descri ptions does not match what is found in the dirt\". What came clear from archaeological evidence is that the Hebrew Bible was a very biased and heavily censored version of Jewish History. The evidence unearthed shows that Goddess wors hip was commonplace in Israel right up to early Christian times, with large numbers of Goddess statues discovered in the homes of common people. Archaeologists have shown that the Hebrews worshi pped the Goddesses Asherah and Astarte as much as the countries around Israel. So is this what this Freem ason symbol is trying to tell us? That within the Bible is a hidden Goddess? "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 14 The beehive is another popular Freemasonry image. I am sure they will tell you that the beehive is a symbol of people working together industrially for the good of the whole. So it would represent hard work and good organisation. Yet again it would be another ve ry good Goddess symbol. The Queen bee rules the beehive and the worker bees are also female. The male bees are the drones, which have no role except to fertilise the Queen bee. The drones that are not used in this way are surplus to requirements and are killed by the worker bees. So it means that the beehive is in fact a Matriarchal Society. Which seems to be a strange symbol for what is suppose to be a male dominated organisation. Bees in Ancient times were also the symbol of the Goddess Artemis. This was because she was once the Great Mother who created the world without th e help of a male God. The ancients believed that bees created themselves through parthenogenesis, so bees became a symbol of the Virgin Creatrix Mother who has survived in Christianity in the personage of the Virgin Mary. The Roman Catholics call her, \"The Mother of God\" which comes from a pre-Christian saying that the Great Mother is the, \"Mother of all Gods\". Now, calling the Virgin Mary, \"The Mo ther of God\" should be blaspheme, because in Christianity, God is the creator of all things and therefore doesn't have a mother, who created him. Christian priests claim that this saying only means the Virgin Mary is only the mother of Jesus Christ, but this that is the case, why don't Roman Catholics say this? Why say she is the mother of god, when they mean she is the mother of Jesus? Some people have also claimed that the beehive represents the pregnant belly of the Great Mother. In much the same way that the artificial Neolithic Silbury Hill in England is claimed to be, \"the swollen pregnant belly of the Earth Mother.\" Images of pregnant Goddesses are found in Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.

This is what Masons themselves say about it: The Three Great Lights in Masonry are the Vo lume of Sacred Law, the Square and Compasses, and the sacred writings are understood to be those r evered by the individual Mason. Although there are local variations in Freemasonry's symbolic struct ure, the Three Great Lights are universal. Taken together they form the most essential, as well as th e most widely known, of the Masonic symbols. No Masonic Lodge can meet unless they are present and displayed. Though it seems there are other Masons who disagr ee with the above statement and claim that in some lodges, \"The Three Great Lights in Ma sonry\" are not considered that important."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 16 On the top we have the beehive ruled by the Qu een bee and the female worker bees representing either a matriarchal society or the ancient Goddess Artemis who was once the Great Mother. Then we have the compass and square on th e open book, which is a double vaginal symbol. Which is also a pre- historic symbol of the Great Mother. Then at the bottom we have Noah's ark. Noah's ark is a very ancient story that originally comes from Mesopotamia . Though it seems there are many similar stories about this all over the world. It seems that with the ending of the last Ice Age the great Glaciers that covered most of Northern Europe, Asia and North America bega n to melt. Resulting in oceans levels rising, as the ice trapped on the land turned into water and ran into the sea. Scientists have discovered that this rise in sea levels didn't happen slowly but happen suddenly in a series of dr amatic floods. This is because the melted water would be trapped on land behind mount ain ranges and ice barriers creating vast inland seas. Then when the vast ice barriers melted the water would suddenly be releas ed in a great flood. The last time this happened was about 12 thousand years ago and accounts of this flood were proba bly the origins of stories like Noah's ark. So the story of Noah's ark takes us back to the Neolithic age, which was an age of Goddess worship, when people still worshipped the Great Mother. This suggests that \"The Three Great Lights in Masonry\" are symbols of the ancient Great Mother. And as there are three pictures they are probably are the triple Goddess. The Triple Goddess is very Ancient Symbol, know n originally as the Maid, Mother and Crone. They were also later known as The Three Grey On es, The Three Harpies, The Three Fates, The Three Graces and The Three Maries. As well as Faith, Hope and Charity. This trinity was also adopted by patriarchal religions. In Ancient Egypt they had the trinity of Isis, Osiris and Horus. While in Christianity we have the trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit as well as the three Marys who witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus. The name Mary comes from the Egyptian godd ess Maat and the Mesopotamian Goddess Mami or Mammitu, which means Mother. So Mary was originally a name for the Great Mother. The name Virgin Mary also has an interesting meaning The ancient meaning of virgin is far different to what it means in Christianity. To the Christians a virgin is a woman who has never been penetrated by a man. Which then creates the problem in that Mary mother of Jesus was supposed to be a virgin when she conceived him. The Christian explanation is that God was the father of Jesus. This is not unusual in religions of this time, the Greeks had Zeus who would seduce or rape mortal women and from this union would come heroic demigods. The Pagan meaning of virgin is a woman who is owned by no man. So therefore she was at liberty to have sex with any man she chooses. To th e degree that when she gives birth she may not know or care whom the father is. The problem for the patria rchy in having women like this was that property or inheritance could only be passed down the female line. Which meant that women were still inheriting power and wealth. Because of this ki ngship was passed down the female line as we see in Ancient Egypt. So the patriarchal law of marriage was enforced where a women was expected to be faithful to one man. Which allows a husband to know who his children are. This then allowed propert y and titles to be passed down from father to son, keeping wea lth and power in the hands of men. This then suggests that the Virgin Mary was a woman who wasn't restricted to the patriarchal custom of marriage and so probably belonged to a G oddess religion. Also the original meaning of the Virgin Mother was a name of the Ancient Great Moth er who could give birth without the aid of a male God. Which raises a question, what is the Ancient Great Mother doing in a Bible of a patriarchal religion? It suggests that people were probably still worshipping the ancient Great Mother in early Christian times and the Christians needed the Virgin Mary in their religion to attract these people. Though there can be another interpretation of the \"Three Great lights of Masonry\", if we read the work of Joachim of Fiore. He was a 12th cent ury monk who wrote one of the most important commentaries on Book of the Apocalypse ever written, according to some theologians. He wrote that the key to Revelations is in the concept of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He claims that the Father was the age of the Old Testament; The Son is the age of the New Testament after Jesus was born. Then after the return and defeat of the Anti-Christ, there will be a utopian age of the Holy Spirit."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 So if we look at the Three Great lights again we see at the bottom the Noah's ark, which is in the Old Testament, so this would be the age of the Fath er. In the middle we see a book with the word John on it, suggesting this was John in the New Testament, so this would be the age of the Son. While at the top would be the age of the Holy Spirit but why does a Beehive represent that age? In some of the Gnostic text the Holy Spirit is the Feminine force and as previous mentioned the Bees are associated with the Goddess Artemis who was once a tribal Great Mother. So in other word this image is telling us of the return of the ancient religion of the Mother Goddess. In the book \"The Secret Zodiacs Of Washington DC\" by David Ovason, he writes about all the Freemasonry architecture in Washington city. What is interesting it the very la rge amount of statues and symbols of the Zodiac sign Virgo. Which the author suggests means that Washington is under the sign of Virgo. The problem is that there is no astrological evidence that this is true. So is there another reason why there is such an emphasis of Virgo in Washington? The author claims that all these Virgo symbols and statues, - \"seems to follow a well-established custom of emphasising the role of Virgo, insisting that Washington DC is under her rule and patronage\". As Virgo was once the ancient Virgin Mother, what is this telling us? Does it mean that the founders of Washington were worshippe rs of the ancient Great Mother?  The hourglass is another frequently used symbol of the Freemasonry, but it is also another feminine symbol. (Women have hourglass figures). The wings on the hourglass represent spirit, so the image is of a Goddess."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 Chapter Three THE EYE OF THE GODDESS The above are images of the \"all seeing eye\" or the \"eye of god\". Again frequently used by Freemasons and displayed right at the top of many of their symbolic drawings. The problem with this image is, why has god got one eye? Some claim it is, \"the eye of Horus\", but this is not an answer, as it doesn't explain why the God Horus in inflicted with just a single eye? It would be more sensible to show him with two eyes because a one eyed person is seen in popular sayings as a very biased or bigoted person. So is this a comment on bigoted Christianity? Where some Christians assume that God is very judgmental and intolerant? It might be, but again it can be seen as another vagina symbol. In popular sayings a woman's vagina is also called an eye, because it has the same shape. In other words, it is another symbol of the sacred vagina that from all life is created. Back in the Neolithic age archaeologists have found what is called \"Eye Goddesses\" these were Goddesses with very prominent eyes. In Mesopotamia she was known as the Goddess Mari, those eyes searched men' s souls. In Egypt she was the Goddess Maat (Mother) and was the deity of truth and Justice and had an \"all seeing eye\". "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 According to Masons - The All-Seeing Eye is one of the oldest hieroglyphics of the Deity. The triangle also is a cabalistic symbol of the most re mote antiquity... In other wo rds both the, \"All-Seeing Eye\" and the triangle are symbols of the ancient Great Mother. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 The picture on the last page is of the US Dollar note, it is universally accepted that the images on it are Freemason symbols. The problem with this image is that it has 13 star s above the eagle that also carries 13 arrows in one of this claws, while on the other claw is a olive branch with 13 leaves on it. There are also 13 bars and stripes in the shield and there are 13 letters in \"E Plurabus Unum\" on the ribbon clenched in the Eagle's jaw. Now people believe that 13 is a very unlucky number. To the degree that many hotels in USA do not have a number 13 room or floor, preferring to call it 12a instead. So what is a country like the USA doing having this unlucky number so many times on one of its bank notes? The official line is that there were 13 states of the Union when USA became independent from Britain; this is why there are 13 stripes on the USA flag. There was originally 13 st ars on the flag also but as the number of states increased so did the number of stars, until the USA now has 50 states and stars on it’s flag. The problem is that the 13 stripe flag is older than the USA. It was first used by the East India Company, which was started back in 1600 and become the most powerful international company in the world in the 18th century. Though why the USA adopted the East India Co mpany's flag is never explained. So what is so important about the number 13? One explanation is that the French King, Phillip IV, destroyed the Knights Templar on Friday March 13. Suggesting a connection between the Knig hts Templar, the East India Company and the Freemasons. But the importance of the number 13 is very ancient and goes back to Neolithic times and perhaps ever older when the first calendars were constr ucted. It is of interest th at scientists have found that in Neolithic times and even back in the times of the Old Stone Age, people then were obsessed with creating calendars. The most famous being Stonehenge but there was many stone circles built in Britain, Ireland, and France before Stonehenge . Scientists have even discove red markings on bone that clearly show Stone Age people keeping track of the phase s of the moon 30 thousand years ago. So why was Stone-Age people so obsessed with time and the phases of the moon? A obvious reason would be that Stone-Age women probably worked out that their mens truation period roughly fitted in with the phases of the moon. The months of the year originally come from the cycles of the moon and there are 13 lunar months every year. Which worked out well, as every month wa s 28 days which is exactly 4 weeks, while 28 x 13 = 364, which is only 11/4 days short of 3651/4 days in a year. In ancient times women became associated with the moon, because their menstrual period also take s about the same time as a lunar month. So the 13 months of the year was seen in ancient civilisations as a very feminine symbol. When patriarchy took complete control they adopted a 12-month calendar inst ead, to rid itself of any feminine association in our calendar. Unfortunately when 12 goes into 365 we have 5 days left over instead of one. The result is we now have a hotchpotch of a calendar with some mont hs being 30 days and others 31 and only one month was left at 28 days. While the days in a week no l onger correspond with the days in a month, as 30 or 31 days do not fit in with the 7-day week. So the number thirteen is strongly associated with the feminine in a time before patriarchy. It is also of interest that Friday the 13th is unlucky beca use Friday was named after the Nordic Goddess Freya. So it means that later patr iarchal religions in an effort to di scredit Goddess religions associated the feminine and Goddesses with bad luck. Thirteen is also in the New Testament. Jesus had 12 disciples but if we add Jesus to this we have a group of 13 people. Which is inte resting, as traditionally a Witch's coven is 13 Witches. Masons themselves claim that the Eagle on the Great Seal is used to represent the Phoenix. We see in the picture the Eagle flying upwards, which is suppose to be, \"the Phoenix rising from the ashes\". Now in its original form the Phoenix was feminine. The earliest story of the Phoenix is of the death of the Goddess and her triumphal return. So it was predicted that the Goddess religion would die out completely but would one day return, which is a very common pred iction in many ancient text. As we see a lot of death and rebirth stories in Pagan re ligions and even in Christianity with the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. This picture on the next page is the image on th e other side of the USA one-dollar note. And again we find 13 rows of stones in the pyramid belo w the Masonic \"All-seeing Eye\" and 13 letters in 'Annuit Caeptis', which means \"God has prospered\"."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 In the image above we have a steep sided pyramid far steeper that the tradition type of pyramid of ancient Egypt and South America. So the pyramid is more like that of a steeple of a church, which is a clear phallic symbol. The steeple goes back to pagan times when patriarchal cults would carve large penises to symbolise potent Gods like Pan. Even today in Hi nduism the God Siva is still worshipped as a phallic symbol. This also goes back to Ancient Egypt, as a symbol of the Sky Goddess Nut mating with the earth god Geb. With images of Geb lying of the ground with his penis standing up straight and Nut representing the sky arching over him. It may even be the original reason for the pyramids. I know a pyramid is not much of a phallic symbol but the Egyptians did attempt to build taller steeper side pyramids until they discovered they were unstable. So the pyramids may be very large phallic symbol worthy of a Great Goddess and may be there attempt to attract her back to earth. [The above picture comes from ancient Egypt; wh ich shows the Sky Goddess Nut mating with the Earth God Geb. Which is the opposite to later pagan religions which had the Sky God and Earth Mother. Unfortunately the Christians objected to symbolic religious images that showed sexual union and destroyed the majority of images like this. As pointed out before the sexual act was seen as very holy and sacred in Goddess religions and was even performed in religious rites. But in patriarchal religions it was seen as something sinful and ‘dirty’.] In this image the point of the pyramid or steeple is cut off and we have a capstone that is separated from the rest of the pyramid. Suggesting that if the lower section is Freemasonry then the upper section is another organisation. Within the capstone is the single eye, which is a vagina symbol. Suggesting that the capstone represents a Goddess organisation. So this whole imagine seems to be saying that above the patriarchal Freemason organisation is a Goddess organisation. Another meaning for this is that the pyramid is unfinished, symbolising the unfinished work of the Freemasons. We see similar symbolism in the Mason story of Solomon's Temple that plays a major part in their initiation ceremonies. We also have similar imagery in Christian Churches as the steeple is a clear phallic symbol and Gothic arches are a vagina symbol, even to the extent of where some medieval churches in Europe show a symbol of the clitoris at the top of the Gothic arch entrances. This is very similar to ancient Goddess temple or caves where the Goddess was worshipped, where the Temple or cave would represent the Goddess and the congregation would enter the Temple through the vaginal entrance."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 So the entrance of the Temple or cave would be seen as being very sacred because if the Temple or cave represents the Great Mother then it's entrance would be the place where she gave birth to the whole world. The Masons also call this entrance, \"The royal arch\" which I will discuss later on. What we see in this drawing is that to get to the Temple itself you have to pass through three separate gates as there are three walls protecting the Temple. Which is similar to Freemasonry itself because Masonry in its original form had three degrees before a candidate became a true Mason. If Solomon's Temple represents Freemasonry itself, then it could also have a deeper meaning. Perhaps it might be suggesting that most Masons only go as far as the outer courtyard of the Temple. A lesser number get within the second courtyard and onl y a few members get inside the Temple itself. What is interesting about the Solomon's Temple is that it was a Goddess Temple. This is the reason why Solomon was condemned in the Bible in his later years for turning his back on Yahweh, because he worshipped the Goddess Asherah. So this is similar to the pyramid image on the USA one dollar. The base of the pyramid is for the ordinary Freemasons, which is the outer courtyard. Th en some become part of another organisation that is represented by the capstone, which is the second c ourtyard. Then within this organisation is a Goddess organisation. Represented by the eye and the case of the Temple image represented by Solomon's Goddess Temple. In Freemason initiations they act out the murder of Hiram Abiff, the builder of Solomon's Temple. Hiram Abiff is referred to as \"The son of the Widow \", which is curious as in our patriarchal society a person is generally referred to by his father whom he carries on his name. So the reference to his mother suggests matrilineal succession, which was common in old matriarchal socie ties. Though Freemasons themselves have another explanation for this. In the Egyptians Legend of the Goddess Isis, her husband the God Osiris was killed by his brother Set and cut up into many pieces. Then Isis found all the pieces and put him back together again and mated with him. Then from this union was born the God Horus. So this suggests that son of the Widow would be Horus as his mother was a widow when he was born. This"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 then suggests that Hiram Abiff was the God Horus, whic h doesn't take us anywhere and is probably a red herring. Hiram Abiff was a King from another land and invited by Solomon to build his temple. So this tells us that Hiram Abiff wasn't a Jew. He didn't come alone but also with an army of workers. Which is all a bit strange in having another King from anot her land coming to build a Temple with his own workers. It suggests a very close bond between the tw o kings. This wasn't the only ruler that visited Israel; the Queen of Sheba also came to meet Solo mon. Though the importance of this visit was never made clear in the Bible. So it does suggests that Solomon was open to influences outside of Israel. In the Bible it doesn't say Hiram Abiff was murdered and that the Temple was finished, while in Freemasonry tradition it says that because of the murder of Hiram Abiff, it was left unfinished. This discrepancy may be telling us the aim and purpose of Freemasonry. King Solomon may have tried to promote Goddess worship in Israel, but after his d eath the followers of Yahweh become increasingly stronger. Perhaps the unfinished Temple means the unfinished attempt by Solomon to re-establish Goddess worship, in Israel. The fact that Hiram A bove was murdered, is probably a reference to how patriarchy gained ascendancy over matr iarchy, that is by violence. The murder of Hiram Abiff also has a controversial point to it. When he was murdered the assassins buried the body to conceal what they had done. When it was realised that he was missing a search was made for him and his body was discove red and reburied. Some people have seen the similarity between this story and the crucifixion of Jesus, claiming that this is a death and rebirth story. Masons deny this, pointing out that Hiram Abiff di dn't come back to life and was only reburied. Though if Freemasons claim that Hiram Abiff is the Egyptian Go d Horus then he is part of a death/rebirth story. The point about the story is that Hiram Abiff had a secret, which he wouldn't reveal to his attackers. If this secret is Goddess worship, then it again reveals Freemasonry history. If Hiram Abiff represents the mystery teachings of Goddess religions, then in the past it was destroyed by violence, and buried underground. Freemasons have si nce re-discovered this body of kn owledge and have reburied it in a safer place where they know where it is. Even if the Freemasons started off with an ideal of returning a Goddess religion it doesn't necessarily mean that its leaders share this ideal today, because if they are all men, then they would have to surrender their power to women. The only thing that really makes sense is that there are people who want to preserve knowledge from very ancient times, so this knowledge can be revealed to the public when the time is right. There's some justification for believing this; in the time of Renaissances in the 8th, 9th and 12th centuries, when the Church briefly relaxed its repre ssion. A great deal of ancient knowledge was suddenly \"discovered\". Like the works of Greek philosophise s Aristotle and Plato. These works must of been hidden somewhere while the Christians were destroyi ng anything associated with Paganism. Though it does seem that much of writing from Ancient Greece was preserved in Islamic countries, which was a more enlightened religion at the time than Christianity. The people caring for these ancient scrolls will have to be rich and well educated, because scrolls will over time deteriorate and have to be copied out again. Also it would be far easier for a rich person to find a place to conceal scrolls than a poor person. So this knowledge could come down through old and powerful families, though even here, there could be dangers, as the opinions and beliefs of a father may not be the same as his sons. So a secret society has to be created to make sure that whosoever the secrets are passed on to, are trustworthy. They would do this through complex initiations, to find out the true nature of the people they allow within the society. Only revealing the true nature of the organisation to people whom they find are sympathetic towards the knowledge of pre-Christian, Goddess religions. It is well known that it was Freemasons who en gineered the American War of Independence. When the American constitution was drawn up it was st ated within it that. \"Congr ess shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free practice thereof\". Since then nearly all other Western countries have passed laws giving its people the freedom to belong to any religion they want to. So in theory any knowledge of ancient G oddess religions could have b een revealed in recent times with no fear of persecution, the fact that no such knowledge was revealed then, or since, means that this knowledge has been lost and only the symbols s till remain. Or the keepers of this knowledge, still think that Goddess worship is unaccepta ble to most people in our society."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 When Pamela Suffield and I wrote Gospel of the Goddess at the end of the 1980s we put forward the idea that we are moving towards a new feminine matercentric age. Yet even many of our own friends found such a suggestion to be completely unacceptable. So if we are looking for a secret that is even still taboo in today's society then this would be a very strong possibility. For years I have been interested in not only Godd ess worship but also the concept of Matriarchal societies of the past. Unfortunately I have found that among scholars this is very much a taboo subject to the degree that there seems to be a campaign to cen sor this knowledge, so that the general public are unaware of this possibility. It seems that all the first civilizations of the Neolithic age were all goddess worshipping matriarchal societies but in spite of the evidence for this many academic writers will still steadfastly deny this. Official history claims that men have always ruled human society and suggest that it is ‘natural’ for men to be leaders and rulers. The result is that the common people know nothing about matriarchy and many don’t even know what the word means! The result is that even academic feminists are unwilling to question official history, in spite of the fact that history has basically his-story and because of male bias, has written out of histor y, many of the great achievement of women. Yet we don't have to go to pre-history to find matriarchal societies, the shocking fact is that they exist in today's world. The biggest is the The Mi nangkabau people in Wester n Sumatra which numbers about 4 million people and is the largest and most st able Matriarchal community in the world today. There are also matriarchal communities in China, Tibet and Malaya, which are kept quiet as government officials find this an embarrassment. In Southern India there is a region called Keralal, which again is matriarchal and has a reputa tion of being a well run, stab le and prosperous area. In other parts of India the people of the Lakshadvip and Minicoy islands and the Khasi and Garo people are also matriarchal. There is evidence of matriarchal communities that survived in Africa up until colonial times. The Biagos Islands of the coast of West Africa have a matriarchal family structure with women being at the head of the family. During the 1940s the anthropologist Eva Meyerowitz, in communicating with the Akan peoples of Ghana also discovered matriarchal customs. In time she was able to write down the history of the Akan people which showed a slow change over many generations from matriarchal to patriarchy. The Berber, Bedouin and Tu areg peoples likewise have matria rchal customs. It is claimed they are descendants of the African Amazons, and ev en today their women enjoy the rights and freedom more fitting to the Western world than Arab women. When the first Europeon settlers moved to North America it was discovered the Cherokee, Iroquois, Huron, Pueblo, Hopi and Zuni, Navajo, Innu of St. Lawrence Valley and Zapotec of Mexico all had matriarchal soci eties, which were undermined by the upheaval of the European invasion. The Basque people of France and Spain were matria rchal in historic times, and the Inquisition and the Medieval Witch-hunts finally destroyed their matria rchal customs. While the Saami, reindeer herders of Lapland were also was matriarc hal up to recent times. There are legends that the Czech people were matriarchal up until the sixth or seventh century. Where it seems that after the last matriarchal ruler called Libuse had died, there was a pa triarchal take over. In this le gend the women fought back led by two women warriors called Vlasta and Sarka. After a very long and vicious war the men finally won and imposed patriarchy on the women. The Gypsies were also matriarchal up until recent times when they were influenced by the surrounding pa triarchal society. Before the 18th and 19th centuries Gypsies were ruled by Queens, then during this period male King s slowly took over and have since ruled the Gypsy people. Though some Matriarchal customs still remain within Gypsy society. I have been informed that there are over 150 ma triarchal commun ities all over the world, but we never hear about this, in either th e mainstream or alternative media. The assumption that all human societies are \"naturally\" patriarchy is false. There are also many cases of egalitarian socialites (where men and women are equal), all over the world. The San people of the Kalahari desert of Bots wana and Namibia, the Hadza people of Tanzania, the Cuiva people in South America, Vanatinai of Sudest island in the Coral Sea, The Chukchi people of Siberia, The Nayaka, Pandaram and Pa liyan in India, the Agta and Batak in Philippines, the Batek in Malaysia and the Pintupi, and Warlpiri and Cape York Aborigines in Australia. All have strict customs limiting aggressive masculine behaviour and preventing too much wealth and power to be placed in the hands of one individual. Which a llows for an egalitarian society. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 This Mason symbolic picture is called, \"The Three Ruffians\" with refers to the murder of Hiram Abiff. What is surprising about this picture is that an old man, probabl y a priest, and a woman are two of the ruffians! We can make sense of this if we assume Hiram Abiff represented Goddess worship. What killed Goddess worship were violent young men led by warlords and pa triarchal priests who introduced the concept of male gods then later women themselves brainwashed their daughters into accepting male rulers and gods. Even today, it is women who carry out the barbaric practice of genital mutilation of young girls in Islamic countries. One of the ruffians is using a mallet used by Masons and is used in Freemason symbolism. Suggesting also that many Freemasons themselves are working against the possible return of the Goddess. Probably because Freemasons in positions of wealth and power do not want their privileges undermined by the return of a Goddess religion and matriarchy."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 Chapter Four GODDESS IMAGES WITHIN FREEMASONRY This picture again shows a familiar theme in Freemasonry. We have a four-storey Mason Temple. Each storey would probably represent a degree in in itiation. On the roof of the Temple is the Goddess. Symbolising again the Goddess organisation above nor mal Freemasonry. While above the Goddess is the single eye showing the Hidden Goddess is the true rule r of us all. Each side of the Temple is two columns these pillars along with the Temple probably represents the Kabalah. The Kabalah comes to us from Jewish mysticism but it may be even older than this. In our book, Gospel of the Goddess, we show the path of th e soul on the Kabalah, moving from Oneness into individuality and back to Oneness again. The journey of the soul into individuality we called the path of the God. While the journey back to Onene ss we called the path of the Goddess."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 The Freemasonry symbolic drawing on above again shows the split-level of two very different organisations. Below is the conven tional view of Freemasonry, of an Ancient order of Mason building things like the pyramids in Ancient Egypt, while above in the clouds are the images of three women. The Ancient Greeks believed the Gods lived in a world above the clouds so this suggests they are Goddesses. The three Goddesses are a very impor tant symbol in Ancient times, as I have already pointed out."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 In this image the Mother Goddess is seen as the most important, as she sits above the other two Goddesses while suckling two children. Then we ha ve a Hellenistic Goddess as she has one breast exposed. This was acceptable in times of Ancient Greece but not in later Christian times. She also holds a ships anchor and she may be Aphrod ite or Venus who was suppose to be born from the foam of the sea. Also the moon controls the tides of the sea and wome n's menstrual cycle is one lunar month. Then we have third Goddess on her knees. Th is would be more like the behavi our of the Christianised Virgin Mary. So in this trinity we have the very Ancien t Mother Goddess from who all life was created. Then we have the more Hellenistic G oddess who ruled the heavens alongside male gods. Then we find the Virgin Mary who is a Goddess within a very patriarcha l religion. This picture then also shows the gradual downfall of Goddess worship. Right on top of the pict ure we have as in many Freemasonry pictures, the single eye. Showing us the hidden Goddess is still supreme. The theme of two very different organisations can also be seen in the Egyptian Ankh, which is used in many Freemason images. The Ankh is an an cient Egyptian religious symbol that is now being use today in modern paganism and th e new-age movement. It is shaped like a Christian Cross except that it has an oval shape in the top part of the cross. When asked what this symbol means, these people explain it means love or life. When looking at this sy mbol it is possible to see a symbol of a vagina at the top and a phallic symbol below. So it can be seen as a symbol of sexual love and from sexual intercourse comes life. Which makes sense, as the ancient Egyptian priests and priestesses did use sex-intercourse frequently in their religious rites. The problem with this explanation is that the Ankh has a horizontal bar separating the vagina symbol from the phallic symbol. If it is a symbol of love or life then these two symbols should be joined together and not separated by a barrier. Suggesting that perhap s the Ankh could have another meaning. In ancient Egyptian Ankh means many things, it can mean Goddess, noose, tie, cross, circle, pair, couple, to clasp and oath, which is very confusing. From the little we know of the ancient Egyptian society it does seem to of been a patriarchal society, but there are many reasons to believe it may not of always been that way. In the ancient Egyptian society, all inheritance came down the female line and when male Pharaohs began to rule Egypt he could only do so if he married his sister, or as in a few cases, his mother. So this means that at one time only female Pharaohs ruled, and even when male Pharaohs came into being it was still his sister or mother who was the true Pharaoh. Another way of understanding the changes in ancient Egyptian society is how the status of deities has changed over time. The further one goes back in time in ancient Egypt the more Goddesses are in charge, which was probably reflecting of the power and status of women in Egyptian society. Then as time went on the Gods gained more and more prominence, which also probably reflected the growing status of me n. Though there was it seems, \"backlashes\" to this growing trend. We can see this in the changing status of Isis, where she was at times demoted to a secondary Deity and then made a series of \"comebacks\". At one time in Egyptian mythology Isis was demoted from her role as Divine Mother to simply being a minor Goddess who was just the daughter of the Goddess Nut and the God Geb. This was probably a reflection of the declining status of the prie stesses of Isis. Then it seems she made a comeback as we can see through the following story. The Sun God Ra or Re took over role of creato r God, and Isis was the Goddess of mothering and sorcery.

Ra was force to reveal this to Isis and she healed him, but now knowing his name she"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 had power equal to him. This story would then be a re flection of the growing status of the Isis religion in Egyptian society, at that time. Isis gained even more prominence when the Romans conquered Egypt, and the Romans adopting her as one of their Goddesses. She became so popular that for a while she became the major religion in the Roman Empire before Christianity took control. Isis even lived on in Christianity. Many Southern European Churches have what is called Black Ma donnas, now this is a mystery because why would people want to paint the Virgin Mary black in a Europ ean Country? The official line is that these statues turned black because of the soot from candles bein g lit under them. Which is not true because the clothing on these statues are also not blackened. It seems that when Isis came to Europe she was worshipped as a black Goddess. Then when Christianity took over, many pagan temples where converted into church es. It seems that the Churches that now have Black Madonnas were or iginally Isisian Temple in pre-Ch ristian times. So it seems that Isis was such so popular among the people that the Ch ristian Church were unable to completely eradicate her, so they had to compromise and have a black Virgin Mary to take her place. The Ankh is a very ancient symbol those orig ins are unknown, if we look at how the Egyptian religion and its Gods and Goddess have changed over time. Then it would be reasonable to speculate that probably this also happened to the meaning of the Ankh. If we take the meaning of the Ankh at its face valu e it can mean love or life, which as pointed out earlier sounds reasonable because it has the symbol of bot h sexes on it. But as also pointed out it also has a bar between both sexes, and that this is a problem b ecause to create life both sexes have to be joined, so this is an indication that it might of had a different meaning in the very ancient past. A clue to this meaning can be seen in that the vagina symbol is a bove the phallic symbol. Wh ich makes sense if ancient Egypt was originally a matriarchy. The different symbols on the Ankh may not be a bout sexual intercourse but could simply be a symbol of the status women and men. If this is the case, then we have a symbol of a woman at the top with a symbol of a man at the bottom and a bar be tween them. This then becomes a symbol of a matriarchal society, because it shows a two-class so ciety with women in the upper class and men in the lower class. With a bar in the middle showing clearl y the class division between the two sexes. Which is what we also see in Freemasonry symbolism, of a Goddess organisation above the conventional male dominated Masonic organisation. When ancient people moved from being hunter/gathe rs to agriculture, it was probably women who were the original farmers. In most hunter/gather tr ibes that still existed until recently, it seems that mostly it is the men who do the hunting and women the gathering. As being the gathers of the tribe, it would be the women who would start to plant the seed s and then gathered them. Even today in Africa this is still true as in many African c ountries it is the women who grow the crops. As women planted the seeds and gather the crop, so the idea of ownership would come into being with women being the owners of the land. In societies before marriage was imposed onto women, inheritance could only come down the female line. Because if women were free to have sex with any man they choose then no man can possibly know who his children are. So the first agriculture societies were probably very matriarchal because women would own everything. With inheritance coming down the female line it would only be women who would inherit land, prop erty and wealth. As women produced all the food and brought up the children, men w ouldn't have a proper role in society. Men in this situation would be looking to women for handout s, and so would have little status and respect in society. In this situation the Ankh symbol, the symbol of matriarchy, which wa s greatly revered by Egyptians, would have been an embarrassment to the la ter patriarchal rulers and priests. So to overcome this problem the rulers changed the meaning of th e Ankh from meaning matriarchy to something else. Over thousands of years the original meaning was fo rgotten as the patriarcha l rulers stamped out all knowledge of matriarchy. Also the symbol has slightly changed over time, in the very old wall carvings the vagina symbol is very much larger than the phallic one. But over time this has changed with the phallic symbol growing larger while the vagina symbol has become smaller. So the changing sizes of the two symbols probably reflect the changing st atus of the sexes in Egyptian society. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 In the drawing on the last page; we have four Goddesses above a cloud on the roof of a Freemason hall. The Goddess, or Great Mother is holding the mirror of Truth, which is a symbol of the Mystery religious saying, “know thyself”. This is a teaching that has survived in Taoism and the Sufi and some Hindu and Buddhist sects but most patr iarchal religions don’t like this form of mysticism and prefer their followers to blindly obey their religious laws and doc trines. This is because a person who looks within themselves to find the truth will be more likely to question religious doctrine, this is why the early Christian sect, the Gnostics, was violently persecuted and destroyed by the Roman Church. Because they Gnostics weren’t willing to blindly follow the Roman Churches canon and dogmas. The Great Mother is accompanied by the three virtues or the triple Goddesse s: Faith, Hope and Charity. Below these four Goddesses is the messenger god Mercury. Who play s an important role in Alchemy and Hermetic mysticism as the God Hermes. It seems he is taki ng instructions or teaching from the Goddesses and"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 passing them down to the Freemasonry brethren. Sy mbolising that the teachings of Freemasonry comes from a Goddess religion. Before Christianity there were both Goddess and God Temples in the pagan world. Over a period of time as society came more patriarchal the Godde ss Temples came under increasin g pressure to change. As their teaching became unacceptable to the patriarchal rulers, they were then forced to continue their Goddess teachings in secret. So the Goddess teachin gs became the \"Mysteries\". As these Goddess temples were forced to teach their followers the teachin gs as decreed by the patriarchal rulers they could only give out their Goddess teachings to trustworthy followers whom they knew wouldn't betray them to the authorities. So this drawing like other Freemasonry draw ings does suggest that the Goddess Mysteries did survive in secret organisations like Freemasonry We can see something similar happening in Russia in the 20th century. When Communism took control in 1917 they banned the Russian Orthodox C hurch and as far as the world knew this religion became extinct. Because no Russian would dared admitte d to being a practising Christian for fear of imprison or even execution. Then in the 1980s with the fall of Communism in the USSR, the Russian Orthodox Church suddenly re-appeared again. Somehow they managed to survive in secret, in spite of nearly four generations of persecution. Unfortunately for Goddess religions, patriarchy wasn't overthrown within a few generations and still continues today, so they had to find ways to survive hundreds of years of persecution. When Christianity took control of the Roman Empire, th e Mystery schools were persecuted, so they went underground and their teachings became known as the Occult, which means hidden knowledge. Alchemy was an important part of the Occult movement, by claiming to work at either turning base metal into gold or finding the elixir of immortal life. These Alchemists were able to study ancient text, practise pagan rituals or do scientific research and still escape persecution by the Church. (Alchemists made important discoveries in chemistry, medicine, mineralogy and pharmacology). Because the Church authorities wanted more gold or a recipe for eternity, they le ft the Alchemist alone and even financed them, hoping they will achieve what they claim they could do. Which was a clever move by the secret Goddess movement, by appealing to pa triarchal ruler's greed and fear of deat h, they managed to survive. The most well known Alchemists were the scientists Roger Bacon and Is aac Newton who not only were Alchemists, but also Rosicruc ians and probably Freemason. The Chinese Taoists were also Alchemists, and this practised probably originated from China. Taoism was originally a Goddess religion but because of patriarchal persecution it had to change itself into a patriarchal religion. This is shown in the Tao- Te-Ching, which is the Taoist 'Bible' that seems to be normal patriarchal re ligious text similar to Buddhism, yet through deeper study you find it is the teachings of a Goddess religion. To allow themselves to practice their Goddess teachings in secret the Taoist invented Alchemy, which like in Europe allo wed them to preserve and study ancient text, which were being systematically destroyed by the patriarc hal rulers. This practice wa s probably taken up by the Sufi, which was also a secret Goddess organization within Islamic countries and finally brought to Europe. So the picture suggests a line of progression with in Freemasonry. When a brother has proved to be trustworthy he is taught Alchemy as represented by the God Mercury. Then if he is proved worthy he is taught about the Triple Goddess of pr e-Christianity. Then if that is ac ceptable to him, he finally learns about the Great Mother of pre-histor ic times, where he will finally learn the true origins of Freemasonry. What is surprising is how clearly they show this in their symbolism. Though this symbolic picture can have another explanation. It suggests teachings; ‘from above’ which means that the teachings can come from the work of mediums or channellers. This is a theme we see in many other Mason symbolic pictures and this suggests that Mason are Gnostics. Gnoticism is learning from God or the Goddess directly, instead of learning about God from priests and scriptures, which means learning spiritual practises like medita tion or contemplation. This is similar to Buddhism and Hinduism where meditation is greatly encouraged. So it could be that Freemasonry is both a reli gion that has ancient secret knowledge but also practice mediation or uses mediums to also gain knowledge from the Goddess. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 The above illustration is another curious drawing. It shows two Masons together, the person sitting down is probably in charge and a worker is probably asking for instructions or discussing a problem. What is strange about this drawing is the sex of the people in the drawing is uncertain. They both have long hair and wearing dr esses but off course both men and women have worn long hair and dresses in the past. So in our patriarchal times we would assume they are both men, but are they? Why didn't the artist make them clearly look like men? In the background on the right hand side of the picture we see a statue of a nude woman, which the worker se ems to be pointing to, suggesting the importance of the Goddess statue. So are they are building a G oddess Temple? In the background we can see another person who is carrying a spear, probably this is a guar d but again the sex of the person is not very clear as he or she is wearing a knee length skirt. In the fo reground is a broken pillar. A pillar can be used as a phallic symbol; broken pillars come up more than once in Freemasonry images and are probably a symbol of the downfall of masculine power."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 So is this what this drawing is saying? That patriarchy has been destroyed, and women have taken control? As symbolised by the broken pillar and the fact they a building a Goddess Temple. I will discuss the symbol of the broken pillar later on, in this the book. This is a Mason drawing of The Seven Liberal Arts and Sciences. What we have to ask is why do women represent them? In an age when nearly all women were not given any form of education, it would make more sense to represent art a nd science as old men with beards, which was the usual custom in the past. These women are show also not as passive dolls but as teachers, perfor mers and professionals. Some are bare-breasted which would be unacceptable in real life in the time the drawing was created. So it suggests that these women were pre-Christian paga ns. It is known that women were academics in the Ancient world. One of the first things the Christia ns did when they took power was to murder academic women and ban women's education. This picture was drawn before female educati on was acceptable for most women. So the hidden message in this picture is that at one time in the an cient past academic women were experts in the arts and science. It is of interest that Samuel Butler in 1897 published a book called \"The Authoress of the Odyssey\". In which he made a strong case that Homer was a woman. Needless to say, such a claim was"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 totally ignored by establishment scholars. One Ancient Greek expert of the time Professor Benjamin Jowett admitted to dismissing this claim without even reading the book. This is a picture very much about the hidden Godd ess. Here we have a bust with a scroll covering its face. This is strongly suggesting that the identity of this person is a secret and has to be concealed. Although the face is hidden the neckline isn't. It is clear that it is the neckline of a woman as it shows the top of a fashionable dress. The hand that is holding the scroll comes out of a cloud, which as pointed out before is where in Greek mythology is where gods and goddesses live. So it suggests that not only is this hidden face the face of a woman but of a goddess as well. Next to the bust near to the top of the picture we have the symbol of Mercury. From him comes another long scroll going down to the top of a tree. As Mercury was associated with Alchemy it could be an Alchemy scroll. Also the title page is about the Secret Hemetick Science, which is Alchemy. Trees were held to be very sacred in Ancient Goddess re ligions. So this image seems to be suggesting goddess teachings being transmitted from heaven. Above this picture we have anot her smaller picture of three pe ople, two men and one woman. The sun god holds a staff of power and is sitting on a lion, in astrology Leo is the ruler of the sun, so this makes sense. The Moon Goddess is sitting on a l obster that comes from the sea because the moon controls the tides. The man on the left has a crown on his head and is holding the sun while the woman is holding the moon in her hand. Suggesting they are the Sun God and Moon Goddess, with again Mercury in the centre as the staff he holds is a Hermitic symbol. Three figures could also be the trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, suggesting that the Holy Spirit is a Goddess and the Jesus is Mercury as a messenger from God or the Great Mother. The woman is also holding an arrow, which is a bit of a puzzle. The most famous arrow in Greek mythology is the poison arrow that killed the invulnerable Achilles. In the Trojan War he not only killed"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Hector the greatest hero of Troy but Penthesilea the Queen of the Amazons. So is this arrow is about the death of a great patriarchal hero by a poison arrow in this vulnerable heel? If we use Achilles to represent patriarchy, this arrow would be another symbol about the downfall of patriarchy. The drawing above is supposed to be about the char ity work that Freemasons do. Again we have the paradox of a secret society that claimed it didn’t allow women in its ranks, yet at the same time it"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 represents itself as a woman. If it is suppose to be about charity work then it is a very patronising picture, because the women is on a pedestal with the poor l ooking up to her with some of them on their knees. The star above the woman suggests that perhaps she might be more than just a woman. This then would make more sense of the picture, as it would be more acceptable if the people in the picture were worshipping a Goddess. This is supported by the f act the woman is not smiling or has a charitable or caring look on her face. She has a stern or even arro gant look on her face suggesting that she expects to be worshipped. This picture could have another explanation, if th is picture is about Freemasonry the poor could be thanking the Masons for another reason besides just their charity work. Perhaps the poor and sick of the world have more to thank Freemasonry for the a few charitable handouts. Freemasons have been prominent in their history in supporting the people against tyrannical governments. It is well known that many of the leaders invol ved in the American War of Independence were Freemasons. What is less well known is that Freemas ons were involved in the English Civil War of the 17th century, the French Revolution and countless S outh American Revolutions. Is seems that Simon Bolivar the prominent South American revolutionary was a Freemason, as was Giuseppe Garibaldi who played a prominent role in uniting Italy in 1870. All these revolutions were a bout freeing the people from oppressive rulers, though it has to be admitted that many of the revolu tionary rulers turned out to be more oppressive than the rulers they replaced. But these revolutions have encouraged the ruling elite to adopt more democratic methods of gove rning countries. In the 20th century totalitarian governments like the Communists, the Italian Fascists and the German Nazis all attacked and destroyed Freemasonry organisations when they got into power. So what ev er you can say about Freemasonry they do seem to have the \"right\" sort of enemies. In the 1980s w ith Fascism making a comeback under the disguise of monetarism, and we also had Freemasonry being attacked by the press at this time. In the background we have the Royal Arch, representing the Great Mother. Another meaning of this picture could also suggest that the ancient religion of the Great Mother is for the common people as well as for the poor, sick and suffering. In fact, it is only by the return of the Great Mother as a dominant religion can these problems be solved, because pa triarchy has only brought to the world warfare, violence, injustice, poverty and suffering. In the Mason drawing on the left we see another Goddess holding up the mirror of truth. A pointed out before this is a reference to ancient Mystery School saying; “Know thyself”. This Goddess is naked so clearly she is a pre-Christian pagan Goddess. She is coming out of a well, which is another vagina symbol, and water is also associated with the feminine. She has a feminine sun above her, as we can see with the triangle within it so it means she like the Statue of Liberty is a Sun Goddess. At the base of the well we can see all the usual Freemasonry tools and symbols. Showing their close connection to Goddess worship."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 Chapter Five THE MATRIARCHAL AGE The story of the Bavarian Illuminati is very we ll known in conspiracy theory literature. Adam Weishaupt a young Freemason in the 18th century started a organisation called the Illuminati. The purpose of this organisation was to create a utopian so ciety unshackled by author itarian strictures. He was also interested in the occult and the Greek mystery religions, and he recruited the members of the Illuminati from the Freemasons. But in time his intentions were betrayed to the authorities and the Bavarian government suppressed his organisation. Adam Weishaupt then seem to have disappeared from history at this point, along with his organisation. Though conspiracy theories claim that the Illuminati survived and are now ruling the world. Though what is the foundation for this belief I don't know. Now this is another paradox about Freemasonry. Although it supposes to have originated as a workingman's Mason guilds it is very much an organisation of the establishment. Most of its members are professional people like businessmen, civil servants, politicians, policemen and titled people like Dukes, Earls and even Kings. So what are people like this who are pillars of the establishment, doing getting involved in a organisation that promotes revolution? It is no wonder that such paradoxical behaviour worry the conspiracy theorists, whom be lieve Freemasons have a hidden agenda. As pointed out Adam Weishaupt was interested the Greek mystery religions and also wanted to create a utopian society and overthrow the authoritarian governments of his time. So where did these ideas come from? Today we know very little about the Mysteries of the ancient Goddess religions. The reason for this was that the Christians and later the Moslems went out of there way to destroy ancient knowledge. It was for this reason that the famous libra ry of Alexander was burnt down. Not only did this happen in Europe but in China as well, where Chines e Emperors also destroyed all Ancient knowledge at about the same time. It also happene d later in South America where all the scrolls of the South American civilisations were destroyed by the invading conquistadors. Even in remote places like Easter Island the missionaries destroyed all its ancient writings. So what is it about ancient knowledge that was so dangerous that patria rchal religions had to destroy it? A clue can be seen in the Tao-Te-Ching where it talks about an age in the past where life was far better for all people. Hesiod a 8th century BC Greek poet also wrote about the Golden age, in which he says. - \"they lived like gods, free from worry and fatigue, old age did not afflict them, they rejoiced in continual festivity... All the blessing of the world were theirs.. The fru itful earth gave forth its treasures unbidden.\" The Golden age would probably be before humans began to use agriculture. Now there is some evidence that people then lived better lives. Modern nutritionists are coming to the conclusion that human beings are healthier on what is called, \"the Stone-Age diet\". This is because this is what our bodies have been used to over millions of years of e volution. Then came agriculture, which gave us a far greater supply of food, but it also brought about a chan ge in our diet that brought about diseases caused by dietary deficiencies. The same is true with th e modern Western diet today; we are now eating foods like margarine, refined flour and sugar that are comple tely new to our bodies. Many dieticians now are blaming the increase of cancers and heart disease and strokes on our modern diet. In Australia there is a real concern about the prev alence of heat disease, cancers and diabetes in the Aboriginal population and people were blaming our m odern Western diet. To find out if this was true some scientists persuaded some older Aboriginal, with these diseases, who still remembered the old ways, to go back into the bush and live like their ancestors. Within just six months their health greatly improved and some were cured of heat disease, diabetes and even cancer. Also it seems we didn't really benefit from agriculture in the way we should. Also with the increasing food supply the human population also starte d to increase, which was all right while they had good harvests. Then suddenly when where there was famine, the population was too large to find food for everyone to eat and there was mass starvation. Hesiod also writes about the following the Silver age. After the Golden Age came the Silver Age, during which lived a race of feeble and inept men who obeyed their mothers all their lives."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 Clearly he is talking about the Neolithic age when agriculture was first used and suggests that women ruled this age. Clearly Hesiod had contem pt for these men who were dominated by women. Then there was the Bronze age which he says.- The men of the Bronze Age were robust as ash tr ees and delighted only in oaths and warlike exploits. 'Their pitiless hearts were as hard as steel, their might was untameable, their arms invincible. We now see the rise of the warrior who ruthle ssly conquered other coun tries. After the Bronze Age Hesiod talks about a Heroic age, which declines to the Iron Age, which is the age, that Hesiod, lived which he says is a period of misery and crime. When men respect neither their vows, nor justice, nor virtue. We even have a Golden Age Legend in the Bible in the story of the Garden of Eden that probably came from Mesopotamia. Though the story was rewritten to blame women for the fall from grace and claim it happened as a punishment from God for disobe ying him. Hinduism also has a Golden Age myth similar to the Greeks where they write about an eterna l cycle of Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron ages. They claim that when our present Iron Age finishes, then a new Golden Age will dawn. Archaeologists have discovered the Ancient Greece was once a fertile country. Goddess religions of the past worshipped tree and held them in high regard. Then when it became patriarchal the trees were cut down and the soil quickly eroded, destroying much of its fertile ground. The same is true of North Africa and the Middle East. The trees that the ancien t Goddess religions held to be sacred were cut down, quickly turning the area into desert. Then what happened when the patriarchs took full control is well docum ented with continuous wars and conquest and the oppressi on of the people by armed warriors and solders. There is Archaeological proof that the Golden, silver, and iron ages did in fact exist. It is just that the academic world doesn't want to acknowledge it. On Thursday 31 January 2002 at 9.00pm in Britai n, BBC Two broadcasted the scientific TV program Horizon. Called, \"The Lost Pyramids of Caral\", the subject matter was archaeology http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/caral.shtml Now to anyone who didn't have an interest in science this program passe d by unnoticed. Yet what this program was about is a very big shift in the unde rstanding of our past and the true nature of human beings. To the degree that historians in the future w ill have to re-write history and sociologists will have to rethink all their theories about human nature. In fact what was discovered could bring about a colossal social, religious and political change in our future . Once the information about what was discovered fillers down to ordinary people. In most books about our ancestors in the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages, they portray them as very brutal and violence people. It also seems that the further you go back in time the more violence and savage people seem to be. For this reason it was assumed that people who lived in prehistoric times were even more barbaric than the people in historic times. This has been the prevailing view by most archaeologists, anthropologist and pala eontologists up until very recently. Now most people assume academic theories are irrelevant to their normal daily lives, but the belief that we descended from savage barbarians effect s us all. Because it assumes we are all deep down just violent brutes in modern clothing, and have to be kept in line through strict laws, moral codes and brutal punishment. This belief influe nces the nature of our religions, political systems and laws. It also has an unconscious effect on the way we treat others, be cause if we are to believe that the true nature of humans is barbaric. Then we learn to fear other pe ople and assume the worst in them. Creating a vicious cycle of fear and hatred for other people. This belief is not much different from the Christian belief that all people are born into sin. The implication of this belief that people can only be saved by obeying the very strict rules and moral code of the Christian religion. When scientists replaced priest s as the \"wise men\" of our society all they done was to continue this belief in another form. In that we are no longer born into sin but we are given instead the equal negative belief that deep down we are all savage brutes. This belief was spelt out on this Horizon progra m by Prof. C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky of Harvard University, who said- I frankly find it difficult to conceive of the emerge nce of urbanisation complexity civilisation in the absence of degrees of conflict, or the presence of, warfare ."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 In other words he was saying it is natural for hum an beings to live in conflict, and he couldn't imagine any civilisation that didn't generate violence and war. Dr Tom Pozorski of the University of Texa s-Pan American and his wife Sheila who had previously discovered what was then thought to be th e oldest city in South America found proof of this belief. In the Casma Valley they had discovered one of the largest pyramids in the world, in fact it was so large that previous explorers had assumed it was just a hill. Wood on the site was carbon dated to 1500 BC and this at the time it made it the oldest city in the America. In the excavation they discovered carvings of warriors who were killin g and mutilating their victims. To quote, Jonathan Haas of Field Museum, Chicago- Heads have blood flowing from their eyes and blood flowing from their mouths and then you have body parts so you'll have just the leg and you'll have a torso or you'll have feet and you'll have crossed hands . So this find seems to confirm everything archaeolo gists believed about the early civilisations. That warlords who ruled by fear, created the first cities as fortresses against conquest by other warlords. This theory seemed to be validated until Dr Ruth Shady of the University of San Marcos, Lima, was to make a discovery that was to turn everything archaeolog ists believed about early civilisations, on its head. Like Tom Pozorski she began to dig around what wa s thought to be hills in a place called Caral in Peru only to discover they were pyramids. As she and her team began to excavate the site she was puzzled the fact that there was no pottery on the s ite, (pottery is nearly always found in ancient civilisations) and finding only stone tools. That suggested this site was so ancient that it existed before the invention of pottery and metal. This was confirmed when some bags made of reeds found on the site were carbon dated. They were date d to 2600 BC so Caral was nearly fi ve thousand years old making it as nearly as old as the first civilisation in Egypt, an d was a thousand years older than any other civilisation in South America. This was to cause a sensation in the archaeological world and archaeologists from North America came to visit the site. Jonathan Haas, \"the world's leading expert on the warfare theory\" began to search around for evidence of warfare. To his surprise he couldn't find any fortifications or any means the city could have defended itself. He began to look further afield to look for battlements in the hills around Caral and then in mountain passes where invading armies would ha ve to travel though, but came up with nothing. Meanwhile Ruth Shady couldn't find any weapons of wa r or any carvings of violence in her excavations; so all this lack of evidence was undermining the warf are theory. To the degree Jonathan Haas had to admit- You seemed to really have the beginnings of that co mplex society and I'm able to look at it right at the start and I look for the conflict and I look for the warfare, I look for the armies and the fortifications and they're not there. They should be here and they' re not and you have to change your whole mind-set about the role of warfare in these societies and so it's demolishing our warfare hypothesis. The warfare hypothesis just doesn't work . It seems that archaeologists are now accepting that it was irrigation and not warfare is what started the first civilisations. Another realisation about Caral is that what was tr ue of this civilisation was also true for nearly the whole of South Ameri ca at the time. Trading goods were found from the Amazon jungle at the other side of the Andes Mountains as well as from the coast. The picture that emerged was that Caral was the centre of a vast trading network. So if the people of Caral felt so safe that they didn't bother to look for ways to defend themselves, the same must of been true for most of South America at that time. Because in no way was Caral just an isolated city cut off from the rest of the world. It suggests that Caral lived in an age where warfare was completely unknown. The ev idence is that the first civilisations in South America lived in peace for about a thousand years before we had warfa re, violence, torture and human sacrifice. The cosy picture painted by the Horizon program of unbiased scientists looking for the truth and finally finding it in the excavation of Caral is basically false. The archaeologists who strongly believed in the warfare theory and then were willing to admit they where wrong in the face of the evidence, or lack of evidence, in Caral, need to be congratulated. Yet this has not been the case for most archaeologists in the past. The truth is that the whole archaeological world for a period of 50 years has had to be dragged kicking and screaming into accepting the evidence, th at the first civilisations live in a world where"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 warfare was unknown. It was not just the evidence from Caral that made them d itch the warfare theory but evidence coming from Neolithic, Copper and Bronze ag e sites in Europe, the Middle East and China. What happened in Caral at the beginning of the 21st century also happen 40 years previously in the 1950s and 60s in a place called Catal Höyük in Tu rkey. Unfortunately the way archaeologists reacted to this excavation was very different. An archaeol ogist called James Mellaart found in this location, the oldest city ever discovered, going back 9,000 years. Making it far older than the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian civilisations. Again the archaeologists coul dn't find any evidence of fortifications or weapons of war. Nor any paintings or carvings showing images of violence, or for that matter any form of centralised government. What was found instead were feminine images of childbirth, Goddesses and animal life. This city was unlike anything discovered since. In that it had few streets, and most houses were built so close together that the only access was through the roof. This then means that people who lived in the city could only gain access to their homes by walking over the roofs of other people's houses. This was to greatly puzzle archaeologists. Because they began to wonder way such a system didn't cause conflict between neighbours. It su ggested their was a very high degr ee of tolerance and good will between people to allow this form of housing to exist for thousands of years. It is impossible to understand Catal Höyük while we think in terms of a civilisation that had masculine values. Unfortunately what is not being considered is the possibility of civilisations those values were feminine. In later civilisations we see the masculine values of war, power and status glorified in images and writings. In Catal Höyük we see images of the feminine values of childbirth, fertility being represented. So it suggests that women were the dominant sex in this community as it is their values that are represented and strongly influence the nature of the civilisation. As it is women's superior social skills of co-operation and communication that allows the city to function. So disturbing was these findings that the whole site was closed down for thirty years by the Turkish Government. James Mellaart was criticised by many archaeologists for claiming that the people of Catal Höyük worshipped Goddesses. One of the most vocal critics was another archaeologist Ian Hodder. So it wasn't a surprise to find that when the excavations were reopened in the 1990s, it was the sceptic Ian Hodder who was put in charge. In the thirty years the excavation was closed down, the academic world kept quiet about the discoveries made at Cata l Höyük. Though there was one archaeologist Marija Gimbutas w ho broke ranks and began to tell th e world about implication of the findings. Not only of Catal Höyük but other Neolithic sites in Southern and Eastern Europe. She wrote about a peaceful world in ancient Europe that wors hipped the Great Mother that was ended by violent Indo-European tribes that came from the North and invaded these peaceful civilisations. Marija Gimbutas wrote books about the Neolithic excavations in Malta, Crete, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldavia and Ukraine, all these finds show ed a world without war a nd violence and where the people worshipped the ancient Great Mother. It seems that when a society worship feminine deities, war and violence were unknown. But when societies worship male gods or both male and female deities then violence becomes commonplace. She was criticised a nd condemned by her colleges and it was claimed her work unscientific because it went against the fashionable warfare theories of the time. No other archaeologists at the time would support what she cl aimed, and she was dismisse d as just a strident Feminist maverick of no importance. Then similar finds began to be written about in the in Indus Valley Civilisation in Pakistan. (Although it was first discovered in the 1920s) Recentl y archaeologist have found its beginning goes back as 7,000 years making it again one of the oldest civilisations discovered. And again archaeologists couldn't find evidence of fortifications, violence and warfare, and it was a civilisation that worshipped horned Mother Goddesses. It was also claimed this civilisation was ended by a violence invasion from Aryan people from the North. Though Indian scholars are now disputing his. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 Chapter Six REVOLUTION AND COUN TER REVOLUTION The first excavations of Neolithic sites started back in the 1940s. So why did it take over 50 years for archaeology to accept the evidence of an age in the past where warfare didn't exist? Controversies like this have happened before in sc ience, new evidence and theories ca n take a long time to be accepted if they go against existing theories. The problem is that knowledge of a Golden Age of peace ruled by a Mother Goddess doesn't only just come from archaeol ogy. They also come from myths and legends all over the world. What is clear there is a campaign to suppress and destroy all evidence about this Golden Age has been going on for thousands of years. The attack on Marija Gimbutas theories is only latest chapter in this crusade. At Catal Höyük there are now Feminists and Goddess groups who are attempting to keep the archaeologists on the site honest. So when they attempts to dismiss evidence of a Mother Goddess culture out of hand they find passionate and articulate Feminists who are willing to contradict them. An example of this is a posting I found on the Internet in a Yahoo E-Group called Goddesssites. Dear Diana, That's great you enjoyed the site, it's so beautiful, and holds so much important history (herstory?) It's good they didn't make negative comments about th e Goddess, I wouldn't really expect that. But did they mention the Goddess at all? The problem for me with the visitor's center was the ABSENCE of the Goddess, and the absence of what I would call \"Goddess consciousness.\" Mellaart and other early archaeologists were congruent with the material they dug, in the sense that they were able to use language that explicated what they we re looking at (peaceful, fertile , nurturing, egalitarian, spiritual, artistic, and so on) while the more recent archaeologi sts seem to shy away from anything remotely connected with \"matriarchal\" theories. By the way, matriarchal actually means \"beginning with the mother,\" which makes it technically quite a good te rm for describing matrilineal, peaceful, mother- centered agricultural peoples of the Neolithic, alt hough perhaps the term \"matristic\" used by Marija Gimbutas is more appropriate for our time. At the visitor's center there are two murals displayed--two versions of the same one--which happens to be the only wall painting from the site that was predominantly male. All the others are female -central and mostly Mother Goddesses and Double Goddesses. Interesting choice to repr esent the site, then, don't you think? In the display case showing the reproduction of the beautiful ivory-handl ed flint dagger, the artifacts are described as having to do with \"hunting and war.\" This is a travesty, since the piece comes from the Neolithic and there is absolutely no evidence of any kind for war or viol ence. As I have written in an article recently, the knife is much more likely to fall into the category of kn ives that belong to mi dwives--for cutting the umbilical cord at birth. These knives were still used b shaman women in Siberia in the 20th century. Fortunately the museum in Ankara still has integrity and shows the finds from Catal Höyük as belonging to the ancient Mother Goddess cultures that are found all over Anatolia. It 's too bad the team at Catal Höyük doesn't feel obliged to keep in step with local Turkish sc holars and the way they see Anatolian history (and prehistory). I'm not trying to pick an argument, but I was really very upset when I went there. It was a place I had looked forward to visiting for such a long time--two decades at leas t--and it seemed criminal to me that no one seems to be monitoring what in terpretations these \"new archaeology\" types come up with. There is a culture war happening right now--a concerted effort to block and erase certain approaches to ancient scholarship--and I believe this is quite political and dangerous for scholars of women's studies. Thanks for listening--Vicki Noble (Vicki Noble is also a well known authoress) So what is the problem? Why was arguably the mo st important archaeologi cal sites discovered in the 20th century so quickly discarded? The reas on was probably because had what was discovered in Catal Höyük and other Neolithic sites became co mmon knowledge; it would become a threat to the stability of every government on Earth."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 When Dr Ruth Shady began to make known her fi ndings at Caral the local people were proud that the earliest civilisation found in America was in Peru, but they were also very puzzled. The question that she is frequently asked is: \"Why did our ancestors have the capacity to build such an important city, and we live so poorly and don't have the ability to do similar things?\" The only answer she is able to give is: \"the society was organised with a population that wo rked to do things collectively for the collective good.\" http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0103/p11s1-woam.html Though she didn't go on to point out that whereas today everyone works for the benefit of the ruling elite, who keep the wealth of the country in their own hands. The Peruvian government is now feeling the politi cal ramifications of these finds. Already they have cut her funding making it very difficult to continue her excavation or preserve what she has already discovered. Universities in USA have offered to fund the site, but th eir condition is that they themselves will take over the excavation. So it seems there ar e political moves to sack Dr Ruth Shady and put someone in charge that will toe the political line. Which could mean censorship of what is being discovered. So it seems ancient discoveries are very political , if it became common knowledge that thousands of years ago people lived in peace and equality. Then people worldwide will begin to ask the same questions that the Peruvian peasants are asking today. This is turn could create new political and religious movements that will challenge our present ruling elite. Because if in the past we lived in a world of peace and equality then why can't we do the same today? This is why Neolithic archaeology is very political; as it is questioning the way our world has been ruled for the last five thousand years. The history we are taught at school shows a sl ow progression from time when we were brutal cavemen to even more brutal early civilisations to the democratic governments of today. History tells us we are today more advanced and free then in any time in history. As Harold Macmillian the British Prime Minister of the 1950s, once said, \"you never had it so good\". The problem is that if this wasn't true and there was a time in the past when people lived w ithout wars, conflict, laws and poverty. This would cause great problems for the establishment. Because many people will ask \"why can't we have this today?\" Government would then be under greater pre ssure to give the people more freedom, provide for a more caring society and eliminate warfare. This would create a worldwide revolution that world create more problems for the Status Quo than the Communi st revolutions. Governments today can get away with an unequal society and limiting the freedom of the people by claiming that because of \"human nature\" a true caring, equal and free society is impossible. If there was proof in the past that this was possible and people were able to live in caring and free societies. The power of the ruling elite would be greatly undermined. Now Freemasonry is supposed to be a secret soci ety but some modern Masons claim that all the secrets of Freemasonry have been revealed to the public. What if this is not true and the Freemasons did have access to ancient scrolls that where saved when Ancient Libraries of the Roman Empire were destroyed? After all it would make sense that scholars of that time would try their best to save what scrolls they could and keep the knowledge secret. Pe rhaps this is why secret societies like Freemasonry came into being. If Freemasons then did have this knowledge then it would make sense of the behaviour of Adam Weishaupt, George Washington and ot her revolutionaries who were al so Freemasons. The strongest argument against creating a utopia where all people are free and equal is the belief that men are basically aggressive, greedy and selfish. If we accept this then it makes equality impossible because some men will want more than ot hers and fight them for it. Also because men are so aggressive law and punishment ha ve to be created to keep men in or der. This is true of men but is it also true of women? If Freemasons do have access to knowledge of what happened in the last Golden age many of them may be plotting to bring a Golden age back into ex istence. They first tried to do this by bringing a free and equal society for men, through the English Ci vil War and the American and French revolutions. When the Roundheads defeated the Royalist troops in the English Civil War female emancipation was discussed as a possibility, for awhile, but radical ideas like this was quickly squashed when Cromwell took over as a dictator. Freemasons then may have realised that only women could create a true free and equal society, but such ideas were too far ahead of their time. So they may have been working hard behind the scenes to bring about the emancipation of women ever since."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 44 [George Washington is his Freemasonry regalia with the Royal Arch in the background.] "},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 45 Although Feminists do claim that it has been a hard fight to gain equality in the 20th century. In historic terms the speed with which they have achieved it has been remarkable. It seems that when a number of Suffragettes or Feminists ha ve gone on to the streets to demons trate for their rights. Then male dominated legislative Chambers have been quick to pa ss laws to give them what they wanted. Though it has to be admitted, that in Britain before the Firs t World War women Suffragettes under the leadership of Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Sylvia and Christab el were arrested because of violent protest and many went on hunger strike in prison. The Suffragette s went as far as planting bombs in Churches and setting fire to public buildings and homes of rich a nd powerful people, to get the vote. One Suffragette, Emily Davison, even died for her cause by throwing herself under the King's racehorse at a race meeting, toppling both horse and rider. This was the exception and women didn't have to use violent tactic like this in other Western countries throughout the world. In Britain the rise of Margaret Thatcher to become Prime Minister was also extraordinary. Where in the Conservative leadership elections she moved fro m a rank outsider to party leader in a very short time. And then she won the next election and was voted into power and the first female British Prime Minister. In the USA if we compared the struggle and violence associated with the black civil rights movement and the struggle women have had to achieve equality. Women it seems have achieved far more with far less effort. Though this cannot be said to be true in ma ny other countries where Freemasonry has not become so powerful. Does this mean that Freemasons are working be hind the scenes for women's power and are ready to help them when they demand more power? It could be true of some Masons in positions of power, but again it would be doubtful if all Mas ons feel the same way, as some do show themselves to be very conservative in nature. For this to happen it means that a secret Goddess organisation has to be still in control of Freemasonry. It is also very doubtful if the Freemasons themselv es are united because in their history they have been both anti-establishment and pro-establishment in their aims. The code of the Freemasons is about tolerance, freedom and equality for all men. Yet at the same time we find many Kings, Princes and very wealthy people are Grand Masters. During the Amer ican war of independence, the main organisers on the rebel side were Freemasons. Yet many Americans who remained loyal to Britain were also Freemasons, this was also true of many of the British officers who fought against the rebels. The fact that there were Freemasons on both sides of the conflict may explain a military mystery. The most decisive action in the War Of Independence was the defeat of the British army at Yorktown. The American army was greatly he lped by a French fleet under the command of Rear-Admiral Comte de Grasse who blockaded the British army from the sea. The British send a fleet in to relieve the blockade but made a whole series of incompetent mistakes in the naval battle of Chesapeake Bay. They caught the French fleet by surprise and still at anchor. Yet they held back and waited for the French to prepare themselves and sail out to fight the British. The British fleet still had the advantage of being on the windward side but failed completely to capitalise on this. Only the ships in vanguard of the British fleet got to see any action and when they were badly mauled the British fleet back off and sail away, leaving the British army they suppose to be helping to their fate. Which is the behaviour very unlike the British navy of the time. When the American War Of Independence was over Comte de Grasse sailed to the Caribbean and capture British Possessions there. He then met a nother British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir George Rodney and was severely beaten. The Britis h captured seven French ships including Comte de Grasse’s 130-gun flagship. Which begs the question; why was the British navy so incompetent at the battle of Chesapeake Bay yet was able to defeat the same French fleet in the Caribbean? I have yet to read anything by any naval historian that can give a sensible explanation of this, except to say the British were very badly led at the battle of Chesapeake bay. But was it bad leadership or was it the work of the Freemason botherhood? In 1775 American Masons allowed Negroes into their lodges, then later on these black brothers formed the breakaway Prince Hall Freemasonry. In complete contrast with this, years later another breakaway Mason group formed the Ku Klux Klan afte r the American civil war. So Freemasons has had within its ranks extreme racists and anti-racists. Its whole history of has been of infighting, of lodges breaking away from each other, and of people creating their own versions of Freemasonry. Masons have shown themselves be as diverse in their attitudes a nd beliefs as the general population. Within the rank"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 and file of Freemasonry many of the members probabl y treat it just as a social club. This point was clearly made by the famous satirist Hogarth in the following picture: In this picture Hogath who himself was a Freema son, was clearly attacking Masons who regarded Freemasonry as just a men's drinking club, and givi ng the brotherhood a bad name through their rowdy and anti-social behaviour. Like wise today Freemasonry is strongly attacked because many of its members use Freemasonry to make useful contacts in business and politics. There has been even claims that Freemasonry has encouraged corruption because many members who are policemen, judges, businessmen, politicians and civil servants are making secret d eals behind close doors. Also giving Freemasonry a very bad name. It is certainly as true today as in Hogath's time that many Freemasons still regard Freemasonry as little more than a gentlemen's club and nothing more."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 The above cartoon is another satire on Freemasonry. It is about a chambermaid who fell through the ceiling trying to eavesdrop on a Mason meeting. The origins of this story come from a paradox. As everyone knows all women are banned from Mason ceremonies but somehow from the earliest times there have been stories of women be ing part of Freemasonry. The earliest recorded case is of the Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger who it seems accidentally witne ssed a Freemasonry initiation. The story goes the family butler who was also the Tyler discovered her. So to keep her quiet about what she saw, she was initiated into Freemasonry. The problem is that this has happened more than once where women have been discovered within Freemasonry and similar stories have been told why they are there. Just before the French Revolution the French lodg es didn't bother to concoct a story like this and openly admitted that the Princesse de Lamballe was one of their leaders. Josephine de Beauharnals the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte was also a Freemason. In the late 19th century Annie Besant the Victorian social reformer and Theosophist leader become a 33-degree Freemason. As was Madame Blavatsky the founder of the Theosophist Society and the author and medium Alice Bailey. Both of whom wrote many books on secret esoteric knowledge. They claimed this knowledge come through mediumship, but if they are Freemasons and Freemasonry does have access to secret ancient writings going back thousands of years. Then it gives another way that both authoresses may of gain access to this knowledge. Perhaps they both had access to the secret knowledge of Freemasonry and may of given out parts of this knowledge, and adapted it in a way that would be accep table to people of the late 19th century and early 20th century. Certainly the Theosophy Society re-introduced to the Western World the concept of reincarnation, which has become an accepted f act in most New Age and Pagan groups today. Now if some Freemasons do worship a hidden Godde ss and there are females within Freemasonry in secret. It is possible to put two and two togeth er and wonder if some Freem asons do have priestesses in the organisation? This coul d make sense of the behaviour of another well-known Freemason called Gerald Gardner. Back in the nineteen fifties, a man called Gerald Gardner started Modern Witchcraft. He had a three-degree hierarchy in his form of Witchcraft the same as within Freemasonry. Many of his rituals are apparently similar to what you find Freemasonry and some Witches do know the secret hand signals that Freemasons use. Also there does seem to be a large number of Witches who are Freemasons. Witches"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 are completely open in the fact that they worshi p the Goddess and unlike the Masons allow both men and women in their Covens. (Though there are still toda y some Freemason groups who do now allow women in their ranks, and there are also exclusively Female Freemasonry organisations). Although Freemasonry does try to present a \"respectable\" image to the world, we can see on the left a Freemason image that is not respectable. This again demonstrates its Goddess roots as only Goddess religions view sexual intercourse as sacred a nd holy. The same is true of Gardnerian Witchcraft. They worship in the nude, new initiates are scourged in a ritualistic way and they have the Great Rite where the High Priestess and Priest publicly have sex together as a ritual act. While the men in the coven worship the High Priestess as a Goddess. Although this is shocking to many people today, this behaviour wasn't so unusual in Pagan times, when sex, flogging and nudi ty were all part of ancient Pagan rituals. So this would suggest that modern Witchcraft came from Freemasonry. Yet there is also a case for saying that perhaps Freemasonry come out of medieval Witchcraft. Painting of Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger in her Freemason regalia "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 Chapter Seven FREEMASONRY AND THE DEVIL This is a Drawing of Baphomet a Freemason and Knights Templar diety. It was the worship of Baphomet that was one of the reasons why the Roman Catholic Church destroyed the Knights Templar. To most people this would be a drawing of the Devil, but what is interesting about this picture is that this Devil has female breasts! Some Occult commentators will go as far as claiming that the Devil is a hermaphrodite, but will not admit that it might be female. This is not unusual and other pictures of the Devil in Medieval times also show feminine features, showing us the true nature of the Devil. So why do Freemasonry Symbolic drawing show the Devil as female? Many people even today still believe that Witches worshipped a Ch ristian God called the Devil. This belief came from the \"confessions\" by Witches made under tort ure. It must be remembered that Christians then accused all other religions and rival Christian sects of being \"Devil worshippers\". The confessions by Witches under torture would be very suspect, as they would only be confessing to what the torturers wanted them to say. More serious research suggests that the medieval Witches were worshipping a Goddess, which would make them a rival religion to Christianity. Dr Margaret Murray in her two books \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" and \"The God of the Witches\" has shown that Witchcraft was the remains of an Ancient pagan religion. She has been savagely attacked for having this view, but no one else has come up with a more creditable reason for the existence of Witchcraft. In the occult there is a truism that; \"As new religions replace older religions, the deities of the old religion become the devils of the new religion.\" This is because the priests of new religions in a effort to attract new followers attempt to discre dit the deities of established religi ons. This is true of Baal-Zebub a Philistia God who was known as the \"Lord Of Flies\" . He was later to become known Beelzebub \"The prince of devils\" in the Bible. So clearly he was on ce an important god that had to be discredited by the emerging Jewish faith, because he was probably t oo popular and represented serious competition to the Jewish god Jehovah. It seemed that this also ha ppened when ancient Goddess religions were replaced with patriarchal religions. The evil gods of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are called either the Devil, Satan or Lucifer. What is not so well know is that all these deities were once Goddesses of older religions. There is a mystery about the name of Egyptian Goddess Isis. All other ancient Egyptian deities like Ra, Horus or Nut are known by their Egyptian names but Isis is always referred to by only a Greek translation. A clue to this mystery is that the Egyp tian name of the Goddess Isis was called As Set. Now the problem with this, is that it was from the God Set or Seth comes the word Satan. The Goddess Isis in her original form was the Eg yptian Great Mother or \"Queen of heaven\". Where she ruled alone and was seen as the Creatrix. Then she had a son called Osiris, those name means in ancient Egyptian \"son of Isis\", or in Egyptian \"s on of As Set\", in time Osiris became Isis brother and then her husband. When he became her husband Isis ha d another son called Horus, though in his original"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 form he was lame and deformed because he was only born of the mother and was without a father. Horus also had a twin bother called Set or Sut, from which the word Satan comes from, he was the evil brother that opposed Horus and was responsible for murdering Osiris. In later versions of the story he cut up Osiris into fourteen pieces but then Osiris was brought back to life by Isis and became Horus. In others versions of this story Set was Osiris brother, and Osiris fathered Horus. Yet Set as it turned out was an older God than either Osiris or Horus, and he wa s once a benevolent God. Set in Egyptian also means \"Queen\" or \"Princess\" and Au Set means \"exceeding Queen\". So it seems that Set was once the Goddess Isis. It seems that Set or Sata was the original Egyptian Mother Goddess and Egypt was once known as the Land of Sata. Then Set became both male and female with the feminine version being As Set or Isis as in the Greek translation. The male Set was then known as a benevolent serpent god who would die and be reborn in the womb of the Mother Goddess, As Se t. Later on the male Set became a evil god and the god Osiris took his place. So a new story was created, in this version As Set or Isis would swallow Osiris whole and then he would be reborn from her as the God Ho rus. Then in later versions of the same story; it was male Set who murdered Osiris and cut him up into many pieces and it was the female Set or As Set who put him back together again. The religion of Isis later became very popular in Greece and the Roman Empire, which created a problem when Rome became Christian, because the Judeo-Christian devil was called Satan, which was the same name of a very popular Goddess Isis. So not wanting to cause trouble with the followers of Isis, the Egyptian name of Isis ha d to be censored in Europe. Another popular name for the Devil is Lucifer w ho was known as \"The Light bringer\". Now in Latin Lucifer means Morning Star and the Morning Star is Venus named af ter a Roman Goddess, who was originally a tribal pre-Roman Great Mother in ancient times. It many cultures planet Venus is named after Goddesses like Ishtar the Babylonian Goddess who was known in Re velation in the Bible as the \"Great Whore\" or the \"Mother Of Harlots\". Interestingly Jesus in Revelations calls himself \"The Bright Morning Star\" (chapter 22 verse 16), suggesting that he is also Lucifer. The Word Devil comes from the ancient Indo-European word Devi which means Goddess and is still used in India today to mean both Goddess and women. It is also from the word Devi we get the words divine and divinity. (It is not unusual to have feminine words degraded in this way. The word cunt is a swear word in our society. Yet it comes from the Goddess Cunti or Kunda and from this word comes the words kin, (family), kind and country). In the original medieval Tarot pack, the Devil card is shown as having female breasts and wide feminine hips. Only in later versions of the Tarot does the Devil become a male. This was also true of the Knights Templars whom were also accused of worshipping an Evil god called Baphomet. Yet pictures of this god show \"him\" to have female breasts. Some occults noticing this, claim that the Devil and Baphomet were hermaphrodites. Yet this is not really shown on the Devils card in Medieval Tarot cards. Note the fact that the devil seems to have female breasts wide hips and slim waist of a woman In the past many Goddesses became hermaphr odites and then later became male Gods. So hermaphrodite Deities"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 existed during the changeover from matriarchy to patriarchy. Interesting this is happening today in Christianity. At one time it was strict dogma that th e Christian God was a male Father God. Then in the 19th century Mary Baker Eddy the founder of Christia n Science, used the term \"Father and Mother God\" in her book Science and Health \". Then a hundred years later at the end of the 20th century other Christian sects in the age of political correctness have taken up this idea and claimed, \"God has no gender\". Though I think you would get an argument if you suggested that their God was now a hermaphrodite. In much the same way you would get an argument if you suggested that Christian Women Priests ar e Priestesses. Another common name for the Devil was \"Old Nick\" and this name surprisingly come from the St Nicholas the Christian version of Santa Claus or Father Christmas. In pre-Christia n times he was known as the Norse god Hold Nickar, but going back even further the name Hold, was also know as Hel, who was a Goddess. It was also from the Goddess Hel that we get the Christian word Hell, as she was a Goddess of the underworld. So this is anothe r case of a Goddess changing into a God. Another Norse god that became a Devil was the god Loki. Like the male Set and or Osiris and many other sacrificial gods like Orpheus, Dionysus, Bacchus, Mithras, Pan, Odin, Bader and the Gnositic Jesus he sacrificed himself to the Mother Goddess. In earlier versions of the stories of Loki he was a hermaphrodite god who was also a Mother. It seems that the gods who were originally Goddesses are the ones who become Devils in later patriarchal religions. The word Demon means to Christians an evil spirit. Yet it comes for the Greek word Daimon that means simply the soul or guardian angel. So again it was turned into something evil simply because it had Pagan origins. The Gnostic s have done a similar trick to J udaism. They called Jehovah the Demiurge who is a false God that has deceived mankind. So in effect, turning him into a sort of Devil. The fact that many ancient Goddesses were turned into gods and then made into evil gods means they must have been once very popular and importa nt to the common people. Political minded priests don't put a lot of effort in disc rediting deities through pr opaganda unless they see these Goddesses as a threat to their power. It is also a truism that; \"it is the winners that write history\". This means that the new patriarchal religions like Christianity and Islam came out on top and rewrote history to discredit the most prominent and important deities of the religions they fought against. So it is of interest that Freemasons have also been accused of being Devil worshippers by ex- members who have since rejected Masonry. This might be just sour grapes or there might be some truth in this. Albert Pike is quoted as saying Lucifer, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness! Lucifer, The Son of The Morning! Is it he who bears the light . .? Doubt it Not ! Helena Petrovna Blavatsky the founder of the Th eosophical Society and also a Freemason wrote in her Book The Secret Doctrine . The Celestial Virgin, which thus becomes the Mo ther of Gods and Devils at one and the same time; for she is the ever-loving beneficent Deity . She was to go on and write. but in antiquity and reality Lucifer or Luciferius is the name. Lucifer is divine and terrestial Light, 'the Holy Ghost' and 'Satan' at one and the same time.\" The author Alice Bailey also a Freemason was founder New Age organisation, Lucis Trust. Which she originally called the Lucifer Trust. Yet is it a problem that Freemasons are worshipping deities that Christians regard as evil? Only if you happen to be a born again Christian. If you think about it, it is an easy way to discredit anyone you don't agree with, is by condemning them as evil. Oppression, genocide, war and violence in general is justified through the concept of good and evil. The concept is one of the biggest con tricks ever invented. This can be illustrated by a story about an encounter between Lady Astor and Joseph Stalin. Before the Second World War Lady Astor was a member of a party of British MPs who visited the Sovi et Union and were made gu ests Stalin. Lady Astor being a very out spoken woman verbally attacked St alin for the millions of peasants that had died, because of his policies of the collectivisation of agri culture and forced industria lisation. He listened to her patiently and then explained that it was very unfortunately that all these people died, but it was needed if the Soviet Union was to become an industrial count ry and was able to efficiently feed itself in the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 future. He clearly didn't see anything wrong with what he was doing, and believed it was necessary to make the Soviet Union a m odern prosperous country. The point is that to many people Joseph Stalin wa s one of the most evil men in history. Yet he didn't see himself like this. He honestly saw himself as a good man who was attempting to do the best for his country. Likewise the same can be said of ev en worse tyrants like Hitler and Po-Pot the Cambodia dictator. Hitler felt justified in th e genocide of the Jews and Slavs because in his mind they were an evil and inferior race. This means that in his mind he was a good person, fighting what HE had decided was evil. The same is true of Po-Pot who slaughtered millions of his own countrymen and women who didn't share his ideal of a perfect society. What is clear is that all these men believed very strongly that, \"the ends justified the means\". So in their minds war, violence, torture and genocide were all acceptable in creating, what they believed was a better future for their countries. I remembered once reading about a prison gover nor who relating his long experiences dealing with prisoners explained the surprising fact, that most criminals see themselves as good people. It seems that criminals tend to blame society, the police or the system for their crimes, and to be fair, there is some justification for this. As the majority of criminals come from the poorest and least educated sections of society. This then means that if we divide the world up into good guys and bad guys. We find it is very much a matter of opinion about, who is who. For inst ance in the conflict in Northern Ireland the Roman Catholic assume it is the Protestant para-militaries and the police who are the bad guys. While the Protestants assume it is the IRA. So with both sides are claiming that the other side are the evil and they off coarse are the good guys, which maked peace talks between the two sides very difficult. The IRA and the Protestant terrorist groups were in a strange collusion, because they justified their existence and actions by the behaviour of the other side. As both si des can point to the atrocities done by the other side to give credence to their violent behaviour. This can keep a cycle of violence going in perpetually. This is true for every war ever fought. With both sides claiming that they are the good guys while the other side is off coarse evil. This was brought out in the open in the Xmas of 1914 during the First World War. The British and Germans in the trenches began singing Christmas carols with each other, and then calling out to each other over no-mans- land. In the end some soldiers came out trenches and began to talk face-to-face and even organising football matches against each other. Then British and German soldiers began to ask each other. - \"What are you fighting for?\" \"For freedom and my country,\" came the replied, \"what are you fighting for?\" \"We are also fighting for freedom and our country.\" Exchanges like this caused many of the soldiers to ask the obvious question. \"Why are we fighting each other?\" Unfortunately no one came up with a sensible an swer to this question. The incident greatly worried the politicians and military leaders on both side s as it threatened to turn the whole war into a farce. (Which is what war is, although it is a very tragic farce). In the e nd \"normality and sanity\" was restored and both sides went back to murdering each other. The problem this highlights is that war is easy if you believe the people you are fighting are bad or evil. Once you realise they are just human being like yourself, then this greatly undermines the moral justification for wanting to kill or harm other people, in wars. The result of condemning someone as evil is that it de-humanises him or her. Once it has been agreed that certain people are evil then it becomes acceptable to hurt, torture and kill them. For instance the justification of Europeans to massacre and steal the land of the native people in the Americas and Australia was that they were \"savages\" and \"heathens\". Which are just other de-humanising words like bad and evil. In the American expansion of to the west it is estimated that 5 million native Americans were killed which puts it up in the same league as the genocide committed by Hitler and Po-Pot. While in Australia the whole population of Aborigines on th e island of Tasmania were completely wiped out. They also did the same in the state of Victoria. In many action and adventure films, books and TV programmes the concept of good and evil comes across very strongly. A villain is established; who behaves in an appalling manner and this gives the hero the justification to commit violence and murder. Some commentators claim that these stories are just harmless fun. Yet as any advertising executiv e knows, people are greatly influenced by what"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 entertains them. So in the end it becomes just anot her way to indoctrinate peopl e, that hate and violence is perfectly justified. Even intelligent and academic people can be sedu ced by the concept of good and evil as in the case of the Christian author and academic C.S Lewis. He wrote a trilogy of Science Fiction books to explore religious themes. I read the first one, Out of the Silent Planet and I thought it was very good book but the second one Journey To Venus shocked and horrified me. In it, he had a hero and a villain travel to Venus, where they find a Garden of Eden complete with a Venusian Adam and Eve. (This was written before spacecraft flew to Vesus, to show what an inhospitable planet it is.) Both men then set about influencing this couple's beliefs. Initially, the villain was more succ essful, the Venusians preferred to listened to him than the hero. Eventually the hero became desperate, as he seems to be loosing the argument. His solution was to beat up the villain and finally after a long chase he bludgeoned him to death with a rock. The logic being that his actions was justified because the man was evil. C.S. Lewis even explains how the hero de-humanises the villain and thinks of him as no more than an animal. Yet it was an appalling message to give to the Venusians, if you can't win an argument, kill your opponent! C. S. Lewis was a respected academic. He wrote childre n's books, religious books and novels, which are still hugely popular. Yet it's clear that illusions about good a nd evil were able to blind even an intelligent man like him. So it means that the concept of evil is an easy way to de-humanise anyone you don't like or agree with. The Christians de-humanised the Witches by claiming they were evil Devil worshippers. This justified burning, hanging and tort uring millions of people accused of W itchcraft. The irony being was that the Witches were the ones being murdered and tortured and to add insult to injury they were accused of being evil, while the torturers and killers were o ff coarse \"good\" people. Christians also accused Jews of being evil long before Hitler done the same thing, and likewise practised genocide against them. So you see how easy it is, just accuse someone you don't like or agree with as evil and then it seems you are justified in murdering them. The concept of good and evil has been so ingraine d in our culture through centuries of Christian propaganda that when Gardner re-introduced Witchcraft , Witches had to publicly claim they were \"White Witches\". White Witches it seems were the goodies and Black Witches were the badies. Which if you think about it is a very racialist concept. I find it surp rising that someone hasn't reported Witchcraft to the race relationship board about this. Once you are able to see through Christian propaganda and conditioning then you realise that the concept of black and white Witchcraft is as stupid as the concept of black and white Christianity or Buddhism. Anybody studying Freemasonry is soon overwhelmed by the vast amount of symbolism. Symbolism is in the realm of occult groups (occult means \"hidden knowledge\") and in many ways it acts and looks like an occult organisation. Many well known occultist like Aleister Crowley, Arthur Waite and S.L. MacGregor Mathers where themselves Fr eemasons. Masons don't call themselves an occult group but some do admit to being a \"mystery school\". Now mystery schools are pre-Christian and are therefore the teachings of pagan re ligions. Which in itself is a mystery, because why did some pagan religions need to have mystery schools? Occultists claim that the mystery schools had powerful magical or spiritual knowledge that would be too dangerous if it was given to the general public. This is an elitist argument that doesn't have any foundation. Having b een a member of occult groups myself, I have found the \"power\" they possessed is more show than substan ce. Though as I have previously pointed out, these Mystery Schools may have had knowledge that was danger ous to the power of the existing ruling class. Pre-Christian Pagan religions worshipped both Gods and Goddesses, but it was mostly the Goddess Temples that had mystery schools. The reas on probably was because, mo st societies then had become patriarchal and Goddess Temples were co ming under increasing pressure to also become patriarchal in character. This would result in many of their Goddess beliefs and teachings becoming increasingly unacceptable to the patriarchal rulers. So to preserve them, mystery schools had to be formed and the followers taught in secret. When Ch ristianity was imposed on the whole of Europe by the Roman Empire, the pagan religions had to go unde rground. This would then be a possible reason for secret societies like Freemasonry and Rosicrucians comi ng into being. It would suggest that these secret organisations wanted to preserve ancient pagan religions. This then would make sense of the Freemasonry secret signs, handsha kes and code words. A secret underground Pagan religion would need"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 these forms of identification, to recognise each other in a time they were being oppressed, if they were to survive. This is hinted at by a well-respected Freemason of the nineteenth century called Albert Pike who wrote that in Freemasonry he found, \"the cardinal te net of the old primitive fait h, which underlie and are the foundation of all religions\". So what is the faith th at is the foundation of all religions? If we go back to Neolithic time we do find a worldwide religion that worships the Great Mother, which has been disparaged by modern scholars as a \"fertility cult\". In spite of the fact it has been found to exist in every culture in the world in ancient times. Freemasons themselves deny that they are a re ligion, and to prove this they allow anyone of another religion to become a Freemason. The problem with this is that although modern religions like Christianity and Islam are extremely intolerant of ot her religions, the ancient pre-Christian Pagans were not. As are modern Hindus which in reality is a Pa gan religion that has survived into modern times. Between many different ancient Pagan religions there was a free exchange of teachings, rituals and beliefs. So even in this, Freemas onry is behaving like a Pagan religion. Some people claim this cannot be true because Freemasons certainly back in the 18th and 19th centuries were stanch Christians, and to be fair pr obably the majority of them were. Yet how it might work is that the leaders of Freemasonry would feel out their members and discuss other religions other than Christianity. If they find members who are open-minded about other reli gions they might discuss this more fully. They may then start talking abou t ancient Pagan religions or Hinduism and see how they react. If the response is still positive then might go further and even suggest the possibility of having a Female Creatrix Goddess. So in this way they can find the members who would be interested in a Goddess religion. If at anytime they get a reaction ag ainst these ideas, the leaders can laugh it off and suggest it was only an academic discussion. So if Freemasonry is a Pagan religion, then its purpose would be to bring back Paganism as a world wide religion, as it used to be before Chris tianity and Islam became the major religions of the world. If this is true then Paganism may be more powerful within our modern world than we all imagine. At first glance Witchcraft and Freemasonry look li ke two very different organisations. The main one being is that up until recently Freemasonry has onl y allowed men in their ranks. While the word Witch is a feminine name and most of the people tortured and burnt alive in the Witch-hunts were women. Suggesting a female dominated organisati on. There cannot be any doubt that the Witch-hunts were successful in stamping out Witchcraft because nothing more is heard of them until modern times. So if Witchcraft was to surviv e it had to go underground and cam ouflage itself somehow. To form another organisation with women in it wouldn't have worked. The Witch hunters would of been on to them very quickly as it was normal in those days to exclude women from all organisations. So the only way would be to form a society that looked complete ly different from Witchcraft and would have to on the face of it, be a very patriarchal organisation. So a rule banning women would make it \"respectable\" in the eyes of the Witch hunters. It has to be remembered Witchcraft wasn't onl y an organisation of only the poor; many wealthy women and men were also accused of Witchcraft. Though, through their wealth and connections many escaped arrest. So perhaps Witchcraft was stamped out among the poor but survived among the rich who brought it back in a very disguised form, namely Freemas onry. It may be that in the past many people in Mason guilds were also Witches and may of escaped persecution through a sort of Trade Union solitary. This would attract more Witches into Mason guilds who then created their own breakaway organisation. When Freemasonry came out in the open in the 18th century it presented itself to be a Christian organisation although today anyone of any religion can join it. Yet its history before the 18th century is largely unknown even it seems to Freemasons themselv es. The question we have to ask is why is it unknown? In my research for this book I read a book called, \"The History Of Freemasonry\" by Albert Mackey who is a respected Freemason historian. In th is book he discusses all theories on the origins of Freemason. Like Freemasonry comes from the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucia ns, Druidism, Gnosticism or even the Romans, and he debunks all these theories. Then having done this, he doesn't tell us how or where Freemasonry originated, leaving it a mystery. So why do Freemasons even today conceal its origins? The answer could be that Freemasonry did originate from Witchcraft. Which would be shocking to people even in modern times, and give ammunition to people who attack Freemasonry. Yet Witchcraft"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 today is slowing becoming a more respectable religi on. Perhaps when it is judged to be respectable enough by the majority of the population, Freemasonry might then reveal its origins to the public. The illustration on the left is apparently Freemasons re-enacting the Knights Templar's worship of Baphomet. The image looks like a person with a Goat's mask and from the size of her breasts she is clearly a women. This drawing comes from the 18th or 19th century showing us that half naked women were worshipped in Freemasonry lodges. (The wings symbol represents spirit, which means she is a Goddess.) This picture is then a glimpse of the rituals and practises that Freemasonry keep secret. Though whether this goes on today is debatable because in the 19th century Freemasonry was 'reformed' and many ancient rituals were discarded. If this is the case and Freemasons got rid of such practises because they were too shocking, it suggests the reformers had lost contact with the real reason Freemasonry was started. Note also the gesture of her hands, with one hand pointing upwards and the other downwards. This is a hand gesture of many Freemason Goddesses, many whom are not dressed in a goat’s mask. The Horned Goddess is very ancient, as images of Horned Goddesses have been found in the excavation of the Indus Valley Civilization that goes back 7,000 years.   "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 Chapter Eight MASON TRACING BOARDS "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 The picture on the previous page is of a first degree Mason Tracing Board. On the floor we see usual Freemason symbols like the uncarved and carved st one. Which is all about self-development. Then we have two plumb bobs and square leaning agai nst a pillar pointing upwards. These all can be interpreted as phallic symbols. Then coming off the floor we have a ladder, which Masons tell us is Jacob's ladder from the Bible. At the base of the ladder we have the compass and square symbol lying on the spine of a book. We also have the circle and dot symbol, which it is claimed means sexual intercourse next to the Bible. So this is a bit provocative. The number of masculine symbols on the floor suggests that on the ground floor Freemasonry is very patriarcha l, but when we attempt to climb up Jacob's ladder we encounter the feminine. In the Bible story Jaco b's ladder had angels going up and down it. In this image we do have three women on the ladder but strangely these women do not have wings, as you would expect an angel to have in a symbolic drawing. They are also not climbing the ladder but sitting on it and seem to be welcoming the apprentice Mason to climb up on it. There are three of them, so it gives us a strong clue that they might be the triple Goddesse s again. Halfway up the ladder we see a key hanging from the ladder, probably suggesting the Goddesses are the key to understanding Freemasonry. The key is another popular Mason symbol and the old fashion key they used, looks a very much like the Ancient Egyptian Ankh, without the bar going through it. I have previously discussed the meaning of the Ankh. In the picture there are also three pillars. The pi llar on the right with the moon symbol above it is longer than the other pillars and is better carved than the other two. If we accept for this picture the feminine is the moon then it would suggest that the fe minine is more important than the masculine. In Freemasonry there is the symbol of the uncarved bloc k whom is a apprentice Mason. Then we have the carved block whom is a master Mason. The symbolis m of the carved and uncarved pillars suggests that the masculine is uncarved and the feminine is carved. Suggesting a man has to become feminine to be a master Mason. But it is far more complex than this. The ladders with the Goddesses on it are pointing towards the masculine sun instead of the feminine m oon. So it could mean it might be a feminine sun and masculine moon. As pointed out before there once used to be Sun Goddesses and moon gods. Though for first-degree initiates, such concepts may be too far ahead of them. This suggests that the concept of Moon Goddesses and Sun Gods is very patriarchal, and as the appren tice climbs the ladder he encounters the feminine and finds the role of Sun and Moon de ities have been reversed so we know have a Sun Goddess and Moon God. So what this can suggest is that for a woman Mason she has to go from the base of the feminine pillar to the top of the masculine pillar. While for a male Mason he is the uncarved stone at the masculine pillar but when he moves towards the feminine pillar he becomes carved or developed. So this picture suggests for a secret Female Mason to develop more spiritually she has to become more masculine and for a male Mason he has to become more feminine. Why this is so is very complex and can be explain in the book Gospel of the Goddess , written by Pamela Suffield and myself. The only other symbols in the image are that th e moon has seven stars around it. These are the seven moving bodies that can be seen with the naked ey e. In other words they are the planets, moon and sun that were used in astrology before the invention of the telescope and more planets were discovered. The base of the picture we have a W probably m eaning west while on top we have an E probably meaning East. So the candidate is encouraged to look to the east for wisdom. Which is of interest as the two major religions of the Far East are Hindui sm and Buddhism and both religions still worship Goddesses. As well as Taoism which lik e Freemasonry worships a hidden Goddess. At the top of the central pillar we have again the Eye Symbol, representing the Great Mother, which is commonplace on many Freemasonry Symbolic dr awings. The fact that the Great Mother is above the central pillar suggests that the apprentice Ma son has to learn the spiritu al lessons of both being masculine and feminine to reach the Great Mother. On the floor we have black and white square s, which are always present on the floors of Freemason lodges, or Churches built by Freemasons or even on the caps of British policeman. If we turn this shape at an angle we get a diamond shape, which we can see within the Compass and Square symbols, that as previously mentioned becomes the shape of the vagina. The three pillars can also represent the Kabbalah, which is a Jewish Occult system, though it probably originally comes from Ancient Egypt. In the hands of Judaism it has became very patriarchal in nature but we have returned it back to a matriarchal system in our Gospel Of The Goddess. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 The painting on the previous page is the Masoni c Tracing Board for the third degree initiation. Which is a bit of a downer as we see here a coffi n. This only makes sense in eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism, as it would be about the death of the ego. In the middle of the coffin we have a doorway, a doorway can also be seen as another vagina symbol. In much the same way that the Ancient peoples saw cave openings as sacred for the same re ason. Another explanation it that is about a doorway to a new world, and if you believe in life after death then off course it would be. People like spiritualists believe that we never die and we only step from one world to another. In pagan mythology Gods like Pluto were the gods of death or the underworld. But in more ancient times were death Goddesses like the Sumerian Goddess Ereshkigal. One of the most ancient writings ever discovere d was of the Sumerian story of the Goddess Inanna. She goes to visit her Sister the Goddess Er eshkigal who is the Goddess of the Netherworld. To do this she goes though a dance of the seven veils wher e she is stripped of her clothing, position and rank. Then completely naked she stands before Ereshkigal who insults her and condemn her to death. In some versions she is left to die on a meat hook and other versions she is placed in a coffin. So the coffin in this image could be the coffin of Inanna. Meanwhile without Inanna the world above is turned into a wasteland. In seems without Inanna the gods have taken over and were misma naging the upper world. Then Enki the god of wisdom comes down to the Neth erworld and rescues Inanna and restores her to her rightful place as Goddess and ruler of the upper world. And the world is saved. When Christianity was first introduced the Ce lts Mary Magdalene came for a while the Goddess of Death as shown on the next page. So ag ain we see the symbolism of a hidden Goddess. At her feet we can see a skull and she stands at the entrance of a cave representing the gateway to death. The idea being that we come from the Great Mother and return to her. This is why in ancient times they buried people on their side with their knees against their chest in a foetal position. We all come into this world as a foetal in the belly of our mo thers, so it was logical for the ancient we return that way. So the bodies are taken through a vagina shap ed cave entrance, because we were born through a vagina. Then the bodies are placed in Mother Earth. In ancient Egypt all corpses were buried with their heads facing west, when Christianity started in Egypt this was changed and all Christians buried their dead facing east. Around the coffin are the four compass points, with west at the head of the coffin. So this is a clear message that this is a pre-Christian pagan burial. Around the coffin there is a headstone a nd urn, the urn goes back to ancient Egyptian times. When the body was mummified the organs were taken out of the body and put into an urn near the body. It can also be an urn to hold the ashes of a burnt body. Today we accept cremation of bodies as normal but up until the being of the 20th century the Chri stian Church opposed it because pagans practised cremation. Also there are three pie ces of foliage from trees. The anci ent Goddess religions held trees to be sacred, and some early Christia ns became saints by cutting down sacred trees and groves. Inside the coffin we have other Goddess symbols, the number five . Five is the number of the Pentagram, which I will discuss later in the book. Five is also the number of balance as it is half way between ten and one. This is backed up by plumb bobs also in the coffin fo r plumb bobs to work you have to balance them in the middle. The only other thing of interest in the coffin is the skull and cross bones. In popular literature a black flag with a skull and cross bones on it is the flag of a pirate. In the initiation of a new Master Mason he is told that his degree, \"will make you a brother to pirates and corsairs\". A pirate is an outlaw or criminal, but he is also a rich outlaw. Only a rich person could buy and finance a pirate ship and for this reason many pirates in the past were funded by rich merchants. Of course this funding would be completely secret, so this gives an insight to the unknown past of the Freemasons. The skull and cross bones flag was also the battle flag of the Knight s Templar ships. When the Knights Templar was destroyed 1312 the Templar navy managed to escape, so did some of them turn pirates to survive? Freemasons became public in 1717 only after they were sure that Britain would never again become a Roman Catholic country. Which was still possible up until then , while the Stuart family could still claim the English throne. Since then their most determined enemy has been the Roman Catholic Church. In the 18th and 19th century Freemasonry wa s banned in Roman Catholic countries and some Freemasonry Catholics were even arrested and to rtured and hanged in Portugal and Spain.

But the French government became embarrassed when so many respected members of th e government were discovered to be Freemasons. For this reason the persecution of Freemasons in France was quietly dropped, but continued in other Roman Catholic countries. Pope Clement XII in 1738 forbade all Catholics to become Freemasons on threat of excommunication. Two years later, membersh ip of a lodge was punishable by death in the Papal States. Protestants have had no problems with Freemasonry, even to the extent that the Church of England has allowed Freemasons to condu ct rituals in their churches. Which is in itself a surprise. In one of symbols of Freemasonry there is a Christian Cross with entwined around it a snake, which has been put on a stained glass window of Norwich Cathedral. Now this should in theory be blasphemy to a Christian, because the snake was the creature who tempted Adam and Eve, and was Satan in disguise. So to have Satan embracing the Cross is an anti-Christian sym bol. The snake is an old Goddess symbol, and was seen to represent wisdom. Snake tubes have been found by archaeologists in ancient Goddess Temples, as well as carvings of Priestesses holding snakes in thei r hands, as seen at the end of the chapter. Also the symbol of the cross goes back to pre-Christian times and was used in ancient matriarchal religions. Probably both the cross and snake were phallic symbols. Although the cross is also claimed to be a modified Ankh symbol and it seems that early Chri stians in Egypt did use the Ankh as a Christian Symbol. "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 The statue on the previous page is of a priestess from the Minoan civilization on ancient Crete, note the apron, which is similar to that of Freemason's aprons. If we accept that the snake is a phallic symbol the fact that the Priestess holds on to the snakes and raises them in triumph shows her power over the masculine. What is also interesting about this statue is that she wears an apron similar to what Freemasons do. They claim they do this because this is what working Masons use. But perhaps there may be anot her explanation for this. Priests today wear long dresses because once all male priests used to dress up in drag to make themselves look like priestesses. This is because in ancient times it was only women who could be holy people. So when men started to become priests they had to make themselves look like holy women to be acceptable to the people. Even to the extent of wearing false breasts and cutting off their penises. So the apron may have been another tradition going back to the age when only holy people were women. What is also interesting is that she is bare breast. Perhaps in the past a women's breast were as sign of status and pride. It was only in the patriarchal age that there was a demand that women cover their breast, probably because of the status and power that women's breast once signified. If Freemasonry has found complete acceptance with Protestants, this does suggest that when it was still a completely secret society one of its pu rposes was to oppose Roman Catholicism and help the Protestant cause. In both Holland and England during th e sixteen century, both countries were threatened by Spanish conquest that wanted to restore the Roman Catholic faith to these countries. Both countries fought back with privately funded warships capt ained by people like Drake and Hawkins whom the Spanish claimed were pirates. So it does suggest th at many of these ships were financed and perhaps even manned by Freemasons, in an effort to curb Roman Catholic power. Perhaps for hundreds of years Freemasons were carrying on a secret war against Roman Catholic countries, a nd were financing pirates like Captain Morgan to attack Roman Catholic ships and colonies. The skull and cross bones have also a very ancient connection. In Catal Höyük and other Neolithic civilizations it was discovered that when people died they were left in the open for scavengers to eat the flesh and then some of the bones were buried in the floors of the house. Which raised a controversial point because it was found that only the bones of women were buried in the homes while the bones of men were thrown in a communal grave. It also has been suggested that Freemason financed the first English settlements in North America. The reason might be is that had they had not done so, the Roman Catholic Spanish might of taken over North America as well as South America. This might make sense of why Freemasonry later became so strong in the USA. "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 Chapter Nine THE PENTAGRAM The image above as is off course the Pentagram a very well know occult symbol. It is very old and was once known as the, \"Five pointed star of Is har\" an ancient Babylonian Goddess. The problem with the above drawing is that it is the wrong way around. In the occult traditions the upright Pentagram is a symbol of white magic while the inverted pentagram is a symbol of black magic. Some occultists have gone as far as drawing the face of the devil on the inverted Pentagram. With the downward point being his beard and the two upward points being his horns. Though on the image on the left the Occultist who drew it, has called it Lillith, wh ich is a name of a Mesopotamia n Goddess. She also appears in Judaism as the first wife of Adam, whom he reject s as she was too bossy. For this reason she became a female Devil within the Jewish religion. So what are Freemasons doing openly displaying a symbol of black magic? It certainly gives credence to its critics who claim they worship the Devil. If this is puzzling then it gets worse, other occult groups besides Freemasonry use the pentagram like Witchcraft. But we also find pentagrams on the flag of the USA and many other flags of both Communist and Moslem countries. Also the military command of the USA is in a building called the Pentagon, which is a five-sided building. Why this building was designed and built in this extraordinary manner is never explained, or even commented on. But it strongly points to the fact that the people who decided to have pentagrams on their flags and to build the Pentagon were either Freemasons or Pagans. Where this symbol comes from no one seems to know. When occultists are asked what this symbol means they say it is a symbol of man. With each point showing the head and two arms and two legs of a man. But other occultists disagree with this and say the Pentagram is the symbol of women and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 the Hexagram or six-pointed star is the symbol of man. The reasoning behind this is that a woman has five points, while a man, if you co unt his penis, has six points. In ancient symbolism the inverted triangle was seen as a symbol of the female sexual region, because it is the shape of her pubic hairs. Arch aeologists have found hundreds of these symbols in excavations of Neolithic and Palaeolithic sites, so the inverted triangle is a very ancient symbol that was once revered in religious rites. The Pentagram also has within it an inverted tria ngle, as shown in diagram above, while the rest of the Pentagram would be a symbol of the penis a nd testicles, as symbolised as an upward pointing arrow head. On the left is the traditional Pentagram and on the right I have drawn the vagina symbol with a thick line and the phallic symbol with a thin line. What is interesting is that it shows the wome n on top in this union, showing the women in the \"dominant position\", and therefore a symbol of Matriarchy. Some occultist claim the Pentagram with the one of the points pointing down is the Pentagram of evil. Now this would be the \"missionary position\" that patriarchal religions demand. This would then suggest that the Pentagram is telling us that patriarchal is evil. The Hexagram can also be interpreted in the same way. The Pentagram is also associated with the Rose which was known in Roman times as the Flower of Venus. The rose was also seen as the vagina with the red rose being a woman menstruating while a white rose was a symbol of the Virgin Goddess that later on becomes the Virgin Mary. So the Rosy Cross as used by the Rosicrucians is a phallic and vaginal symbol. If the Pentagram is so strongly associated with ancient Goddess religions then what are countries today doing with this symbol on their flags? Incl uding Moslem countries who suppress women's rights. Or why does the USA have its military command building as a Pentagon? Do they realise that this could be seen as a Goddess symbol? Perhaps they might. In the last century the statue of Liberty was built as the gateway to America. So why did they choose th e image of a giant woman, when all its rulers and establishment then was run by men? No one co mments on this fact but in 1989 dissenting Chinese students in Tiananmen Square built a replica of the statue and called it \"The Goddess of Freedom\" so it was clear to them what this statue represents. The Statue of Liberty was conceived, financed and built by Freemasons. They even had a Freemasonry ceremony when the statue was dedicat ed on October 28, 1886, by the then President of USA, Grover Cleveland. French Freemason Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi initiated this colossus. Whom he claimed, \"I caught a vision of a magnificent goddess holding aloft a torch in one hand and welcoming all visitors to the land of freedom and opportunity\". So clearly in his mind the statue was a Goddess. He also wanted to build a giant statue of the Goddess Isis in Egypt, but as Egypt was then, and now, a Moslem country, this wasn't a good idea and it fell th rough. The cost of making and installing this Statue Of Liberty was enormous. The French Freemas ons had to raise 3,500,000 French francs, while New York newspaper owner Joseph Pulitzer donated $100,000, which in the1870's was a lot of money.

Everyone knows about using a crystal ball for fortune telling but some mediums use a mirror to do the same thing. If this is so, then what we are seeing here is some form of séance. The medium has his back to us and is directly facing the mirror, so he is probably in a trance. The medium is pointing to symbols laid out on the table in front of him, so he could be answering questions about what these symbols mean. We can see a similar theme in the next drawing.

The fact that this is a king is interesting as very many members of royalty are Freemasons, but this could have another meaning as the crown is also used as another vagina representation as in the cross and crown symbol. In th is picture the Mason is being given instructions on what to draw by the Goddess above the clouds. Which suggest that, this how the symbols of Freemasonry came into being, through the work of mediums. Though we cannot also rule out the possibility of knowledge handed down fr om pre-Christian times, as well. On the bottom of this picture it states: The mysteries that are shown ar e only shown to a Mason known. So what are these mysteries? In the foreground we see a broken pillar symbolising the destruction of masculine power. Then we see an open doorway going into a long corridor this again is another obvious vagina/Goddess symbol. Above the doorway we see a Goddess seated on a cloud w ho seems to be giving instructions or teachings to the Mason. Seated next to the Goddess is in a lower position we see the Grim Reaper or Angel of Death symbolised by his scythe the traditional tool of The Grim Reaper. He is offering the Goddess an olive branch. During the patriarchal age war and violence has been the traditional method for men to settle arguments. So in this time the Grim Reaper has been very pr oductive. So the Grim Reaper could be representing patriarchy who opp ressed the Goddess on the Earth through violence. For him to now offer the Goddess an olive branch is suggesting he is surrendering to her. The Grim Reaper appears in other Freemasonry symbolism like the Mason symbol of \"weep\" which I will discuss later on. On the other side of the Goddess here is also another Angel blowing a horn. In Christian symbolism this probably is symbolising the archangel Michael sounding the last trumpet. Though similar stories are told in Persian, Norse, Hindu and Greek mythology. Which is about the last judgement and the end of the world, which many people have pred icted will happen about the year 2,000, which didn't happen. In this symbolic drawing the last trumpet is clearly not about the end of the world but it could be the end of patriarchy and the return of the Goddess. In the background we see a tunnel again another vagina/Goddess symbol. Outside the tunnel are men in contemporary dress, when the drawing was created. One man seems to be welcoming the other men inside the tunnel. So it suggests they are Mas ons being welcomed into the realm of the Goddess. There are some more symbols in this picture like Astrology symbols, beehives and a pyramid in the background. Which I have already covered. These two Freemasonry and Rosicrucian images are of death and rebirth. Showing a couple joined as one (making love) on a crypt. The Tantra in Hinduism also has similar symbolism and has been accused of black magic for performing the sex-act in graveyards. This is a Goddess religion point-of- view where the sexual act and everything to do with giving birth is seen as being sacred. But Freemasonry also has more acceptable ima ges of death and re-birth called, \"The Royal Arch\"."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 The images on the last page represent another fa vourite Freemason symbol is what is called the royal arch, which is another vagina symbol. The pi cture shows a man walking out of one arch and into another. This could be a symbol of life and death. We come into the world through the vagina then when our bodies die we return to mother Earth, in a grave. In ancient times the bodies of people were placed in a foetal position or buried in caves to empathise the fact of us returning to the Great Mother. (Though off course this is not comple tely true today with caesarian birth and cremation.) The picture also shows the Mason seem to be entering a paradise when going through the last arch which, suggests that life after death, is a lot better than life on this Earth. We can see a similar theme on birth and death in the following Freemason symbolic painting. We can see clearly in this painting the oval shap e of the vagina, and in case we have any doubts about this, we can see above it a V shaped bush, re presenting the pubic hairs of a woman. Inside this shape we see the faint outline of a man, with a V shaped square over his heart. Suggesting that his heart is with the Goddess. At the bottom of the picture are th e skull and crossbones, which suggests death. This then again turns this symbolic picture into another birth and death image The oval shape and the man within it are drawn as a shadow, suggesting that the Goddess is hidden behind all the other more well-known Freemason symbols.

The above drawing is called \"Weep\" and is a popul ar symbolic picture. At first glance this pictures can look very sinister. We have a weepin g woman with the Angel of death behind her playing with her hair. Does it suggest that the Grim Reaper, as he is also known, wants to have some sport with her before he kills her? One explanation I have read from a Mason is that the Virgin as she is called is"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 weeping over the death of Hiram Abif. The open book re presents the memory of his death. The plant in her hand represents the sprig of cassia grew from th e place he was buried and this was how his body was discovered. The urn represents his ashes. While the figure of the Angel of death or Saturn represents Time because with patience and perseverance everything we be accomplished. If we accept there is a hidden Goddess in Freema sonry we come up with a different interpretation. The pillar is a phallic symbol; the fact that it is broken suggests that masculine power has been destroyed. And although the woman in the picture is crying it does suggest that it was she who pushed over and broke this pillar, because it is broken at the heig ht of her hands. So it seems to be about women destroying the power of men. She has in her hand a book, an olive branch and an urn. The book suggests knowledge; the olive branch suggests peace and reconc iliation while the urn suggests death, as it is were the ashes of dead people are put. But the urn, cup or grail are also Feminine symbols. Death is also represented in the figure standing behind the women who is the Grim Reaper or the Angel of Death. This is symbolised by his scythe and hourglass. Yet ag ain the hourglass is a Feminine symbol as it is women who have hourglass figures. He seems to consoling the crying woman and doing her hair. Which is a strange thing for a Grim Reaper to do. This book is probably is a symbol of modern times. In the past education was denied to women but in the 20th century women have been given the sa me rights as women for education. In our society knowledge is power so because women are better educated they have obtained greater power in society. Women are different then men in that they are less co mpetitive and aggressive. So this is shown in the symbol of the olive branch. Because women are less aggressive it is easier for them to work together for the good of the whole. So these are the two great pow ers of women that can destroy the power of men. The urn is a symbol of death and this is how men have ruled society. Where rulers rule through violence or threats of violence. So the power to kill others has been the method of governments to keep the people in order and to protect themselves from other governme nts who wish to invade them. So the fact she now has death in her hands suggest that power has been passed to her. Though the urn can represent other things like the d eath of patriarchy or the death of men's egos. Which is needed for a new Golden Age to come into being. The Grim Reaper would also be a good representative of the power of men. Because men are so aggressive towards others they fight each other in wars with better and be tter weapons. Today these weapons have become so destructive that they are able to destroy the whole of civ ilisation. So to have the Grim Reaper doing the hair of the woman suggests he is in some way serving her. So the whole image is about women destroying the power of men to the degree he is under her total control. So why is she weeping? Probably she is weeping because of the destruction and suffering man has inflicted on this planet. Thou gh it could have another explanation, women can weep for happiness as well as sadness. Having destroyed the masculine power she is now in the position to create a more feminine and harmonious world. So how is she to do this? The answer could be in the New Testament as the teachings of Jesus Christ are full of Goddess teachings. The submissive male who will allow Women to rule his life seems to be a increasing modern phenomenon in the West. Up until recently any ma n who showed any submissive qualities to women have been despised and treated with contempt. Whic h is strange because if we look at the teachings of Jesus Christ whom supposed to be the founder of Chri stianity, he teaches men to be submissive and even masochist. To quote the King James Bible. Matthew chapter 5 verse 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said. And eye for a eye a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you. That ye resist not evil: but wh osoever the smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee and not turn not thou away. Ye have heard that it hath been said. Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you. Love your enemies, bless them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 74 That ye many be the children of your Father whic h is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth the rain on the just and on the unjust. In Luke chapter 6 verse 27 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you. Bless them that curse you and pray fo r them which despitefully use you. And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek o ffer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take away thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh aw ay thy goods ask them not again And as ye would that man should do to you, do also to them likewise For if ye love them which love you, what thank s have ye for sinners also, love those that love them.

But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the highest : For he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful. Judge not and ye shall not be j udged: condemn not and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Yet his masochist teaching didn't stop here. In the Bible it states that Jesus knew that Judas was about to betray him, yet he didn't do anything about this and seem to encourage Judas to carry out this act. He made no attempt to hide from or resist the soldiers that came to apprehend him, and when arrested he made no defence against his accusers. Even when the Roman Governor Pilate made attempt to get him off he still wouldn't co-operate. So it means he voluntarily allowed h imself to be betrayed, condemned, tortured, whipped and crucifie d. Which has to be seen as extreme masochist behaviour Yet the story of Jesus is not original or unique because many other pagan gods like Osiris, Orpheus, Dionysus, Bacchus, Mithras, and Pan also had similar histories. The story of a god-man who was capable of miracles and able to heal the sick, who then was condemned to death and crucified, and then returned again from the dead, was commonplace in pagan times. These gods died on trees or stakes but some like Dionysus and Jesus died on crosses. Most of these stories come from Mystery Plays but unfort unately most knowledge of these religions were destroyed by Christians and Moslems so a lot of this knowledge has been lost. Except in the New Testament. Christians claimed that Jesus in the Bible sacrificed himself to the Father God for the sin of mankind. Christians interpret this that God was an gry with mankind and Jesus sacrificed himself to appease the anger of his father. In other sacrificial gods stories, the saviour god accepts all the sins of mankind and he is then abused, punished and put to d eath. So he becomes the scapegoat for the sins of the world. Now in all Mystery religions there is an outer and inner mystery. What we read about in religions are the outer mysteries, which many people seem to be satisfied with. Though there are people to whom the outer mysteries do not make sense, a nd search for the inner mysteries. In the earlier Mystery plays the saviour god sacrifices himself to The Great Mother. For instance in the Nordic myths the gods Loki, Odin, and Bader, they all sacrifice themselves to the Goddess Fredia. In the original version of the Isis Osiris story Isis swallows Osris whole and then later he is re-born from her. While even in the Jesus story, his crucifixi on is witnessed by the three Marys. Who probably represented in earlier time the Trip le Goddesses. We even find the concept of sacrifice in Buddhism. Siddhartha Gautama was born a prince and lived a life of luxury and privilege up until the age of 30. Then he gave all this up to live a life of a beggar and lived among the people. The theme in all these stories that the God-man has to sacrifice himself to save the whole of humankind. So from this we have to ask the questi on, how can the voluntary sacrifice of the god-man to God or the Great Mother save us all?"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 75 The oldest story of a sacrificing deity is the anci ent Sumerian story of Inanna, which is about five thousand years old at the beginning of the patriarcha l age, and this story seems to predict what will happen when patriarchy takes over, and its later downfall. In this story, Inanna is the Queen of Heaven, w ho wishes to visit her sister Ereshkigal the Goddess of the underworld or Netherworld. It is a long story and there are many different versions of it that seem to have changed over time, probably to fit in with the changing social attitudes. So in this retelling this story I will try to go back to the original version. Inanna arrives at the gates to the underworld di splaying all the symbols of Her rank and position. A Golden crown, lapis necklace, a double strand of deep blue beads, a jewelled belt around her waist, gold wrists/arm bands, she was holding a lapis meas uring rod and wearing a royal robe. To begin the descent to the underworld Goddess one must pass th rough seven gates, surrendering one article at each gate. So in effect it becomes the original dance of th e seven veils. In some versions Inanna questions and protests at the removal of each article and is told, \"Be satisfied Inanna! The ME of the netherworld is being fulfilled. Inanna you must not open your mouth against the sacred customs of the netherworld\". The ME probably relates to what is called today, the ego. As Inanna is the Queen of Heaven she would of course have a very large eg o, so in one sense the removing of each article is the surrendering of her ego. At the first gate, Inanna is stripped of her cr own. The patriarchal H ittites invaded and conquered Sumer. So the Queens and High Priestesses who rule d before were stripped of their positions. Inanna was renamed Inaras and became the virgin bride of the sacred king, so she was no longer the supreme ruler but was the consort of a King. This mean s the taking away of Inanna's crown symbolised overthrowing of the matriarchal rulers. At the second gate, the lapis necklace is taken from Inanna. The necklace goes around the neck and within the neck is the voice box. This symbolises the ability of Inanna to express herself, although the Hittite patriarchal rulers, had political power the people they ruled were still matriarchal in their attitudes and ways of living. In more recent times wh en a despotic dictator takes power in a country the first thing he does is to curb free speech. So likewise the women who previously held power in the matriarchal societies, we re probably silenced under the thr eat of death, from criticising the new patriarchal rulers. At the third gate, Inanna is stripped of her doubl e strands of blue beads that hung between her breasts. The breast for a woman represents her ability to nourish others, with her milk, so it symbolises a women's ability to love others. When the patriarchal rulers first took control, the women at first must have felt very angry about losing their status and power . Then slowly they must have had \"a change of heart\", and they began to co-operate and even love these patriarchal men from the North. As Inanna passed the fourth gate, she is stripped of her jewelled be lt around her waist. As it is a jewelled belt it would represent wealth. In matriarchal societies all possessions came down the female line, so in this way all the wealth of society would be in the hand of women, giving them great power. The patriarchs wanted all inheritance to come down the male line but as in ancient societies a woman was free to have sex with any man she chooses so there was no way for a man to know who his children were. To overcome this the male rulers and priests introduced the concept of marriage where a woman had to be faithful to one man. So a husband would know that th e children his wife produces were his, and allowing inheritance to come down the male line, and putting the wealth of the society into the hands of men. This is why marriage was originally only imposed on the upper classes. It took a long time before the custom of marriage filtered down the common people because inhe ritance wasn't such a big issue, as they had very little to pass on to their children. At the fifth gate Inanna's gold wrist/arm band is removed. The hands and arms symbolise our ability to act and make things happen. So for a long time women were still farmers, builders, traders and even warriors, and were still capable of creating wealth and power for themselves. Slowly these jobs were taken away from women and put into the hands of men. Women also did learn how to hit back at patriarchy by becoming Amazons and so used weapons , but in the end even these women were defeated and the only role left for women in society was that of wife, servant or prostitute. At the sixth gate, the lapis-measuring rod is removed from Inanna's hand. A person using a measuring rod has to be educated to know how to us e it. In patriarchal times, women were discouraged"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 from being educated because education can give a pers on power and status in a society. All knowledge and wisdom was removed from women, so they would have to depend on men for this. At the seventh and last gate, Ina nna is stripped of her royal robe and is left completely naked. Even though power and status was taken away from women, traditional customs and beliefs probably still gave women respect and status in society. Even as late as the Middles-ages women still were held in high regard as healers and seers. To counter this, patr iarchal religions began to put out propaganda like that women had no souls, or they were evil and the cause of all men's suffering. When this didn't work they went further and started to condemn women healers an d seers as Witches whom were in league with the Devil. They then started the infamous Witch-hunt where millions of women were tortured and murdered. So through fear they undermined the respect men had for women, and the respect women had for themselves as they began to believe what the patriarchal priests told them. So now women had nothing left, all respect, power, status a nd wealth had been taken away she was left naked and defenceless. After descending the seven gates, Inanna is ju dged by Ereshkigal and found to be ignorant, a mortal and not a supreme being, a nd with a mind full of her own self. In the patriarchal age women were considered to be stupid, and not having access to any form of education, were also ignorant. A supreme male God and male priests repl aced all Goddesses and priestesses. Also women were expected to devot e her whole life to looking after her children and husband, and were condemned for being selfish if they in any way thought about their own needs. Even today this is still true, as many still women fear being thought selfish. Inanna is then condemned to die hung from a m eat hook, but in other versions she is place in a coffin. While on the surface, without the presence of Inanna the Earth is turned into a wasteland. Now there are many different versions of the Inanna story and many different interpretations of it, like the Damazi/Inanna story or the Tammuz/Ishter story. In later versions, it is a God who rules the Underworld, and still later it is the Goddess who comes to collect her daughter who was abducted by the Underworld God, as in the story of Demeter and Persephone. In these late r versions the story is seen as the reason why in Northern climates everything dies in winter and comes back to life in summer. Because in this story Persephone is married to Hades the God of the Underworld and has to return to him once every year during the wintertime, so like Inanna when Persephone has to returns to the underworld everything above ground dies. In the original Inanna story, she simply dies and is reborn. The period of the wasteland is repeated in many ancient myths including the original stories of King Arthur. The wasteland is about the patriarchal society. The matriarchal religions respected all life and nature and were referred to as \"nature cults\" by the later patriarchal scholars because th ey worshipped trees and animals. When the patriarchal religions took control the patriarchs no longer re spected life and nature. Trees were cut down, causing soil erosion in places like Ancient Greece and throug hout the Middle East where fertile land was turned into desert. Archaeologists have found that in Biblical times Israel was a fertile country with extensive forests, but now many of the trees that grew there are extinct in that part of the world. Patriarchy never quite understood that by destroying nature, man was causing his own downfall. The hard lessons learnt about soil erosion in Europe and the middle east were lost when Europeans went to America and Australia, and millions of acres of land were depleted before this lesson was learnt again. On Easter Island the natives cut down all the trees on the island. Destroying for th emselves an important food source as with coconut trees, and their ability to build wooden houses and boats for fishing. Even today men still over-fish and pollute the oceans and use intensive farming methods that deplete the soil and destroy wildlife. With the help of Enki, a water and wisdom G od and a son of the Goddess, Inanna gains her release from the Great Below and is allowed to ascend through the seven gates. In other versions it is Inanna's lover Tammuz who helps her, and he vol untarily, takes her place in the Netherworld. To have a God that brings about Inanna's releas e is very interesting. Men themselves have undermined patriarchy in the last four hundred years. Patriarchal religions not only suppressed women but also other men. The peasants, like women were ke pt ignorant and denied education, as it makes it easier for the rulers to control them. At the same time patriarchal religions , suppressed science, and prevented the increase of knowledge as much as possible. When the Protestant sects broke away from the main Roman Catholic religion in Europe, they couldn't see any good reason why science should conti nue to be suppressed. Though they were to find"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 77 out hundreds of years later when science took over fro m religion as the major font of wisdom in the Western world. As scientific thought took contro l, the men of science couldn't see why the common people should be denied education, and ideas that a ll men should be equal began to flower. As the common people became better educated they began to demand more rights, women too began to be better educated and complain about the shackles that patr iarchal religion and customs imposed on them. With many men now in power that were no longer infl uenced by patriarchal religions, the demands by Feminists were seen to be reasonable and over time these demands were granted to them. So if Enki the wisdom God is science it was scien tific thought that released Inanna from her bondage to patriarchal religion. While to have her love r Tammuz take her place symbolises the fact that many men will voluntary submit themselves to women when the matriarchal age comes into being. Some scholars have claimed that Tammaz was the original Jesus Christ. At the seventh gate, Inanna is given back her royal robe. Although for a time science continued the patriarchal religion's denigration of women as in the last century claiming that women had smaller brains than men or were too emoti onal to make sensible decisions. Yet science didn't go as far as patriarchal religions and claim women were evil because to scientific men it was clear women were not in any way evil. So women gained more and more respect in society and the royal robe is a symbol of this respect. At the sixth gate, Inanna is given back her meas uring rod. The men of science couldn't see any good reason why women should not be denied educa tion and even in the nineteenth century women began to take on professi onal jobs like doctors, journalists and sc ientists. Jobs up until then only men were allowed to do, so the measuring rod was a symbol of women's growing edu cational qualifications in society. At the fifth gate, Inanna is given back her golden wrist/arm band. At the beginning of this century higher education was given only to a small majority of women, but other women began to follow their lead. During the first and second world wars, women began to work in factories and on farms doing jobs men normally done and showing they were more than capable of doing them. Although Feminists have complained that after both these wars the return ing male troops took over these jobs once again and women went back to being housewives again. But it showed what is possible for women and since then more women have depended upon themselves to earn a living and not on men. To the degree there are men today who stay a home to look after the house and children while the women go to work. So the wrist/arm band symbolises women's ability now to take charge of her own life to earn her own money and not to have to rely on a man. At the Fourth gate, her jewelled belt is returne d. Women are not only now able to earn their own living but some are becoming wealthy. At one time the only way a woman could become rich was to inherit money, to be a widow of a rich man or beco me a successful actress or courtesan. Now successful businesswomen are becoming millionaires, while other women are taking the top-jobs in many professions. Feminists complain a bout the \"glass-ceiling\" that prevent women from getting the top-jobs in society, but slowly the glass ceiling is collapsing. So the Jewelled belt symbolises the wealth women are gaining in society. At the Third gate, the double strands of deep blue beads are returned to Inanna. In the patriarchal age it wasn't only patriarchal religion that kept wo men in bondage, it was also the fact that she loved patriarchal men more than she loved herself. Now as we are moving towards a new matriarchal age women are learning more and more how to love them selves. So the beads that hung between her breasts and over her heart, symbolise women changing the way th ey love. This is seen clearly in the breakdown of marriage in recent times. Women are now dema nding more from men and will rather break up the relationship than accept any abuse from men. At the Second gate, Inanna's lapis necklace is re turned to her. Since the 1960s Feminists have become very vocal about demanding their rights. Although Feminism has received setbacks along the way like the back-lash during the 1980s, Feminists have n't given up and are still criticising the patriarchal society. At the first gate Inanna receives back her crown. This is the symbol that women have now taken back control of society. The Earth now begins to fl ower again, as women once again respect life on earth in all its forms. Already now we see in the Green party, Greenpeace and other environment organisations the concern about what damage patriarchy is doing to our world. As women become more in control this"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 concern will grow until genuine practical steps will be taken to correct these problems. In the Inanna story it was claimed that the Earth was turned into a wasteland while Inanna was stayed underground with her sister Ereshkigal. So women's first job when that take back control will be to heal the earth of the damage that was done during the patriarchal age. Some scholars have made the c ontroversial claim that the stor y of Inanna's decent into the underworld is the prototype story for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. This causes a problem, as many Christians believe the stories in the Bible to be historical facts. The problem with that belief is that scholars are very aware that all the Bible stories over hundreds of years have been changed, embellished and censored. These stories might have originally come from real events, but were soon changed and merged with other stories and myths, so it is hard to know how much of the original event is left in the story. All religions from an early time have been contaminated by politics, and it is unfortunate that it is the politically minded priests who have gained most power and have ruled religions. While priests with genuine beliefs in their religion have always played the subordinate role. So it would be the politically motivated priests who would order changes in the texts and doctrine of a religion for political reasons, but it would probably be the more genuine believers who carri ed out this task. It is known that the patriarchal religions carried out a wholesale de struction of ancient knowledge for political reasons. But the priests given the task of censoring this knowledge from religi ous text probably didn't agree with the task they were given. The result of this has been in recent years that many people have realised that there are hidden messages within many religious writings. But the priests given the task of rewriting scriptures, tried to pass on the truth of the situation in coded form, to inform people in the future of the teachings of the Ancient Goddess religions. In many ancient myths there are stories of matriarchal times where the Queen or High Priestess would marry a young man who would jointly rule with her for one year as King. Then when this year was up he would be sacrificed and the Queen or Hi gh Priestess would marry another young man and the cycle would continue. Whether these stories are about real events and customs, or is a \"mystery\" story that is about the cycle of matriarc hal and patriarchal ages, is a matter of opinion. But again some scholars to claim or hint that from these stories that the story of the crucifixion of Jesus originates. Which suggests that Jesus and his life story was a work of fiction. So if the story of Inanna is about the downfall of women at th e beginning of the matriarchal age and her rise at the end of the patria rchal age. Could then the story of Jesus's crucifixion be the story of man's downfall at the end of the patriarchal age? The story starts off in triumph, with Jesus mounted on a colt or ass riding through the streets of Jerusalem, where crowds welcome him and proclaim him King. So we can take this to mean he is a fully patriarchal man at the height of his power and ego growth. Yet his triumph doesn't last l ong, he prophesies that Jerusale m will be completely destroyed, perhaps symbolising the collapse of patriarchy. Then he goes to the Temple and condemns the priests there for turning a house of prayer into a den of thieves. Which would be a good description of patriarchal religion, which became extremely wealthy a nd powerful during the patria rchal age. Jesus then begins to give more prophesies to quote, - \"Count ries will fight each other; kingdoms will attack one another. There will be terrible earthquakes, famines, and plagues every-where; there will be strange and terrifying things coming from the sky.\" Which sounds lik e a very good description of the patriarchal age, the mention of \"strange and terrifying things coming from the sky\" sounds interesting it could be about bomber aircraft that destroyed whole cities in the Second World War, and the nuclear attack on Japan. Then Jesus and his disciples sat down for the Pa ssover meal, during this meal Jesus washed the feet of all his disciples, a job norma lly done by servants, slaves or women. He also made the point that he was the one who serves his disciples. Why he did and say these things is not made very clear, but again it could be a practical prophesy of man's downfall, demonstrating that all men need to learn humility. Jesus then goes through a ritual, with the bread and wine saying that, this is his body and blood, which again symbolises a form of sacrifice. Echoing the ancient stories of the King that is sacrificed at the end of each year to the Goddess. In some of these tales the King is not only sacrificed but eaten in a cannibal feast. This was the fate of Dionysus who was torn apart by women and then eaten before he came back to life again. It also similar to the story of Isis swallowing Osiris or the male Set whole, before he is born again from her."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 So this would be symbolised by breaking and eating of the bread which Jesus calls \"my body\". The drinking of wine, which symbolises the blood of Jesus Christ, is more interesting. In ancient Goddess religions menstrual blood was held to be sacred. While in many later patriarchal religion menstrual blood was held to be ta boo and unclean. So the blood coming from Jesus would suggest that Jesus was a woman and there are some authors who have claimed this. Though more likely it means that Jesus was going through an ancient Goddess ritual. To symbolise a cup with wine in it and call it blood is a clear Goddess symbol with the cup being the vagina and the wine being menstr ual blood. Later on this symbol was turn into the Holy Grail. Judas decides to betray Jesus to hi s enemies, and in this meal Jesus seems to be fully aware of this betrayal, and seems to encourage Judas do it. As pointed out previously men themselves started the beginning of the downfall of patriarchy. As they turned their backs on patriarchal religions, allowing greater freedom and education not only to the common people but to women as well. So we seem to see Judas and Jesus colluding together to bring about their own downfall. This is unde rlined by Judas betrays Jesus with a kiss, symbolising a companionship between them. Judas then goes on to hang himself, so like Jesus he sacrifices himself. So both Jesus and Judas symbolises men who not only betray patriarchy by qui etly helping women to gain power and status in society, but who also willingly sacrifice themselves to women. When taken capture, Jesus makes no resistance, a nd when condemned and judged by his enemies he makes no attempt to defend himself, in much the same way Inanna makes not attempt to defend herself against the judgement made by Ereshkigal. In recent years Feminists have attacked both patriarchy and men in general and although some me n have resented this, on the whol e men have made little attempt to in any way defend themselves and have preferred to remain quiet. Jesus' enemies took him before P ilate and condemned him, but Pila te wasn't interested. They continued to insist on having him executed and Pila te decided to pass the buc k and sent Jesus to King Herod to be tried. It seems that Herod was also sympathetic to Jesus but again Jesus made no attempt to help himself and refused to answer Herod's questions. In the end He rod mocked Jesus and treated him with contempt, put a fine robe on him and sent him back to Pilate. Now in many ways this reflects the attitude of me n today. Religious fundamentalists and extreme right-wing politicians have tried to put the clock back to the \"g ood old days\", of extreme patriarchy. Their anger is not only directed at women but other men who seem to be letting the side down. As patriarchal religions and very right-wing politics no longer hold the power in the land they once had, they have to appeal to those who do have the power, sym bolised by Pilate and Herod. As a result politicians today will get up and talk about going back to \"strong family values\". But being politicians they only say this because they think it might gain them votes or get people who are pressurising them off their backs. Knowing full well that there is nothing they can really do to reverse the continuous decline in patriarchy. So Jesus seems to be representing the passive man of today who is allowing women to gain more and more power and status within society. The medi a of today like Herod mock and treat the \"new man\" with contempt, but even here ther e is a division of opinion. Feminism is now very strong within the media as well so the \"new-man\" also does get some s upport, probably symbolised by the fine robe Herod gives Jesus. When Jesus is sent back to Pilate, and he still insists that Jesus has done nothing wrong, but bowing to pressure decides to have Jesus whipped to satisfy an angry crowd that Jesus' enemies brought together to condemn him. The whipping fails to satisfy the blood lust of the crowd and Pilate trie s to get Jesus free on a Passover pardon for criminals. But the crowd demand th at a prisoner who had been put into jail for riot and murder be set free instead. This very much symbolises the attitude of many people who have far greater regard for patriarchal criminals than the \"new man\". We can see this on TV and films where violent men and even serial killers are glamorised and made into heroes in films. Probably the producers of these violent films hope that it will make young men more macho, who will in turn put women \"in their place\". Pilate in the end caves into pressure to have Je sus crucified, and \"washes hi s hands of him\". Like Inanna, Jesus is stripped of all his clothing, and then the Roman soldiers mock him by putting a crown of thorns on his head. Already men in this century have began to condemn themselv es, talking about \"man's inhumanity to man\". In the past men would put the blame of the problems for the world onto other men."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 Like Hitler who blamed the Jews, or the rich who blam e the poor or the poor who blame the rich etc. But blaming just one group is now becoming more and more unacceptable and it is being realised that all men are the cause of the world's problems. So the crown of thorns is the realisation by men that when they ruled the world they caused great suffering not only to themselves but to all of life. The crown represents the power men had to rule the world and the thorns are the suffering it caused, to whole of humankind as well as the planet. The cross is put on Jesus' back for him to carry it to the place where he will be crucified. There is no problem with interpretation here be cause Christians themselves see the image of \"carrying your cross\" to mean carrying all the sins of the world on your back. Unfortunately Jesus proved to be too weak to carry the cross, and the soldiers forced another stronger man called Simon to carry it for him. The \"new man\" today is considered by society to be \"weak and wimpish\" while a normal patriarchal man is seen to be \"strong and tough\". So to have a strong and th erefore patriarchal man carry the cross as well is an interesting development. There are many men today who act like a fully patriarchal macho man but inside they are not like this. In most cases it is an act because it is how men are expected to behave. This means that seemingly macho men will also begin to carry the cross of shame for the patriarchal past. Jesus was then crucified between two criminals, who in our society are also considered to be very \"macho\" so therefore also patriarchal. It means all types of men will be crucified when the matriarchal age comes into being. One of the criminals mocks Jesus but the other criminal is more sympathetic and Jesus says to him \"I promise you that today you will be in Paradise with me\". The patriarchal age was not only hell for women but for men themselves, because the aggressive behaviour created wars, conflict, inequality, persecution and poverty, for men as well as for women. So to live in a society where women control this aggressive behaviour would compared with the patriarchal society, become a paradise. The paradise Jesus talked about to the criminal is the matriarc hal society that will come into being when men completely sacrifice themselves to women. The three Marys witness the crucifixion, which would be the ancient Tr iple Goddess of Crone, Mother and Maid. Jesus's birth was also witnessed by three wise men from the east. When Jesus died he shouted out in a loud voice \"Father! in to your hands I place my spirit\". If we are to change the word father to mother what he said is the final complete surrender of men into the hands of women. Jesus on the cross was also wounded by a Roman sp ear on this thigh. Some writers make a claim of the obvious sexual overtones of this act. Of th e spear being a penis and the wound on Jesus's thigh his vagina giving out menstrual blood. Which again sugg ests that Jesus was the women and probably Inanna. This is confirmed in the Holy Gr ail stories of the Gra il being the cup that catches Jesus' blood. Like Inanna, Jesus dies and later \"rises from the dead\", and it is three women (the Triple Goddess) whom he first sees after his resurrection, so in this way a new patriarchal age begins, and like the story of Inanna it is about the continuous cycle of patriarchal and matriarchal ages. What is interesting in both the Inanna story of her journey to the Netherworld and the story of Jesus is that both sacrifice themselves voluntary. It is men who bring about the end of the patriarchal age and it is women who bring about the end of the matriarchal age. As we see in the story of Pandora. The story of Pandora's box or jar and Adam and Eve suggest that once women were the dominant sex and people then lived in a non violent Golden age and later Silver age. Then women decided that making men the inferior sex was unfair. This is re presented by Pandora opening the box or Eve tempting Adam to eat from the tree of knowledge. The very act of doing this suggests that Eve was in charge. Unfortunately in giving men equality resulted in him eventually becoming competitive with women and dominating society through violence. This has resulted in our present world of violence, injustice and poverty. As the Bible points out this was a tragedy for both men and women as Adam found that outside the Garden of Eden he had to, \"work by the sweat of this brow\". In other words in a masculine world of winners and losers there are few winners and many losers. So the losers in a patriarchal society which includes both men and women found th emselves having to work, not only to support themselves, but the ruling and warrior classes a nd the patriarchal priesthood. Clearly if we look at the history of the last four or five thousand years we can see that men have made a terrible job at ruling the world. Men's answer to all problems has been aggression and violence, which has created a world of wars, genocide, poverty, fear, hatred and suffering. At the time of the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 saviour gods when there was still knowledge of the Anci ent Matriarchal age, there must of been a large number of people who wanted the entire world to return to the religion of Great Mother. But what was preventing this was violent men who were conqueri ng other nations and turning conquered people into slaves. This means that violent men who were only interest ed in slaves and loot would quickly conquer any people who attempted to set up a matriarchal society of love and harmony. So it would be seen very clearly that the cause of all the wars, violence, poverty and suffering of the world was caused by these selfish and violent men. We know from history that the Amazons did for a while attempt to fight fire with fire and armed themselves. But this clearly wasn't the answer because by becoming violent yourself you become exactly like the people you are fighting ag ainst. In other words the only way Amazons could be free was to become as aggressive, ruthless and violence as the men they fought against. Which is the problem that many career women have today. In that they are forced to be as competitive as men to gain any power in status in our society."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 For this reason some Women decided on a different method and attempted to reform these violent men. To do this they gave them a vision of what a caring and loving world w ould be like and explaining to them this is only possible if they were willing to sacrifice yourself to the Great Mother. So a story was created to put forward a drama of heroic sacrifice. To some degree this seems to have been successful because all over Europe and the Middle East there we re saviour God religions. So it seems many men were willing to sacrifice themselves to the Goddess in these Mystery religions. Unfortunately they became victims of their own success because the vi olent men who had no interested in sacrificing themselves, saw these religions as a th reat and set about destroying them. It is of interest that early Christianity was ve ry popular among the slaves of the Roman Empire. This would make sense if many ma triarchal societies where victims of the conquering Romans, so there would be a tradition of the worship of the Mother G oddess among the slaves. So they would be very sympathetic to a saviour god religion like early Christianity. Attempts by the Roman ruling elite it seems to stamp out these saviour God religions at that time was unsuccessful. It seems that both Christianity and the Egyptian religion of the Goddess Isis and her saviour god Osiris was very popular among the common people and the troops of the Roman Empire. Far too popular it seems to mount a holy war against these religions. The ruling elite instead attempted to promote a very patriarchal religion based on the sun god, but this didn't receive enough support from the people. So in the end they decided that if you can't beat them, join them. The Roman rulers simply hijacked the Christian Religion and changed it to make it acceptable to them. They then set about destroying the Isisia n religion and any Christian sect like the Egyptian Gnostics that didn't follow the type of Christianity put forward by the Roman elite. The actual teachings of Jesus like, \"loving your neighbour\", \"turning the other cheek\" was quickly ignored as the Roman rulers became more interested in the religion of Judaism and promoted this, rather than what was taught by the early Christian Church. Then Christianity as a state religion and late r the Moslems, (another Jewish sect) set about destroying all knowledge of the ancient religion of the Great Mother. While at the same time they distorted the teachings of the saviour God claiming that Jesus sacrificed himself to an angry father God to appease him. Rather then the idea that all men need to sacrifice themselves to the Great Mother before we can have a peaceful matriarchal world once agai n. This forced Goddess religions to go underground, where they created secret societies to preserve their teachings. These secret Goddess religions called themselves Alchemists, Witches, Rosicrucians and Freemasons. Perhaps the mystery religions of the past were a few thousand years before their time. They were trying to promote a vision of a peac eful and loving world in a very viol ent age. Today in the 21st century we see in the West at least a different attitude to violent men. It is no longer acceptable for Western rulers to go out and conquer other countries, just for the hell of it. Nor is it acceptable for them to rule through fear and intimation. Western rulers today are forced to listen to the needs and desires of the common people and even respect the views and opinions of minorities and women. So perhaps the sacrificial/saviour God image within Christianity has acted as a Trojan Horse for the patriarchal age. On the collective unconscious leve l it created an archetype that has influenced all men in Christian countries for the last two thousand ye ars. So that the idea of voluntary sacrifice has become acceptable to men on the unconscious level, which is starting to bear fruit in the last few hundred years. It has become commonplace for men today in the West to sacrifice themselves for their families and wives. Talking to young men today I find they their girlfriends or wives expect them to do housework and look after the children. It also seems mo re and more it is the wife not the husband is the dominant partner in relationships. In fact the whol e status of women has dram atically increased during the 20th century. So are these men very much in tune with the archetypal sacrificial/saviour God? Clearly if all men are effected by this powerful archetypal it will save the world from violence, wars and suffering. Although Christianity has mostly ignored the teachings of Jesus and have concentrated more on the Old Testament god of judgement and fear, the symbol s of a sacrificial Jesus has been in all Churches. While the Great Mother is seen in Roman Catholic Churches in the disguise of the Virgin Mary. And even though most Christian priests have only paid lip service to the teachings of Jesus and the drama of his betrayal and crucifixion, this was still taught. So these symbols, drama and teachings has probably been unconsciously influencing men in Christian countie s ever since Christianity became a state religion."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 So although in the short term the attempt by ma triarchal women to create a submissive saviour god in the past seems like a failure. The popularity of the sacrificial drama of Jesus Christ has brought about an archetypal change in men, which will allo w men to surrender themselves to Women and bring about a new matriarchal age. After all, it is in Christian countries we see the rise in feminism during the 20th century. Statue on above is of the Egyptian Lion Goddess Sekhmet. She is an Avenging Goddess who not only destroys Demons but also once attempted to de stroy the whole of mankind. Her story is very similar to that of the Goddess Kali whom we will discuss in the next chapter.  "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 84 Chapter Eleven THE GODDESS KALI In my research of pre-Christian mystery Religio ns what I found was that any information about them, mostly comes from those who were opposed to th em. So apart from telling us that their rituals involved licentious sexual behaviour they don't tell us much about them. As paganism was completely destroyed by Christianity in Europe and only surviv ed in coded form in Freemasonry, Rosiccrucism and Alchemy. We have to look to areas of the world we re paganism survived, and that is in Hinduism and Taoism, to understand the what were the original Goddess teaching were like. Although Taoism and Hinduism have been mostly ta ken over by patriarchy Matriarchal elements still survive in both religions. Within Hinduism it most ly survives in Tantra, and both Taoism and Tantra like the Mystery Religions use sex in their spiritual practices. The followers of Tantra worship the Goddess Kali. Of all the deities worshipped today, the Goddess Kali has to be the most biza rre and unsettling of them all. What are we to think of a Goddess who is nude, black, has a bloodstained sword in her hand, a necklace of the skulls or heads of men, a skirt of the cut-off arms of men. And is always shown w ith her tongue sticking out and walking or dancing on the body of a man. To say she is bloodthirsty is an understatement, because in her stories she will massacre whole armies of men or de mons. In some stories she gets so drunk on drinking the blood of demons that she starts to massacre the whole of ma nkind. Though the story goes on to say that the God Siva saves the day by coming to Earth and throwing h imself at her feet and thus appeasing her blood lust. From a Christian point of view, she would be cons idered an evil Goddess and is even referred to by Christian commentators as a Hindu Devil, but in India she is revered as either \"The Mother\", \"The Saviour of the World\" or \"Female World Ruler\". She is worshipped by millions of normal people in India and even by people in Western Countries. Her devotees claim that she is a very ancient G oddess, who is worshipped all over the world under different names. Even today in Cat holic Churches in Southern Europe there are statues of Black Virgins, which is an unusual colour for a Christian image. It seems these Churches were built on pagan Temples of Black Goddesses, many being the Black Isis w ho was very popular in Roman times though there is evidence that the Black Isis replaced an even older Black Goddess. So in effect the Virgin Mary became a Goddess and followed a tradition of being painted black. Kali is also associated with the ancient Celtic Goddesses Caillech, Cale , Scotia, the Finish Goddess Kalma and many other European Goddesses who like Kali are called The Black Mother and Creatrix of the World. In Ancient Egypt there was Sekhmet, the lioness Goddess, who like Kali would slaughter w hole armies of men or De mons and get drunk on drinking blood. There is also the Aztec Goddess Coa tlicue, who had a skirt of serpents, a necklace of human hearts and a human skull in her hand. In some images her head has been cut-off and from her neck flow two streams of blood, which is also similar to traditional pictures of Kali. If it is possible to connect Kali w ith Coatlicue, then Kali would have to be a very ancient Goddess, because to do this would mean that she is older than the time when there was a land Bridge between Siberia and Alaska. This goes back to the time of the last ice age which sounds incredible, until you ask the question; why were the people in Northern Eur ope worshipping Black Goddesses? It is normal for people to worship idols of the same race as themselv es. Christians in Northern Europe have statues of Christ with fair-hair and blue eyes, while in Africa his statues are that of a black-man. The only reason why people would worship a statue of a race different from themselves is that the Deity had an extremely long visual tradition that people forgot why they made the Deity that way. Human beings probably evolved in Africa, which is a hot country, so in spite of the drawings you see of early cave-men that show them to be white. It is more than likely that they were black and some of them only slowly became white when they lived many thousands of generations in co ld climates. Kali could be by far the oldest Deity that is being worshipped in the world today. In so me images Kali is shown as a very old woman, perhaps an indication of her great age? Also she is known as the Goddess of time, suggesting that she is timeless. This has been partly confirmed by Archaeologists, who have discovered images of Goddesses going back 30,000 years. In the images and stories of Kali there is a great deal of symbolism that is very strange and puzzling. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 [Kali representing all women, dancing on the defeated Siva representing men] "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 The Hindus have attempted to make sense of this symbolism, they claim that Kali is so destructive because she is the Goddess of time, and everything is destroyed over great periods of time. The necklace of heads she has around her neck are 50 in number which represents the 50 letters in the Sanskrit alphabet. The reason she sticks out her tongue is because she is shy! The reason she stopped massacring mankind when she stepped on Siva was because she is married to Siva and a good Hindu wife would feel embarrassed at doing this! Except for saying that Kali is the Goddess of time, somehow these explanations do not ring true, and they sound like wild speculation. Like with Freemasonry imagery the symbolism su rrounding Kali is never explained or given only superficial explanations. So Freemasonry and Tantra are similar in that they have something to hide and they only reveal their teachings through confusing sy mbolism. So as with Freemasonry the way to break their code of their symbology is to be awar e that Tantra was once a matriarchal religion. In most images of Kali she is Bl ack, and one of her names is 't he Black Goddess'. In Christian symbolism black is evil and white is good, but because of the ancient history of India this view can also be seen as racist, because caste means colour. Sugges ting that a white race that conquered India in pre- historic times, who became the rulers while the common native people were black. This is the view of European scholars who claim that India was once conque red by a white Aryan race; this is now disputed by Indian scholars who point out there is no real evidence of this, except for the caste system. So to say white is good and black is bad means that this is a bout class and racial prejudice. This shows that Kali was probably one of the native Goddesses befo re the white invaders invaded India. Religious symbolism can mean different things in different parts of the world. In the west we associate light with goodness and dark with evil. So it comes as a surprise to many people that the Australian Aborigines see it the other way around. The r eason for this is that Australia is a hot and dry country where anyone can die quickly in the hot sun w ithout shade or water. So to the Aborigine the sun and light are dangerous while the dark is safe and a relief from the heat of the sun. White people coming from colder climates regard the sun and fire as a relief from the cold, and fear darkness because of the long nights when it is winter. In the past, winter wa s when most people in northern counties died of cold and starvation, so it is no wonder they regarded the da rk as evil. The Aztecs feared the darkness so much that they sacrificed thousands of people to their S un God to ensure that the sun came up every morning. Indicating that they also originally came from a cold climate. The archaeologist Marija Gimbutas claimed that the last Matriarchal age ended when patriarchal invaders came from the North to conquer the peacef ul Matriarchal communities further south. So it seems that patriarchy started with white people in cold countries. So the same thing could of happened to India in pre-historic times, with white patriarchal invaders coming from the north. Kali is also shown as naked, which is sensible in a hot climate but is often seen as primitive behaviour by people coming from colder climates where clothes are needed. When white invaders arrived in India, they wore clothes to protect thei r fair skins from the burning sun. They imposed their dress code on the natives; in much the same way as white people did in the last century in other hot countries. Even though the natives saw no reason to put on uncomfortable clothes in a hot climate. So it is of interest that there is a tradition of holy-men in India who walk about stark naked, and can be very aggressive in the way they behave. To the degree where they carry weapons like swords in their hands and show they are willing to use them. This is a very old tradition because the Greeks wrote about them when Alexander the Great invaded India. In many warm countries, though the native people do not we ar clothes they don't attach much importance to this fact, whereas these holy-men are using their nudity as a form of defiance. So this could have originally been a gesture of defiance against the white rulers and their customs to prove that they were not being intimidated by them. All other Hindu Gods and Goddesses are shown as cl othed, but with Kali she is mostly nude and this is commented on in songs and verses about her. Yet nudity seem to be commonplace in older Deities like Diana, Aphrodite and Pan. So it seems that ther e is a point to her nudity, which is probably that she is not a part of the patriarchal establishment. So therefore she existed in India before the patriarchal invasion. This is reflected in the story of the Gard en of Eden, Adam and Eve were also nude before the serpent tempted them. The snake can be a symbol of th e penis, so the snake could be a man or masculine knowledge. The story could be symbolizing that wh ile Adam and Eve were nude they lived in the paradise of a matriarchal society. Then it was invaded or influenced by patriarchy. So the wearing of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 clothes would be a symbol of Adam and Eve accepting patriarchal religion and its way of life. Unfortunately the result of this was that they were thrown out of the paradise of the Garden of Eden. Eve was forced to take second-place to Adam, while he was forced to work \"By the sweat of his brow\". This probably came about because in a ma triarchal society, everyone was e qual so people would only have to work to support themselves and members of their famil y. In a patriarchal society the people not only had to work to support themselves and their family but the hierarchy of rulers, priests and warriors. They also had to work hard building useless things like palaces, fortresses, large Temples, Churches, pyramids and weapons of war. Another feature of Kali is that she is always show n with her tongue sticking out. The Polynesians, who are related to the Indian people, use this as a sign of an aggressive challenge. In Britain today, children will also stick out their tongues as a sign of defiance. Kali is also shown carrying a bloody sword and with her expression of aggr ession we have to regard her as a warrior. She would then be a war Goddess; but why would warriors want a woman repres enting them unless the warriors happen to be women? This suggests that Ancient India might have been once an Amazon nation. Many people today regard Amazons as myths, not knowing that archaeol ogists have dug up graves of many Amazon warriors throughout Europe. So it suggests that when India was invaded by patriarcha l armies from the north the women learnt to arm themselves and fight back. T hough it seems like the Amazons in Europe and Africa they were finally defeated. In her images Kali is shown walkin g or dancing on the body of a man; mostly this is the God Siva who is white. Some scholars claim that he was a native God who existed in India before it was invaded by patriarchal tribes. This is because he is worshipped as a penis in many of his temples. As the patriarchs were contemptuous of this form of worship, they stamped it out in many other countries it suggests that like Pan he was once a Matriarchal god. Which shows that the invaders were compromising with the native people at a very early date if they were willin g to adopt the native gods. In much the same was the Christian turned many pagan Gods a nd Goddesses into Christian saints. After being adopted by the rulers of the country, he soon became a white man. This is em phasized in some of his st ories and images as he is covered in white ash. So we have a native Goddess dancing or walking over a white man who is symbolic of the privileged rulers of the country. This means we have to regard Kali as a rebel leader of the native people who is dancing trium phantly on the defeated rulers. In one Hindu sect, called Thuggee, who worshipped Kali, the followers would carry with them a cord and quietly strangle people sleeping on the street at night as a sacrifice to Kali. The British successfully stamped out this sect, but how did such a bi zarre sect come to be created? In Southern Italy, after the Austrians had conquered them, a resistance movement called the Mafia was created. After the Italian people rose up and freed themselves of Austri an rule, the Mafia didn't disband but continued as a criminal organization. So the same could of happen to the Thuggee. After the British conquered India there was some resistance to British rule. Not having the ability to defeat the British in open warfare some Indian resistance fighters hit back in other ways. They would break into British soldiers' barracks at night and murder hundreds of them silently, while they were asleep. So this form of stealthy resistance is traditional in India, which points to the Thuggee sect being created originally as a resistance movement. As the Thuggee worship Kali it points to them being orig inally matriarchal, fighting to rid the country of the patriarchal invaders. They clearly failed in this, but they continued the killing long after the cause was lost and in time they forgot the purpose of doing this over hundreds of years. Tantra, also worships Kali, and is very similar to Taoism in China. They both teach the concept that a man when having sex with a woman should not ej aculate. Many reasons are given for this, like, if a man ejaculates he wastes his spiritual energy, or that it is a type of yoga training to go beyond the temptations of the flesh. These sound like the usual patr iarchal explanations that have allowed Tantra and Taoism to survive into the patriarchal age, while allo wing a matriarchal practice to continue in secret. At a basic level, for a man to be able to withhold his or gasm is a great advantage to the woman, as it allows her all the time she needs to have an orgasm or even several orgasms. Without any fear that the man will ejaculate and cut short her enjoyment. Also because a man doesn't ejaculate he is not going to be worn out and will always be, \"on the boil\" whenever the women wants sex. In modern day Western countries with the rise of feminism, women are already maki ng these sorts of demands on men. Where a man has to learn foreplay and how to not ejaculate until the women orgasms. In Tantra, men are also encouraged to have sex with virgins. On the surface this sounds very patriarchal as patriarc hal men like to \"break in\""},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 virgins. Until you realize that in the ancient past a virgin was an independent woman who was not in any way dependent on a man. To sum it all up, in Tantra, men were encouraged to have sex only with independent women, and to hold back their orgasm in favour of the woman. Also in Tantra, sexual positions are mostly shown with the woman on top, unlike patriarchal re ligions, which prefer the man on top and in control. So in Tantra the woman is taking the dominant position, and using the man for her pleasure. Suggesting that it was once a very matriarchal religion. Tantra also teaches the concept of the left-hand and right-hand path of spiritual enlightenment. The right-hand is traditional Hindu orthodoxy, but the left -hand path is a complete rejection of this. On this path the seeker has to go beyond all the customs and taboos of society to achieve spiritual enlightenment. This makes it a very anti-establishment doctrine and it is greatly criticized by traditional Hindus. Christians and many people in the occult tend to regard the concept of the left-hand path as the path of evil. This is because of the very successful propaganda campaign that th e Church mounted against the Witches during the Middle Ages. It was so successful that many people even today associate Witchcraft with evil. As are Freemasons who since the 19th century have also been accused of Devil worship. The result is that modern Witches in Britain when faced by the media, unless they are attention seekers, have to claim that they are \"white Witches\". This is as daft as a Christian calling himself a white or black Christian. In fact the charge of Black Christianity would be make more sense, because it was the Christians who did all the torturing, burning and r obbing of the Witches. The Christians in the Middle Ages behaved in exactly the same way as the Nazis did when persecuting the Jews. First of all they put forward a propaganda campaign to claim how evil the Jews were and blamed many of the problems in Germany at the time on to them. When they had popular support against the Jews they then began to put them in concentration camps. The Nazis took a lot of interest in the history of the Witch-hunts in Germany. It sounds like they were impressed by the very successful propaganda campaign that the Church mounted against the Witches, and copied it. The Hindus never went that far in condemning th e fringe elements within their religion. Probably because even though many anti-establishment sects existed in Hinduism there is no record of them overturning the establishment. In the end the patria rchal rulers came out on top. So it seems that the image of Kali conquering patriarchy is not an event that occurred in the recorded past. As far as we know it never happened at all. So it can only be an event that existed so far in the past that it has been forgotten or it is a future event that the people hoped would come to pass in the future. In Ancient Israel, when the Jews were conquered by other nations like Babylon and Rome, their prophets pr edicted that one day a Messiah would appear and lead them in overthrow ing their oppressors. That never happened in those days, but after the Jews were forced out of their hom eland they hoped for a Messiah to lead them back. In this century this prophecy has become partly true. A lthough a Messiah did not appear, the Jews did return to Israel. So was Kali a type of Messiah to the na tive Indian people? The image of her dancing on a white man could have been the symbol of the dark, matriarchal native peopl e finally overcoming and defeating the white patriarchal rulers. Perhap s this might have been the original meaning, but over thousands of years, in spite of the caste system, the Indians have more or less become one race. So the original meaning of Kali would have been lost. However, the images are still used and have come to mean something else. In some of the older pictures of Kali, she is s een dancing on a man who naturally looks to be in pain because of it. But the later images show the man relaxed and he seems to be enjoying the experience! Walking or dancing over someone is a sign of c onquest. In the old images the man resisted being conquered by Kali but in the later ones he doesn't and pa ssively allows her to \"walk all over him\". This is surprising because she is shown carrying a bloodstai ned sword and has around her a chain of skulls or men's heads. In some of the images she does kill him. The chain-of-heads symbolizes that this man is not the first man she has conquered and is proudly showing how many men she has overcome. Siva is traditionally the victim and seems to like Kali walking all over him because in many images he has an erection. Sometimes Kali is shown sitting on it. Does this means that this is sexual conquest? As the person on top in sexu al intercourse is the one in contro l of what is going on. In some images Kali is the one with her head chopped off. Perhaps this is what happened to her when the rebellions of the native Indians were suppressed in Anci ent India. But she is also shown holding her head in her hand and still alive, which implies she is immortal. So this suggests she was once a sacrificial"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 Goddess like Inanna who died but then later returned. She might have been defeated in the past but now she has returned to conquer Siva, successfully this time. The image also shows the method of conquest. She is not conquering by war, as she is not attempting to kill Siva and he is voluntary surrendering to her. So why would a privileged ruler surrender to a low caste woman? It could only be that as Siva seems to enjoy being walked on he must be a masochist. This does suggest that the ancient Indians had an understanding of male masochis m, which is reappearing today in western countries. In recent years a new type of prostitute has appeared called the Dominatrix. These women own torture chambers in which male clients are willing to pay to be tortured and humiliated. The Dominatrix also dresses in black leather, rubber or PVC and acts in a very aggressive way to her clients. So is this an unconscious attempt to mimic the shining black skin of Kali and her aggressive nature? All this suggests that Kali is a very powerful archetypal image, re-eme rging into our consciousness. It has been assumed that the Dominatrix sells only kinky sex, but she rarely has any sexual contact with her clients. So if the clients are not getting sexual satisfaction from her what do they get out of it? Her clients worship the Dominatrix as a Goddess, which is what Kali is, and wo rship is a very important aspect of religion. Most religions today separate religion fro m sex and some religions declare that sex is evil even though we couldn't reproduce without it. But in the past, sex and religion were closely linke d. The priestesses of the ancient Goddess religions of the past, were referred to as Temple prostitutes. By the later patriarchal religions to disparage and misrepresent what was happening in these Temples. In a Goddess Temple we have to assume that men were wo rshipping Goddesses. They may have been worshipping the Priestess as well, as representative of the Goddess. This is something that is happening today in Kali Temples in India. In the nineteenth century, the famous Hindu saint Sri Rama krishna, a devotee of Kali let it be known that he worshipped his wife. There is a tradition of the worship of young girls as Goddess in India that survives even today. It is of interest that when these girls become too old to play the role of Goddess they became pros titutes. So the roles of priestess and prostitutes ar e still linked in the minds of Hindus. If men are getting really turned on through worshipping Goddesses, it would encourage men to believe women ar e all Goddesses. They might begin to treat women with respect and to be dominated by them. If this is so, no wonder the patriarchal religions hated and feared sex, because they saw it as a threat to their power. This is probably why they would only allow sex in marriage where the wife had to swear to obey her husband, have sex in the \"missionary position\". The husband was also encourag ed to be a \"real\" man and beat-up his wife if she disobeyed him. So these images are telling us that Kali will return to conquer Siva (the male ruling class) and that she will do so through sexual conquest. We can see today as a increasing number of prostitutes are becoming Dominatrices, and there is a growing numbe r of women Domination se x-magazines for sale. Women's magazines, which used to concentrate on cooking, sewing and romanc e now have stories and articles on sex. Some even have nude males in them. It is also now acceptable for women to watch male strip-tease performances. So women are increasingly able to see men as sex objects to be used for their own pleasure. This is probably only the tip of an iceberg, reflecting the changes in men and women's sexual fantasies. Modern western women are demanding sexual satisfaction from men, while men are learning how to give it to them. Some of the more recent images show a white Kali on top of a black or white Siva, so the images are moving away from black versus white to the more direct male versus female image. It is possible to see Kali in a woman like Margaret Thatcher, as she showed so much aggr ession, determination and domination. Had she not become a politician she would ha ve made a great Dominatrix. So much so, that it becomes very easy to imagine all the men in her cabinet grovelling to her. Ex-ministers have appeared on TV and with a chuckle and a smile, described the appalling and outrageous way she treated the members of her cabinet and civil servants. It is noticeable that she never allowed another woman in her cabinet; perhaps another woman w ould have spoilt the fun! Young men today are seen pushing babies in prams, something a generation ago that would be unthinkable. In schooling, young women no longer dream of marrying a man and having children, but want careers. The result is that in the 21st century gi rls are now out-performing boys at school and higher education. It is claimed that because women are now better educated women will get all the important jobs in the future. The more that powerful women appear in our society, the more they will be sexually attractive to men, encouraging them to worshi p women and allowing th em to take power."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 [In the above picture we see a headless Devi mating with Siva.

This is shown in the many stories of Kali. There are many stories about Kali in Hinduism which all seem to be different versions of the same story, suggesting that they came from a single source in the distant past. It appears that over thousands of years, the story was altered to fit in with the changing beliefs and ideas of different generations, with each version retaining a similar theme. Some of the stories seem to be heavily influenced by the patriarchal bias of the Hindu religion; others ha ve somehow kept this to a minimum. it is one of these latter stories, translated into English by Ajit Moorkeriee in his book \"Kali, The Feminine Force\", that I would like to retell, to show how it can explain what is happening to our society today. In this tale. - The Great Goddess Durga or Devi was created by the united energies of the Gods when they became impotent after a long battle with Demonic Forces . The Demons are also called anti-Gods, and would be called Devils in western religions. When a new religion takes over a country the old Gods which existed before are usually turned into Devils. We can see this with Pan, who later became the Christia n Devil, or Set, who was once a benevolent God, but when religion changed, became an evil God and was later the Satan of Judaism and Christianity. So the Demons were possibly the previous Gods of the Hindus. One problem with our story is that in patriarchal religions, Gods are supposed to be all-powerful, and creators of the world. Most people have accepted that until quite recently that a male deity created the world. So to patriarchal people, God is all-powerful because he is the creator of the universe. To have Demons in this story who after a long war are more powerful than the Gods, points to it describing a time when the patriarchal age is in decline. Who are the Demons? The biggest threat to patriarchal religion in recent years has been science. In the seventeenth century, Newton s howed that planetary bodies move be cause of scientif ic laws and not by the hand of God. In the nineteenth century, Darw in put forward the theory that people and animals were created through evolution and not by God. Then in the 20th century, scientists postulated the \"Big Bang\" theory, which showed that the Universe expl oded from a singularity and was not created. Today, the Gods are no longer all-powerful, and in the we stern world many people do not believe in a God, or have serious doubts about his existence. So the story so far is a correct prophecy of now, the patriarchal Gods are finding themselves impotent in the face of the anti-Gods: science and atheism. To win popular support, Christianity in the West is starting to rid itself of many patriarchal attitudes. Many believers are rejecting the angry and judgmental God of the Old Testament, and returning to the more loving and caring Father God of the New Testament. They are also preaching the more matriarchal teachings of Jesus, wh ich is tolerance, and understanding of others, and using less and less, the strongly patriarchal teachings of the Old Testament, which emphasize intolerance and bigotry. Some are even going so far as to accept the concept of a genderless God and many sects are allowing women priests. In allowing the possibility that God could be both male and female, they are beginning to recreate a Goddess, as the Gods had to do in the Kali story in order to fight the Demons. Because the power of the Church has been broke n by science and rationality in our society, modern people in the West are free to worship a Goddess if they want to, thus the rise of the power of science is allowing the Goddess to return to us. Devi then has a long battle with the Great De mon and eventually destroys him. However, this victory was not the end of the ep isode. Two other Demons appeared w ith the intention of rendering the Gods impotent, so again they prayed for help from Devi. This part of the story is very similar to the later part of the story and seems to be two different versions of the same story joined together. There is a possibility that the stories of Kali are about the very ancient past as well as the future. If what is happenin g today has occurred in the distant past, it points to the possibility of a continuing cycle. In Hinduism as well as other ancient religions, the concept of great cycles or ages lasting hundreds of thousands of year s exists. We live today in the Kali-Yuga age (Age of Iron), which started about 5,000 years ago and will go on for another 400,000 years. It could be suggesting that in our world we have ages where the Demons rule the Earth, and have to be defeated by The Great Goddess later on in the age. So Kali defeated the Demons in the Last great-age and will defeat them again during this age. 5,000 years ago is at the be ginning of the Kali-Yuga age was also the time the recent patriarchal age started. So it does suggest that these ages start with patriarchy or demon rule and"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 then Kali defeats the demons or patriarchy and matriarchy comes into being until the end of the age, then a new age begins starting again with patriarchy. Devi then came to Earth again, in disguise. Ther e she is met by one of the Demons who try to persuade her to see the Demon King. But sh e very politely declines the offer. In the nineteenth century many women began to realize that men used them as slaves. In the USA some women campaigned against slavery, only to realize that the slaves had the same rights in society as they had. They complained about this to men who trie d to persuade them it was \"natural\" for women to be men's slaves and devote their lives to children and husbands. So women in the 19th century began to question the status quo and politely declined the \"reasonable\" arguments by men that they should accep t their position in society. Women beginning to demand equal rights didn't have any confidence in themselves. Men, who told them that women were not as clever as men because they had smaller brains, easily intimidated them. Or that women were too emotional to make sensible decisions about affairs of state. In the wr itings of the period, women show an undercurrent of anger about their situation of powerle ssness. But they rarely showed this anger to men and used the 'feminine' ways of pe rsuasion and patience to get their wa y. Women were disguising their feelings by being very polite to men, even though th ey felt great anger towards them. At the same time they didn't accept men's reasons for why they should remain dominated and go back to being submissive wives. The Demon King became enraged that Devi woul d not come to see him, and ordered a Demon Chief with an army to bring her to him by force. Wh en they attempted to do this, Devi reduced the Demon Chief to ashes with the vibration of a hum she made. His army was then destroyed by Devi's pet lion. The hum is used in Hinduism to create a harmonious vibration, which helps meditation. In this century, women began to protest they were being unfairly treated by men and demanded equality. Harmony is created by equality because inequality creates resentment and conflict. So it was through the very sensible and reasonable argument for equality, put forward by women, that they gained their first victory over patriarchy. First by the Suffragette m ovement that campaigned for women to have the vote in western countries and then the women's Liberation Movement that campaigned for true equality. By being able to articulate the different ways men and women were being treated within society, they shamed many men into allowing women more equal treatment. In very ancient religions, Gods were associated with animals; for example, Pan was half man and half goat and Horis was depicted as a bird-of-prey. A lion that can destroy an army has to have Godlike powers. If Devi is manifesting herself on this Earth through the women's movement, then it means the lion represents the men who have helped women to gain equality. Although men have not taken to the streets to campaign alongside women, women could not have achieved much in this century without the help of sympathetic men. These men were willing to vote for women's emancipation in male dominated legislative chambers, allow them into universities and employ them in male-dominated professional jobs. It was this type of men that countered the power of other men, who were greatly opposed to women gaining any form of power in our society. We can see a big difference in men as well as women from what was acceptable in the past and what is acceptable now. A Suffragist or women's liberation movement 400 ye ars earlier would have resulted in a Witch-hunt, where men tortured and burned alive millions of women, who it seems at the time \"didn't know their place\". The fact that this didn' t happen in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries shows that there had to be large numbers of men who were sympathetic to the women's movement and allowed it to progress without too much violent o pposition. So the Suffragettes and later on the women's Liberation movement created, in theory, a more ha rmonious society where men and women are given the same opportunities in society. When the Demon King learnt that his Chief and army had been destroyed he ordered two other Demons and a larger army to bring her to him by fo rce. On seeing this great army approaching her, Devi grew terrible with rage; her face turned black. Then from her frowning forehead jumped Kali, armed with a sword and noose. Kali is portrayed in the story as a hag, symbolizin g the fact that she is a very ancient Goddess, far older than Devi. Needless to say, mounted on her lion, she totally destroys, in the most horrendous way, the two Demons and their army. We are now on more uncertain ground, as this seems to be talking about something that will happen in the future. But there are signs that Kali is appearing in our society."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 [In the picture on the last page we see a Godd ess who represents the whole of womenkind lying asleep in an Egyptian crypt.

But it could have another mean ing because this is portrayed as an Egyptian scene and the Egyptian Sun Goddess is Sekhmet whom is also a li oness. The story of Sekhmet is very similar to the story of Kali, because like Kali she not only destroys the evil gods but also nearly destroys mankind as well. So if the lion is a representation of Sekhmet then it suggests that it is powerful women like Kali and Sekhmet that is needed to reawaken women. This scene is also similar to the re-awaking of Inanna where the God Enki saves her.] "},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 The Dominatrix was mostly created by men's sexual fantasies, but today in the 21st century there are now many women who are also being turned on by the Kali archetype. They are not content with the idea of equality with men and want to dominate them. Since the nineteen eighties there has been a backlash against the women's Movement by religious funda mentalists and right-wi ng politicians, who have attempted to reverse all the gains made by the feminist movements. They encourage women to fulfil their traditional roles again, bring back antiabortion legisl ation and blame higher crime rates onto single mothers. This has already created anger in the women's movement. As the fundamentalist movement gains in strength, women will be forced to abandon th eir \"we only want equality\" stance, and realize that they are caught in a power-game where \"the winner takes it all\". Equality is not yet possible. This will allow the women's movement to be led by women who will not be interest in equality but in winning. It is they who will inflict a def eat on the two demons of f undamentalism and right-wing politics. They will be helped by many men, symbolized by the pet lion Devi rides, who are greatly attracted to dominant women, and more than willing to worship them and be their servants, as well as to fight on the behalf of female power. The Demon King, hearing of this defeat, sets out with his brot her and an even Larger army against Devi, who separates different aspects of herse lf into many of the Hindu Goddesses and with the help of the loyal lion, destroys his army. When Ka li fights the Demon King's brother, every wound she inflicts produces thousands of smaller demons. In the end she can only defeat him by swallowing him whole. The women's Movement has never been complete ly united even though they claim that The Sisterhood Is Powerful'. What seems to be suggested is that the Feminists who will continue to claim they only want equality with men, and will try to distance itself from women who only want to dominate men. But the male backlash against women will polarize soci ety so much that they will be forced to fight alongside them. In the twentieth century most of women's gains were achieved by a small number of activists, while the vast majority of men and women were indifferent to the argument about women's rights. Equality between the sexes has not created widespread conflict in our society. But with rise of fundamentalists who want to put women back in their place, and women who will want to dominate society, this will polarise society. Very few people will be neutral about th ese demands, and many will fight with great passion, either for or against it. The backlash has been seen clearly in Mosl em countries like Afghanistan and Iran where fundamentalists have wiped out all the gains made by women in the 20th century. Probably the first countries to become matriarchal will be in the West, since it was in Northern Europe that patriarchy started. T oday, Scandinavian countries have moved further towards matriarchy than any others, so it seems that matriarchy will be gin there. With the West becoming matriarchal there will be problems in Eastern countries . Patriarchal rulers, seeing what has happened in the West, will try and prevent change, inevitably creating another wa r. The rulers will mount a propaganda campaign against women, out of their fear, making the wome n in these countries angry. With the support of matriarchal women from the West, patr iarchy will be resisted and over thrown. One of the best weapons against matriarchy by patriarchy has been to make patriarchal women breed continuously, so that the patriarchal races outnumber th e matriarchal. This is st ill true today, because in countries where women have gained some degree of equality the birth rate has dropped, while in soci eties which are still very patriarchal the birth rate is still increasing. So this is the demon that keeps on creating more demons, no matter how many times he is wounded. There is no point in trying to fight this demon; Kali could only defeat it by swallowing it whole. This means Patriarchy will have to be swallowed whole by matriarchy. The answer is not fighting, but an internal revo lution in which countries and religions will become matriarchal because the majority of the people want to be matriarchal. In Greek mythology, there is a similar story. Hercules is sent to kill the many-heade d Hydra. He attempts to do this by chopping off its heads, but each time he removes one, several grow in its place. He puts down his sword and drags the Hydra from its swamp into sunlight where it withers and dies. So it means enlightenment about the ills of patria rchy and the benefits of a female-ruled society will eliminate the demons of male domination. Many people will think it impossible that a religion Like Islam could become matriarchal in the future, but not all Moslems are fundamental extremists. The only reason we have extremists today in Islam is because it is changing to a more moderate religion, and the extremists want to get back to how"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 Islam was in the past. Women are still oppressed in Islam but they do not accept their lot so easily as their mothers did, so the men are finding it more difficult \"to keep them in their place\". Islam today recognizes the threat to it from atheistic scienc e and westernisation. The leaders of Islam know how important it is to keep popular support, and like Chris tianity will change to keep it. They have seen the demise of Christianity because it didn't change fast enough and quickly became out of step with the popular beliefs. The teachings of Mohammed like Jesus ar e open to many different interpretations. So if popular opinion begins to change towards feminism they will have no choice but to follow. This change is already happening in Roman Cat holic countries like Italy and Southern Ireland. Although in these countries birth control is still ba nned, the birth rates are not higher than any other European country and Italy has the lowest birth rate in Europe. Which means that most of the people are no longer following the Churches' doctrine of not using contraception. This gives the Church an uncomfortable choice, either to continue with its old laws or become completely out of step with the majority of the people, which will mean in time that they will become a minority religion. Or change and reflect the increasing power women have within society and eventually become a matriarchal religion. In the end only the Demon King was left, he started to taunt Devi, to encourage her to fight him on her own. She did not fall into this trap and brought t ogether all the different aspects of herself including Kali . Then mounted on her faithful Lion she destroyed the Demon King. As women start to overcome patriarchy, men will attempt to exploit the differences within the women's movement. So this is a warning to matriarchal women, not to allow internal differences to divert them from the main aim of defeating patriarchy. This realization will force women to forget their differences and join together as one, to bring about Patriarchy's final defeat. This also gives a suggestion on how patriarchy will be defeated by Matriarchy. The last matriarchal age seemed to have ended through the violence of men, where the aggression of men seemed to be an advantage over women. But aggression can be also a great disadvantage as shown when the Romans conquered Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The Romans were successful not because of their aggression, but because of the passivity of their troops who were willing to obey the orders of their generals without question. It was soon discovered on the battlefield th at a fighting force that fought together as one unit could easily defeat a much larger force that wasn't so united. The same thing happened in the English civil war in the seventeen century. The Royalists under Prince Rupert were mostly noblemen who even then were still a warrior clas s who learnt about warfare from an early age, as well as using mercenaries who were professional soldiers. With this advantage, Prince Rupert carried all before him early on in the war. His opponent Cromwe ll only had an army of farm-boys, who had no experience of war. But being on the bottom of the pecking order were used to doing as they were told, Cromwell trained them into a force known as the Iron-S ides. When they took to the field of battle they fought as one and proved to be invincible, Rupert never won another battle and lost the war. In business, and politics as well as war a number of people who are united can easily defeat a far larger number of people who are not united. This is men's disadvantage because their aggression makes it harder for them to unite with others, as they are more likely to argue with each other than women are. During the whole patriarchal age the only way men c ould become united was by having a strong leader, who achieved obedience though intimidation and promis e of reward. So a man who is working for a company is threatened with the sack if he doesn't do his job properly or receives reward in promotion if he is seen to do well. Women on the other hand have a far more responsible attitude to others and the community as a whole. They do not need rewards or threats to work for the good of others, and it has been only in this century that women have ever re ceived money for what they do. Even today women are still working for nothing, looking after houses and hus bands and bringing up children for no financial reward. This tack of ambition has been a disadvant age in a patriarchal society only whilst women have been kept separated by marriage. With marriage br eaking down there is now an opportunity for women to come together and be united. It has been noticeable that the feminist movement has achieved a lot without any leaders. All that was needed was for women to be informed of what was needed and they were able to organize themselves to benefit the cause. It is women's lack of aggression that makes it far easier for them to work together. Women fail to realize how much they have achieved in the twentieth century, changing from a situation of near slavery at the beginning of the ce ntury to near equality with men at the end. Which in historic terms is a very short space of time, somethin g that it took men thousands of years to achieve at"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 96 the end of the last matriarchal age. When women decide that they want to dominate and control society, men will be far too disorganized to prevent them. Even if all the fundamentalist forces join together to fight the women's movement, men will still be arguing and fighting among themselves and so will be too disorganized to resist the female Supremacists. After this The Great Goddess Durga departed, prom ising the Gods that she will nourish the world with vegetation growth . As this story is told in patriarchal times it w ould be unacceptable to say that The Great Goddess will remain to rule the world. So we have to see that as something that was added to make it acceptable, or it would never have been allowed to be told. This is confirmed because Kali is called by her followers in India as both \"The Savior of the World\" and \"Fem ale World Ruler\", as we do not have a Female World Ruler, it has to be prophecy for the future. [Again we have a headless Goddess on top of a defeated God. Note the naked women with swords, showing us it is strong Amazon women who will defeat patriarchy] The promise of the nourishment of the Earth is very interesting. Today with all our great forests being cut down and deserts Like the Sahara growing larger every year. Women will need to do a large amount of replanting to counter the Greenhouse effect and bring life back to many barren parts of our Globe. It is also of interest that the old Goddess Religi on held trees to be sacred, and were reluctant to cut them down. The later patriarchal re ligions had no such inhibitions, and cleared the land to create man- made deserts. So it seems women in the future will reverse this trend and bring life back to the devastated parts of the world. In other stories of Kali when she is defeating the armies of Demons, she gets drunk on drinking blood and cannot stop herself from killing. So much so, that the Gods fear that she will destroy all men on the Earth. In an attempt to save man, the God Siva come to the Earth and Lays on the ground in front of Kali. She walks all over him, and her anger evaporates. By doing this Siva in effect was totally surrendering himself to Kali. Which symbolizes, that women will in the future keep on fighting until they receive complete and unconditiona l surrender from men. The gory images that come from Kali are completely unlike women, after all it is men who have started and fought wars. Men commit most crimes of violence so in this way Kali doesn't fit into the image we have of women. In spite of this, men have"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 97 always suspected there is a tiger lurking within all women. Somehow the ima ge of Kali becoming drunk with drinking blood doesn't become a surprise to us. Rudyard Kipling wrote a very famous and popular poem call \"The female of the species\", which goes on to say \"is much deadlier than the male\", in a time when women were seen by society as very much the weaker sex. So it does indicate that we ha ve an unconscious knowledge that women to can be extremely aggressive. Feminists have been firm in claiming they only want equality with men. But within feminist writings there is a real anger against men. Which is not surprising with the thousands of years of abuse women have had to put up with from men. Women have a real fear of men and do think that if they ask for too much it will create a backlash and men will once again dominate women through the use of physical violence. So for this reason women prefer a quite revolution so as not to antagonise men too much by asking for too much, too quickly. Women probably underestimate themselves. If women want power then they have to make the Feminist slogan, 'The Sisterhood Is Powerful', work. Women are only at a disadvantage while they try to play the patriarchal game and compete with men individuality. This is where most men have the advantage because they are not only stronger and bigger than women but more aggre ssive as well. This is why marriage is a patriarchal invention because it give s men all the advantages. For women to gain real power requires them to work together. This is where women have an advantage; men tend to compete with each other and can only successfully work together under a strong leader. Recently scientific studies show that women don't need a strong leader for them to work together. Whether it is fighting patriarchy on the battlefield, in the boardroom or in politics, women will have the advantage if they create a powerful sisterhood. In the end what will decide the issue is whether, the majority of people in society will want to live under patriarchal or ma triarchal rule. As we can see around the wo rld today, women have more power in some countries than in others. Sooner or later we w ill have in a few countries with genuine matriarchal rule. If women can demonstrate that they are better ab le to rule society than men, in these countries, it will create a worldwide revolution. Not that they will ha ve to prove a lot, a look in history of how our world is run today. Demonstrates that women would have to try very hard, to do a worse job of running the world than what men do.

The problem for Christian ex- Freemasons is that what he is holding in one hand seems to be a flower, which Masons use as vagina symbol. While in the other hand he has a compass he seem s to be inserted into the flower, so it is another symbol of the sexual act. For fundamentalist Christians such symbolism would be blaspheme, but is it? Is the true nature of Jesus like that portrayed by orthodox Christians or wa s he something different? This is the problem in understanding, Revelation, at the end of the Christian Bible. If we take the orthodox view this vision makes no sense whatsoever, but if we open our minds to the possibility that the true nature of Jesus might be different to the orthodox view then we can make sense of the symbolism within Revelations. Some Freemasons claim that John is more important th an Jesus, to the degree that they claim to be Johnannite Christians. Which is inte resting, but which John do they worship? They're as three Johns in the New Testament. The First is John the Baptist, not a lot is said about him in the Bible yet he was a very important figure in early Christianity. To the degree an early Christian sects called themselves the Mandaeans and ignored Jesus and only worshipped John. In the official version of the New Testament John was beheaded by Herod because he promised a dancing girl Salome she could have anything she wanted. And at the request of her mother she asked for the head of John the Baptist and it was given to her on a dish."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 At first sight this is just an interesting tale but digging deeper you find there is more to it. So it is not a surprise to learn that Solome was also an Ae gean Goddess. She is supposed to have performed the dance of the Seven Veils to please Herod. Which today is just seen as an early form of strip tease. Yet in Goddess temples this was a very sacred dance that originally portrayed the Goddess Inanna's Journey through the Netherworld. The story is also about the sacrifice of the God or King to the Goddess. So the original story would be about John bein g sacrificed to the Goddess Solome. The story of a head in a dish is repeated in Arthurian Grail stories. Where Sir Perceval during his quest for the Holy Grail, has a vision of King's head being paraded on a bloody dish. It seems that this dish is also the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is suppose to be the cup which collected the blood of Jesus Christ as he died on the Cross. The Holy Grail is a symbol of the vagina wh ile the blood in it, is menstrual blood. We have similar symbolism in the ritual of the last supper where the sacrificial wine is al so a symbol of menstrual blood. So what is a man's head doing in the Holy Grail? To put it crudely, he is giving head. Our Christian conditioning would make us reject the idea that cunnilugus has anything to do with the Holy Grail. Yet we have to remember that Taoism, Tantra, Witchcraft and the Pre-Christian Mystery religions regard sex as sacred. So cunnilugus in a spiritual setting would be about a man worshipping a woman. The rituals of John being beheaded at the request of Solome, the Last S upper and the Crucifixion of Jesus are all about a God/King sa crificing himself to a Goddess. The second John is the disciple John that we have covered earlier, was either Mary Magdalene, or Jesus's homosexual lover depending which version you prefer. The last John was the author of Revelation. There is a possibility that he was the disciple John, (Mary) as well, but most Biblical scholars reject this and claim it was written long after the original disciples had died. Many Masons claim that Freemasonry originated from the Knights Templar, but there was another similar order around at the same time ca lled the Knights Hospitaller. They were so similar to the Knights Templar that the Pope attempted to merge the two orders together, and when the Knights Templar was destroyed many Templar Knights found refuge in the Knights Hospitallar. This order has survived until the present day and even has a seat in the United Nations as a sovereign country!? It is called, 'The Order Of St John' and for hundreds of years ruled the is land of Malta, defending ag ainst attempted Islamic invasions but surrendered without a fight to th e Freemason Napoleon Bonaparte. As mentioned previously Malta has ancient Goddess Temples that has survived to the present day, was the purpose of this order, the preservation of these Temples? It is assumed by many that the patron Saint of the order of St John is John the Baptists, but this is not made clear and they don't seem to rule out the disciple John or John the author of Revelation. The real mystery is why such a strange vision or dream was put in the New Testament, at all. Because it comes across as just the ravings of a madma n, as nothing in it makes sense. Many Christians have realized that perhaps there is a secret code within it, but nothing has come from this. The key to understanding Revelation is the same as understanding Freemasonry symbolism. It only makes sense if you realise that it is about the teachings of a secret Goddess religion. The problem with this vision is that it seems to show Jesus to be more like an avenging Jehovah God rather that the compassionate, tolerant and caring man that Jesus was portrayed earlier in the New Testament. This then means that the author either ha d no understanding of the true teachings of Jesus. Or he uses this contradiction to tell us where he had put his codes messages. In reading Revelations we come across this parado x from the very first. Revelations came to John from a supernatural being that he described like this. - His hair was white as wool, or as snow, and his eyes blazed like fire; his feet shone like brass that has been refined and polished, and his voice sounded like a roaring waterfall. He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came out of his mouth. His face was as bright as the midday sun. This angel or messenger is supposed to come fr om Jesus though interestingly his name is only mentioned, at the beginning and end of Revelation. In most of the narrative he is called either the Son of God or the Lamb of God. The angel gives a messa ge similar to what an Old Testament prophet would preach. As he will go on and on about how the wick ed will suffer terribly, while the good will be \"saved\". Yet Jesus wasn't in any way like an Old Testament prophet, he preached forgiveness and even"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 when he was nailed to the cross he was able to say of his persecutors. - \"Forgive them for they no not what they do\". The messenger himself is therefore a very frighteni ng and aggressive person unlike the gentle and caring figure of Jesus. So we have a problem either that this message didn't come from Jesus, or within it is a hidden message. The first strange description is that the messenger had a sharp two-edge sword came out of his mouth. Now this is completely absurd. No person in their right mind would put a sharp two-edge sword in his mouth. What is more he uses this sword while still in his mouth to fights \"sinners\". This is even worse because the difficulty of trying to fight others with a sword in the mouth, is to say the least, very difficult. So ludicrous is this that most commentators on Revelation tend to completely ignore it. But what if the original author of Revelation gave this preposterous description to draw attention to it? Remarkably this description is similar to Kali. In Christian terminology she would be seen as a female Devil, so is it no wonder the author had to keep her identity secret. Kali wasn't so foolish to have a sword in her mouth. But she is described as having a very long tongue that always hanged out of her mouth as she fought and destroyed Demons or Anti-Gods. So the image of the long tongue of Kali and a sword coming out of the mouth of the messenger is very similar. Also like this angel she is described as having blazing eyes and a great roaring voice. The two stories have very similar plots. In \"Revelations\" the story is about the Lamb of God leading a force of Angels to destroy \"sinners\", and to create a New Jerusalem. In the Kali story she and a number of other Goddesses destroy the Demons or Anti-Gods. I'm sure to many people this would also be absurd as what would an early Christian have to do with Hinduism? Yet he gives another cl ue in that \"His face was as bright as the midday sun\". Suggesting he is a Sun God. Now the ancient Egyptians had a similar story to Kali of the Lion Goddess Sekhmet who nearly destroys humankind in a mighty slaughter. Sekhm et was in her original form a Sun Goddess. This is why the astrology sign Leo is associated with the Sun. The astrology clue is empathised because in this angel's hand he held seven stars. Now the seven stars two thousand years ago would be the moving stars. These are the planets, moon and sun th at were visible to the naked eye. Christianity for hundreds of years either opposed or barely tolerated as trology, as it was seen as an as pect of Paganism. Astrology was practised by most Pagan religions throughout the Middle East and India. This suggests that this secret message was not for Christians but for those who had a wide understanding of all religions. So the original Revelation story may of come from Egypt, which was probably where it was written. The ancient Goddess religions were once a worldwide religion wher e the teachings were similar all over the world. The astrology connection continues with the next vision, which is about the throne of God and to quote-. Surrounding the throne on each of its sides, were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and behind. The first one looked like a lion; the sec ond looked like a bull; the third had a face of like a man's face; and the fourth loo ked like an eagle in flight. Again we have an absurd description of creatures covered with eyes front and back, which makes us look for a hidden meaning. In ancient Judaism th ere are the four principal banners of Judah. With Judah represented by a Lion or crown, Reuben by a Man, Ephraim by an ox and Dan by an eagle. Anyone interested in astrology would recognise the Li on as Leo, a fire sign and the bull as Taurus an Earth sign. The man and eagle wouldn't be recognis ed in modern astrology, but the eagle would in the early astrology coming from ancient Mesopotamia. Who like the Jews were Semites people. The Mesopotamians had a constella tion called Aquila symbolised by an eagle. The man symbol is a mystery although the Mesopotamians did have constellations named af ter Goddesses. In the very ancient past many Goddesses where changed into Gods, so a constellation named after a Goddess by the Mesopotamians would be changed into a God or man by the more patria rchal Jews. So the four banners of Judaism and the four living creat ures in Revelation would probably represent the air, fire, water and Earth of astrology. Then the Revelations goes on to say. - I saw a scroll in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne; it was covered with writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals. And I saw a mighty angel, who announced in a loud voice, \"Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll? "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 It seems there was no one until a lamb appeared w ho it seem had been sacrificed. It was this lamb that was worthy to open the scroll. Now a lamb to symbolise Jesus is a strange symbol. Up to a point it makes sense in astrological terms as when Jesus was born it was the end of the age of Aries the Ram. Except why a Lamb and not a Ram? The lamb has the reputation as the most gentle and harmless of creatures that will follow his mother anywhere. The lamb then is a good symbol of the gentle and caring Jesus we read about in the Gospels. Who went to his death \"like a lamb to the slaughter\". But it is not really a good symbol for the way Revelation is written. As it is about \"sinners\" being punished in the goriest fashion and only the \"good\" being saved. So by calling Jesus the Lamb of God the author is emphasising this paradox. Jesus preached tolerance but the religion that was named after him has a reputation of intolerance, bigotry and violence. By symbolising that only the Lamb could open the seven seals. Suggests that only a person, who can understand the true caring teachings of Jesus, can understand the hidden message within Revelation. Because a person who belie ves in the \"fire and brimstone\" fo rm of Christianity, will take Revelation at its face value and not see the contradictions within it. The vision continues. - Then I saw the Lamb break open the first of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice that sounded like thunder, \"C ome!\" I looked, and there was a white horse. Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown. He rode out as a conqueror to conquer. Then the Lamb broke open the second seal; and I heard the second living creature say, \"Come!\" Another horse came out, a red one, Its rider was given the power to bring war on the Earth, so that men should kill each other. He was given a large sword. Then the Lamb broke open the third seal; and I heard the third living creature say, \"Come!\" I looked, and there was a black horse. Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. I heard what sounded like a voice coming from among the four living creatures, which said, \"A litre of wheat for a day's wages, and three litres of barley for a day's wages. But do not damage the olive-trees and the vineyards!\" Then the Lamb broke open the fourth seal; and I heard the fourth living creature say, \"Come!\" I looked, and there was a pale-coloured horse. It s rider was named Death, and Hades followed close behind. They were given authority over a quarter of th e Earth, to kill by means of war, famine, disease and wild animals. The interpretation of the first four seals is very easy because it is a perfect description of the patriarchal society. Most of patria rchal history has been about warfare, conquest and genocide. It has also been about forced labour, slavery and the exploitati on of the common people by the rich and powerful. Which is what the third seal is about. It is ironic th at many commentators of Reve lation have seen this as a prophecy of the future and had not seen the wars and chaos that existed in their own time. It is also of interest that the pagan God Hades is also mentione d, what is a pagan God doing in a Christian vision? Then the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar of the souls of those who had been killed because they had proclaimed God's word and had been faithful in their witnessing. They shouted in a loud voice, \"Almighty Lord, holy and tr ue! How long will it be until you judge the people on Earth and punish them for killing us?\" Each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the comple te number of their fe llow-servants and brothe rs had been killed, as they had been. Again we see the incongruity, if Jesus's teachin gs were all about judgement then there is no problem in the martyrs demanding revenge. Yet it is this desire for revenge that keeps wars going. We can see this clearly in a place like Northern Ireland where both the Catholics and the Protestants are unable to forgive each other for the wrongs they have done each other in the past or in the Balkans where again the Serbs, Croats and Moslems are also unable to forgive each other. This has kept conflicts going for hundreds of years. So this is a comment on the patriarchal society and the source of the chaos it creates. Which was clearly understood by Jesus who taught his disciples to \"love your enemies\". The sixth seal describes an end of the world sc enario, though again will have a contradiction as people hide in terror - Fall on us and hide us from the eyes of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb! The terrible day of their ange r is here, and who can stand against it? “The terrible anger of the Lamb”?! This is surely a very inappropriate symbol; lambs have never been noted for their anger. So again this is a sign that there is a hidden meaning here. Another strange"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 saying in the Bible is that, \"the meek shalt inherit the Earth\". Which is impossible in our competitive, masculine world. Both the description of the Lamb and the meek would apply to patriarchal women who have allowed men to dominate and abuse them. In recent times we see signs of the \"worm turning\". Women today are not so accepting of the dominance and abuse of men. Within many women there is a lot of unexpressed anger again men which if allowed to continue will bring about the avenging Kali aspect of women. Then we come to the famous bit where 144,000 were marked with the seal of God so as not to be harmed by - The four angels to whom God had given the power to damage the Earth and sea. I personally never heard of angels damaging the Ea rth and sea, and I don't somehow expect it to happen in the future. But in our present age we do see with modern technology people who now have the power to do this. So the four ange ls who damage the Earth could be governments, industry, science and technology. As all four collude to pollute the e nvironment with toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases. As well as over fish the oceans, cut-down rain forests, and dump nuclear waste. In the 21st century it can be confidently predicted there will be a number of man-made disasters, as we are starting to see through global warming. Also what is not so well known is there is a 50% decrease in men's sperm count caused by toxins bei ng dumped into our food chain. In has been predicted that by 2030 most men will be unable to father a child as their sperm count will be too low by then. There are other possible dangers like the irresponsible use of genetic engineering, and nuclear weapons getting in the hands of terrorist groups or despot ic dictatorships. The 144,000 people being saved from these disasters suggest that some people will so me how survive these man-made catastrophes. Then in the vision John witnesses a large crowd who had received salvation. When he asked who they were he was told. - These are the people who have come safely thro ugh the terrible persecution. They have washed their robes and made them white with the blood of the Lamb\". Christians of course assume these people are Chri stian martyrs, and to be fair this would be correct prophecy, because persecution of Christians continued in Rome long after John's death. Even when Christianity became the state religion, persecu tion continued on those who were the \"wrong\" type of Christians. That is to say the Christians who we re not willing to toe the party line as decreed by the state. So Revelation could be a bout The Rome Empire becoming Christianise and the \"New Jerusalem\" would then be the Holy Roman Empire. Yet not ev en Christians accept this explanation. probably because Christianity as a state religion didn't have much to recommend it, as a New Jerusalem. Over the centuries the Christians have probably persecuted far more people than had been done to them. Persecution does seem to be fairly normal behaviour in patriarchal societies. The reason for this is that patriarchal societies seem to hate change. So any person that deviates from what seems to be \"normal\" is given a hard time and can be even tortured and murdered. So if we are looking for martyrs they may not be Christian. As previously pointed out the lamb is a strange symbol for this narrative. As the lamb is the most gentle and innocuous creature one could wish for. The people that had been persecuted were \"w ashed clean with the blood of the lamb\". Suggesting that they to were lamb like in their behaviour and were persecuted because of it. So who would they be? It is true that a few Christian sect s have adopted a non-violent way of lif e, but this is a small minority. The average Christian male has shown himself over the years to be a very aggressive and violent person. Christian priests in the past have encouraged men to beat their wives to keep them in order. In the Middle Ages the Christian Church started Witch-hunts that caused the deaths of Millions of women. They also encouraged laws that took away women's right. So if we are looking for martyrs a good candidate would be women. The Seventh Seal is broken and we have another string of disasters, like volcanoes, meteors hitting the Earth, plagues of locusts and perhaps nuclear warfare. All this has happened in the past and may again happen in the future. John is then given a secret but is warned not to write it down. Then he is given a little scroll and is told to eat it, which tasted sweet in his mouth but sour in his stomach. Revelation is written in a style of fire and brimstone, which goes down well with patriarchal Christians. So this style would be sweet to these people. The fact that it turned sour in John' s stomach suggests its hidden meaning would be an \"unpalatable truth\" for patriarchal Christians."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 The next part is about two witnesses who turn out to be prophets. That are able to destroy anyone who harms them with fire that come out of their mouths. This suggests they are charismatic orators who are able to turn a crowd against anyone who oppose them. The doctrine of ma ny hellfire and damnation orators has been a message of hate, to the degree of inflaming people to commit genocide. These two prophets were attacked and killed by a great beast that came out of the abyss. Their bodies are left in the street, a nd the vision continues to say.- The people of the Earth will be happy because of the death of these two. They will celebrate and send presents to each other, because those two prophets brought much suffering upon mankind. Probably the two prophets were Christianity and M ohammedanism and the beast that attacked them would then be atheistic science. Newton in the 17th century showed that the planets moved through scientific laws and not by the ha nd of God, as believed at that time. Then in the 19th century Darwin wrote his theory of evolution, which undermined the be lief that God created life. Since then the success of science has greatly decreased the power of all patriarchal religions. It is interesting that it is stated in Revelation that these two patria rchal religions have brought mu ch suffering upon mankind and people celebrated when they died. If we look back to the last 150 years we can see that although atheism has it faults. It still has created a far more humane and tolerant society than patriarchal religions. So the people had good reason to celebrate. The beast also came out to the abyss which is a feminine symbol as in Ancient times is would be the symbol of the vagina of The Earth Mother. Both Christianity and Mohammedanism greatly opposed science in the past and tried to destroy it because they rightly saw science as a threat to their authority. So it suggests that scientific thought came from the Goddess to destroy the power of patriarchal religions. Then the two prophets came back to life and there was a viol ent Earthquake, and the people became terrified. In more recent times there has b een a right-wing/fundamentalist backlash, affecting mostly Islam countries but also some Christian countri es as well. As countries like Iran and Afghanistan turned back to fundamental Islam and have promoted terrorism against the atheis tic western counties. To a lesser degree, countries like USA or Britain have atte mpted to \"turn back the clock\" and enforce \"family values\" on the people, in an attempt to stop the erosion of the patriarcha l society and religion. The next chapter is about the elders around the th rone of God saying it is time for God to judge the dead. The last line of their proclamation they say. - The time has come to destroy those who destroy the Earth! Now any environmentalists would have no probl ems in understand who these people who were. They would be to them the scientists and the industrialists who are at present polluting the Earth, oceans and atmosphere. Then a woman appeared. - Whose dress was the sun and who had the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. Before Christianity and Moha mmedanism took control there wa s Sun-Gods and Moon-Goddesses, in pagan religions. The sun has a far more powerful light than the moon. So a Sun-God was seen as being more powerful than a Moon-Goddess. These deities were still around at the time Revelation was written, and John probably had seen their Temples. This suggests that the women those \"dress was like the sun\" might be a sun-Goddess. As they existed in very ancient times with moon Gods. This is confirmed by the fact she has the moon at her feet. So it means she is no longer \"the lesser light\" which is how the Moon deities were seen. She is now the mo re powerful Sun, which suggests the man has now become \"the lesser light\" of the moon under her feet. The twelve stars on her head could also be a reference to astrology, as there are twelve astrological signs. Neither patria rchal religions nor science liked as trology but it has been adopted by modern paganism, so it could be about the paganistic revival we see today in the west. The woman is about to give birth. Is this the bi rth of the new matriarchal age? A Red dragon appears who dragged a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down on the Earth. As the woman had twelve stars around her h ead, it suggests that this dragon tried to destroy astrology. Which would be a symbol of modern paganism, Witchcraft and the new-age movement who all use astrology. Both Christianity and atheistic science have attempted to destroy and discredit these movements."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 104 He stood in front of the woman, in order to eat her child as soon as it was born. Then she gave birth to a son, who will rule over all nations with an iron rod. But the child was snatched away and taken to God and his throne. Now it has to be admitted that if this child was the birth of a new matriarchal age it should be a girl. But to state this in Revelation would be impossi ble as it would be censored. Though it is more than likely this child was the lamb, which is the very passi ve or submissive man, which is still a good symbol of the matriarchal age. This passage does also suggest that patriarchal religions and atheistic science attempted to destroy matriarchy before it even got starte d but it received divine protection. If this child is Jesus then there is a problem because the child will \"rule over all nations with an iron rod\". Which is not the behaviour you would expect from the gentle lamb- like Jesus. Though it could be the behaviour of a Kali-like women. Then a war broke out in heaven between the drag on and angels, which suggests this could be a religious war. In recent times with the decline of Christianity, other spiritual groups have appeared instead. Like Spiritualism, occult groups, the new-age movement, paganism and W itchcraft. Christianity has been unsuccessful in attempting to stamp out these groups and is now on the decline. When the dragon realised that he had been th rown down to the Earth, he began to pursue the woman who had given birth to the boy. Which is what has happened in recent times a lthough the power of Christianity has been destroyed. More extremist Christia ns have greatly opposed feminism an d liberal laws that had allowed abortion and homosexuality. Again in the story it is divine protection th at saves the woman. Then a great beast came out of the sea and, - The dragon gave the beast his own power , his throne, and his vast authority. This is what has recently happened, the authority of the Patriarchal Church has been past onto Science. Which now has the authority and power in so ciety that the Church use to have. This beast had been wounded but recovered, which is what happened to science hundreds of years ago. Religions like Christianity and Mohammedanism had persecuted sc ience for hundreds of years, and at times all but stamped it out. But it recovered to come back an d overthrown the power of patriarchal religion. The beast was allowed to make proud claims whic h were insulting to God, and it was permitted to have authority for forty-two months. It began to cu rse God, his name, the place where he lives, and all those who live in heaven. It was allowed to fi ght against God's people and to defeat them, and it was given authority over every tribe, nation, language, and race. All people on the Earth worshipped it, except for those whose names were written before the cr eation of the world in the book of the living which belongs to the lamb that was killed. This confirms that the beast is atheism. It had many heads like atheistic science, communism, capitalism and materialism. Probably the other heads are a variation on these themes. It was Marx who denigrated religion as \"the opium of the people\", while atheistic science has treated the belief in a supreme God as a fairy story. So these would be the insults the beast gave to God. Communism whenever it took power banned and oppressed religions . While atheistic scie nce has taken over the world, with the majority of people looking towards scie nce rather than religion to solve their problems. Yet saying that the beast only had authority for forty-two months suggests its power is only temporary. As we see today were atheistic science is finding it is fighting a losing battle against the \"unreason\", of the paranormal, astrology, \"alternative\" medicine and the new-age movement. Science has also a new challenge from Christianity of, \"Intelligent Evolution\", which claims that life and intelligence was not created by blind chance as advocated by atheist scie ntists but by a guiding intelligence which brings God back into science. The last sentence of the quotation poses a proble m; most Christians would assume that the people who didn't worship the beast would be them. But as already pointed out the Dragon is patriarchal religion which handed its power over to atheism. As we can see all over the world, religions have compromised with atheistic science. And are now bowing down to it, as it has no answ er to the power of science, and technology. Then I saw another beast, which came up out of the Earth. It had two horns like lambs horns, and it spoke like a Dragon. It used the vast authority of the first beast in its presence. It forced the Earth and all who live on it to worship the first beast, those wounds had healed. This second beast performed great miracles; it made fire come down out of heaven to Earth in the sight of everyone. And it deceived all the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" 105 people living on Earth by means of the miracles whic h it was allowed to perform in the presents of the first beast. The second beast sounds very much like technology . It is technology today that can perform \"miracles\", and the fire from heaven could be nucl ear explosions, which has been the most spectacular demonstration of the po wer of technology. The second Beast was allowed to breathe life into th e image of the first beast, so that the image could talk and put to death all those who would not worship it. Both atheistic science and technology work to gether, with technology coming from scientific research, giving them material expression and power. Technology also gives atheism authority and power, and weapon technology did allowed the atheis tic communists to impose atheism onto millions of people. While western atheists have also imposed atheism onto the world, forcing people to worship it through becoming dependant on materialism. The beast forced all the people, small and great, rich and poor, slave and free, to have a mark placed on their right hands or on their foreheads. No one could buy or sell unle ss he had this mark, that is, the beast's name or the number that stands for the name. Technology now has brought about the possibility of having a \"cashless society\" and instead of everyone having money or credit cards that can be lo st or stolen. There is talk about having a small electronic chip placed under the skin of people's hand or forehead. This does at first sight sounds like a good idea. But as \"Conspiracy theorists\" point out the electronic chip can be used also as an electronic tag, which will allow the police or secret services to keep track off and monitor everyone in society. This could create an Orwenian nightmare, where it would be very easy for governments to impose totalitarian regimes onto the people. It goes on to say, - This calls for wisdom. Whoever is intelligent can work out the meaning of the number of the beast, because the number stands for a man's name. Its number is 666. This number has caused great speculation about who this man is, and people like Hitler and Aleister Crowley have been named as the beast 666. Though this is only wild speculation with little reason for this except these men are seen as being \"evil\". In Barbara G. Walker's book The Woman's Encyclopaedia of Myths and Secrets , she tells us that in ancient times the number 6 was the number of sexual intercourse, this was becau se it was the union between the Trip le Goddesses and their consorts. The triple six then became the number of the Triple Aphrodite as she was the Goddess of love. So she claims that the beast 666 is the number of the Goddess Aphrodite. This could be a hint as to when this will ha ppen. Patriarchy suppress ed all promiscuous sex because it was only through the rigid marriage institution that a man could know who his children were. Atheism when it took power never understood why marri age was so important to patriarchy and allowed it to deteriorate. If the beast 666 is the symbol of promiscuous sex then it would be when patriarchy is breaking down and people were free to have sex w ith whoever they pleased. The sexual revolution started in the west during the 1960s at the same time women's Liberation started, where people openly had sexual relations outside marriag e and the oppressive laws against homosexuality were repealed. So freedom is the sign of the beast 666 this will mean the beginning of the end of patr iarchy and the return of the Goddess. Then Revelation goes on about the 144,000 that will be saved. As well as saying that they never tell lies that they are faultle ss and they are all virgins. Now what is strange about this is apparently all these 144,000 virgins are males. The word virgin is mo stly used in connection with women, not men. In patriarchal marriages it is important that the bride is a virgin but not the bridegroom. As it is women who have children, she will always know who is her child. (Unless she gives birth in a modern hospital where nametags get mixed up). But for the man he can onl y know who are his children if he can be sure his wife is \"faithful\" to him. For this reason it used to be acceptable for men to have mistresses, or go to prostitutes. But for a woman to be unfaithful was considered to be a \"sin\" and in the past it was punished by death. So in saying that these men are virgins could be a hint that these men are as passive as patriarchal women. Because the idea of a man who have. - Kept them selves pure by not having sexual relations with women. - Before they got married, th ey would be regarded as complete wimps in very macho patriarchal societies. As this is how macho men regard any man who admits to being a virgin. Also the older meaning of virgin is of women who do not belong to any man and are therefore free. We"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" 106 have all been seduced by the materialistic society; to the degree we are dependant on it. But there have always been people who have attempted to break this dependence. Like many hippies who are into self- sufficiency or people who pay to go on courses to l earn how to live off uncultivated land. So these people are attempting to be free of materialism. Revelation goes on to say that Jesus the Lamb led all his followers to overthrow the power of the beasts. Although women today are getting more and mo re assertive, as pointed out in an earlier book I co-authored called Gospel of the Goddess . Women will for a long time have smaller egos than men. So it is not easy for them to get up and say. \"We can do a far better job at running the world then men\". But it is a lot easier for passive men to say this. So we might have to look to these types of men to give women confidence in themselves to overthrow the patriarchal society. Revelation then goes on to proc laim the good news that the Great Babylon has fallen. I think it would be very easy to suggest that Babylon is the materialistic society we live in. This is made clear when it later goes on to say. - The businessmen of the Earth also cry and mour n for her, because no one buys their goods any longer; no one buys their gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; their goods of linen, purple cloth, silk, and scarlet cloth; all kinds of rare woods and all kinds of objects made of ivory ...The businessmen say to her \"All the good things you longed to own have dis appeared, and all your wealth and glamour are gone and you will never find them again! So what destroyed Babylon? It says that not only Babylon was destroyed, and the cites in all count ries were destroyed. It seems Babylon was destroyed by an Earthquake but it doesn't say how the other cites were destroyed. Though it does discuss The Bowls of God's Anger, these are seven bowls that angels pour on the Earth. Bowls are another Goddess symbol like that of th e Witch's Cauldron and The Holy Grail, simply because these are all symbols of the vagina. The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the Earth. Terrible and painful sores appeared on those who had the mark of the beast and on those who had worshipped its image . Doctors in recent years have had great success at combating disease through antibiotics. Unfortunately the bacteria has been able to become immune to these antibiotics. So scientists have to always to produce a new form to combat the new strains of bacteria. Now doctors are admitting that they are losing this war as new strains of dangerous diseases are appearing that no antibiotic can destroy. Bringing about the possibility of plagues like we experienced during the Middle Ages. Another possibility is that there are food-manufactures who wa nt to introduce new genetic engineered food. We can be sure that they will be totall y irresponsible in doing this, because of the very large profits that can be made. Which will overwhelm any consideration of possible dangerous effects these foods might have. So this could result in mass food poisoning in the future. Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea. The water became like the blood of a dead person, and every living creature in the sea died. All over the world industries are pouring millions of t ons of toxic waste into the seas, as it is far cheaper to get rid off toxic waste by dumping it into the sea than to find a way to make it harmless. Scientists used to claim that the oceans where so vast that they would dilute the harmful effects of the toxins. This premise is now showing itself to be false, as there is becoming a limitation to what seas and oceans can tolerate. Already around industrial areas th e water is becoming too polluted to safely swim or surf in. Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood. The pollution in many rivers and lakes have got so bad in recent years that all life in them has been destroyed. Then the fourth and angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to burn people with its fiery heat. This is probably to do with ozone depletion. In countries like Australia people are now covering up in the sun where skin-cancer is on the increase. As the ozone-layer is becoming very thin over this continent. The same thing is now happening over Europe and Northern America where governments are advising people not to sunbathe for fear of skin-cancer."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" 107 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast. Darkness fell over the beast's kingdom, and people bit their tongues because of their pain. The Beast's kingdom or throne would be the in dustrial factories in an d around cities. Already these plants cause pollution to the degree it covers whol e cities. As well as accide ntal releases of toxic gases that have maimed and killed ma ny thousands of people, in places like Italy, Spain and India. Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl and on th e great river Euphrates. The river dried up. Recently it has been officially acknowledged that Global Warming is a fact, but how warm will the Earth become in the 21st century no one really know s. With a warmer climate and changing weather patterns caused by it, great rivers may well dry up. The last angel destroyed Babylon with an Eart hquake; it is well known th at large cities like San Francisco are built on fault-lines. This makes the possibility of a large city being destroyed by an Earthquake very likely in the near future. The whole materialistic society can only keep going while the public has confidence in it. Experiencing the seven plagues like that mentione d in Revelation, is going to undermine people's confidence in science and technology, more so if science gets the blame fo r all of the plagues. This will result in large numbers of people looking for alternativ es to materialism. This is what will destroy Babylon more than anything else. To quote- \"The bus inessmen of the Earth also cry and mourn for her, because no one buys their goods any longer;\" People might of stopped buying goods because they may not want to have anything to do with technology any longer. After seeing the harm it can do in the hands of irresponsible people. Among all this carnage Revelation had one chapter on \"The famous Prostitute\", she is described like this, - There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast that had names insulting to God written all over it; the beast had seven heads and ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and covered with gold ornaments, precious stones, and pearls. In her hand she held a gold cup full of obscene and filthy things, the result of her immorality. On her forehead was written a name that has a secret meaning \"Great Babylon, the mother of all the prostitutes and perverts in the world. So what is the secret meaning about the name Gr eat Babylon? And why is it a secret? Would it be because if the meaning became clear it would be censored? Now in reading Revelation there is a problem even though it is about Jesus, the whole tone of it is wrong. Jesus taught to \"love your neighbours as yourself\" and \"Do not judge others\". So to lead angels into destroying cities because he doesn't agree with how they behave, is not really his style. Not only that he mixed with prostitutes and spoke up for them. As with the prostitute who was a bout to be stoned where Jesus told the crowd, \"Who is truly without sin may cast the first stone\". Mary Magdalene is also supposed to be by tradition a prostitute. The way that it is written it seems to mean that Jesus condemns prostitutes, but when we read of what he really taught in The New Testament, we find he doesn't. So the secret meaning is clearly not about this. What Revelation does seem to be saying is that Great Baby lon (the materialistic society) was controlled by women before it fell. Because Great Babylon is called The Famous Prostitute also she is riding on, \"a red beast that had names insulting to G od written all over it.\" So she has taken over control of the materialistic and atheistic society, which attack s religion as a delusion. Also \"she is covered with gold ornaments, precious stones, a nd pearls.\" Which means she is a very rich and powerful woman. Now at the beginning of the 21st century we do find a few women who are very rich and powerful and some have been rulers of countries. Women are also gaining power in all other patriarchal institutions, and breaking down the \"glass ceilings\" that are holding them back. So in saying that Great Babylon will fall when women start to rule society is a confirmation when it will happen. She is also called, \"the mother of all the prostitutes and perverts in the world.\" In recent years some prostitutes have became more dominant and call themselves Dominatrices. Although many Dominatrices deny that they are prostitutes, as they see prostitutes as being too passive. With many being dominated and abused by pimps, and doing whatever the client want them to do, while professional Dominas are certainly not passive and dominate men instead. The perverts would of course be the Dominatrice's clients, who would be seen that way by most of society. As they pay these Dominatrices to bound, whip, humiliate and abuse them. Some will also pay to worship and kiss the feet and bottom of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" 108 the Dominatrix or drink her urine. So it suggests that this trend will grow and sadistic women and masochistic men will grow in number, until it becomes \"normal\". But calling her a prostitute can have another meaning. The saying \"To prostitute yourself,\" means that a person does something he doesn't believe i n, but does it for money and power. Now that women are beginning to learn how to love themselves, the onl y role model they have, are patriarchal men. Who are extremely selfish and aggressive and haven't learnt as yet how to love others. So many women today are trying to act, dress and behave like men. In th e \"dog eat dog\" patriarchal society women only see two choices, either they love others a nd are taken advantaged of by patr iarchal men. Or they suppress all what they have learnt about loving and caring for others and behave lik e patriarchal men. So many rich and powerful women today have to behave in a way they do not really agree with, but feel that they have no choice in doing this to gain power and status in the patriarchal society. This is confirmed when it goes on to say, - And I saw that the women was drunk with the blood of God's people and the blood of those who were killed because they had been loyal to Jesus . So these powerful women have become patriarchs themselves. A good example of this would be Margaret Thatcher who held very strong patriarchal views. While in power she never acknowledged any debt or companionship with the women's movement. She never helped in anyway other women to gain power, by never allowing another woman in her cabin et. And even gave speeches and passed laws to encourage women to \"go back to the home\". So she was part of the \"backlash\" that the women's movement experienced during the ni neteen eighties. She never showed any compassion for the poor or deprived, as you would expect from a woman. And she came across as a completely ruthless woman, who saw any feelings of caring for others as a \"weakness\". The chapter goes on to talk about a number of king s who rule for a while who then are defeated by the Lamb. This probably means their used to be many patriarchal ages in the past, which were replaced by matriarchal ages. The chapter finishes by saying that, - the beast, will hate the prostitute; they will ta ke away everything she has and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and destroy her with fire. Fo r God purpose by acting together and giving the beast their power to rule until God's words come true. This is exactly what happened to Margaret Thatch er when she was Prime Minister of Britain. She had been the most successful Prime Minister in Britain the 20th century. She had won three elections, and had fought well for what her pa rty believed in. By breaking the pow er of the unions and privatising most of the state's ownership of industry. Then, af ter all what she had achieved, her party turned against her, attacked and humiliate d her and threw her out of office. The same thing happened also to Benazir Bhutto, she was elected Prime Minster of Pakistan in 1988 and was deposed by a military coup in 1990. She later became prime minister again but ag ain she was betrayed, slandered and deposed. Though clearly this prophecy is not only about Marg aret Thatcher or Benazir Bhutto, in the future many other women will become rulers of count ries. The chapter finishes by saying,- The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the Earth. There is not today one city that rules over the rest of the world. But the most powerful and materialistic society today is the USA, where women in comparison to most other countries have great power. So it could mean that Great Babylon is the USA, who has the military a nd economic power to tell all the other nations of the world what to do. We know today that women do not rule the USA, but they are getting there. So is it suggesting that one day there will be a women President of the USA? And when this happens, then there will be a patriarchal backlash. Where a war between patriarchy and matriarchy will start and Kali will be let loose. After the fall of Great Babylon, Revelation then goes on to a chapter on The Wedding-Feast of the Lamb, the bride is hardly mentioned at all except to say. - She has been given clean shining linen to wear. (The linen is the good deeds of God's people). At the end of Revelation it turns out that the Bride is The New Jerusalem. Which does suggest that, women will rule the New Jerusalem like the Gr eat Babylon. This would suggest that after the materialistic society collapses. Many people will then create an alternative and genuine matriarchal society. The clean shining linen, the bride wears a symbol that she is now no long contaminated by"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":" 109 patriarchal thinking. So is therefore able to be dominant and caring at the same time. While the Lamb becomes the passive man who is willing to accept her domination. The next chapter reads very much like the Kali stories, where all the armies of the Beasts are defeated and slaughtered by. - The Rider on the White Horse, who, - Out of his mouth came a sharp sword, with which he will defeat the nations . As pointed out before this is a very strange place to hold and use a sword. Which suggests a link with Kali who is n early always shown with her tongue sticking out. It goes on to say.- He will rule over them with a rod of iron, and will trample out the wine in the winepress of the furious anger of the Almighty God. As pointed out earlier according to Revelation it is Jesus who will rule the world. So this figure must be Jesus, except that to \"rule over them with a r od of iron,\" or to slaughter great armies, is not really his style, and not the sort of behaviour you would ex pect from a Lamb. To trample out the wine is a Kali symbol as she tramples all over Siva, and in her stor ies she also has a furious anger as she slaughters demons. So the chapter suggests a war between the patriarchal and matercentic societies. Whether it will be a physical war or more a war of words and ideas is hard to say. If it is a physical war it may not be only about Amazons fighting patriarc hal soldiers on the battlefield. Th ere will probably be many \"lambs\" who will also lay down their lives for their mistresses. Also there will be many patriarchal women fighting for patriarchy. Though how it reads in both Revelation and the Kali st ories it sounds more like a slaughter of the patriarchal forces than a war. This has been true of many battles in the past. Where brilliant war leaders like Napoleon or Alexander the Great, when confronted with incompetently lead forces have turned battles into little more that slaughters. The Beast was taken prisoner, together with the false prophet who had performed miracles in his pres ence. Which suggests that science and technology. Who make predictions of the future and perform technological \"miracles\". Will now be in the hands of matriarchal women. Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the abyss an a heavy chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpen t - that is, the Devil, or Satan and chained him up for a thousand years. The ancient meaning of the abyss was the genital orifice of the Great Mother from which all creation came. So this could be a symbol of us all returning to the Great Mother. After a thousand years the dragon is let loose again. So it is again about the cycle of patriarchal an d matriarchal societies. Then comes The final Judgement, which finishes by saying. - Whoever did not have his name written in the book of the living was thrown into the lake of fire. Again it has to be said that judging and condemning others was not Jesus's style. What it probably means is that people who still are patriarchal in attitude, will soon die out. And only people who are matriarchal in character would be reincarnated on the Earth during the coming matriarchal age. Then there is The New Heaven and the New Earth, This suggests that in a matriarchal society there will be a new reality. Which means in a matriarchal society everything on the Earth will become different, because people will treat it in a different way. While in heaven there will be no longer an angry judgmental God or no God at all. So the Ne w Heaven will be The Goddess who loves us all unconditionally. The new Jerusalem appears and a loud voice says.- It is done! I am the first and the last, the begi nning and the end. To anyone who is thirsty I will give the right to drink from the spring of the water of life without paying for it. Whoever wins the victory will receive this from me: I will be his God, and he will be my son. In saying that he is the first and last, it was Christianity that started the first truly patriarchal religion throughout Europe and later the world. That is to say, a religion that worshipped a God without any Goddesses in it. Then when Matriarchy comes in to being it will come about when men adopt the true teachings of Jesus and become like lambs. So in a sense it was Jesus who started the truly patriarchal age and it will be him who will end it. Or it could again be a reference to the matriarchal/patriarchal cycle. He says that he will give anyone the right to drink without paying for it. This is a hint that a matriarchal society will be completely different from a patriarchal society where probably ownership and trade will no longer exist. In saying that we will all be sons of God\", means that in matriarchal terms we will all be the children of the Godde ss or a female God. The victory is the realisation that the Goddess"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 loves us all unconditionally, because we are her childre n and will always be there for us if we allow her to. The next chapter in on the new Jerusalem.- One of the seven angels who had th e seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, \"Come and I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" The spirit took control of me, and the angel carried me to the top of a very high mountain. He showed me Jerusalem the Holy City, coming down out of heaven from God. It then goes on to describe Jerusalem but didn't mention the wife of the lamb of God again. The wife of the Lamb being Jerusalem can explain this oversight. Which confirms that the New Jerusalem is a matriarchal society. The New Jerusalem is described as, - The city has no need of the sun or the moon, because the glory of God shines on it. In other words this society instead of relying on matter for life, relies only on the support of The Great Mother. Then it goes on to say, - And the Lamb is its lamp. Which suggests that the Lamb is the lesser light, that is to say, lesser to the glor y of the Goddess and the women who represent her on the Earth. The gates of the city will stand open all day; they will never be closed, because there will be no night there . This reminds one of the ancient Goddess city of Catal Huyuk, which never had city-walls at all and stood undefended for thousands of ye ars. So it is suggesting that their no longer be any need to defend the city as there will be no longer any warfare. In saying that there will never be any night there is restating that the light of the Goddess will always be there to look after the city. Then Jesus appears, he prevents John bowing down to him by saying Don't do it! I am a fellow- servant of your ...perhaps this means a fellow-servant of the women who now rule. It certainly means that this is the humble Jesus we read about in the Gospels. He goes on to say.- Whoever is evil must go on doing evil, and whoever is filthy must go on be ing filthy; whoever is good must go on doing good, and whoever is holy must go on being holy. This sounds more like the true Jesus who does not judge others and allows them to be themselves. During the patriarchal age men had to learn how to love themselves, while women learnt to love others. No blame can be put on to anyone for learning these lessons. So it is pointless to condemn a patria rchal man for being selfish and sadistic , as it is to condemn a patriarchal woman for being \"weak\" and masochistic. So it does mean that the author of Revelation did understand the true nature of Jesus. So in portraying him like an Old Testament prophet was only a way to allow Revelation to survive the patriarchal age, uncensored. Jesus finishes by referring himself as the bright morning star, which is a slight surprise as this is the planet Venus, who was named after a Goddess. Though John probably wouldn't know the planet Venus by this name. The original Semites name of the planet Venus was originally named after the Goddess Attart. In histor ic times the planet's name was change d to Attar a Semites God. Though there was a problem with this as Attar did later become th e Goddess Ishtar. If the author was aware of the changing sex of the planet Venus among Semites pe ople, this could be a way of trying to tell us something. Like, what is known, as a God in one age becomes a Goddess in another. Also the Morning Star was also the name of Lucifer the \"light-bringer\". Later on Lucifer became one of the names of the Christian Devil. So to have Jesus call himself the Devil creates a problem. This ambiguity continues in the next line which goes.- The Spirit and the Bride say, \"Come!. We would assume that the Spirit was Jesus, but up until then it wasn't mentioned that he had the Bride with him and why suddenly called Jesus \"the spirit\". This could be a patr iarchal oversight or it could be allowing us to question the sex of Jesus, and therefore of God. In Conclusion John shows that he fears the censors of the future by threatening with punishment and plagues, to anyone who censors or adds to the book. Whether this was ever done is hard to say, but it probably escaped censorship because what is says onl y starts to make sense towards the end of the twentieth century. So in conclusion, the story of Kali seems to be about women taking control of the world. While Revelation is about the same thing but suggests it will bring about a new reality. Many people have seen Revelation as a \"Doom and Gloom\" prophecy about the end of the world. Which is probably true, but"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 only of the patriarchal world. The New Jerusalem gives the possibility of a far better world for as all when the patriarchal world we live in has been destroyed. We have already witnessed in our history how one world-view can change from one reality to another. When the reality of patriarchal religions was replaced by the reality of physical science. This then could in turn be taken over by the reality of a loving and caring Mother Goddess. So the apocalypse may hopefully be in the end, a war of words and ideas. Resulting in a better reality for us all.  "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 Chapter Thirteen FREEMASONRY IN THE MODERN WORLD There is a hidden meaning in the word Freemason its elf. The official line is that Freemasonry originally came from the Mason guilds, a sort of Mas on Trade Union. The problem is that this doesn't account for all the religious symbolism and secrecy within Freemasonry. If we accept the possibility that Freemasonry didn't come from the Mason guilds then why call it Freemasonry? If we look at ancient civilisations like ancient Egypt, a large amount of information of what we know about them comes from the stones they built their temples and pyramids. As well as from the carved statues and carved writings on the walls. The sister civilisation to ancient Egypt, Sumer and Mesopotamia, which existed at about the same time, we know far less about because they built in mud brick, which eroded away far quicker than stone. So the clear message is that if you want your knowledge to last to the distant future, then use stone . And the people who build in stone are masons. So the secret meaning of mason would be, \"the keepers of ancient knowledge\". This is backed up by the fact that the original meaning of mason means, \"one who persists\". But why did they call themselves Freemasons and not just Masons? In the past knowledge was rigidly controlled by the rulers and the church. Any scholar that didn't abide by the unwritten rules given out by the ruling elite could quickly find themselves both tortured and murdered. Even today scholars can find themselves unemployed if they give out knowledge or opinions that is unpopular with the establishment. So it is clea r that ordinary scholars were not free to say what they want. As Henry Ford once famously said, \"history is bunk\" and the reason for this is what we know of history comes from heavy controlled and censored scholarship. The Freemasons were on the other hand are free from censorship only in the sense they belonged to a secret society and could communicate censored facts and beliefs to each other in secret. Censorship of the Goddess is not about what ha ppened in the distant past it is still going on in more recent times. When the first palaeontologists dug into Stone-Age sites they began to find images and statues of women. These were dismissed then as just fertility cult objects and simply discarded as being of no importance. It was only the interest in the art world that we know about these objects. Art collectors began to collect them but they were lost to science as no one made a note of where or how they were discovered. In more recent times with women be ing present on these excavations, this is not done so readily. Though it still goes on. In Israel arch aeological excavations that are funded by either the Roman Catholic Church or the Jewish state, ne ver find any evidence of Goddess worship. But excavations in Israel funded by universities find large amount of Goddess carvings in the homes of ordinary people. So what is going on? Do the ar chaeologists funded by the church or state censor or even destroy anything that suggests Goddess worship? The possibility of the Christian Church censoring or destroying archaeological evidence can be seen with the Roman Catholic Chur ch's behaviour with the Dead Sea scrolls. When they were first discovered the Church quickly moved in and took control of the scrolls. Then they wouldn't release them to scholars outside of the translator s they had appointed to work on them. It was over 30 years before they were released under great pressure from other scholars. So what was the reason for this remarkable behaviour? Why didn't the Roman Ca tholic Church want others to examine them? The obvious answer was that the Church needed time to censor or destroy any scroll that contradicted the teachings of the Church. Archaeologists and scholars also have problems with Amazons. To most of the general public the stories of Amazons are myths. Yet what does th e public not know is that archaeologists have found graves of female warriors all over Europe. Archaeologists claim that these finds are an \"embarrassment\". Resulting in reports of female warriors graves not even getting into scientific journals. The only archaeologists that have publicly reported finding gr aves of Amazons is archaeologists from the old Soviet Union, where graves of female warriors were found in the Ukraine and Georgia. So where does Freemasonry stand in all this? Probably on both sides of the fence. Freemasonry rituals have been censored as well. For instance Al bert Pike in USA and the Duke of Sussex in Britain lead an internal revolution to get rid of many of the ancient rituals of Freemasonry because again they"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 were to them an \"embarrassment\". What were th ese rituals we now don't know because according the Freemasons they all have been destroyed. So it is hard to know what the majority of Freem asons know about the Goddess. It has been said by Masons themselves that many of the normal rank and file members do not bother to attend Mason meetings and just pay their dues and that is all. Wh ile others just use it as a gentleman's club. So it is possible that the vast majority of Freemasons do not think about the Mason symbols, or if they do, are satisfied with superficial explanations. Yet in the heart of Freemasonry is there still a Goddess organisation? We find there has been attempt by Masons and other peopl e to bring to the general public ideas about the Golden age and Matriarchy. Jean Jacques Rouss eau (1712-78) in his books, \"Social Contract\" and \"Discourse on the Origin of Inequality among Men\" tried to bring back interest in the ancient golden age. He also point out the natural goodness in all human beings and how the st ate and religious institutions that rule our society corrupted it. While in the mid 19th century the scholar called J.J Bachofen brought together all the evidence of matriarchy in ancient times then available, and very mildly suggested a matriarchal age in the past. He was strongly criticised for this by other scholars who dismissed and discredited his work. Yet in spite of this, his work was to inspire scholars lik e James Frazer who wrote his famous book, The Golden Bough, and more recently Joseph Campbell. It also influenced Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels who publicly praised Bachofen's work. As well as th e psychologist Carl Jung who developed from it the theory that the ancient Great Mother is a very important archetype in the collective unconscious. Other scholars in the early 20th century also wrote about ma triarchy like Robert Briffault, who had pointed out that anthropologists were very bias ed in their field studies, as they assumed that in all the Stone-Age cultures they studied they were all male dominated. And ignored any evidence when this wasn't the case. This didn't go down well with the academic community and again he was very he avily criticised. Yet his work was to inspire the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski who also found Stone Age communities they didn't fit the \"normal\" patriarchal model. As did Margaret Mead who again was also criticised for making observations about societies that didn't fit in to the patriarchal norm. Another anthropologist Eva Meyerowitz was to find evidence of matriarchal rule in African tribes. While Evelyn Reed, in articles, lectures and her book, \"Sexism and Science\" was to sava gery attack anthropologists for their sexual bias against women. Jane Harrison another scholar also suggested matr iarchy in ancient Greece, but managed to escape criticism by not being too explicit. Unlike Dr Margaret Murray a respected Egyptologist also received heavy criticism for writing that Witchcraft was an an cient Goddess religion that has survived up to the middle ages. The poet Robert Grav es wrote his famous book, The White Goddess. Later on Erich Fromm brought together the works of Freud, Marx and B achofen, where he pointed out that communism and socialism could only work in a matriarchy. Then on the wave of the Feminist movement of the 1960s and 70s Feminist scholars like Merlin Stone and Barbara G. Walker also continued to dig deep into ancient history to find more evidence of matriarchy in ancient times. After the Second World War archaeologists starte d to make finds supporting the idea that there was a matriarchal age in the past. This evidence was again dismissed by academics but Feminist writers began to write about it. Like Elizabeth Gould Davi s who was brave enough to directly claim that women did once rule the world, and Riane Eisler who kept strictly to Feminist dogma of equality. It is doubtful if all these people were Freemasons , but it could be that some of them were and others were encouraged by them behind the scenes. The problem is with any secret society in that passing down any secret knowledge over thousands of years is that every generation has the problem of finding people you can trust in the next generation. Over many generations mistakes will be made so that the knowledge w ill get in the hands of people who will not like what they have received and either destroy it, or hand it to the authorities, or not bother to pass it on. It could even be possible that the knowle dge was destroyed and only the ancient symbols have survived. Or it could survive but be in the hands of people who believe this knowledge is too dangerous to give to the general public. It can even happen that a secret society can in time have the opposite agenda to the one they started off with. Freemasonry could of started off to pr eserve ancient secrets but many generations later some of its members may decide that the secrets need to be destroyed because they don't agree with them. It means like any ot her organisation Freemasonry can change and evolve over many generations, and so may not have the aims as it did hundreds of years ago."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 114 As already pointed out Freemasons in the past were greatly opposed to the Roman Catholic Church, and they were active supporters of Protestant Christian sects. Now there is a real mystery about how it was possible for Martin Luther, (1483-1546) to defy the powerful Roman Catholic Church and not either be imprisoned or executed. His great success in being able to start a breakaway Church suggests more was going on behind the scene than we read about in history. If could be he was getting help from secret organisations like Free masonry or the Rosicrucians. Then having successfully split Christianity dow n the middle Freemasonry then strongly supported science. (Most of the men in the scientific revolution in 17th century Britain were Freemasons). Science then became a tool for attacking all forms of Christianity. With Isaac Newton proving that the planets moved by scientific laws and not the hand of god as previously thought. Then later on Darwin showed how life on Earth could be created by evolution a nd not by God. The success of science has greatly undermined the power of the Chris tian religion over the people. So is history censored to conceal a very secret Religious war, between an Ancient Goddess religion and patriarchal religions like Christianity and Islam? Was there also an open war between Goddess religions and patriarchal re ligions right up to the time of the beginning of Christianity and Islam? Then with the dominance of these two patria rchal religions the followers of the Goddess religions went underground. Surviving in organisations like th e Knights Templar until they were also crushed. Then in the Middle Ages they tried to bring back Goddess worship through Witchcraft but was brutally and violently put down again by the Christian Chur ch. So the Goddess religion went underground again creating another secret organisation the Freemasons. This time they set about trying to destroy the power of the Christian religion from within. When they were successful in this they were able to give more power to women in our society. Then with religi ous freedom and tolerance becoming possible in the 20th century Gerald Gardener a Freemason brought back Witchcraft, which since the 1950s has been one of the fastest growing religions in the world. Freemasons have successfully infiltrated governme nts and positions of power all over the world. The power of Freemasonry can be seen during the S econd World War. What is not well known is that wealthy people like Henry Ford funded the Nazi part y from America. They claimed they done this because they feared a communist take over of Ge rmany. Then when Hitler took power he not only attacked the Jews he also banned many organisations like Freemasonry. When Hitler started his conquest of Europe he was probably confid ent that he wouldn't get any interference from America because both the Republicans and Democratic parties made a promise to the American people not to get involve ag ain in any European war. He probably was reasonable confident of not getting too much interference from Britain and France as well, because as was later discovered there were powerful pro-Nazi factions in the British and French governments. He also had a treaty with Stalin for non-interference in his quest to conquer Europe. Wh en France fell to Hitler the majority of the British Parliament wanted to sue for peace. Had Britain done this, Hitler would be free to conquer the Soviet Union and Europe would become a Nazi empire. But somehow the then British Prime Minister Churchill managed to outmanoeuvre pro-Germany faction and appealed over their heads to the British People, to keep the war going. Now Churchill was a Freemason but claimed he wasn't an active member. Yet there is a clue to his beliefs in the following story. In Blenheim Place the place where he was born is a small building called Diana's Temple and it was here he proposed to his wife. Now this can be dismissed as a silly romantic gesture but Wilson Churchill wasn't like this. He was a very emotional man and an important ritual like proposing to his wife would have to fit in with his deepest be liefs. So was he a secret member of a Goddess religion? Meanwhile in America Franklin Roosevelt had won the USA election. It was from the Roosevelt administration that the Freemasonry symbols appear ed on American bank notes. Roosevelt came to power with a promise not to go to war, but he also knew that Hitler had a treaty with Japan and he used this treaty to bring America into the war. Roosevelt provoked Japan as much as he could, to make it want to attack America. He imposed an oil embargo on Japan, who because they were fighting a war in China, was in danger of its military machine grinding to a halt, through a lack of fuel. The resulted was the attack on Pearl Harbour and the promise of Roosevelt not to go to war was forg otten. So Hitler not only found the British Empire continuing the war against him but the American superpow er joining in as well. Which is very ironic as it"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 115 was American money that helped make Nazism a ma jor party in Germany. Hitler then found himself heavily outnumbered with no chance in winning the war. So can we claim that it was the secret manoeuvri ngs of the Freemasons that brought about the downfall of the Nazi party? Why not, as we know Freemasons played a important role in the English Civil war of 17th century, the America War of Inde pendence, the French Revolution and countless of revolutions in South America. It seems that very authoritarian governments like the Kingship of Charles 1, the French monarchy and the Nazi party are the enemies of Freemasonry. The war between patriarchal re ligions and governments and the secret Goddess Religion can be charted throughout the 20th century. In the women' s movement we can see its success in the vote for women at the beginning of the 20th century. In Ho llywood in the 1930 and 40s we see a large number of powerful women on the screen. Like Betty Davis, Joan Crawford, Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, all becoming successful film stars and were referred to as \"love Goddesses\". Some of the stor y lines were far ahead of their time in portraying strong women, and they became powerful role models for ordinary wome n. So what were these film producers in the 1930s and 40s doing promoting strong women? Then a change came after the Second World War, America was taken over by McCarthyism who not only attacked communism but women as well. At the beginning of the 1950s, women were encouraged by women's magazines and films to become more \"feminine\". Betty Friedan exposed this in her book \"The Feminine Mystique\" which helped create the women's Liberation Movement. The powerful female film stars in the 1950s found it harder to get film-roles and more passive women like Doris Day, Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe became the new female film stars. The film industry declined as fewer people wanted to see these passiv e women on screen. By the 1960s all major female stars were eclipsed by the male st ars, some of them, like John Wayne, Sean Connery and Clint Eastwood playing extremely macho roles. In the 1970s-80s, more powerful female film and TV stars have reappeared like Barbara Streisand, Fay Dunaway, Sigourney Weaver and Roseanne Barr, but these women have had to fight hard to get film roles, while the very macho film stars like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger had no tr ouble with this and money is thrown at them to make very big budget movies. Which surprisingly enough don't make much of a profit. The macho stars are there to encourage males to be \"real\" men and to keep women in their place. Unfortunately, to keep their popularity, over the years these films have become mo re and more violent, en couraging young men who see them to be violent as well, as we can se e in the growing rate of violent crime today. In the beginning of the 21st century we are no w finding more assertive women on the screen. Whether this is to do with the power of Feminists or the secret Goddess religion or both is hard to know. As Feminists have pointed out since the beginning of the 1980s there have been a backlash against Feminism. With Feminist legislation of the 1970s being repealed in the 1980s. With increasing right wing governments who have prom oted, \"family values\" and waged a propaganda war against single mothers, so Feminists have had a hard time during the 1980s and 90s. In the 1960s archaeologists discovered Catal Hö yük and as I mentioned before the Turkish government soon had the site closed down when it discovered what was being found. After this it was like Catal Höyük didn't exist, it was very hard to find any archaeologist book that would mention this excavation. Even though it was the oldest civilisation that was ever found. But now we see a change in the 1990s the excavation was reopened and now I find it is far easier to get information on this site. Recently I was to see the Catal Höyük mentioned on a science TV program and in a children's history book. It even mentioned the fact the people of Ca tal Höyük worshipped the Mother Goddess without denigrating the Goddess as a fertility cult. So it seems after more than 30 years since it was first excavated Catal Höyük is now becoming, \"respectable\". Also now there was now a younger group of scientists who wasn't so opposed to the theories of Marija Gimbutas. Richard Rudgley recently wr ote two books and made a TV program called \"The Secrets Of The Stone Age\" that broadly supported Marija Gimbutas theories. So in recent years there are many people in the academic world who are now mo re accepting of the evidence that the first civilisations live in peace. Richard Rudgeley comes straight to the point wh en he says, \"The widely accepted view of the human story is wildly inaccurate.\" He then goes on to point out that because historians have ignored what happen during the Neolithic age, it seems that to the general public that civilisations suddenly appeared"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 out of no-where. Because we are taught that the pe ople in the Stone Age were ignorant savages, who then suddenly created sophisticated ci vilisations like ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Because orthodox archaeology gives no explanation to the public of how this suddenly happened, in this vacuum people outside science have invented their own theories. Like Erich Von Daniken in his book \"Chariot Of The Gods\", or the many theories of a lost continents like Atlantis, Mu and Lemuria. The point he is trying to make is that if the general public was aware that Stone-Age people were not ignorant brutes and that civilisation didn't start with the Egyptians or Sumerians, but thousands of years earlier in the Neolithic age. Then we would not need aliens from outer space or lost continents to explain how civilisation got started. He explains that the first large stone structures were not built in the Nile Valley but in the island of Malta. When the first archaeologists first excavated the Temple complex of Malta they assumed it was a crude attempt to copy what was built in ancient Greece. Then when it was carbon dated it was found to be built 5,500 years ago. A thousand years older than the Great pyramid in Egypt. He then says that the comment of archaeologists hearing this news was that is was the wrong date in the wrong place. The reason apparently for this attitude for this is that Ma lta is off the beaten track. Which is strange because Malta is just off the coast of Italy and not that far from Ancient Greece and Egypt. A more plausible explanation is that the archaeologists didn't want to know that Malta had the oldest freestanding stone buildings in the world, because the Temples in Malta are Goddess Temples, with Giant statues of the Great Mother. [The remains of one of the 50 Goddess Temples found in Malta] Can it be, that the reason we have such a large gap in our history that Richard Rudgley complains about, is because it is an age when people clearly worshipped th e Great Mother? As all the lost Civilisations that he writes about were a ll full of feminine images, it strongly suggests that this silence is simply male bias. In men who discovered these sites wanting males to be the ones who created the first civilisations and not women, or they're more to this than that? Archaeology like most science is very expensive, so most archaeologists are either very rich individuals like th ey were in the 19th century, or they rely on funding from universities, governments or religious sects like the Roman Catholic Church. As in everything else in life, \"he who pays the fiddler calls the tune\". Archaeologists finding the \"wrong\" things or advocating the \"wrong\" theories, in the eyes of the people wh o sponsor them, could have their funding cut off."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 The First person to do a \"scientific\" excavation on Malta was a Jesuit priest called Father Emmanuel Magri in 1903. His form of excavation was to rub off pa intings on the walls of the largest Goddess temple in Malta. Then to dig up the floor of the Temple a nd what he discovered there mysteriously disappeared. In other words, his work was to destroy the site for its archaeological value. This is not unusual. In the 19th century European explorers discovered in Zimbabwe an ancient city that was built by African kings between the 12 and 16th century. European archaeologists and treasure seekers then carelessly destroyed nearly evidence that it was Africans who built this city. Because of a theory that Zimbabwe was the lost King Solomon's mine. They didn't want to contemplate that Africans were able to create civilisations in the past, as it would undermine the right of Eur opean countries to coloni se Africa, because the justification of colonialism at the time, was that they were civilising the people of this continent, whom were called savages. The times have changed all the efforts on the part of the establishment to return us to the \"good old days\" of patriarchy are failing. Women today are becoming even more assertive and ambitious. Already girls are out performing boys in school and uni versity in western countries. This means that in the future it is more likely that the top jobs will go to women and not men, as young women today are better educated and better qualified than young men. Yet \"uppity\" women, who don't know their place, can still come under brutal attack as we can be seen in the death of Princess Diana. The genius of Princess Diana was that she was able to portray herself in the media as a genuine caring and loving person. Something any politician or spin-doctor would give their right arm to have. Although she didn't have any political power, in the way she was able to use and manipulate the media made her a very powerful person. And she was able to use this power to further her own agenda to create a more caring and loving world. Yet in so doing she wa s making an attack on the patriarchal society. Because once you give people that a loving caring wo rld is possible then it undermines the power of the ruling elite. As it no longer become acceptable for a small minority of people to hold wealth of the world in their hands while other people live in desperate poverty. From the very beginning when she became a royal she responded to people in a very caring way. Now this is not unusual with famous people in the medi a, but the difference was that she was able to put it across to the degree that people believed it was genuine. This made her from the start the most popular royal in the world. At first she was just content with this but then she was to learn a trick from another royal Princess Ann. In the early 1980s there was a great famine in the Sudan, but the media ignored this famine so the people in the West were unaware of the millions of people dying of starva tion in the Sahara desert region. Princess Ann as president of the Sa ve The Children Fund visited Sudan and the media went with her as they wanted a story on the break up of her marriage. Then reporters personally saw the great suffering going on in the area. As the result of this visit, the media all over the world began to report on the famine and this in turn got the Band-Aid movement off the ground. As the result millions of pounds were donated to try and save the people in the area. A Sleeping Goddess found on the island of Malta"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 Princess Diana followed on doing the same as what Princess Ann had done but with far greater publicity. One of the most important acts she done was change people's opinions on the Aids epidemic. When Aid first started to spread in the West people greatly feared it and believed that they could catch this disease by touching people with Aids. Also as it was mostly homosexual men who got Aids and this increased homophobia. Some Church followers were even suggesting that Aids was the way God was punishing deviants like homosexuals. The media in Britain was encouraging these stories and I can remember reading one scare story in the British ne wspaper suggesting that people could catch Aids from toilet seats, if a homosexual man sat there previously. At the height of the homophobia frenzy whipped up by the British press, Princess Diana fearlessly met this hysteria head on. She visited a hospital w ith Aids patients inside a nd talked to and shook hands with patients dying of Aids. Pictur es of her doing his was in the ne wspapers and on the TV and in one stroke she had given homosexual men Royal approval and had destroye d the myth that you could catch Aids by touching. She was later to do the same with leprosy as in many part of the world people still believe it is possible to catch leprosy but touching a leper. She again appeared on TV touching shaking the hand of a leper and help overcome prejudice against people with this disease. Charitable organisations were finding that if Princess Diana took a active interest in support of them, she was able to generate large amounts of contributions for their cause. So they became very aware of her power to help the causes she believed in. She also started to move into politics. In the 1980s in Britain there was high unemployment as well and an increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. The right-wing press in Britain was whipping up a hate campaign against unemployed people, claiming that they were scroungers and work-shy. Princess Diana showed the world clearly where her sympathies laid by again visiting and talking to homeless people. Though by this time the media was now wise to he r tactics and wasn't so keen on reporting her doing this. So she didn't get the media coverage in this, which she normally expects. The British media also tried to start a hate campaign against Princess Diana but the newspapers who attempted to attack her found that they were unable to dent her popularity with the common people. I personally do ask myself why British newspapers want to whip up hate campaigns against people like homosexuals during the Aids scare, the unemployed, Moslems and now it seems against asylum seekers. These campaigns of hate sound su spiciously like the hate campaign the Nazis mounted against the Jews. She was to move more into politics towards the end of her life. Charitable organisations had for years campaigned against the production and use of land mines, but had never got anywhere with this. In all conflicts all over the world countless land mines were buried indiscriminately, then after the war the land mines are left in the ground with no one knowing we re they were. So the civil population living in the area would continue to be killed and maimed by treading on these mines . (It is claimed that in recent years only 2% of the people who are kill and maimed by land mines are soldiers. 98% of deaths and injuries caused by land mines are civilians long after the war had finished.) Princess Diana then decided to get involved; in simply by visiting an area wher e land mines are been buried, she focused the world's media on this problem and got government s all over the world to take notice. She was warned by conservative politicians not to get involved in politics. She herself was to claim before she died that she feared she would be killed, and when it did happen the circumstances of her death suggested a government cover up. This has been covered in othe r books, TV programmes and articles where it strongly suggests that Diana was murder ed by a professional hit squad. I am aware that many people do not want to believe this, as it sugges ts that Western Governments are far more corrupt than we like to believe. Yet the ve ry suspicious deaths of John and Robert Kennedy as well as Martin Luther King, suggests that such things are possible. She was a real danger to the ruling elite becau se she has somehow managed to tune into a powerful Goddess archetype. She was demonstratin g the power of a compassionate and caring Goddess icon and this was a danger to all patriarchal political parties and religions. We can see this through the great emotional eff ect of her death had on people, which was to surprise everyone. But thinking about it is not so surprising. We do live in a uncaring world, where selfish and corrupt industr ial and political leaders are commonplace. Princess Diana was one of the few people in establishment who showed that she genuinel y cared and loved people. The very large numbers of people that publicly mourned the death of Princess Diana gave a clear message to the politicians that"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 119 the people wanted to live in a more caring world. This was picked up by the British Prime Minster who stated that people loved Diana because she genuinely cared. But he didn't learn from this himself and his actions have since shown he is a normal selfish, uncaring and cynical politician. In the past, patriarchy made no apology for its brutality and self ishness, today it can't get away with this. Patriarchal leaders today have to attempt to justify their actions to the people and they way they do this is to claim they are doing their best in a difficult world. Princess Dian a was either unconsciously or consciously leading a campaign that this wasn't good enough. By her actions, she was whipping up strong emotions within the people that they wanted to live in a more caring world. Another Women was the have the same effect befo re Princess Diana was Evita Peron. It would be easy to be cynical and say that she was only a mistress and later wife of a South American dictator. But the emotion effect she was to have on Argentina, th e country where she was the first lady, shows she was more than this. Like Princess Diana the political influence she had was very limited. But unlike any other politician she was able to show to the people that sh e genuinely cared. The people respond greatly to her and although she was unable to do a lot for the people of Argentina, the fact that she came across as a person who genuinely care about the people. Made her very popular. With her early death, again like Princess Diana, people showed clearly how they felt about her at her funeral. That gave a message to the politicians that people do want to live in a caring society. Something I'm afraid the Argentina politicians ignored. The story of Evita Peron was given publicity by the stage musical Evita written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. The genius of this musical was it portrayed clearly the emotion effect Evita had on the people of Argentina. Unfortunately when it was make into a f ilm the producers had little understanding of what the story was about. They put a pop star in the title role who didn't have either the singing voice or acting ability to do justice to the music and lyrics. So it seems there is a secret war with both sides fighting behind the scenes for power and control over governments, the media, religions and financial institutions. But the will of the common people also have a say in this, as well. In the West it is unlik ely that the majority of people will accept any effort to push us back to the \"good old days\" of patriarchal va lues. It seems that the patriarchal forces have become more powerful since the beginning of the 1980s in that they have taken c ontrol of all mainstream political parties as well as the media in the West. But somehow they are still unable to change the will of the common people in wanting to return to good old fashion patriarchy. Also there are signs that the people are restless. People are becoming disillusioned with politics because it is being realised that it doesn't matter which political party you vote for, the policies of governments will be exactly the same. Also people are starting to be more informed of the stories that the mainstream media give little coverage. Like the third world debt problem that ensures that third world countries cannot climb out of poverty. The effect of globalisation is that give s power to international corporations and undermines the power of sovereign go vernments. Since the 1980s most countries in the world have scrapped Keynesian economics and adopted Monetarism instead. The result has been high unemployment; a world wide recession and the gap between rich and poor has slowly became greater. Greater numbers of people are now protesting agains t this and there is revolution in the air, like we saw in the early 1960s. There is a powerful anti-capitalism movement now that is still growing in spite of the fact the mainstream medi a gives it not coverage whatsoever. The problem today is that with the collapse of communism and with socialist political parties who have sold out completely, and have become new conservative parties. There isn't any political party people can turn to that will change anything for the be tter. The same is true for religion, as all patriarchal religions can only offer people more of the same. Th e same very negative messages about human beings, which religions have been spouting for the last tw o thousand years. Surely the time has come for a religion based on a compassionate and caring Mother Goddess, or a matriarchal political party, where women can point out; men have done a really terrible job in ruling our world and it is about time women took over instead. In recent years a few Masons have began to admit there is a Goddess within their movement. Robert Lomas a Mason author willing to write about the Goddess in his book, Turning The Hiram Key. Alan Butler in his book, The Goddess, The Grail And The Lodge is more explicit in saying that Freemasonry is a secret Goddess organization. Other authors are now saying similar things, like Graham"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 120 Hancock and Robert Bauval in their book, Talisman where they claims that after the French Revolution, Robespierre attempted to replace Christianity with a religion based on the Goddess Isis. Many people today are getting introduced to these ideas through the great success of Dan Brown's book, The DaVinci Code, which is a fictional version of the book, Holy Blood and the Holy Grail , by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln. Through these books many people are learning about how important Mary Magdene was in early Christianity and how her role was later downgraded. Other authors are also touching on this subject like Lynn Pi cknett and Clive Prince in books like, The Templar Revelation . So we can see the ways the Goddess is returning to consciousness, in recent years but it is still happening very slowly. Though whether Freemas ons are united in wanting a Goddess religion and matriarchy to return is debatable. Many are very rich and powerful men and will not want to do anything to undermine their wealth and power. This is a usual Mason image of the Royal arch and Tr iple Goddesses, but note the gap in the Key Stone of the arch. A arch like this in real life would collapse, so it is suggesting that this arch is symbolising something else which is the vagina of the Great Mother from which all life was created. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 Chapter Fourteen, THE COMPASSIONATE GODDESS If secret societies like Freemasonry have retained the secret teachings of the ancient religion of the Great Mother. What are these teachings? Surprisingly enough you don't have to find these teachings in the occult, secret societies or mystery schools they are there for all to see with patriarchal religious teachings. Christianity is suppose to be about the teachings of Jesus Christ. Yet if you look at the Christian Bible you will find that the actual teachings of Jesus make up a only a very small portion of the book. Another surprise is that the Christian Bible is about two very different religions. Most of the Old Testament and the Acts of the Apostles and the teachings of Paul are about the teachings of a Patriarchal religion, whereas the teachings of Jesus are mostly about the ancient religion of the Great Mother. This religion has survived in other religions as well, the purest form being the Tao-Te-Ching. We can also find it in Hinduism and Buddhism and probably in Islam, though I admit I have never studied this religion except for the Sufi teachings, so I don't really know much about this. I was surprised to learn that the Koran is a revised version of the teachings of the Goddess Kore, the ruling Goddess of the Koreshites whom Mohammed was a member. So it strongly suggest there is secret Goddess teachings within the Koran as well, though I haven't personally attempt to find them. There is Goddess theology in the Old Testament but personally, it is a book again I don't have an interest in studying too deeply. In the western world we have been brought up to believe in a angry a nd uncaring God who judges and condemns us. Some people have attempted to get away from this Judeo-Christian God and try to see him as a loving God as portrayed by Jesus in the Ne w Testament, but old habits die-hard. Even though many people try to see God as a loving God. We all live in a world of suffering and people unconsciously assume it is because we are \"sinful\" in the eyes of God and this is why he will not help us. Because for what other reason is there so much suffering in the world? Atheists who use it to proof that God, does no t exist support this argument. They pose the question, \"If God loves us all, as stated by Jesus Chri st, then why are we living in a world of suffering?\" Which is a question Christian priests ha ve no answer to. So it all suggests that either there isn't a God or that he is indifferent to our suffering. In the Bible it states that; \"God make us in his ow n image\". If we are to think of a God who has the great intelligence and power to create the universe , then as we all are his creations we should all be perfect. Because a being with such power and intelligence should be able to make a perfect job in creating us. Yet I doubt if any person thinks that they are perfect and I also doubt if anyone thinks that we live in a perfect world. The Bible gets around this paradox by saying that; we were led astray from this perfection by the Devil. Yet who is the Devil? The Bible says he is a fallen angel. Yet if God has created everything then it means he has created the Devil as well. Which again suggests this powerful being of unlimited power and intelligence seems to be incompetent."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 So from our point of view we have a choice. We either believe in an imperfect God who it seems doesn't know what he is doing, and is willing to bl ame his own shortcoming on to us. To the degree of punishing us for his mistakes, or that we don't believe in a God at a ll. So that the universe and life appeared by accident, which suggests we live in a meaningless and pointless universe. Which is a very depressing picture. It suggests th ere is no hope for us all and we are forced to live in this world of suffering forever with no redemption. Such beliefs will have a very negative effect on anyone who believes in them and so it is no wonde r people look for happiness through money, power, sex, gambling drink and drugs. What is the way out of these very negative belie fs? How can we give ourselves hope in a better life and future for us all? One way would be to belie ve in a loving father God as advocated by Jesus but the judgmental and punitive God of the Old Testament ha s contaminated this belief. Another answer is to change the sex of God so he is not a Father God but a Mother Goddess. The problem with the belief in a loving Creator or Creatix is why is He or She allowing us to live in a world of suffering. The answer is in the story of the Prodigal Son. Anyone who has been brought up as a Chris tian should know the story of The Prodigal Son, which is a parable by Jesus. Briefly it is about a s on who leaves his father to make his own way in the world. But leaving the security of his father everything starts to go wrong for him. He is robbed and cheated and soon finds himself living in desperate povert y. In the end he swallows his pride and goes back to his father and is greeted with kindness and consid eration by the father and restored to this rightful place. The meaning of this parable is that we all are prodigal sons and daughters. And the father in this story is the idea of the Loving Father God that Jesu s unsuccessfully tried to promote or the Ancient Great Mother. The reason why Jesus was unsuccessful in promoting the Loving Father God image was because most men are not kind and loving of others. We see men who attack each other and go to war with each other. In fact a loving man is seen as something of a wimp. Which is the image Jesus has. People have preferred the image of the angry and dogmatic Old Te stament God, because at least he is a \"real man\" with attitude. Not realising what this image does to the people and the society that believes in such a God. As the Bible says we are created in our creator's image and if we accept that, then the problems of the Great Mother is similar to that of a mortal mother. Any mother who has children comes up with a real dilemma, because she loves her child ren unconditionally she doesn't want to see her children hurt or suffer in any way. Yet she also knows that if sh e is to mollycoddle them too much and give them constant protection, they are unable to live lives of th eir own and learn how to look after themselves. So if she is a wise mother she learns to untie them from her apron strings and allow them the freedom to make their own mistakes. So mothering is a balanc ing act of giving her children freedom to learn for themselves. But not too much freedom so they will hurt themselves. Likewise we all are the children of the Mother Goddess. She like a mortal Mother loves us all unconditionally. She doesn't want us to suffer yet also she wants to give us the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them. This means she has given us a very vital gift of freewill. So that she will not interfere with anything we wish to do. Because sh e loves us all unconditionally she will love us no matter what we do. This is echoed in the words of Jesus when nailed to the cross he said: \"Forgive them for they no not what they do\". In the eyes of the Great Mother we are all still children, and the earth is our playground. So if the Great Mother loves us all unconditionally why does she not interfere in the world? Why does she not come down to earth and guide us more directly to eliminate suffering from the world? The answer is in the Prodigal Son parable by Jesus. When children become teenagers they begin to rebel against their parents, they become \"knowalls\" and think they know better then their mother and father. And many of them leave their parents and go off on th eir own to live independent lives. This is what the whole of humanity has done, as we have a desire to be independent of our Mother Goddess. So we have turned our back on her to lead independent lives. Li ke a mortal parent she knows that she cannot interfere with this decision we have all made and has allowed us to go off to learn for ourselves. Yet also the story of the Prodigal Son also tells us that if we want to return to the Great Mother then we are all free to do so and we will be welcomed with open arms. So the question is, why are we not doing this?"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 The obvious answer would be pride. The teenage son or daughter doesn't want to go back to there parents and say: \"I can't look after myself after all\" . But there is another reason for this, the way we see our creator has become extremely distorted. If we be lieve our creator is a angry and judgmental God or that God doesn't exist at all. Then we are not going to want to turn to someone who will condemn and punish us or we think doesn't exist at all. So how did it come about that we ha ve distorted the image we have of our creator? If we are to believe what we are told about in offi cial history, then it seems that people in the past lived far more terrible lives than what we did. It seem s that the further we go back in time the harder life was for all people. But is this true? I don't think an yone would argue with the fact that life was far harder in the medieval times than today. Yet would it also be true that if you go back further in time than the Middle Ages, would life get progressively worse for people? That is a debatable point, because the further we go back in history the less we understand what is really going on. But logic tells us that if we adopt the model of gradual evolution where everything has slowly got better for all people, then as we will go back to a time we will have conditions were so hard for people that humanity couldn't possibly survive. So we have to revise this model and see that history is about a series of highs and lows. A low point would have been the Middle Ages an d if we look at these times people then believed in the angry and judgmental God far more than they do today. The belief permeated the whole of society where people were genuinely frightened of God. Wh ich created a very negative point of view because every disaster and misfortune was seen as a judgement against people, by an angry God. Though I am not an advocate of atheism. I have to say that the rise of atheism in the 19th century has created a far more humane society for us all. It seems that the belief that God does not exist is far better for us all that the very negative belief in an angry, judgmental and punitive God. Another thing that patriarchal religions have taught is fatalism. That is to say our life is in the hands of God or fate and there is nothing we can do about this. So Christians have been taught that everything that happens is, \"the will of God\" while Moslems have been taught, \"it is but the will of Allah\". Now there are some advantages in just accepting life as it is, but the problem is that is leaves an individual completely powerless. So if you have a fatalistic belief that we live in a world of suffering ruled by an uncaring God. Then the acceptance of this is means this come part of your reality. Any ruling elite likes to encourage fatalism because if the people are fatalistic then they are far easier to rule, because they will be more accepting of the corrupti on and incompetence of the leadership. Fatalism can only become positive if there is a positive belief that a loving and caring God or Goddess created us. The general public only know of two beliefs on how the world was created. Either it was created by a God or was created by accident. There is a third possibility and we created it. Now a first sight this belief seems incredible because we as far as we are aware we haven't got the power to create our world. With the concept of a male God comes the belief that God is separated from us. With the concept of the Mother Goddess is the concept that we were born from the Great Mother so therefore we were once at One with Her. Then after we were born we becam e infant Gods and Goddesses. As such we all have to ability to create the world we live in, the problem is that being infants we don't know yet how we do this. All of us are creating our world be most of us to it on the unconscious level. It is our unconscious thought, feelings and beliefs that create our world. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that the world is rule by secret Occult groups like Freemasonry. Now although I don't go along with the many weird ideas conspiracy theorist comes up with, in this, they may be correct. What ancient Shamans or Witches have discovered long ago was that we are all infant Gods and Goddesses in our own righ t, because we all have the abilit y to create our own reality both collectively and individuality. We do this through our thoughts, feelings and beliefs. Now anyone learning this can do three things. - 1. They can tell the world about this and try and teach it to other people. 2. They may find it too difficult to convince others that we do create our own reality, but can use this power to help others. 3 They can simply use this knowledge to gain personal power and wealth. At some point in the past groups of men came to gether and used this knowledge to become the rulers of our world. They created priesthoods and r ealised there was a big advantage in keeping this knowledge to themselves and keeping the ordinary people ignorant. In other words priesthood would"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 work together to gain personal power for themselves in ruling a country or empire. Then would give out a form of religious teachings to the people that would keep them powerless. Now the Ancient Greeks had a myth about a Golden Age that existed in their past. Yet the myth of the Golden age doesn't only come from Ancient Greece. Probably the most ancient religion that survives today is Taoism in China. Again this religi on talks about a Golden age in the past. As explained repetitively in the Tao-Te-Ching by Lao Tzu written at about the third century BC Although the Tao-Te- Ching is considered to be the Taoist \"Bible\". Taoism is far older than its author Lao Tzu. It seems that he was the archivist in the Imperial Court, and w ould have had access to very ancient documents that were destroyed by later Emperors who wanted to de stroy all ancient knowledge. So the Tao-Te-Ching is one of the few Chinese writings of that period to survive. Yet as previously point out archaeologists have found proof that the Golden and Silver Ages did exist in Neolithic sites, and that this knowledge has been kept from the general public because of political reasons. If we accept that there was a Golden age then why was it so much better than what come after it? The Tao-Te-Ching gives many reasons for this and why we declined from the Golden age. Those of old who were competent In ruling according to the Tao Did not do it by enlightening the people But by keeping the people unknowing. The difficulty in leading the people comes from their knowing too much. Now this is a similar idea to the story of the Garden of Eden. Again Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat the fruit from \"the tree of knowledge\". In this story when they ate the fruit they realise they were naked. This suggests they had lost their innocents. Again this is in line with what the Ancient Greeks says about the Golden age in that th e people of the Golden age were innocent. So what is the problem with knowledge? There is nothing wrong with knowledge in itself but as the old saying goes; \"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing\". When the people of the Golden age allowed themselves to be ruled and guided by the Mother Goddess through their instincts, then harmony was easy to achieve. Because all people were calling on the great wisdom of the Great Mother in everything they did. As everyone believed in an All-powerful Great Mother who gave her ch ildren unconditional love then collectively everyone was creating this reality for themselves. Then some people began to realise that the Great Mother had given them the power to cr eate their own reality. Now as both men and women were creating a reality of harmony anyway, this knowle dge wasn't much used to them. Until it seems this knowledge got into the hands of men who had very strong competitive instincts. These men then began to use this knowledge to gain personal power. By using this knowledge they gained power over other people and began to rule communities. Unfortunately although these men knew how to gain personal power they didn't have much wisdom when they became rulers. This again is pointed out by the Tao-Te- Ching When a man is to take the world over and shape it I see that he must be obliged to do it For the world is a divine vessel: It cannot be shaped; He who shapes it damages it; He who insist upon it loses it. In other words by trying to improve the world we have only made it worse. The Great Mother would see this decline but wouldn't do anything to stop it because she can see the desire of her children to learn to be independent from her. From what we learn from the Ancient Greeks and the Tao-Te-Ching it seems that the decline was very slow. In the Prodigal Son parable, when the son leaves his loving father he is soon robbed and cheated of his money by others. So who were these robbers? It seems they were and still our rulers and priests who robbed us of the contact, and therefore the great wisdom and abundance of the Great Mother. The priests become the mediators between the Great Mother and the people, but the priest made incompetent rulers. Bringing about a decline of human fortunes. The more they tried to put thing right the more"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 mistakes they made. Leading us to a world of conflic t, fear and suffering. To quote the Tao-Te-Ching again: When the great Tao is lost, spring forth benevolence and righteousness When wisdom and sagacity arise, there are great hypocrites. When family relations are no longer harmoni ous, we have filial children and devoted parents. When a nation is in confusion and disorder, patriots are recognised. When Tao is, equilibrium is. When Tao is lost, out come all the differences of things. As people began to learn through priests they began to doubt the wisdom they received from the Mother Goddess, simply because sometime the wisdom of the Great Mother is beyond our understanding and sometime doesn't ma ke logical sense. Because of this doubt the priests realised they could use this doubt to receive for themselves power over others. Th e priests claim to have a better contact with the spirit world, God or Goddess than the average person. Even if the priest is completely honest the temptation to use his position as the spokesperson of th e Great Mother or God for personal gain would of been very great. And off coarse those who where not honest would abused their position of trust to further their own ends. Unfortunately the advice of th is priesthood was mostly for their own personal gain and wouldn't be anywhere as good as the great wis dom of The Great Mother. So when they the people came to the priesthood complaining that the advice gi ven wasn't much help. Then the priests where forced to blame the Great Mother. Which priest do even today when they say; \"The ways of God are very mysterious\", when confronted by an unanswerable question. So the image of the Great Mother became tarnished. She didn't seem to have the same wisdom she had in the past. So people began to pay less a ttention to her words as interpreted by the priesthood. This period was written about in the Tao-Te-Ching He who knows does not speak; He who speaks does not know. He who is truthful is not Showy; He who is showy is not truthful. He who is virtuous does not dispute; He who disputes is not virtuous; He who is learned is not wise; he who is wise is not learned. Therefore the Sage does not display his own merits. The first line of this chapter in the Tao-Te-C hing states: \"He who knows does not speak.\" We have to ask why not? A clue to this reason can be seen in later lines: \"He who is virtuous does not dispute; He who disputes is not virtuous\". It seems that in the time of Lao-Tzu if a person who is still in contact with the Great Mother and voices her wisdom, he is likely to be attacked by those who claim to know the wisdom of the Great Mother but only do it to gain personal power. In disputes the true sage would be at a disadvantage. He or she can only give the wisdom of the Great Mother but may not be able to say why the people should follow this teaching. Or if he or she knows why the people should follow the ways of the Mother Goddess they may have di fficulty in explaining it, because political minded priests will now cloud the people's perception. As Lao-Tzu points out, learned people are not wise because their wisdom comes from books or teachings of priests that came before them. So the teachings they learn would be very contaminated. Whereas th e Sage will still be learning from his or her inner voice which is the voice of the Great Mother. So as suggested by the Tao-Te-Ching those who only wanted power for themselves where able to influence people far more than those who still had a tr ue contact with The Great Mother. And the contact with the Mother Goddess was slowly broken and replaced by the knowledge of the priests and rulers. By becoming in the eyes of the general population the mout hpiece of the Mother Goddess, they began to give her a very bad name as they more and more used he r as a scapegoat for their mistakes. So the people began to reject the Great Mother and other Goddesse s and Gods were created out of the imagination of the priests. Many ancient civilisations began to worship a large number of deities and the priest of the different Gods and Goddesses competed w ith each other for power over the people. The priests then at one time must of realised that a God who could frighten the people gave them far more power. So Gods like Jehovah, Zeus, Thor a nd Rama began to appear. These were thunder Gods who will punish with a bolt of lighting anyone they we re displeased with. This might of given great"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 political power to the priests of these Gods but it was a disaster for the people. Because in believing is such punitive Gods, the people collectively created a very negative world of fear, hatred and suffering. Later on spiritual teachers like Jesus and Buddha trie d to counter this trend. Jesus putting forward the idea of a loving Father God, while Buddha taught people how to contact the Great Mother through meditation. Yet these teachers became Gods themselves after they died, and there teaching soon becomes distorted to suit the needs of power hungry priests. So what has the Great Mother been doing as we collectively broken all contact off from her? It would be untrue to say the link has been totally cut o ff, and where she could influence us for the better, she did so. To the degree that we have moved fro m a very negative period in the Middle Ages where people really believed that they were created by a uncaring, angry and judgmental God. To now where people don't believe in a God at all or they are starting to believe in the caring God as promoted by Jesus. So what is the next step? What would happen to us all if we started to believe in the Great Mother who loves us all unconditiona lly and will gives us everything that will bring us joy and happiness? The problem that most people will have with this is that it sounds far too good to be true. But unfortunately because of this belief the Mother Goddess cannot give us what we want , because it is we who create our reality through our beliefs. The Great Mother has given us all the power to create the life and world we want to create. And we create our personal life and collectively create our world by the way we think and feel. So if we believe that a utopia where everyone is happy is impossi ble, then that becomes true, because that is what we believe. We have all become prisoners of our pa st and history. When we look back in our history all we read about is wars and conflict so we assume this way of behaving will continue because it is \"human nature\". Yet as we have said there is some proof from the excavation of the Neolithic that there was in pre-historic times a Golden age. So why can we not do the same today? As I have previously pointed out the Great Mother has given us free will. But she has given us more than this she has given us god-like power to cr eate what ever we want in our lives. Unfortunately we are still children. We have the power, but do not yet have the knowledge and experience to use this power. It is like someone giving us a high-powered s ports car without telling us how to drive it. So with experimenting we might learn how to start the engine, then we then might try and drive it. But without the knowledge and experience of driving it, we are more than likely to crash the car. Before we are allowed to drive a car we go to a driving instructor to learn how to drive it. The same is true with life, the Great Mother is always there to help and guide us. Unfortunately we then began to listen to political minded pr iests and we have lost contact with the Mother Goddess. So she is now only a \"small voice\" which most of us choose to ignore. It has become very difficult for her to contact us though the distortions of religious and at heists dogma, to the degree that many priests have claimed the small voice within us is the voice of the Devil or evil spirits. To some degree we need to be wary of this small voice as religious nutters have killed people and claimed it was the \"voice of god\" that told them to do it. This is why we have to understand that the small voice only comes from the Great Mother who loves us, and everyone on this Earth, unconditionally. So any voice in our head that advocates hurting or harming others, or ourselves is clearly not the small voice of the Great Mother. We can only get into contact with the Great Mother by clearing away these distortions, this can only be done by affirming a few basi c truths about the Mother Goddess. It was possible for the Prodigal Son to return to his loving father because he had the memory of what life was like before he went off on his own. We unfortunately do not have that memory. As far as we know in the whole of recorded history we have always lived a life on conflic t and suffering. So it requires us to listen to the small voice of the Great Mother even though it seems to contradict ever ything we have been taught about our world. We have to listen to her when she tells us that a world of love and harmony is really possible. Even though this contradicts everything we have be taught. Th is means we have to affirm to ourselves a few basic truths about the Great Mother. 1. The Great Mother loves us all unconditionally, because we ALL are Her children. So in no way will She judge, condemn or punish us. 2. The world of the Great Mother is a world of Love and Harmony. The world of conflict, fear, hatred and chaos was created by us. Not because we are bad or evil but because we are children and as such, \"we know not what we do\"."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 3. The Great Mother is all powerful, because She is the One, She is everything there is. She has given us the gift of freewill and will never interfere is our lives. Therefore She will only help and guide us if we give Her permission to do this. 4. The Great Mother will always be there for us and give us what help, if we allow Her. Unfortunately if we believe in a judgmental avenging god or in no god at all, that is the reality we have created and She cannot go against wh at we have chosen to believe. So therefore if we can go throughout our liv e reminding ourselves the Great Mother is all Powerful because She is the One. That She loves us all unconditionally because we are Her children. That we in truth live in a caring world of love and harmony. Because this is the world created by the Great Mother. The world of fear and chaos, then becomes an illusion created by us all collectively. Then it can become far easier for the Great Mother to help and guide us. It is like tuning into a radio station. The radio station we receive in our normal daily gives us negative thoughts and feelings about ourselves and the world we live in. This is the radio station we all have collectively created together and has created the frequency that creates our collective reality. If on the other hand we make a conscious effort to tune in to the frequency of th e Great Mother which is the frequency of unconditional love, harmony and compassion. Then we find we begin to tune into these thoughts and feelings and our lives begin to change for the better. If you find this difficult then simply keep repeat to yourself that; \"The true reality of our life (my life) is the realit y of love, compassionate and harmony.\" Or if you like; \"We live in a abundant universe of love and harmony\" and \"I am loved, (we are loved) by the Great Mother unconditionally\". Or any other positive words and feelings that support this theme. We then start to create in our lives a world of love and harmony because this is the real world created by Her.   "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 Chapter Fifteen THE FEMININE CREATRIX From what you read in this book it suggests ther e has been a secret war between a matriarchal religion and a patriarchal re ligion going on for thousands of years, and you would also be forgiven for thinking that the problems of this world are not between good and evil but between patriarchy and matriarchy. Yet to c ondemn patriarchy as \"bad\" or \"evil\" is not the answer. Because all you are doing is de-humanising patriarchy, without trying to underst and why we have patriarchy in the first place. In the last four thousand years of recorded histor y it has been accepted world wide that our creator is a man, so much so, that many people today cannot imagine a Supreme Creator as anything but a male. In accepting the masculine nature of our Creator we ha ve constructed a masculine, male dominated world. This world has reflected the mascu line values of competition and aggre ssion. The result is that we have been brainwashed for thousands of years to believe that we live in a world of conflict, hatred and suffering, to the extent that we now believe that this is the only world there is. So we are unable to believe that a world of love and harmony is possible and assume it is unrealistic because we don't know any different. We don't realise that the masculine world of conflict is crea ted by our beliefs about ourselves. It only requires to change our beliefs and respect and accept the feminine to bring about a more loving and caring world. The way it works is that if we accept that human nature is sinful or brutish then we become suspicious and fearful of other people. This fear blocks out any love, compassion or understanding we may have of other people. They in turn may have th e same fears and so do not treat us with any love or understanding. So we get caught in a viscous cycle of fear and distrust, which can lead to in extreme case to violence and hatred. So the assumption that other people are not to be truste d creates on the collective level a society of fear and even hatred. If on the other hand we assume all people are loving and caring then we will accept them with love as well. Most people will respond to our loving attitude and so creating a virtuous cycle of love and compassion. The paradox is that a belief in evil on the collective level creates evil, while a belief in love on the collective level creates a loving world. This has been recently proven scientifically. In recent years some scientists have been studying the effects of people's ability to trust others. A world Values Survey done by Ann Arbor of the Univ ersity of Michigan has asked people all over the world, \"Do you think strangers can generally be truste d?\". The highest is 65% in Norway and it is down to just 5% in Brazil. What came out of the survey was that the ability of people to trust strongly affected the economics of countries they live in. People in countries with the highest positive response also enjoyed the highest standard of living. While in countries where the trust level was below 30%, we re countries that have widespread poverty. To quote Steve Knack of the World Bank.- \"Trust is one of the most powerful factors affect ing a country's economic health. Where trust is low, individuals and organisations ar e more wary about engaging in fina ncial transactions, which tends to depress the national economy.\" Another factor that came out of this scientific surv ey is that the less trust with a society the higher the religious faith. The scientists explain this by claiming that if people cannot trust others they are forced to rely on a higher power. I have to say I can't agree with that explanation because if people are believing in a judgmental and punitive God then clearly they can't rely on this higher power either. It is more likely that people that have a very negative belie f in God, become very fearful of the world they live in. This \"God fearing\" attitude makes them fear others , so they feel they cannot trust either God or man. They also discovered that Breast-feeding also increased the trust levels in children while bottle- feeding had a negative effect. Which is interesting because during most of the 20th century male doctors were actively encouraging women to bottle-feed. Even today when scientific research has proven the benefits of breast-feeding, mothers are still en couraged not to breast feed for too long. If we accept that the masculine represents co mpetition, conflict, aggre ssion, war and hatred, all these forces come from one force, which is separa tion. On the other hand, feminine values are, Love, compassion and empathy, and all these forces come together to represent Oneness. So in other words the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 One is feminine. The One is all that there is, so we are all part of the One. Separation from the One is masculine which allows us all to become individuals . So the relationship between the feminine and the masculine, is the relationship between the One and th e individuals that make up our world. This is why the concept of a male supreme Creator is separated from the world. He creates the world but doesn't live in it, while the concept of the feminine Creator is that the universe is the One, that is to say, the Great Mother. Which means collectively we are all the Great Mother. This concept of Oneness is put forward by John Donne (1571-1631) in his famous poem, \"No Man Is An Island\". Whic h has the well known lines.- All mankind is of one author, and is one volume; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. Some mystic traditions attempt to claim that the One is masculine but this becomes a contradiction in terms. For how can the competitive masculine become One? So this belief makes life very difficult for mystics who attempt to tune into a masculine One. Some religions like Taoism and Buddhism have the concept of a genderless One, thoug h it has to be admitted that in the Tao-Te-Ching it does also call the Tao, \"The Mother\" or \"The Mysterious Female\". A strong argument can be made that the One is beyond concepts like male and female. Now there is merit is this, but there is a case for saying that the collective whole is Feminine, while we who live in the illusion of separation are masculine. So it means for us that the Mother Goddess is the One. She is all that there is, unlike the Creator God who is separate from the world and then is sepa rated from himself in being two Gods the father God and the Devil. We are given the illusion that we are born from the Great Mother so we imagine we are separated from her. This gives us the opportunity to experience individuality. So we become the children of the Great Mother to whom she has given the gifts of individuality and independence through the illusion of separation. The Ancients knew this and showed it in a very ancient symbol of a snake swallowing its tail. The snake's body forms a complete circle. The attribute of the circle is not only the feminine symbol of the vagina but it represents the whole or the One. The snake represents the penis so is a masculine symbol. With the snake's body forming the circle it shows the masculine is on the boundaries of the One. It means that the masculine is connected with the One but also can be seen in this symbol as outside of the One. It therefore becomes the perfect symbol showing the relationship between the One and the individual. Another ancient symbol saying the same thing is represented in Roman Catholic Churches all over the world in the image of the Virgin Mary holding a male baby. The Virgin Mary represents the feminine One and the male baby represents the masculine individual. Roman Catholics priests will tell you that this image only represents the mother of Jesus Christ holding him as a child. Yet this image is far older than Christianity and to some Roman Catholics is far more important to them than the image of Christ on the Cross. As mentioned before many followers of the Virgin Mary call her, \"The Mother of God\" which should be in Christian terms blasphemy as it sugges ts an ancient pagan idea that The Great Mother created God. Roman Catholic priests will point out that this saying only means that the Virgin Mary is the mortal mother of Jesus Christ. Yet if that is true then surely what the followers of the Virgin Mary should be calling her is, \"The mortal Mother of Jesus.\" Long before Christianity, the ancients called the Great Goddess, \"The Mother of all the Gods,\" which is very similar to what the followers of the Virgin Mary call her today. This suggests that it is a traditional older than the Christian Church. In the ancient Egyptian religion there is a similar image and that is of the Goddess Isis holding her baby Horus. Some scholars have suggested that the image of the Virgin Mary holding her child comes directly from the Image of the Goddess Isis doing the same thing. In the legend of Isis, she was married to Osiris who is in conflict with his brother Seth. In this conflict Seth murders Osiris and cuts him up into many pieces and scatters them all over Egypt. Isis th en goes out in search of these pieces. Putting them back together she brings Osiris back to life to have a child from him. From this union the child Horus is born and when he grows up he c ontinues the conflict with Seth. In this legend Isis takes no part in the conflict; her role is that of a healer. The conflict between Osiris and Seth that brings about Osiris being scattered into many pieces gives a clear symbol that competition and conflict cause s separation. Isis brings the pieces back together again making the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 separated masculine whole again. Yet in healing the masculine as represented by Osiris all she does is allow the competition and conflict to continue in the war between Horus and Seth. So this legend tells about the dance between the feminine as Isis and ma sculine as Osiris, Horus and Seth. The masculine continually creates separation and the feminine continua lly heals and restrains the separation. The role of the feminine Isis is to prevent the separation going to the extreme and destroying itself, and if it does, it is her role to bring the masculine back together again. Another ancient legend is that of the Hindu Goddess Kali. In this legend the Gods were exhausted by wars with demons whom it seems were winning the war. This is of course typical masculine behaviour calling your enemies demons or devils which justifies attacking and fighting them. So the Gods call for help from Kali or Devi the Great Moth er Goddess, depending whic h version of this story you read. Kali/Devi goes into battle with the demons and kills them all until she is left with the Demon King. The Demon King appeals to her sense of justice, claiming she has many fierce Goddesses to help her such as, Durga, Chamunda, Ambika. But she replies, \"I am all alone in the world, who else is there besides me\". This tells us clearly that she is the One. Kali/Devi then joins in battle with the Demon King but finds no matter how many pieces she cuts off him, these pieces then create other demons that in turn attack her. This symbolises clearly that war is not the way to overcome the masculine and separation. In fact it is war and co nflict that makes the masculine str onger, as it creates more and more separation. So in the end Kali solv es this problem by swallowing the Demon King whole, bringing the masculine back into the One. Which is also what Isis does to Osiris in the earlier versions of the Isis/Osiris stories. The legend goes on to say that having defeated the demons; Kali becomes intoxicated by blood and goes on to destroy the rest of mankind. The Gods are powerless to stop her. In a desperate attempt to prevent the destruction of the whole of mankind, the God Siva comes down from heaven and lays lifeless at her feet and Kali walks all over him. Seeing him lifeless at her feet her bl ood lust evaporates and the world is saved. This part of the legend shows us that once wars are started then there is no end to them. All over the world we see wars between traditional enemies who are unable to forgive each other and wars continue generation after genera tion. In other words conflict create s hatred and hatred creates more conflict. This cycle can only be broken when the masc uline represented by the God Siva surrenders to the feminine represented by Kali. The ancient Greeks and Romans represented lo ve, through the Goddesses Aphrodite and Venus. Somehow it makes sense to have a Goddess representing love. Jesu s in the New Testament attempted to promote the idea of a loving Father God, yet this never caught on even among Christians who mostly preferred the angry and judgmental Jehovah of the Old Testament. Many Christians also have problems with the image of Jesus himself who comes across as a very meek and mild man and therefore is seen as a bit of a wimp. This is why many Christians pref er the more warlike and macho prophets of the Old Testament and are more likely to quote them than Jesus. So it means if we choose to worshi p a male God and claim he is our creator, then we are in effect worshipping the male principles of competition, conflic t, aggression and separation, which in turn creates the great suffering we see in our world. History has pr oven this to be true with Christianity, which hasn't been a world of forgiveness, tolerance and \"loving thy neighbour\" as preached by Jesus. Christianity instead has a history of intolerance, war, genocide a nd hatred. The massacres of the Cathars, and Witches and the wars of the Crusaders and later on the countless wars between th e Roman Catholics and Protestants, the genocide of the native American and Australian peoples shows clearly how intolerant and warlike Christian societies have been. The same is true of the Moslems who also worship a male God. They have just as bad a record of intoleranc e, wars and genocide as the Christians have. If on the other hand we worship a Goddess as our Cr eatrix we are then allowing ourselves to also worship the ideals of love, harmony and Oneness. Un fortunately in all of recorded history we have no clear record of what a society woul d be like that worships a Creator Goddess. We know of societies that have worshipped both Goddesses and Gods, like the Anci ent Greeks, Romans or Egyptian but they made a male the Creator God. These societies had far more religious tolerance than the later Christian and Moslem civilisations. The same is true of the Hi ndus in India who worship both Gods and Goddesses. They again have more religious tolerance than the Moslems in Northern India and Pakistan. Yet we cannot say a society worshipping deities of both sexes is very much less warlik e than societies who only worship Gods. This is because the priests of male Gods are competitive with the followers of Goddesses."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 This forces priests or the priestesses of Goddess Temples to be as competitive in return to survive. So the love, peace and harmony of Goddess worship become s impossible while other people worship Gods and separation and interfere with those who worship Oneness. So it seems that Oneness and separation are in conflict with each other but it is not the nature of Oneness to compete with separation. Yet separation s ees this non-competitive nature as a threat to its existence. This is because the foundation of separa tion is an illusion. If we no longer believed in separation then we all woul d become One and we fear we would lose our individuality. Feminists have pointed out in many books how men have dominated women over many centuries through violence and intimidation. So even though it is more natural for women to love, care and empathise with others, men are able to brutalise women to the degree they are forced to accept masculine values of competition, aggression, intolerance and hatred. Yet although separation is in conflict with Oneness there also seem to be an attraction to one another. Traditionally men have dismissed women as being weak and illogical. Yet most men are very attracted to women. Likewise ev en though men have traditionally ab used women, it still doesn't stop women being very attracted to men. So does this suggest that the One as the feminine and separation as masculinity need each other? If we are all One, we would live in a world of peace and harmony, simply because if we are all of one mind then conflict of any kind becomes impossibl e. Yet in this Oneness relationships become impossible, because if we are all one, whom can we relate to? If there is nothing outside of the One then a world of Oneness becomes static. It just Is. It becomes perfection and once something becomes perfect there is no reason to move on from that pe rfection. This is why the feminine One needs the masculine separation to create rela tionships and movement. Unfortuna tely if the masculine is not controlled or restrained by the feminine it will quickly move into a vicious cycle of fear, hatred and destruction. Many of us might claim we would like to live in a world of love and harmony. Yet we betray ourselves every time we read a ficti onal book or watch TV or a film. It seems what we find entertaining is conflict and suffering. Men enjo y action stories and films involving extreme violence. Women prefer soap operas or romances but even in these stories there is still great conflict. No romantic story would be interesting if there wasn't a breakdown in the relationship before the happy ending. So we have to admit to ourselves that we are fascinated by conflict and suffering. If we admit to this then we also have to admit that we have conflict and suffering in our lives because we want them. The truth is that most people would fear a world that was in comple te harmony because it would be very boring. Yet living in a world of separation then makes peace and harmony become totally impossible. Separation creates fear, hatred a nd destruction. So a masculine so ciety becomes self-destructive and without the influence of the feminine it will destroy itself. For the last few thousand years we have seen the conflict caused by men becoming the dominant sex. Yet in that time even though women have been the submissive sex they have still worked very hard on men to civilise them. Men complain frequently that all women want to manipulate and change th em. Traditionally in their own quiet way women do change men and greatly modify the excess of conflict and hatred that men indulge in. This is why in very male dominated countries like Islam countries, men traditionally avoid the company of women as much as possible, because they fear that to be with women will make them \"soft\". Without the subtle influence of women, men woul d have destroyed themselves long ago. During the cold war between the West and the USSR both si des made and deployed e nough nuclear weapons to destroy the world many times over. During this war both sides became very close to using these weapons. There was one incident where the USSR ve ry nearly launched all her nuclear weapons because of a computer error. So we can see that had men be came even slightly more a ggressive in their nature, we as a species would have become extinct. We have a choice. We are able to be One and ther efore live in a world of static harmony. Or we continue to live in a world of separation where we can have relationships with others. This then becomes a more dynamic world but such a world leads of f ear, hatred suffering and finally to destruction. So it means the feminine One, needs the masculine separation to give it dynamism and relationships. While the masculine separation needs the feminine One to give it love harmony and peace to prevent it from destroying itself. So how is it possible for these very two very different forces to work together? This seems to be impossible because the One and separated are totally different. The"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 132 masculine mode of separation greatly fears the feminine One. This is because under the influence of the One he might lose his individuality. The femin ine for obvious reasons also fears the masculine separation, because for thousands of years her love for the masculine has always been returned with hatred and abuse. Are the fears of the masculine justified? In accepting the feminine Oneness will he lose all individuality? The feminine One is only able to love, as fear and hatred within the One is impossible. So when a women returns love from a man who shows he ha tes her, she is threatening him with her love as he fears he will lose his individuality if he returns her love with love. Yet women themselves are individuals as well. Women are able to love, empath ise and co-operate with ot hers and yet do not lose their individuality. Though it is admitted that the individualism of most wome n is far less than most men. Imagine a world where there are no males, a world where women were able to reproduce without men. Without the divisions created in society by men perhaps women will empathise with each other to such a degree that they would lose all individuality. This might have happened to matriarchal societies of the past where women dominated societies became so peaceful that they began to stagnate. So the masculine had to be encouraged to bring new dynamism into society. Yet because of the competitive nature of the masculine, it competed with the fe minine and in the end took control and dominated the feminine. Men then claimed that it was a masculine God that created the world and created a masculine society with all the conflict, fear, hatred and suffering we see in our recorded history. So because the masculine moved out of the control of the feminine, it means we have moved from one extreme to the other. So is this the only choice we have? Of a dynamic masculine world that is basically self- destructive, or a loving and peaceful feminine world where nothing much happens. Can't we have both? Can we not have a loving world that is also dynamic, in other words a world that is both individual and at One at the same time. In the past men have greatly feared and hated ve ry feminine women who have given them love in return for hatred and abuse. This suggests that the conflict between the On e and separation only comes about when the One is too feminine and the individual is too masculine. So this means that there might be a middle way between these two extremes. It is possible for women to learn from the masculine and men to learn from the feminine? This in theory should be the feminist relationshi p where both men and women are equals. Yet as we have seen such relationships are not very peacef ul. In recent years marria ge councillors have become a boom industry to try and fix up the conflict between couples, as more and more relationship break down and end in divorce. In fact the traditional patriarchal marriage where the man is the dominant partner was more stable than the feminist's e qual relationships of today. This is because of the way men think and feel . As men are very competitive equality doesn't come naturally for him because in his mind he is always thinking in terms of winners and losers. He is happy to be the dominant partner or the submissive part ner. But to be the equal partner is something that is totally alien to his nature. Men are by nature game players and to them life is a game of winners and losers. We can see this clearly when men had ideals of creating a equal society. The result was the French revolution and later Communism. Both attempts only made society only slightly more equal than other male dominated societies. In the end this ex periment was seen as a failure because not only did men totally fail to create a equal society, Communist societies began to stagnate when equality was forced on men. This is because very different things motivate men and women. The feminine is motivated by their maternal instinct and learn to love others. Most women are more than happy to spend their whole lives caring and looking after other people, like children, husbands, old people and animals. The masculine on the other hand is motivated by competition and without competition; men lose their strongest motivation. Men are able to some degree to live in harmony with women when they are the dominant partner, or as it seems in recent times if she is the dominant partner. In these relationships women play the dominant and masculine role, while men play the submissive and feminine role. Yet this doesn't mean that the sexes completely swap roles. Just because a woman is playing the dominant role it doesn't mean"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 she has to lose her contact with the One and lose her ability to love and care for others. Likewise because a man is playing a feminine role it doesn't mean he has to lose his individuality. Men representing masculinity and se paration find equality and co-opera tion very difficult. To him the only type of relationship that makes sense is a relationship where either he is in charge or this partner is in charge. If that is not clearly defined then he will continue to compete with his partner until it is mutually agreed that he dominates her or she dominates him. In other words the masculine mind needs a clearly defined \"pecking order\" for h im to have relationships with others. To create a caring society of peace, harmony and love which is dynamic where all people do not lose their individuality, requires us to accept that the One is feminine. We don't have to make the feminine the total ideal and reject individuality. Women have to take the lead and play the assertive masculine role, yet not lose their contact with the On e, while men have to learn how to play the feminine role of caring for others and yet not lose their individuality. The Great Mother has the same problem as a mortal mother. If a mother looks after her children too much she can ensure their safety, but in the process she doesn't allow them to grow. On the other hand if she gives them far too much freedom they w ill grow and learn how to look after themselves yet are more likely to be hurt. As children of the Great Mother we have demanded from her more freedom to look after ourselves. In doing so we have create d the world we now live in. Unfortunately in not knowing what we are doing we have created a world of f ear and suffering. It is now time to return to the Great Mother and to Oneness. To accept the guidance and wisdom of women who are her representatives on this Earth. For so long we have accepted a male God and ma sculine values in our world that we no longer believe in or even know that there is an alternative to this. Yet there is an alternative and that is the Feminine. It is not a matter of choosing between th ese alternatives because we can choose both if we wish to. We have experienced both, we have ex perienced Oneness and the pain and suffering of separation, and through this experience we can then lear n to live lives of being an individual in a world of Oneness. Patriarchal prie sts have done their best over the last few thousand years to destroy any knowledge of the Ancient Great Mother because they knew that if she were to return to consciousness their power would be destroyed. Fortunately this knowledge has been retained in th e teachings of Jesus, the Tao-Te- Ching and Secret Societies like the Freemasons who have given out this knowle dge bit by bit to the people. The knowledge that The Great Mother love s us all unconditionally is all the knowledge we need to start us on our return j ourney to our Comic Mother. Men have led the way, away from the Great Mother and Oneness into individuality. Now it is women's turn to lead us back to Oneness as individuals. A Freemason symbolic drawing, on the left, showing the return of female power. As usual the sex of the main figure is made ambiguous, to overcome censorship but the fact that she has breasts and no external genitals means she must be female. She has a chain around her arm suggesting she is not the Great Mother but is represents the female race and is being guided by the Mother Goddess. Likewise in turn she holds a chain, which is attached to a monkey. This could be the Monkey God that is featured within Hinduism and Buddhism, but this is a European picture. The monkey is probably, man, because it is men's stupidity that has created a world of warfare, injustice and poverty. So this picture show women taking control of men and preventing him from doing any more harm to the world."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 CONCLUSION The symbolism of Freemasonry suggests it is a G oddess religion. Now the problem with this is that it would be hard for a secret Goddess religion to survive in a world dominated by violent and ruthless patriarchal religions, because over many generations th e secrets of any secret society will eventually be betrayed to the ruling elite. In the past we have seen how ruthless the Church has been, through the massacre of the Gnostics, Cathars, Knight's Templar and the Witches. So if Freemasonry is a secret Goddess religion how has it escaped the same fate? The answer might be becau se as the Freemasons are an occult group they were able to use the occult to save themselves. The occult means, \"hidden knowledge\", and some people imagine that this hidden knowledge would only be about creating better magical spells. Ye t magic is not that eff ective unless the practitioner understands what it is, that makes magi c work. All of us have to power to do magic, the only difference between a true magician and a normal person is that the magician is conscious of his or her power and knows how to use it. While most ordinary people ar e blissfully unaware of their power and create the world they live in on the unconscious level. So it means that a Secret Occult Group who knows th e secret that, \"we all create our own reality\", will be very powerful in a world where the majority of people are unaware of this power. This then means that this occult group can use th eir power to create their own reality to ensure they will be never be caught or betrayed. In other words they can create a reality for themselves that ensures no harm comes to them or their love ones. The problem is that in passing this knowledge down over many generations somebody is going to get it all wrong. The know ledge may not get passed down properly and so the occult group can begin to loose their power. This would be true in the case of the Knights Templar and Witchcraft in the Middle-Ages. There would be no wa y they could be persecuted in the way they were, if they were aware of their power. As with many o ccult groups the teachings can get corrupted over many generations. To the degree that people start to believe that the power is in the words and ceremonies they use, and lose the knowledge that the power is within their own minds. The Witch hunts may of brought about a savage form of evolution, in that only Witches with the true knowledge of the power of the mind survived. So the secret history of the world is about shee p, wolves and goats. The sheep being ordinary people who are totally unaware of the power of the mi nd, then there are the wolves who are very aware of the power of the mind and use this power to gain personal wealth and power over other people. Then there are the goats who also are aware of the power the mind but use it to help others. Though it is possible for some people to be both a wolf and goat at the same time, in using mind power to help themselves and others. Now any secret society is going to end up having both wolves and goats as its members. So even if it starts off with a strong ideal of using its power to help the sheep. Over a few generations the membership can change until it is dominated by wolves who will use their power for personal gain. Likewise the opposite can happen. A priesthood can be cr eated with the purpose to gain power over the people but over many generations some of these priests may gain a conscience and see the harm they are doing to ordinary people. Like giving out negative be liefs that God is judgmental and cruel. So you may find a ruler, high priests or a pope who will change the teachings to give the people a more positive attitude towards themselves. Or you may find individual members of th e Priesthood who are not interested in personal gain. An example of this is St Francis Of Assisi, (1181-1226) who attempted to give the people more positive ideas about Christianity. Over the last two thousand years we can see th at the priesthood of religions like Christianity, Islam and Buddhism has dominated the world. These re ligions would be dominated mostly by wolves as the priesthood of all these religions have become very powerful and have given the people fatalistic teachings that have made them powerless. Yet secret Occult organisations have fought back like Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Alchemists and Witches in Christian countries a nd the Sufi in Islam countries. People in these organisations would mostly be goats because they wouldn't achieve the same wealth and power belonging to a secret organisation as belonging to the establishment priesthood."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 Over many generations it seems that the power of the Christian priest hood declined. Probably because they began to forget that there power comes from their own minds and began to rely too much on material power. While the power of the Freemasons grew, because being ruthlessly persecuted it meant that only the members who were very aware of the power of the mind survived. Yet if as claimed by conspiracy theorist that Freemasons now rule the wo rld it is more likely that Freemasonry has now been taken over by wolves. Simply because the wolves will always go were the power is, and if it is no longer in the Christian Church, they will de sert the Church and join the groups were the real power is. So the paradox could be that this could end up that goats will dominate the Christian Church and Freemasonry dominated by wolves. The proof that the wolves are still very much in charge whether they are Freemasons or not comes from Keynesian economics. When I was a school in the 1950s I was taught that Keynesian economics was how the Western world got out of the economic Depression of the 1930s and was also the reason for the post war economic boom. The way this theory worked was to bring full employment to the whole economy. Where there was high unemployment like in North America and Eu rope in the 1930s, governments simply invent jobs like building roads and other public works to give the unemployed a good wage. The result was that everyone would have money to spare to pay for g oods. This in turn would increase demand, allowing factories to go into full production. The increase in productions means the factories could employ more workers and have bigger profits. Which gives a big boost to the economy. So in theory everyone would benefit, the workers, retailers and industry. It seems to good to be true, it was a win-win situation for everyone. The problem with having full employment was that it gave greater power to the workers and the trade unions. This was because if any worker didn't like the wages or conditions of his job he was free to go and get a job elsewhere. This meant that the bo sses had to give into worker demands or he could quickly lose his workforce. The result was that worker wages kept on steadily rising from the end of the Second World War to the end of the 1980s, as did infla tion. The result was that during this period the gap between rich and poor was slowly decreasing. Which wasn't good new for the rich. The problem also for the rich was that the two largest countries in the world, namely the USSR and China had become Communist states. So the We st was in competition with the Communist countries for the hearts and minds of the people. Keynesian then suited Western ruling elite very well because they could rightly say to their workers that they were far better of living in a Western democracy than in a Communist country. Then in the 1970s things began to change for th e Communist. The Soviet Union was finding it very hard to keep up with the arms race with the US A. They had all ready had to drop out of the space race as they no longer could afford the expensive ro ckets needed to put a man on the Moon. While in China the Chinese leader Mao-Tse-Tung had died in 1976 and the leaders who took over no longer wanted to continue with the Communist system. This was a clear sign to Western leaders that they were winning the Cold war against Communism. So at the end of the 1970s some Western countries began to adopt Monetarism. It was sold to the public as a new form of economics, but in fact it wasn't new at all. It was the type of economics that caused the Wall St crash and depression throughout the West during the 1930s. In the 1980s all Western countries adopted Monetari sm and it didn't matter if the government at the time was socialist or conservative. The politicians claimed at the time they needed to squeeze inflation out of the economy. What they didn't say was they way you done this was to have high unemployment which undermined the power of the workers and Trade Unions. This was because the workers had to accept the wages and conditions that th e employers gave them or they would be sacked, and out of work. With high unemployment this became a real problem as it now wasn't easy to get a new job. The result was that worker's wages demands b ecome less and this stopped inflation in its tracks. Not only did unemployment dramatically rose th roughout the West but the West went into a \"Recession\", (Just another name for a Depression like we had in the 1930s). The only people who benefited from this was the rich. Since the early 1980s the gap between rich and poor has greatly increased. Off course the so-called \"free press\" of the West ern countries made no mention of this in their newspapers. Neither did the so-called left wing soci alist parties, simply because all newspapers and TV"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 channels are owned by very rich men. Likewise the l eaders of left wing parties are not exactly poor either and personally benefit from the in creasing gap between rich and poor. So it means that Keynesian economics is about givi ng more power and wealth to the people, while Monetarism is about keeping power and wealth ex clusively in the hands of the ruling elite. As Monetarism has been adopted throughout the world it m eans that the wolves are still in charge. Yet we do see other signs they show that there are attempts to bring more power to the people like the emancipation of women. So perhaps it is both goats and wolves who are in charge. It may be that the ruling elite may want to bring about a utopian \"New Worl d Order\" but not yet. After all if they was going to give power to the people or to women they would lose their power. So even it the ruling elite have ideals about cr eating a utopian world they will find the idea of giving up power very difficult. So even if the Freemasons are ruling the world they now are the establishment and as such would ha ve to same attitudes and the Chri stian priesthood they wrestled power away from. If the common people or women are to have power then it is very unlikely that the ruling elite will give it to them. This means the only way the people can have power is for them to take it themselves, and the only way that could happen if the secret of Mind Power become common knowledge. Unfortunately in this is not easy, as explained in the Tao-Te-Ching.- When the superior scholar is told of the Tao, He works hard to practise it. When the middling scholar is told of the Tao, It seems that sometimes he keeps it and sometimes he loses it. When the inferior scholar is told of the Tao, he laughs aloud at it. If it were not laughed at, it would not be sufficient to be Tao. This then is the problem. Concepts like, we create our own reality, or that our Creatrix in feminine in nature, are not universally believe d, which I find perfectly understandable, because personally, it took years for me to accept and fully unders tand these concepts. Yet some of these teaching have found their ways into the lives of ordinary pe ople. Like in the New Thought movement that was started in the USA during the 19th century. If was from New Thought the ideas like \"positive thinking\" came from. What is not realised by many people is that magic and positive thinking are exactly the same thing. The only difference is that positive thinking mostly uses affirmations and visualisations, while magic mostly uses ceremonies and rituals. Many people are very hostile against the idea th at we live in a world of mind, for the following reasons. 1. It doesn't seem to fit in with our personal experiences. We may try to \"will\" something to happen but it doesn't seem to work. What is not r ealised is that we create our reality through our unconscious minds. So if we want change our re ality we have to re-programme our unconscious thoughts. 2 If we accept we create our own reality then in means we are responsible for our lives. Which is something that not all people want to do. It is easier to blame fate, God or other people for things that go wrong. We are in truth at the mercy of fate or othe r people while we believe we are powerless. It is only when we start to re-programme our unconscious minds that we then can take responsibly for our lives. 3. Some people are very frightened of the idea that what we think can create our reality. This is because they know they have very little control over their thoughts and feelings. Not realising that if they study this subject they can find ways to learn how to do this. 4 Although some people can see the logic that we live in a world of mind, they can be put off by the hard work needed to gain control of our lives. Many people want instant fixes, and unfortunately some positive thinking books encourage this way of th inking, by telling the reader how easy it all is. Whereas in truth most people have to go through year s of meditation and other spiritual exercises to learn how to gain control of their minds and lives. So although many occult groups keep their work secret, the truth is that they don't have to because if they were to openly talk about it, they wouldn't be believed anyway. This then is why it is mostly the wolves that rule our world. Secret Occult Groups can get themselves into positions of wealth and power simply because there is so little competition from the sheep. The good news is that we all have the power to collectively create a caring world of abundance and happiness. The bad news is that most people seem to be unaware of this and even resistant to these"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 ideas. This is why the Freemasons can clearly tell the world their secrets in their symbols and very few people understand them. Yet things are changing for the better. Occult knowledge is leaking out, and it started with the New Thought, or Mental Science movement in America in the 19th century. New Thought came out of the work of a Au strian Freemason Doctor, Franz Anton Mesmer, (1734-1815). As a young man he exper imented with magnets as a way to cure his patients and it seems was successful. Then he discovered he could get the curative effects without magnets. Trying to make sense out of this he formed a theory of Animal Ma gnetism and using this theo ry found he was able to effectively cure many people. This brought about the hostility of other doctors in Vienna and he was forced to move. He travelled to Paris and caused a sensation with the way he was able to cure so many people. Then he was investigated by a panel of doctors, which included the Freemason Benjamin Franklin, who managed to establish that Animal Magnetism didn't exist. The shooting down of Mesmer's Animal Magnetism th eory wasn't the end of the story because no one could come up with a sensible explanation for the reason for Mesmer's ability to cure his patients. Other people leant from Mesmer and from this came the practice of Mesmerism. Later on Mesmerism was to be called the more respectable name of hypnotism. Mesmerist in the 19th century used their powers in very much the same was as hypnotist do today. With many using it as a form of entertainment by hypnotising people, but others tried to continue Mesmer's work and use it for healing. One of th ese stage mesmerists was Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802-66) who practised in USA. In his act he ha d another young man called Lucius Burkmar whom he would mesmerise. Then as a side line Burkmar would also diagnose illness while a trance. Then e would give to patients methods they could cure themselves , that outraged Quimby, because some of these cures seemed to be nonsensical. Yet he was to find they worked when the patients tried them out. Burkmar even cured the sceptical Quimby of back trouble usin g another cranky cure. Quimby then came to the conclusion that it must be the mind that was affecti ng these cures. He reasoned that if Burkmar could give patients methods of trea tment that seem to appeal to their d eepest beliefs, then it would heal them. (A better explaination would be that Burkmar was gi ving treatments that appealed to the patient's unconscious mind. But this was before Fre ud make his ground breaking discoveries.) Quimby set himself up as a full time healer and b ecame very successful using the principle that it was the mind that healed people. One of the people he successfully healed was Mary Baker Eddy. She began to study his method of healing but they soon came to a disagreement. As she was a committed Christian she claimed it was only God who could give healing, while Quimby saw his treatment in term of a mind cure. This was to cause a spit between the followers of Quimby and Mary Baker Eddy. Yet in some ways it doesn't really matter whether you say it is God or simply the Mind that does the healing, both methods work. Mary Baker Eddy went on to create the Christian s ect Christian Science. Unfortunately her very authorisation manner aliena ted some of the more talented heal ers her organisation, resulting in some leaving to form their own versions of Christian Scie nce. One of these people was Emma Curtis Hopkins, she had a far more open-minded appr oach to healing. She took New Thought away from the idea it was just a mind cure or a Christian Doctrine into the rea lm of Mysticism. Where she put forward the concept that we are all of One Mind. She also became known as the, \"teachers of teachers\", this was because her pupils started the three major New thought organisations after Christian Science. Two of her pupils Nona L. Brooks and Melinda Cramer, were the founders of Divine Science. Anothe r two, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore started Unity. While Erne st S. Homes who was one of her last pupils founded the Church of Religious Science. She even had something to teach about the future roles of men and women. Not only did her school encourage women to take th ese leadership roles, but she actually based her theology on an interpretation of the Trinity based on ideas initiated by Joachim of Fiore which stated that there were three eras in the history of this traditional trio. The first was the patriarchal idea of \"God the Father\", the second was a time of freedom for th e general population which was signified by the birth of Jesus, and the third, \"the Spirit, the Truth-Principl e, or the Mother-Principle,\" focused on the power of women. Ernest Holmes went on to teach Norman Vincent Peale who wa s a Freemason. He wrote many popular books on Mind Science and manage d to bring these ideas to the general public in the form of \"positive thinking\"."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 Since the time of Freud and his discovery of the unconscious mind it has been easier to explain how \"New Thought\" works. It seems that the uncons cious mind controls everything about our lives, how we think and feel and the reality we live in. As many people have discovered the conscious mind seems to be helpless in the face of the power of the unconscious mind. Unless we understand what is its function. What modern \"New Thought\" or \"Positiv e Thinking\" writers and discovering is that the unconscious mind acts like a computer while the conscious mind is its programmer. So the job of the conscious mind is simply to programme the unc onscious mind. Or reprogram the unconscious mind, when it has programmes within it that are not helpful. Today this is mostly done through affirmations and visualisation but in the past, occult groups done this through ceremony and ritual. As Freemason George Steinmetz was to write in his book \"Freemasonry Its Hidden Meaning\". - Through its careful and secret teaching Freemasonry has preserved knowledge of Mental Science through the dark ages of ignorance, so that in our mo re enlightened day, when a man has the right to think for himself and express those thoughts openly, th e great storehouse of knowledge is found stocked with the fundamental ideas. Like in most things esoteric we find there is Free masonry involvement. Like the fact one of the most important New Thought organisations Christian Science uses the symbol of the crown and the cross. Which is also a Freemasonry symbol. The crown also has five points on it. So if it were laid out flat it would be a five pointed star or Pentagram. As prev iously explained the Pentagram is associated with the Rose, so it is sort of Rosy Cross symbol, as used by the Rosicrucians. The cross also goes through the crown showing an obvious sexual association. Thoug h it is also a symbol of unity of making the masculine and feminine One. Christian Science was also the first Christian sect to put forward the"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 139 concept of a Father and Mother god a nd so help to bring back the Goddess. It was also the first Christian Sect to be started and led solely by a woman, Ma ry Baker Eddy. Her first husband Colonel George Washington Glover was a Freemason. She had some of her writings published in \"Freemason's Monthly Magazine\" and many early Christian Scientists leaders under Mary Baker Eddy were also Freemasons. Also organisations like the Theos ophical society and the Golden Da wn were also created in the 19th century bringing to Christian countries many Ea stern and Pagan spiritual beliefs. Then in the 1950s Gerald Gardner started Witchcraft. These three organisations have ve ry direct and clear Freemasonry connections. From all these organisations the New Age movement was created which allows ordinary people like me, to gain access to esoteric teachings. Though it seems not all Freemasons want to give out their Occult secrets. Benjamin Franklin was hostile to the work of Mesmer. It suggests that eith er Franklin didn't get involved in the occult side of Freemasonry, or he would have realised what was cau sing these cures. Or he believed that Mesmer was discovering occult secrets that he didn't want the ge neral public to know about. So it could be that some Freemasons want to inform the public of their se cret occult knowledge while others are against this. Yet slowly this is filtering into the mainstream where you can find New Age ideas being written about in women's magazines. Positive thinking is al so becoming \"respectable\" and being taken up by the business and sports people because th ey find that it works. So there are signs that there are some people within the Freemasons and other Secret Occult Organisations are attempting to give out their secrets to ordinary people. This is in truth is the only wa y we can create a better world for us all, on both the personal and collective levels. Is to give out the secrets that our Cr eator is a Mother Goddess who gives us unconditional love, and that we are infant Gods a nd Goddesses who have the power to be whatever we want to be.
