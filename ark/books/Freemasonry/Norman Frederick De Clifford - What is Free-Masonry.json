SECOND To Morality - - To the Duty that Man owes to his God, his country, his neigh- bor and to himself. We shall speak of Masonry and morality not only as it is being practiced today, but in every age of the world's his- tory. We shall also go into the Religions of the world. We shall endeavor to show all who may read this series of books, that the system of Morality embodied in Masonry embraces the ethics of all Religions, all Sci- ence and all Philosophies that have ever existed upon the face of the earth.

Masonry does not teach or believe in Sun wor- ship, yet the Master Mason knows all the profound philosophical truths that underlie the Religions of the ancient Persians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Phoenic- ians, Peruvians, Britons, Scandinavians and the Sun Worshipers of the world universal. Masonry does not teach the Religion of Mohammed. Neither do Free- masons believe in its prophet as the inspired of God. Masonry does not teach or ask its members to prac- tice Hebraism any farther than a belief in the ONE, Eternal, Everlasting, Supreme Architect of the Uni- verse. Neither does Masonry teach Christ or Chris- tianity. But it does most assuredly Claim that No ONE Religion has or contains the whole of TRUTH. But it teaches every Freemason to believe and posi- tively know that each and every one does contain a part of the Eternal Verities of the Ancient Wisdom Religion that was taught by a Venerable Association or Brotherhood of ancient India. Freemasons believe in the ONE ABSOLUTE EVERLASTING GOD, a knowledge of whom passeth all understanding. Be- fore whom all men bow in Awe and Adoration. THIRD In relation to the Allegories, Legends, and Symbols that permeates the whole of Masonry. We will endeavor to lift the veil and unfold to you their True meaning. Religions of every age, from the most ancient to the present day, are filled with Allegories. We also find them permeating the mythologies of all nations and peoples. The Brahmins, Zarathustrians and ancient Egyptians used them. So did the Babylonians, Phoenicians, Peruvians and Scandinavians. And it"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 7 is a well known fact that the Jewish Rabbins used them in their religious teachings more freely than (perhaps) any other people. The Christian philos- ophy are full of them, in fact, Christ Himself taught in parables (Allegories). They seem to have been the favorite method adopted by the ancient members of our Royal Craft in order to hide from the profane their Esoteric mysteries. The Legends, Allegories and Sym- bols of Masonry are purely Allegorical. They teach us a knowledge of Life, Death and the Immortality of the Soul. All our Masonic Legends, Allegories and Symbols are perfectly and easily understood by those who have been \"duly and truly prepared\" and who have put themselves into a position to Receive and understand them. More especially is this so to him who has kept his First Vow To subdue his passions and improve himself in Masonry. In this series we will endeavor to unfold some of the most sublime Truths that are embodied in the Allegories and Symbolism of our most Illustrious Fra- ternity. FOURTH We shall find a most profoundly beau- tiful scientific philosophy in the Metaphysical and Ethical teachings of Masonry which are embodied in those Allegories and Symbols. We shall also find that those sublime teachings and that profound Scientific Philosophy have come down to us from a Venerable Association or Brotherhood of India known as \"The Great School of the Masters\" which have had a con- tinuous existence from the Dawn of Civilization to the present day. It was from this source and from that country (ANCIENT INDIA) that our most Illus-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 The Lion's Paw Series trious Fraternity originated. And long centuries afterwards it was cradled on the banks of the Eu- phrates and the River Nile, ages before the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were raised to gratify the whim of a daughter of Ebactana; or the foundation of the Great Pyramid was laid in the plains of Gizeh. Ritualism and the Veiled Symbols of Masonry con- ceal the very essence and aroma of the Wisdom that belonged to that Venerable Association or Brother- hood of Masters, including the profound philosophies that were concealed in the Indian, Mazdean and Egyptian mysteries. And we want you to know, my dear Brothers and readers, that: That Association of Masters is still in existence. They hold the KEY to the solution of LIFE, DEATH and the IMMORTAL- ITY OF THE SOUL. Before concluding this Foreword I desire to say, that there is no question in my mind, but, that the earliest peoples in all countries throughout the whole world worshipped Nature in all her wonderful mani- festations and differentiations. The sublimity and grandeur of mountain peaks, the raging torrents, waterfalls, the dark and silent rivers and hollow cliffs, as well as the dark mysterious caverns, the towering pines all were no doubt worshipped as emblems of their Gods. In the same way the Sun, Moon and Stars as well as their differentiations were worshipped as gods. Today as in the dim and misty ages of the past, we find Sun worshippers who ascribe to that glorious orb God-like powers and attributes which we shall speak of in the body of this work. I do not believe"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 9 that any of the intellectual people of those various epochs in the ancient or earlier ages worshipped any of the above named Emblems or Symbols as the TRUE or ACTUAL GOD. But only emblematic of that ONE GREAT ABSOLUTE CREATOR OR CONTAINER OF ALL THINGS. The greatest mysteries in the universe are those that are ever going on around us. So common to us that we seldom or never take note of them or even reflect upon them. Learned men tell us of the Laws of Nature that regulate the motions of the Sun, Moon, Planets and Stars in their orbits flashing along in tre- menduous circles. Each and every one revolving upon their axis, shining in the infinitude of space with a refulgent glory inexpressibly grand and beautiful, moving with inconceivable rapidity through the in- finitude of space. No wonder that man in the early ages ascribed God-like powers to them and worshipped them. For in those remote times God was a mystery to those people as He is to us of today yes, my Broth- ers, everything in the universe that surrounds us is a mystery to us and to all men. Life as an abstract idea, a Power or a Principle was but little understood or grasped by early man. But the manifestations and differentiations of Nature attracted his attention and he formulated ideas re- specting them. And they like civilized men of all na- tions formulated Gods, to suit their own spiritual needs. And they endowed them with the peculiar at- tributes and general characteristics of the worshippers themselves."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 The Lion's Paw Series The devotees of pre-Vedic India builded their most sacred shrines distant from the thronging multitudes.

THE AUTHOR of this little volume has en- deavored to answer the question in the following pages, \"WHAT IS FREE-MASONRY?\" by asking another question What is Masonry?

By simply telling you that \"Masonry is a peculiar system of Morality veiled in Allegory and illustrated by Symbols, that statement alone would not answer the question What is Free-Masonry?

TO PREMISE my remarks in relation to this stu- pendous question so that you, my dear Brothers, may be enabled to thoroughly understand its true meaning, it will be necessary for me to ask another question, and that is What is Masonry? and differ- entiate between FREE-MASONARY and MA- SONRY. In order to do this I want you to distinctly understand that, Masonry is a peculiar system of Morality veiled in Allegory and illustrated by Sym- bols. But in order to better define the word Masonry I shall be compelled to answer another question, which is From whence did we receive this System of Moral- ity, veiled in Allegory and illustrated by symbols? In order to answer this last question fully and com- prehensively it will necessitate my going into the Origin and Antiquity of Masonry. Then into detail in i elation to the main or original questions, showing you that Masonry has a History, a Literature and a Philos- ophy, that it is founded upon an exact science, and that he who desires to thoroughly understand this progressive scientific philosophy embodied in its Alle- gories and Symbols, must read, study, reflect, digest and discriminate."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"18 The Lion's Paw Series In the following pages I will endeavor to tell you what Masonry is, what it stands for, what it teaches and illustrate the subject matter fully and compre- hensively. Masonry has stepped across the threshhold of the twentieth century, bringing with it all those sublimely grand and beautiful philosophic Truths that were taught, practiced and thoroughly understood long drifting ages before the Vedic hymns or Mantrams were first chanted under the shadow of the Hindu Rush or Himalaya mountains of ancient India. The home and birthplace of our great ancestors, the Ary- ans of that country. From which country and source Masonry has found its way to every corner of the world universal. And today the sun never sets upon our beloved and most illustrious fraternity, for it is al- ways at its meridian height and glory with respect to Masonry. The wisdom and intellectual development of the Rishis and Sages of ancient India, with the profound scientific philosophical truths which have been handed down to us of today, were studied, taught and prac- ticed in the hoary ages of prehistoric civilizations of the dim and misty past, under the dawning light of a New Age and a New Race, by peoples whose visions were illuminated by the dying embers of the Atlan- teans and Lemurians. Races that have passed or are passing away, but who have left behind them the very essence and aroma of their ancient wisdom, knowledge and wondrous civilization. The traditions connected with those older peoples have helped us on to a proper understanding of the Light, Knowledge and Truths taught in our Symbolic Lodges. But the Gnosis of"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 19 those teachings are now only taught behind the closed doors of the Lodges, Chapters, Councils and Consis- tories of our beloved Scottish Rite of Free-Masonry. If any Masonic student who asks the question, \"What is Free-Masonry?\" or desires to know from whence it came and prove its antiquity, let him search for himself as I have, and his investigations will most assuredly lead him on to the same conclusions as my- self --That the Origin and Antiquity of our beloved fraternity rests upon a foundation that can be traced back link by link into the most remote civilizations of the dim and misty past thousands of years before Jesus of Nazareth preached the Beatitudes through- out Judea and gave to the Jews what \"Chrishna\" had preached and practiced and taught his people one thousand, two hundred years before the Master Christ said, \"I am the Door,\" \"The Way,\" and \"The Light.\" Long years before the harp of Israel grew melodious with the songs of Sol-Om-On or King David bought the threshing floor from Oman the Jebusite whereon to erect a temple to the most \"High God of Israel,\" ages before the lawgiver Moses, was lifted in his rush cradle from the flowing waters of the River Nile. Long drifting centuries before Abram crossed the plains of Mamre in company with Angels or paid his dues or tithes to the Hierophant of the Order of Melchizedeck or the Jews were a people.

And that all those profound truths have come down to us of the twentieth century through those long drifting ages from one generation to another. There has never existed a time in the history of the world when the teachings of that Venerable Brother- hood were not being given forth or taught in order to help poor struggling humanity on to higher planes of intellectual and spiritual unfoldment, and we must distinctly understand that a vast number of our sub- limely beautiful and glorious Masonic Truths are em- bodied in all Religions and all Philosophies, and that they are not New Truths, but they are as old as the stars. The volume of the Sacred Law tells us in the language of the writers: \"Ein Chodosh tacash ha Shemesh\" (There is not new under the sun) See Eccles. 1st Chp., 9th verse et seq., That man would be more than a God who could invent or discover any- thing which has never been in existence before. Ragon in \"Maconnerie Occulte\" tells us that: Humanity only seems to progress in achieving one discovery after the other, as in truth it only finds that which it had lost. Most of our modern inventions for which we claim so much glory, are after all, things peo- ple were acquainted with three or four thousands years back. Lost to us through wars, flood and fire, their very existence became obliterated from the mem- ory of man. And now modern Thinkers begin to re- discover them once more. My dear brothers and readers, the farther back we go into the realms of prehistoric civilizations search- ing for the Wisdom and Knowledge belonging to the Brotherhood of a pre-historic age, the more will we"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 21 be confronted with unmistakable evidences of their great learning and most extraordinary intellectual and spiritual development. We will also recognize in the magnificent monuments of India, Assyria and the val- ley of the Nile, tokens of their wondrous knowledge in Astronomy, Geometry, Mathematics, as well as the state of perfection to which they had arrived in all Arts, Sciences and Philosophies. Besides these, we have proof positive of the existence of a science known to this Venerable Association or Brotherhood of an- cient India, which men of the present day cannot prop- erly understand or interpret, or at best only dimly sense. Right here I will positively assert that All Re- ligions, all Philosophies and all Sciences for this race had their origin in the \"Land of The Vedas,\" whose links in the chain of evidence can be traced back to its original source broken and disfigured as they are, yet, still with fragments here and there to connect us with the glory that belonged to the ancient Wisdom or \"Se- cret Doctrine\" of that Venerable Association or Lodge of Perfect Masters which was at its zenith and crowned with glory when Science, Religion and Phi- losophy walked hand in hand together. This great Brotherhood inherited all the Wisdom belonging to the Atlanteans and Lemurians whose mighty traditions they thoroughly understood and comprehended.

The teach- ings of Anaxagorus, Empedocles, Democritus and oth- ers are being taught today in our schools and colleges. Gallileo was not the first man to discover the motions of the earth. The rotation of this planet upon its axis, and the heliocentric system was taught by Pythagorus and others B. C. 700. As above stated the motions of the earth were understood at this early date, and yet, during the reign of the Emperor Constantine in the year A. D. 217 his son Crispus Caesar was taught by his preceptor Lactantius that: the earth was a plane surrounded by the sky. That earth itself being com- posed of Fire and Water, and his venerable preceptor, the Holy Father, warned him against believing in the heretical doctrine of the earth's globular form. What the world has lost through the bigotry and fanaticism of the early Church Fathers will never be fully realized by the present generation. But there is one very great satisfaction to all Free-Masons, and that is THE KEY to the solution has never been lost, and the Light of the ancient wisdom of the Brotherhood will come forth once again as it did in the days of Eliola in the Golden Age of Egypt from the misty veil that enshrouds it for the benefit of Masonry in par- ticular and humanity in general.

Let us think for one moment of the millions of priceless books and MSS. burnt, of monuments with their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols pulverized to dust. Of the bands of early hermits and ascetics roaming around among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert or in mountain, val- ley and highland, seeking for and eager to destroy every scroll, papyrus or parchment that they could lay their hands on, if it only bore the symbol of the Tau; or any other sign borrowed or appropriated by the New faith and we will then see plainly how it is that so little has come down to us of the records of our be- loved Fraternity. Verily the fiendish spirit and fanati- cism of the early Church Fathers as well as the fol- lowers of Islam has loved from the first to dwell in darkness or ignorance rather than in Light and Truth. It was just such things that I have just described that tore asunder and destroyed many of the links in the chain of evidence connecting Free-Masonry of the day with the Brotherhood of ancient India."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 25 CHAPTER II Investigations After many years of research in India, Australia, Persia, Assyria, the valley of the Nile from Cairo to Khartoum and the Islands of the Southern Pacific ocean as well as this American continent from Canada to Patagonia I am positively certain that Free-Masonry is a lineal descendant of an ancient Association of Ven- erable Masters in India to whom I have so frequently referred in this chapter.

Just as it did in those gopuras of India as well as in the cave temples of the Mazdean Hierophants and those stupendous fabrics that adorned the banks of the River Nile; long centuries before the couchant Sphinx looked to the East; ages before the foundation of the Pyramids were laid in the plains of Gizeh, or the \"Temple of Light was closed, when Egypt became the Land of Darkness.

In every epoch of the world's history these profound philosophical teach- ings have been given forth by the Great Brotherhood with all its harmonious system to all those who have been \"Duly and Truly Prepared\" and found worthy and well qualified to receive them.

After reading the 6th and 7th chapters of Hebrews turn to the one hundredth and tenth chapter of Psalms and to the fourth verse and you will find that King David was made a Priest forever after the Order of Melchi- zedeck.

Returning homeward flushed with victory, laden with spoils of war, he meets the Hierophant of the Order of Melchizedeck the so-called King of Salem the Prince of Peace, who brought forth bread and wine and blessed him. And Abram paid his dues (or tithes) unto him, which clearly proves that Abram himself belonged to that ancient \"Order of Melchizedeck. Remember this was not a Jewish Order, and from the evidence of the volume of the \"Sacred Law\" or Holy Bible, it clearly shows that the Order of Melchizedeck was in existence long before the Jews were a tribe or a people.

There is no question in my mind but that the Es- sences were lineal descendants of the Order of Mel- chizedeck and that Venerable Association of India, a branch or lodge of which was founded early in the golden age by Eliola in Egypt. This was done by the express desire of the Venerable Masters themselves. It was established at the very beginning of Egyptian civilization, at which time the people were hungering and thirsting for just such profound knowledge and scientific revelations. It was this Great Lodge and its work which caused Egypt to develop to such glorious heights of intellectual and spiritual ascendency.

Ancient History begins with the earliest events of historic records and ends with the fall of the Roman Empire A. D. 476. Medieval History is also known as the Middle Ages. It commences with the fall of the Roman Empire A. D. 476 and continues to the discovery of America A. D. 1492. Modern History extends from the discovery of America up to the pres- ent year and day."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"32 The Lion's Paw Series The Christian Nations of the world begin their time or era from the Birth of Jesus of Nazareth, or, Christ the Master.

History is also subdivided into History of Civili- zation, Sacred History, Profane History, Ecclesiasti- cal History and Civil or Political History. I have written this definition of History and its sub-divisions in order that you may realize the fact that if you desire to follow the positive assertions made and given to us in our Rituals, you will most assuredly find it necessary to make an especial study of all kinds of history in order to prove the truth of the assertions therein made, that \"Masonry has been in existence from time immemorial, and the best men of every epoch of the world's history have been members of our Fraternity,\" consequently if you are earnest in your desire to prove the truth of what our Rituals tell us, search for yourselves; especially among the sacred writings of every nation and people and more particularly our own volume of The Sacred Law or Bible.

The \"PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY\" treats of the events of the past in connections with their conse- quences and deduces from them certain principles which may serve as a guide to statesmen in conducting the \"affairs of nations.\" Thus History has been called \"Philosophy teaching by example,\" and as a very great writer and author has said, \"Social advancement is as completely under the control of natural law as is bodily growth. The life of an individual is a minia- ture of the Life of a Nation.\" If any of my readers are desirous of search- ing for proof of the Origin and Antiquity of Masonry I most earnestly ask them to follow the lines I have laid down above. Before going farther into this subject I desire to quote you from \"THE HISTORY OF FREE- MASONRY,\" by A. G. Mackey M. D. In his Preface on page vi, he informs us that \"The second part of the work will pass out of the field of Myth and Legend and be devoted to the AUTHENTIC? (Bold face and query mine) or recorded history of Free-Masonry.\" Rejecting as wholly untenable and unsupported by historical evidences the various hypotheses of the origin of the institution in the Pagen Mysteries in the Temple of Solomon, or in the Crusades, an at- tempt has been made to trace its birth to the Roman College of Artificers, which presents us with an al- most identical organization of builders and architects. Following the progress of the Roman Masons of the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"34 The Lion's Paw Series college through their works, to the different provinces of the Empire where they went accompanying the Legions in their victorious excursions, we would find the art of building was communicated by them to the Italians, the Spaniards, the Gauls and the Britons. \"The hypotheses sought to be sustained in inves- tigating the history of Free-Masonry in the present work, succintly stated as follows: Operative Masonry is the basis on which Speculative Free-Masonry is founded . . . that is to say, the Lodges of Free-Masons of the present day are the successors of Operative Masons which existed all over Europe dur- ing the Middle Ages and up to the beginning of the eighteenth century \"Free-Masonry can be traced only to an associa- tion of builders or architects. Every ceremony in the Ritual, every Symbol in the philosophy of Speculative Free-Masonry indicates nay, positively proves, that it has been derived from and is closely connected with the art of building. The first Free-Masons were build- ers, they could have been nothing else. To seek for them in a mystical religious association of the ancient pagan mysteries, or in an institution of Chivalry as in the Knights of the Crusades would be a vain and unprofitable task. As well might we look for the birth-place of the eagle in the egg of the crow as to attempt to trace the origin of Free-Masonry to any- thing other than an association of builders.\" Now my dear Brothers, with all due respect to Brother A. G. Mackey, M.D., and his opinions in rela- tion to the Origin and Antiquity of Free-Masonry, I"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 35 shall simply say as the late General Albert Pike said, his premises are incorrect and consequently his con- clusions are wrong. For if what he said were true, neither Solomon, King of Israel, Hiram, King of Tyre or Hiram Abif could have been Three Grand Master Masons, and from his statements our Lodges could not have been dedicated to King Solomon and they ought not to have been dedicated to the two Saint John's, but rather to the \"COLLEGIUM FABRORUM\" or the Guilds and Builders of Rome. Besides, these claims of Brother A. G. Mackey, M. D., in his \"History of Free-Masonry,\" knocks our Rituals all to pieces, and we have nothing to depend upon in relation to the Origin and Antiquity of our beloved Fraternity other than his erroneous statements and assertions. I shall go into this subject fully and comprehen- sively later. But, before doing so, right here and now I want you my dear Brothers to distinctly understand my opinion in relation to Brother Mackey's state- ments and assertions and I will positively assert: As well might one look for the birth-place of a Lion among a litter of puppy dogs as to attempt to trace the Origin of Free-Masonry to the Guilds and Builders of Rome, or any other practical operative Masons in Brick or Stone. For Free-Masonry teaches the building of the Temple of Human Character through the development of the Faculties, Capacities and Powers latent within the Sanctuary of the Soul of every intelligent human entity. It also teaches Life, Death and the Immor- tality of the Soul, and I perfectly agree with Brother Mackey when he said \"The first Free-Masons were builders. They could have been nothing else (Bold"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 The Lion's Paw Series face mine) and I myself positively say and assert that they were Builders, but, my dear Brothers, they were BUILDERS OF MEN. When a candidate is initiated into our beloved Fraternity it symbolizes a birth into a New Life. He now finds himself surrounded by the Wisdom of the Ages, and yet he does not fully realize it. He first makes a Promise, afterwards a solemn declaration; he is then invested with an Obligation, the fulfilling of which and by keeping his Promise makes him in truth and deed a Mason. He is now presented with the Working Tools of an Entered Apprentice Mason. They are symbolical of the only tools that will enable him to build his Temple of Human Character in accord with the Constructive Principles of nature and teach him how to keep his First Promise and enable him to \"Live the Life\" in accord with what Masonry teaches, and what Christ, The Master preached and practised to the people and the Brotherhood of Judea. But as I have said above, I shall go into this sub- ject more fully and comprehensively under the sub- ject of the building of the Temple of Solomon, and the profound Symbolism of the Lambskin, or White Leather Apron. Also, upon the way it is worn, and why it should be worn in those particular ways and no other."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 37 CHAPTER IV Antiquity of Masonry 9 As we are endeavoring to prove the Origin and An- tiquity of Masonry, we do most positively assert and declare that the very name Free-Mason will most as- suredly prove not only its great antiquity, but the epoch and country from which it originated, and the why and wherefore of the name Free-Mason in the Golden Age of Egypt. I have lectured in the great majority of the states and the larger cities throughout the union in relation to the Origin and Antiquity, Allegories, Legends, Symbols, Ritualism and have specially spoken upon the words FREE-MASON and FREE-BORN. I have also written upon the various subjects not only in my \"Egypt, The Cradle of Ancient Masonry,\" but in all my other writing as well. Before going any farther let us come to a proper understanding of the word FREE-MASON. In order to do this I will quote you from my \"Egypt, The Cradle of Ancient Masonry,\" page 85 et seq. \"Now this brings us to a very important and interesting sub- ject and one that should interest every Masonic stu- dent and Free-Mason throughout the world universal, and that is the origin and meaning of the words FREE-MASON. A thorough understanding of these"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"38 The Lion's Paw Series two words will verify the statements that are made in our Rituals that \"Free-Masonry has been in existence from time immemorial, and that the best men of every epoch of the world's history have been members of our beloved Fraternity.\" It will also prove that our very name FREE-MASON originated in the \"Valley of the Nile thousands of years before Rhea Silvia fed the sacred fires upon the altars of Alba Longa, or the foundation of Rome was bathed in a brother's blood or the master Christ was born or dreamed of.\" I do most positively assert and claim that Masonry originated in Ancient India and it was cradled on the banks of the Nile. Therefore in order to prove this fact I will state that the \"name\" FREE-MASON \"Proves its antiquity as well as the country in which is was cradled,\" and this verifies my statement that it is a lineal descendent of The Ancient Egyptian Myste- ries. But, let it be thoroughly understood that those so-called Egyptian Mysteries did not originate in Egypt. But, that those ancient Mysteries with all its profound and exhaustless store of Wisdom and Scien- tific Philosophy was the offspring of a far more an- cient organization that was in the height of its glory long centuries before the Sphinx \"Looked to the East, or, the foundation of the Pyramids were laid in the plains of Gizeh, and that organization was and is \"The Venerable Association of Perfect Masters of Ancient India,\" known today as the Great School. The words Free-Mason did not originate in the Anglo-Saxon language, neither do they originate in the Latin or Greek, all of which they antidate by thou- sands of years, for they came down to us from the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 39 Egypto-Coptic, a language that was used by the an- cient Egyptians in the Golden Age of Egypt. The Copts are most certainly the lineal descend- ents of the people who migrated from India to the \"Valley of the Nile,\" and who adorned the banks of that river with stupendous specimens of cyclopean architecture. Their written language was expressed in three distinct forms. THE FIRST was the Hie- roglyphs. THE SECOND The Hieratic, and THE THIRD The Demotic. The Hieroglyphs were used by the Hierophants and Priests of Egypt to preserve all their sacred writings and thus veil from the profane all their secrets. The Heiratic was derived from the Hieroglyphs, both of which belongs to the Priesthood, while the Demotic was an offshoot of the other two. It was used principally by the people for commercial purposes. I do not desire to enter into a long description of the writings of the Ancient Egyptians, but will simply state that, in the Egypto Coptic language the word PHREE meant Light, Knowledge, Wisdom and MASSEN was the plural of Mes and signified Children or Son's, hence we were known and are known today as children or Son's of Light, Wisdom or Intelligence, because LIGHT signified knowledge to the candidate or Initiate. It is that which every Brother is in search of \"MORE LIGHT.\" Thoth signified the Intellect and mas a child or son, conse- quently Thoth-mas means child or son or Thoth or an Intellectual Man or Men of Intelligence."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"40 The Lion's Paw Series RA was the Sun-God and MES the child or son, therefore the Grand Ra-mes-as was considered to be a child or son of the sun. Now the origin and definition of the words FREE- MASON must most assuredly prove to the Masonic student and Master Mason and thinking brothers, the great antiquity of our beloved Fraternity. It will also prove that Masonry could never have originated from an Association of Guilds and Builders of Rome, or the practical operative masons of Europe who worked with brick or stone. They certainly builded magnifi- cent Abbeys, Castles etc., throughout the whole of Europe. But, they never gave birth to our glorious Fraternity with its exhaustless store of profound phil- osophy, and as I have so often said they were, and are, two separate and distinct bodies. For Masonry is a peculiar system of MORALITY veiled in ALLE- GORY and ILLUSTRATED by SYMBOLS, and its members are those who labor to build the Temples of Human Character in accord with the Constructive Principle of Nature in Individual Life. The Practical operative Masons of the Guilds of Europe were architects and builders in brick and stone. They worked to beautify and adorn the va- rious cities and towns throughout the whole of Eu- rope. There is no doubt but they traveled from town to city and from one country to another. But we must distinctly understand that neither the Science of Architecture or Masonry ever originated from the \"Collegium Fabrorum\" or the Guilds and Builders of Europe. There is no question but that there was an institution or organization in the early days of Roman"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 41 History which was known as Collegium Artificium or Collegium Fabrorum. We also believe that this Col- lege of Artificers were composed of prominent Archi- tects and Designers. And no doubt some of the better workmen who labored under their more intellectual instructors may have been members of our Fra- ternity. We do most assuredly admit that this Organization or Association of workmen to be the founder of the various Guilds of Operative Masons throughout the whole of Europe. We also admit that from these various Guilds of Operative Masons in brick or stone, sprang those men who claimed and as- sumed the title of \"Traveling Free-Masons.\" We do also believe and admit that the members of these various Guilds were bound together by certain Rules and Regulations for their government and preserva- tion. But we do most emphatically assert and declare that the Guilds of European Builders and our glorious Fraternity were two separate and distinct Bodies. Let me make this more plain to you by stating that All our Labor Unions of today are separate and distinct bodies from the Druids, Odd-Fellows, Knights of Pythias, Red Men, Forresters, etc. Yet we posi- tively know, that many of those who are members of a Labor Union, are also members of the different Orders mentioned above. In the same way there is no question, but, that the most prominent, and intellectual men who composed the various Guilds of Operative Builders, were also members of our Fraternity. They applied as all other who had gone before and were found to be Worthy and well qualified to enter our"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"42 The Lion's P^w Series portals, and receive \"The Light.\" After they had re- ceived \"Masonic Light,\" they then fully realized that the profound Wisdom and Scientific Philosophy that belonged to pre-historic civilizations, were embodied in the peculiar system of Morality, Allegories and Sym- bology of Masonry. We must distinctly understand that all those who belonged to the practical Operative Guilds, could not become members of our Royal Craft for this reason- outside of their own profession of skilled workmen, they were extremely ignorant. Their Moral and in- tellectual qualifications would preclude them. They were not nearly so well informed as the ordinary American mechanic or laborer of today. Consequently if they had not the necessary qualifications, it would be simply impossible for them to enter the portals of our most Illustrious Fraternity. Let me assure you, my brother, that the sublimely beautiful teachings embodied in the Ethics of Ma- sonry, has, and ever will be in existence. And it did not require the building of a Temple by Solomon, King of Israel, to demonstrate the depth of profound Morality or the sublime scientific philosophy that be- longs to our Fraternity. For I have shown, or shall show you that Masonry has had a continuous existence through every epoch of the world's history. Surely the very name PHREE MASSEN (Free- Mason) ought to convince the most skeptical Master Mason from whence it was derived and prove that it descended to us from Egypt in her Golden Age. This fact will demonstrate beyond the shadow of a doubt that Masonry is far older than The Golden Fleece or"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 43 Roman Eagle, or Rome herself. The Coptic lan- guage was in substance the same as the spoken lan- guage of Ancient Egyptian origin. It follows that it must have been connected with some Ancient Egyptian Brotherhood or School, or the Mysteries of that Ancient civilization. We positively know that the in- structions and Wisdom taught in the One was identical with the other up to a certain epoch in the Life of that Nation. The esoteric teachings of both Masonry, and that more ancient School have ever been a guide for the Neophyte, to a higher plane of Spiritual unfold- ment. In order to reach this higher plane our Solicitant must begin his Constructive Spiritual De- velopment by a careful study of Ethics or Morality and above all the practice of Moral Principles. In doing this our Brother will be enabled to fully develop all those Faculties, Capacities and Powers that lie dor- mant in the sanctuary of his Soul. He will them be en- abled through Personal Effort, Practice, Self-Control Keep his First Promise and \"Live The Life.\" If any earnest Masonic Student will devote a little of his time and study for himself the sacred writing of our own Scriptures, as well as those of other countries, and search for the Origin and Antiquity of Masonry, he will most assuredly find that it rests upon a founda- tion that can be traced back into the most remote civilizations of the dim and misty ages of the past. At which time all the profound truths that were then and are now embodied in the Science of Morality, Al- legories and Symbols which were orally transmitted from mouth to ear. And they will also find that it came down to us through long drifting ages from one gen-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"44 The Lion's Paw Series eration of people to another. One thing is certain they will find very little in common between the Guilds and Builders of Rome and our Fraternity. I have shown from the words Phree-Massen, and also proven that Masonry does not in any way re- fer to the Builders of Rome or any other country. But it does most assuredly refer to the Builders of Men and they were known through every age as Children of, or Sons of Light. And Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma refers to the members of our beloved Fra- ternity as the CHILDREN OF LIGHT. What I earnestly desire to impress upon your Mind and Soul is that our beloved Fraternity with all its profound philosophies, Ethics, Legends, Allegories and Smy- bolry never developed among the practical Operative Guilds of either Rome or Europe. But that it came down to us from the \"Land of the Vedas,\" the birth- place of Masonry and our great ancestors, The Aryans of India. I earnestly ask my readers to procure a copy of the \"Great Work by T. K.,\" published by the Indo-Amer- ican Book Co., 5705 West Lake Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. And I specially request you to read Chapter IV \"THE LINEAL KEY.\" And I do most assuredly believe that from a Masonic historical viewpoint you will find it to be one of the most wonderful, instructive, and entertaining essays or themes ever written on the Origin and Antiquity of Free-Masonry. Every in- telligent Masonic Student and Master Mason should obtain a copy, read it carefully and study it. Because, it will prove to him or them beyond all question that the Masonry of today is simply an offshoot of a far"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 45 more Ancient Association than the \"Collegium Fa- brorum of Rome. And I want to once more repeat that the foundation of Masonry was never stained with a brother's blood. But it was laid in Harmony, Peace, and Love, by that Ancient Brotherhood of Perfect Masters who had associated together for the express purpose of perpetuating that exhaustless store of Wis- dom to which they had attained in the hoary civiliza- tions of the past. It will also prove that Jesus of Nazareth was an initiate. That he studied in India where he became thoroughly acquainted with those profound Moral Principles which He afterwards gave so freely to the people of Judea. It also informs us that Buddha and The Christ were both Masters, and that they both worked with a unity of spirit and of purpose. And their differences are those of method only, and not of substance. Buddha and Christ were expounders of spiritual and psychic laws, under widely different conditions. They differed also as individuals. They differed in personal attainment, character and method. As a re- sult we have two philosophies colored by the indi- viduality of their teachers. Though both systems are based upon the same principles, they are very unlike in outer form and creed. Each of these teachers expressed his individual concepts of spiritual principles and of human resnonsi- bilities. Each employed the method which appeared as best adapted to the intellectual and moral develop- ment of his own time and Race. Buddha founded an order of ascetics vowed to poverty and beggary. He taught a literal renuncia-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"46 The Lion's Paw Series tion of material comfort and of natural human ties as the life of highest attainment. He saw in a life of seclusion and introspection what appeared to him a higher life than one which shared the common activi- ties and the common joys of human life. The funda- mental doctrine of Buddha was the sacredness of all life. The fundamental characteristics of the man was reverence for Law. Christ, on the contrary, conducted an active minis- try in fellowship with \"publicans and sinners.\" He did not found an order nor adopt a distinctive garb. While he did not exalt himself, neither did he abase himself, with shaven head and begging bowl. He preached temperance without imposing austerities. He neither condemned the natural activities of men nor disparaged natural human relations. The church he attempted to found was one not built by hands, nor was it symbolized by priestly garb nor priestly au- thority. The fundamental doctrine of the Nazarene was the universal brotherhood of man. The funda- mental characteristics of the man were Compassion, Pity and Love. The method adopted by Buddha would have found no response among the Jews and Gentiles of Judea. However, the truths taught by Buddha were the same as those laid down by the later teacher. Who that knows the spirit of the age will venture to say that the method of teaching employed by Christ would be ef- fective in this age of scientific skepticism.

This was the 'School of Black Magic' or of The Black Art' which in later form came to be known as the 'School of Egyptian Pagan- ism.' Among the most prominent and important move- ments that are lineally descended from and directly related in principle to the Great Parent School of India are: FREE-MASONRY, both ancient and modern. Buddhism, in its origin and primitive character. Primitive Christianity, as exemplified by the Mas- ter Jesus. Protestant Christianity, in so far as this stands for a protest against the Paganizing of Primitive Chris- tianity.

Mohammedism, both primitive and modern. The Greek Church, both primitive and modern. ROMAN CATHOLICISM in the present form. My dear Brother, before going farther into this subject let me give you some information in relation to the word MAGIC and its definition. Because I have"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 49 spoken of the \"Great Parent School of Egyptian Black Magic.\" The T. K. informs us, that: \"It is the individual exercise and use of the natural powers of the Body, Spirit and Soul in controlling and applying the forces, activities and processes of Nature. MAGIC Magia in its esoteric sense means: The Great Life or Divine Life in Spirit. The root of the word is Magh. In Sanskrit it is the same as Mahat. In the Zend it is Maz. In the Greek it is written Megas. And in the Latin Magnus. In all these languages its signification is Great. Esoteric science is, above all, the knowledge of our relations with and in divine Magic inseperableness, from our Divine Selves. The latter meaning some- thing else beside our own higher spirit. Nearly every intelligent Christian knows the name of Simon Magus. Because he is mentioned in the Acts. But who among them all can tell us of his Great Powers. He was a great Magician. So was his direct disciple Menander A Samaritan by birth. He was the successor of Simon and reached the very height of the Science of Magic. Both Simon and his pupil attained to wonderful powers in enchantments, which the Christians claimed to be the handiwork of the Devil. Yet the Divine Miracles of the Master Christ and the Apostles or of Moses and Aaron have never been explained any more than those so-called Sorcerers and Magicians of Ancient and Modern times. Every true Mason as well as we of the School do not believe in supernatural phenomena. And we laugh at the word \"Miracle.\" For a Miracle is something"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"50 The Lion's Paw Series we do not at first understand. But when we do it is no longer a Miracle. But simply an effect produced by certain causes set in motion by the intelligent Laws of God or Nature, by he who knows how to manipu- late those wonderous Laws, through and by his greater knowledge of the Constructive Principle in Nature. The source and basic principles of Magic lies in the Spirit and the Thought. All those who know and understand how to manipulate those Laws have learned by Personal Effort and profound meditation. For this is the KEY-NOTE to Esoteric Study. lambi- licus speaking of the Divine Science of Raja Yoga tells us that \"Magic is a lofty, sublime Science, and exalted above all others.\" It is the great remedy for all. It neither takes its source in, nor is it limited to the Body or its passions, to the human compound or its constitution. But all is derived by it from our Divine Ego which runs like a silver thread from the Spark in us up to the primal Divine Fire. It means to me that I have the power of doing Good or Evil. It also points out to me If I desire to subdue my pas- sions and improve myself in Masonry I must \"Live The Life\" and work out my own Salvation through think- ing and acting Right. We positively know that Roman Catholicism is the immediate offspring of the Great Parent School of Egyptian Black Magic.

And so it also now can be understood why Prot- estant Christianity is held by the Church of Rome in the attitude of an hereditary enemy. This is because the Protestant movement represents in large measure a direct protest against Egyptian and Roman Pagan- ism. In just so far as this is true, it stands for primi- tive Christianity, which is a direct lineal descendant of the Parent School of India."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 53 CHAPTER V. Prerequisites for a Mason Before any person can be initiated into a Masonic Blue Lodge the applicant must be a Man. Perfect in all his parts. FREE-BORN, of lawful Age.

Should these conditions be truthfully proven he will have no difficulty of going the way all Brothers and Fellows have gone before. He will be enabled to pass be- tween the columns and receive that which every brother is in search of, \"LIGHT.\" Before proceeding with a treatment of the subjects embodied in this Chapter I wish to say: Every Man and Brother who desires to thoroughly comprehend Masonry must be endowed with intellectual qualifica- tions, in order to be enabled to understand and appre- ciate the granduer and Sublimity of its teachings. Therefore, if he is not intellectually inclined he will never rise above the foundation of the Symbolic De- grees, and consequently he will become a mere drone in the busy Hive of Masonry instead of an Active Worker. He will most certainly go through the various ceremonies of Initiation, Passing and Raising. He will most assuredly receive the Degree of a Master Mason. But he will never understand the true mean- ing of that Sublime Degree. Neither will he become"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"54 The Lion's Paw Series a Master himself until he has solved the problems of the preceding Degrees and their profound philos- ophical meaning, and thoroughly understands the sub- lime teachings that permeates those ancient ceremo- nies. Then and then only will he realize the true mean- ing of Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. If he be true to his Vow and to his O. B. he will be true to himself and his fellowman, and he will labor inces- santly for the benefit of others. He will also, to the best of his ability, endeavor to point out to them the Path That Leads to Light and Truth. Thus he will help them on to a knowledge of the Laws of Love and Righteousness, and himself on to higher planes of Spiritual unfoldment. THE FIRST of the pre-requisites for admission into a Masonic Lodge is that the applicant be; a \"MAN/' SECOND he must be \"FREE-BORN.\" Now, my dear Brothers, if we carefully analyze the true mean- ing of these two words we shall find that they do not refer in any way to physical slavery. But rather to Spiritual or Mental Bondage. In the first case phys- ical Slavery is capable of being thrown off in many ways by the one enslaved. But Mental Bondages is most difficult to escape. The bondage of the Soul is unspeakably more harmful to the individual so bound, than he who is held in physical bondage as a simple slave. One is compelled to believe, according to what others tell him. The other being held in simple phys- ical bondage is permitted to believe in accord with the dictates of his own conscience and work out his own Salvation."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 55 We find many men who were born Slaves that proved themselves to be most eloquent Teachers of Morality and Moral principles. Take for instance Epictetus, who was born as history informs us, some- where about the middle of the first century of the Christian Era. The exact date of his birth is not known. This man was born in Physical bondage, yet he was Mentally-Free. His writings prove him to be one of the greatest philosophers of the Stoic School. It is positively certain that he was not only a slave, but a cripple. It is related that he was injured by the cruelty of his master who subjected him to severe torture. While he was suffering Epictetus said to him : \"If you continue you will break my leg.\" He had hardly spoken when the limb broke and the philoso- pher added quite calmly: \"Did I not tell you what would happen.\" He believed and wrote that the true aim of Man was to live in conformity with the Constructive Prin- ciple in Nature. To obey the internal voice of the Soul. To obey the Law. To Live The Life. He also taught that every man should submit without com- plaining to that which was not in their power to pre- vent. And it is positively certain that he practiced what he preached and taught. It would be of little use for me to go into detail, in relation to the Doctrine of Epictetus. I might quote you from selections of his discourses and show you that he deals with nothing but the ethical teachings of Stoicism, and with these only in their simpliest forms and he states them so clearly and directly, that no one can miss their meaning. It is enough to say"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"56 The Lion's Paw Series that the One thought that underlies all the discourses is that of FREEDOM freedom from Servitude to the varying accidents of human life from Servitude to Pleasure as well as to pain, to hope as well as to fear, to one's passions, as well as to the domination of others. He was resolved, with a power that has never been surpassed, that none of these things should have con- trol over him, that Spiritually he would be a FREE- MAN. And he felt in the Stoic Morals he had found, the means of his infranchisements. This Stoic plan of Salvation, which he announced to his disciples, with all the energy of his nature, can be stated in a word. FREEDOM from all that binds and enslaves the indi- vidual Will can be secured simply by recognizing that the Will is within its own sphere, potentially supreme, and that the only thing in the world that has any real value for a reasonable mind is the character which the Will in its Freedom works out. Within this sphere of individual FREEDOM lie man's only good and evil, as well as his personal worth and dignity for there he is Master of his fate. There he may have Good if he Wills it or Evil if he selects. Beyond this sphere on the other hand where Freedom ceases there ceases also choice, responsibility and character. And whatever happiness there is whether Good or Evil, but abso- lutely indifferent to the intelligent Will and to Rational desire. With regard to the whole course of Life, ac- cordingly, there is but one possible rule of conduct, namely, to make the best use of whatever is in one's power and take the rest as it happens, as it pleases God. He who follows this rule will most assuredly"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 57 attain his desire, FREEDOM will in fact, be as God, not merely Knowing, but also controlling Good and Evil. Does the Tyrant, says Epictetus, want my head? Let him take it. Has my Friend died. I will bear the inevitable without complaint. Does Starvation threaten me and my children? Let it come if it must, for it can bring me nothing worse than death, which is nothing. But, in whatever, relates to my charac- ter, my dignity, my serenity, I am Master. And no power in heaven or on Earth shall move me from my course one hair's breath, or balk my desires. My dear readers and friends, in this account of Epictetus, I have shown you that although he was held in physical bondage he was most assuredly Mentally Free. He could believe according to the dic- tates of his own Conscience. There was no power on earth, or in the heavens above that could destroy his attitude of Mind or Soul. His Master could destroy the physical body, but he could not destroy his Mental Freedom. Therefore, I intend showing you from a Masonic viewpoint, what kind of Man our beloved Fra- ternity considers the words Free-Born to mean. But, before going farther in this subject I would like to quote you from our DECLARATION OF INDE- PENDENCE. This sublimely beautiful sentiment is one of the grandest that ever emanated from a human brain. It will stand forever as a monument to the Spirit of Masonry and the Brother who wrote it: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\" That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness;"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"58 The Lion's Paw Series that to secure these Rights Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the con- sent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it and to in- stitute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. It was the same Spirit and a Kindred intelligence that formulated these profoundly significant words constituting the preamble of our National Constitu- tion. We, the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the Common De- fense, promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. At every point in the onward and upward progress of our National evolution, it has been the same broad, gracious but uncompromising spirit of individual Liberty, together with an unfaltering love of human Freedom and its unquenchable thirst for knowledge and education that has thus far defeated the subtle and persistent efforts of opposing forces to subvert and subordinate the power, the dignity and the vitality of the State to ecclesiastical authority and control."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 59 CHAPTER VI. Roman Catholicism From a Masonic standpoint children who are born of bigoted Roman Catholic parents are never Free- Born, neither can they be considered to be Free. You may ask, Why? I answer: Because they are born in Mental Bondage. In the pre-natal existence of the child the Mother weaves into every fibre of its being, her own attitude and belief in Holy Mother Church. The child is in- structed, from the time it can understand what is said. Then it is firmly impressed upon the Mind and Soul of that child that Obedience to the commands of the church is the only essential Obligation resting upon it. Every child thus born is compelled to believe that the greatest of all sins is disobedience to the Holy Mother Church and its absolute authority over them. They are also taught to believe from their infancy that the Church or its representatives, the Priests, posses the divine power of forgiving the sins of its children. That there is no sin so black or degrading that the Church will refuse forgiveness to any member who is able and willing to pay the price \"in good and lawful money,\" which the Church or its duly accredited representa- tives and financial agents The Priests demands. In that particular Church the honest Student of Psychology is constantly shocked and amazed to find"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"60 The Lion's Paw Series that all things Spiritual and Psychical as well as celes- tial, terrestial and in heaven as well as on earth have been reduced to a purely commercial basis. And in this country are valued only in dollars and cents. It would be very difficult to find a priest or even a mem- ber of that Church in good and regular standing who would publicly admit its truth. But this does not alter the fact, in the least, nor in any way or manner modify their meaning nor mitigate their effects. The Pope and his College^of Cardinals are the only people in this Church who are independent. In them only is all the power. The balance are superstitious and bound by Fear, to absolute Obedience. The few wield absolute Power. They Command Obedience. The many Obey. Can you not see from the above, my dear Brother and readers that a child born from bigoted Roman Catholic parents is at birth dedicated to Superstition, Obedience and Fear. Do you not realize that there is no Freedom of Thought or Conscience, or in fact, Free- dom of any kind to any one who is bound by Supersti- tion, Dread and Fear? I tell you my dear Brothers; no man who calls himself a Roman Catholic should ever be permitted to enter the portals of our beloved Fraternity. The Master of a Lodge who knowingly, allows, such an one to be admitted into that Lodge should be compelled to surrender his Charter. No born Roman Cotholic who has not given unmistakable evidence that he has repudiated and forever thrown off the fetteis that bound him to the Romish Church should be admitted to membership in our Royal Craft upon any consideration whatever."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 61 Before proceeding farther, let me point out to you, that there are two great Spiritual Schools, one of which has developed, and the other has endeavored to dominate human Intelligence and Conscience throughout the Ages. Those two Great Silent, power- ful and vitally antagonistic currents which at their in- tersection have given to the world an Exodus, a Cruci- fixion, an Inquisition, a Protestation and a Reforma- tion."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 63 CHAPTER VII. Scottish Rite Philosophy I am exceedingly desirious of showing you that it is the duty of every Brother Master Mason to labor earnestly and incessently to guard the portals of our Fraternity against all those who are not worthy or well qualified to enter. It is also the bounden Duty of every member of the so-called York Rite of Masonry to labor for the advancement of his Brother, both Mentally and Morally, as we of the Scottish obedience. They should also teach him, that it is by the development of the in- tellectual qualifications that Man begins to learn some- thing about himself and the potential forces that are latent within him. As we do in the School of Natural Science and the philosophical Degree of the Scottish Rite of Masonry of the Southern Jurisdiction. The acquisition of knowledge is a gift, as it were, to some. But, every living, thinking, intelligent, hu- man being, with a well balanced brain has the poten- tiality of acquiring knowledge and becoming wise by deep thought and earnest study. He must first learn to Think and Reason for himself. For as a man Thinks in the depth of his heart so he becomes. If he follows this line of study, it will not be long be- fore he will begin to realize that the Key Note to WISDOM is MEDITATION. Then will he be enabled to trample beneath his feet the snarling serpents of"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"64 The Lion's Paw Series Bigotry, Ignorance, Intolerance, Fanaticism and False- hood. In doing this he will not only help Masonry in particular, but humanity in general, by showing the Light of Truth in Free-Thought and Free-Speech. Free Masonry tolerates all Religions and does most emphatically claim and assert that no Man, or body of Men, living or dead, has the right to dictate to another what he shall or shall not believe. Masonry also claims, and positively asserts, that every Man has a perfect right to believe according to the dictates of his own conscience. Unless a Man is allowed Free- dom of Thought he is not a Free-Man at all. If Man is possessed of Free-Will and is not permitted to ex- ercise it, by following his own Reasoning Faculties and Powers WHERE IS HIS FREEDOM? Every Religion and the so-called Truths of In- spired writings, depend entirely upon the testimony of Man himself. The evidences brought forward by him are produced as proofs of the Truth of his assertions. Masonry claims and positively asserts that all men have the Right to judge of the Truth of the claims put forward, and to examine the proofs of the various so-called \"inspired\" writings and then to judge them from a commonsense standpoint. Then if they stand the test of their searching investigations it is Truth for them. Man becomes what he WILLS himself to be. He can never get outside the world he makes for him- self. Death cannot destroy the seeds that he hath sown, for in good time they all will ripen and he will reap the fruition thereof. No confession, no repent- ance, no sacrifice or imploring of God, Pope, Priest"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 65 or the Devil can ever change the Mighty Law of Per- sonal Responsibility. Whatsoever a Man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. The hand that smites him is his own. That which we are doing to- day and shall do tomorrow are contributing to form the true character, according to which we are to be judged. A man's faith belongs to himself alone and he is Personally Responsible and Morally Account- able for his Thoughts and Acts. His Freedom con- sists, in being enabled to Think and Reason for him- self, without let or hindrance, from any source at all whatever. He should strive incessantly to sub- jugate the animal within the sanctuary of his own heart. He should strive earnestly and incessantly to keep his first Promise. When he has conquered Self, he is worthy of more honor, than he who hath con- quered a thousand cities, because he has conquered the Kingdom of his own Soul. In doing this he will have kept his FIRST PROMISE. For he will have learned how to subdue his passions, and in doing this, he will have improved himself in Masonry. Every Scottish Rite Mason, who is true to his vows, has ever labored to give humanity Freedom of Thought, Freedom of Speech and a Free Government, for the People and by the People. And every Brother Master Mason who has the good of the Fraternity at heart, is a Priest of Truth, of Toleration, of Philosophy and of Rational Liberty. And it is his bounden Duty. FIRST: To take Tyranny, Injustice and Unsurpa- tion, by the throat and strangle them. And by the as- sistance of his Brothers endeavor to Free the Human Race irrespective of Creed, Caste or Color, from all"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"66 The Lion's Paw Series who would enslave it. SECOND, to Free his own country from Despots and Despotism. In doing this Masonry will give to the People, both Temporal and Spiritual Freedom, which includes all the inalienable RIGHTS OF MAN. To ever labor for the upbuilding of the human Race is the bounden Duty of every Scottish Rite Ma- son. For from what they have learned in our Ineffable and Philosophical Degree, they will positively know, that the greatest of all gifts to MAN is MANHOOD. They will also know that, True Manhood can never be found in the mumbling chants and invocations of Romish Priests, Secterianism or Religious Dogmas and Creeds. Our beloved Fraternity teaches us that our main Object and Duty in life is, to do our Duty to all men, even to the neglect, of our own personal comfort. It also teaches us, to strive to make others happy, because it is our duty to do so, without hope of fee or reward. Happiness, will surely follow the Man, or Mason, who Cheerfully performs his Duty. At the same time self-gratification should never be the incen- tive, to do good, but lo do it, because, it is Right for us to do so Let us ever remember, that in plucking the weeds, from our neighbor's garden, we plant roses in our own. But, we must not do it for the sake of the roses, do it, because it is our own Duty to do so. God commands us to do good, so the volume of the Sacred Law informs us. And Altruism, has ever been taught, by all the great Reformers, long centuries before our present Christian era. It is still taught and preached, but is seldom or never practiced. If man would only practice what the School of Natural"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 67 Science and the Scottish Rite of Masonry, of the Southern Jurisdiction teaches, Mankind would be far happier and this world would be a veritable paradise. Masonry teaches all, its members, to recognize in the whole Human Race, one great family, of which you and I, my dear Brother, are a part. Every true Master Mason, and Knight Kadosh, will ever labor, for the uplift of his fellow man and Brother, in order to improve their condition, both Mentally and Morally. It is their Duty, to teach them, never to submit to Oppression, Injustice and Usurpation. And whose Watchwords are Humility, Patience and Self-Denial. They are always ready and willing to hazard their lives, for the welfare of their country and the interest of humanity, and to sacrifice their lives for their fel- low man, if humanity, may be benefited thereby. We should also remember, that we should sacrifice our per- sonal comfort and desires, to help a needy Brother, we should give to him from our own earnings, help him physically and mentally. Point out the way and path to every man and Brother that leads to higher planes of Spiritual unfoldment, so that they might be enabled to come to a proper understanding of their own Faculties, Capacities and Powers. We must never forget, that these things are a Duty, that we owe to every man and Brother Mason. We should also ever re- member, and never forget, that wise Aphorism of EPICTETUS, THE ROMAN SLAVE: Be not di- verted from your Duty, by any idle reflections, the silly world may make upon you, for their concerns are not in your power, and consequently, should not be any part of your concern."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"68 The Lion's Paw Series Do good to all men, irrespective of Creed, Caste or Color, is the Duty of every Brother Master Mason. And as Brother Rebold says, in his History of Ma- sonry: The real object of Free-Masonry, may be sum- med up in these words To efface from among men, the prejudices of caste, the conventional distinctions of color, origin, opinion, nationality; to annihilate fanaticism and superstition ; to extirpate national dis- cord. And with it extinguish the firebrand of War. In a word, to arrive by free and pacific progress, at one formual, or model, of Eternal and Universal Right. According to which individual human beings shall be free, to develop every Faculty, with which he may be endowed. And so concur heartily and in the fulness of his strength, in the bestowment of happiness, upon all. And thus to make of the whole human race, one family of Brothers, united by affection, Wisdom and Labor. Let me assure you my dear readers and friends, Free-Masonry antagonizes no creed, but tolerates all. And professes the teachings of the Ancient Wisdom that have descended to us from that venerable Brotherhood of India, to which I have so often re- ferred, in this work. Free-Masonry, seeks Truth alone, and it strives to lead by Degrees, all intellects, to Rea- son. It allows every Brother, to profess and practice, any Religion, or Philosophy, that his conscience may dictate (providing that Religion does not interfere with the inalienable Rights of Man), or none, if it be preferable to him.

It also asserts most emphatically, that, not only every Brother Ma- son, but every Man should have the Right of Freedom of Thought, Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Conscience. The dogma of Masonry, is that of Zarathustra and Hermas. Its Law is progressive initiation. Its princi- ples regulated Hierarchy and Universal Fraternity. It is the Heir of all the Ancient Initiations. It is the de- pository of the secrets of the Apocalypse and the Sohar. It is the preserver and conserver of the An- cient Wisdom, of that Venerable Brotherhood of India, whose unbroken records, go back ten thousand years, before Christ the Master preached the Beatitudes, throughout Jerusalem or the Jews were a Tribe, or a People. The object of its worship is MORALITY and TRUTH, which is represented in our Lodge, Chapters, Councils and Consistories by the Light that it dis- penses. Through every age of the world's history, Masonry has ever been the Champion of the Rights of all Men. It endeavors to Teach, and requires the brethren to practice and disseminate a Knowledge of Truth and Morality among all men throughout the world Uni- versal. It is ever striving to free them from their animal passional nature. It also works incessantly to free all men from Ignorance, Bigotry, Intolerance, and Mental, and Spiritual Slavery.

Roman Catholicism Now, my dear Brothers and Readers, I ask you: What right has any man or body of men, to persecute, and condemn another, because, he cannot, or does not, believe as they command him to? I do most assuredly claim that no man should be censured, or praised, be- cause he believes that Christ has come. Neither should we blame or condemn, or find fault, with an- other, if he believes, that He is yet to come Neither should we blame, or find fault with another, if he be- lieves that He never will come, because he believes that Christ, or the Christ principle, dwells in the heart of every man. And that every individual must work out his own Redemption, and be his own saviour, by \"LIVING THE LIFE.\" My dear Brothers, if you do not put your Faith in the Dogma, and Creed, of the Roman Catholic Church, you should not be persecuted, or censured. If the so- called \"Light of the New Dispensation is not visible to you, it is not your fault nor their misfortune. TRUTH to one may not be TRUTH to another, and what may appear perfectly consistent to me, may seem to be the height of absurdity to you, and others. But my dear Brother, realize the fact, your thinking so does not make it so. Consequently you must certainly realize at some time, that it is one of the greatest of crimes,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"72 The Lion's Paw Series for any Man, or body of Men, to condemn, and punish others, because they do not, nor cannot, believe as they do. The Hindu, Brahmin, Jew or Moslem, has just as much right, to condemn, persecute, and punish both Roman Catholic, and Protestant, as we have to revile, and persecute them. There is no particular merit, in a man being either Gentile, Jew, Mohammedan, or Parcee. No matter what a man's faith may be, it is most as- suredly dependent in a great measure, upon his birth- place, and to the Mother, who bore him. He as a child drinks in with his Mother's milk, the faith, and belief which belongs to her. We shall find that the teachings he learned at his Mother's knee, are in many instances, the most lasting, because, he is so consti- tuted, as to need some system of worship, concrete, and tangible, upon which to focus his hopes and as- pirations. Consequently he follows the form of wor- ship, whose basic principles, and rules, he learned at his mother's knee. From the above, you my dear reader, must cer- tainly realize that it is self-evident, the country where- in we are born, and the religious beliefs of the Mother, are, evidently, mighty factors in the production of a belief in one thing, and disbelief, in another. All that Masonry demands of her applicants, are that They have attained to a lawful age, that they are Free-Born, and that they have been heard of under the tongue of Good Reports. But, above and beyond all else, Ma- sonry demands a belief in the One Great God THE SUPREME ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 73 We have a bitter, vindictive and relentless foe in Jesuitry, whose motto is THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS. You, my dear Brother, might ask Who, and what are the Jesuits? I answer you They are the bitter, and unrelenting enemies, of all men who are not Ro- man Catholics, they are especially antagonistic to all Free-Masons. They are really, and truly, the militant wing of the Romish Church, and they are continually, and persistently, working to restore the Pope, to temporal power. The head of the Roman Catholic Church is called the White Pope, whose home is in Rome at the Vatican. The head or General of the Jesuits, is called the Black Pope. He is supposed to live in Rome, where he makes his headquarters. He, is appointed for Life, and he has unlimited powers placed in his hands. He maintains and appoints, all officers under him.

Luckily our people are awakening to the danger. The foreigner by sentiment, if not always by birth, is wresting the sceptre from our grasp, and we are in imminent danger of losing our birthright. England, like ourselves, by reason of her views, has not a friend in the world and undoubtedly her de- sire at the present time is to win our Love and Alli- ance, and to affect this she is willing to sacrifice any- thing but honor and self-respect. There is room for both in the world. What she cannot control herself she would only be too glad to see controlled by a friendly Protestant, English-speaking people like our- selves, and especially to save it from the clutches of her hereditary foes The Church of Rome and her Sacred Militia the Jesuits. Let me quote you my dear Brothers and readers, parts of two speeches that were made by two Metho- dist ministers at the Methodist Convention, held in St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal church in New York City, on November 19, 1900. Bishop Goodsell of Ten- nessee, while speaking of the work that was being done by their missionaries in Southern Europe, said: \"There are many who doubt whether we have done any work in Italy, the land of superstition and priest- craft; whether we can ever hope to accomplish any- thing there, in the face of the tremendous press of adverse thought, with which we are confronted. The"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 81 fact is, we sent one of our workers into Italy. He soon made up his mind that in Rome we had to do as the Romans do. He began by training the young, by taking them into our schools and seminaries. The work is slow, but its value has been recently testified to by the Pontiff himself, who has honored us by ex- communicating everyone, teachers and pupils alike, connected with our institutions of learning. In his effort to preserve for himself the triple crown of pa- pacy, he has issued a sweeping interdiction against the schools and every one passing through their gates. This, however, has only made us more determined to wipe out a system which has created out of a former man of Empire, a cringing beggar with a monkey and a grind organ.\" At the same place and during the same Conven- tion, The Rev. Dr. C. W. Drees, said: \"Christendom is divided into two camps, with Protestantism on one hand and Greek and Roman Catholicism on the other. The time is upon us, when, anew, the question which appeared in the Protestant reformation will begin to agitate the world and demand to be pushed to their final issue. After slumbering through four centuries the self-same questions were awakened by the last act of infamy of the pontiff in declaring himself Infallible. Within twenty-four hours after that blasphemous declaration had been written on the triple crown of Rome, the Prussian armies, invaded Catholic France. Forty-five days later the battle of Sedan was fought, with Protestant Prussia the victor, and twenty days only had elapsed, when the united armies entered the \"holy city\" where the people held sway, bringing with"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 The Lion's Paw Series them car-loads of Bibles. The Pope lost his temporal power, and since that day, the creed has been weaken- ing. The Roman Church at one time held sway every- where, but, now that church, and Spanish domination, have fallen off their high pedestals. When Spain is arraigned the Catholic Church should be arraigned, with that power as co-respondent. Ever since Issa- bella signed away the Liberty of Spain to the Pope, there has been an illegitimate alliance between State- craft and Priestcraft, against human Liberty and hu- man progress. In our late revered, Brother General Albert Pike's answer, to the letter of Pope Leo XIII, known as the letter \"Humanum Genus.\" He says: \"Thanks unto the God of Hosts, from whom all glories are! Free- Masonry is mightier than the Church of Rome; for it possesses the invincible might of the Spirit of the Age, and of the convictions, of Humanity. And it will continue to grow in strength, and greatness, while that church, in love with, and doting upon its old traditions, and incapable of learning anything, will continue to decay. The palsied hand of the Papacy, is too feeble, to arrest the march of human progress. It cannot bring back the obsolete doctrine, that Kings reign by divine right. In vain it will preach new crusades against Free-Masonry, or Heresy, or Re- publicanism. It will continue to sigh in vain, for the return of the days of Phillip II, and Mary of England, of Loyola, and Alva, and Torqumada. If it succeeds in instigating the Kings of Spain, and Portugal, to engage in the work of extirpating Free-Masonry,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 83 these will owe to it the speedy loss of their crowns. This world is no longer in a humor, to be saddled, and bitted, like an ass, and ridden by Capuchins, and Franciscans.

The world has not forgotten, that when Charles IX of France, and the Due de Guise, at first disowned responsibility for the massacre of twenty thousand Protestants, and others on the eve, and after the Eve of Saint Bartholemew, the Catholic clergy assumed it. Heaven adopted it, they said! It was not the massacre of the Kings and the Due. IT WAS THE JUSTICE OF GOD. Then the slaughter re- commenced, of neighbor by neighbor, of women, of children, and of children unborn, in order to extin- guish families the wombs of the mothers were cut open, and the children torn out of them, for fear they might survive. Men remembered that at Saint Michael, the Jesuit Auger, sent thither from the College of Paris, an- nounced to Bordeaux, that the Archangle Michael had made the great massacre, and deplored the slug- gishness of the Governor and Magistrates of Bor- deaux. After the 24th of August there were feasts. The Catholic clergy had theirs at Paris, on the 28th, and ordered a Jubilee, to which the King and Court went, and returned thanks to God. And the King who proclaimed that He had caused Coligni to be Killed, and said that he would have poinarded him with his own hand, was flattered to intoxication, by the praises and congratulations of Rome.

Free-Masonry is strong enough every where now, to defend itself, and does not dread even the Hierarchy of the Roman Church, with its great rev- enues, and its Cardinal Princes, claiming to issue the deciees and Bulletins of God, and to hold the Keys with which it locks and unlocks, at pleasure, the Gates of Paradise.

Colonized by Englishmen, who speak but with only the authority of Reason URBI ET ORBI to men of free souls, and high courage, and quick in- telligence. It does not need that Free-Masonry should take up arms of any sort, against the Church of Rome. Science, the wider knowledge of what God is, learned from his works; the irresistible progress of civilization, the Spirit of the twentieth century. These are the sufficient avengers of the mutations, and murders of the long ages of a horrid past. These have already avenged Humanity and Free-Masonry, need not add another word, except these, that there are two questions to be asked, and answered, there- unto demanded of all Roman Catholics, in the United States, who are loyal to the Constitution of Government, under which they live, Patriotic Citi- zens of the United States : Does not your conscience tell you, that what is now demanded of you by Pope"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"86 The Lion's Paw Series Leo XIII, by the General of the Jesuits and the Chief Inquisitor is TO ENGAGE ACTIVELY IN A CON- SPIRICY AGAINST THAT CONSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT, AND THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH IT IS FOUNDED.

But I have also quoted from other sources"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 87 in order to bear out my own assertions in relation to the subject of FREE-BORN, and the Roman Cath- olic \"Church.\" I will finish with one more quotation, from \"A Lexicon of Free-Masonry\" by A. G. Mac- key, M. D., which is as follows: The constitutions of our Order requires that every candidate shall be Free-Born, And this is necessary, for, admission into the fraternity involves a solemn contract, no one can bind himself to its performance who is not the Master of his own actions. Nor can the man of servile condition, or slavish mind, be ex- pected to perform his Masonic duties, with that free- dom, fervency and zeal which the laws of our insti- tution require. After reading the above and what I have said, you should thoroughly understand, why a child, born of bigoted Roman Catholic parents, could never become, a good, and true member of our Fra- ternity, especially if he has been trained in one of their parochial schools. The Roman Catholic Church is held together by principles and purposes, the exact reverse of what our Constitution and Declaration of Independence stands for. All the tremendous powers of this great organi- zation is given into the hands of the Pope and his college of Cardinals. They wield absolute power. They command absolute obedience. They claim that the greatest sin that can be committed, is Disobedi- ence, because Disobedience creates disorder and en- genders schism. The masses obey and their obedi- ence is compelled by superstition, ignorance and fear."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"88 The Lion's Paw Series They have arrayed against us, what every Free- Born American citizen would die for, and that is the Love of Liberty and the cause of Truth. America glories in her Liberty. She has demon- strated and emphasized that fact, by placing con- spicuous in New York harbor, a stupendous statue of the Goddess of Liberty enlightening the world. This statue stands there, to represent Freedom of Thought, Freedom of Speech, A Free Press and a Free Gov- ernment for the People and by the People. The time has passed when Pope could humble Kings and compel obedience to his mandates. Free- Masonry and Education have taken Ignorance by the throat and is now shaking the Life out of it. Peo- ple are now begining to Think for themselves. And when they do come to a knowledge of the fact that they must work out their own redemption, All man- kind will be Free-Born. Today the Vatican is terribly afraid of a new move- ment within the body of the Romish Church by Modernists or Neo Catholics. They are working earnestly and intelligently to rejuvinate the Cath- olic Church and do away with the absolute power of the Pope. These Modernist claim that this One Man power is unscriptural, unhistorical, un-Catholic and entirely wrong. Their most earnest desire, is to re- juvenate Catholicism and reform the Church.

Prerequisites of Candidates THIRD The candidate must be of Lawful Age. By the American Constitution. The candidate for Initiation and membership into a regular constituted Lodge of Master Masons, must have attained the law- ful age of twenty-one years. But in other countries the son of a Mason is allowed to make application for membership at the age of eighteen years. No doubt you all know, that Operative Mason's tools, are used by Free-Masons, to symbolize some- thing other than what they are used for. And I de- sire to call your attention to the fact, that There is one tool and a very important one which is used by the Operative Mason that is not found upon the trestle board of the American Ritual and that is a Lewis. It is a very peculiar kind of instrument made of iron, it is used for the purpose of lifting heavy blocks of stone. The stone mason cuts a slanting cavity in the top of the stone, he then drops in the jaws of the Lewis, attaches the tackle to it, the stone is then hoisted to its intended place and put in posi- tion. In the English Ritual it finds a conspicuous place upon the tracing board of the entered apprentice. Under the English jurisdiction the Lewis, symbolizes Strength, because it is used for the purpose of lift-"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"92 The Lion's Paw Series ing the heaviest of stones. It also symbolizes the Son of a Master Mason. Because the Son is strongest at that age. And it is the duty of the Son to help and support the failing strength of his father, when old age approaches. The English Constitution permits a Lewis or Son of a Master Mason to be Initiated at the age of eigh- teen years. But it distinctly specifies that all other candidates must have reached the age of twenty-one before they can present their petition or application for Initiation. In France the Son of a Master Mason is called a Louveteau (young wolf), and he like the Lewis in England is also permitted to present his application for Initiation and membership into the Fraternity at eighteen years of age. FOURTH The applicant must come of his own FREE WILL AND ACCORD. The scriptures say: \"Ask and ye shall receive. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you.\" Masonically speaking, to what does these questions allude? I simply leave them to be answered by your own indi- vidual intelligence. I will say, however, that no man was ever asked to become a member of our beloved Fraternity, he must ask for admission of his own Free Will and Accord. No man is ever solicited to enter into a Masonic Lodge for membership therein. Should any person express a desire to become a Free- Mason to a member of any Masonic Lodge, with whom he is acquainted, it is the duty of that Brother to tell him how to proceed. Upon no consideration will a member of a Masonic Lodge solicit any one to"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 93 enter the sacred portals of Free-Masonry. If a man was known to have been solicited, that man would not be allowed to proceed, he never could pass between the columns that Establish in Strength the Harmony and Unity of Free-Masonry. Every Man must come of his own Free Will and Accord, otherwise he could not be received. For out of his own mouth he would condemn himself, and he would be rejected. To him who comes in this way and gives The Right Knock, he will be permitted to enter and be received as all others who have gone before. We know then that his Faith is well founded, consequently he is allowed to enter and search for himself. In searching among the sublimely beautiful Al- legories and Symbols of Masonry, our candidate or Masonic Student, will find a most profound depth of Moral philosophy, embodied in each and every De- gree. He will begin to realize that Ritualism is not Masonry. He will begin to realize that there is some- thing more, in the philosophy of Masonry than Grips, Words and Tokens. He will if he has been Duly and Truly prepared, positively knows, that the ritual- istic ceremonies of Initiation, covers up and hides a most profound and beautiful progressive Scientific Philosophy. And he will positively know that it did not require the building of a Temple by Solomon, King of Israel, to demonstrate the profound system of Morality that belongs to our beloved and glorious Fraternity. He will begin to realize that the won- drous Knowledge and Wisdom contained in the veiled symbols of Masonry are not only of the most profound interest, but, sublimely grand and beautiful."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 The Lion's Paw Series Our Neophyte will no doubt have some difficulty endeavoring to find the true meaning of many of our Masonic Symbols.

It requires something other than mere recommendation from some Brothers who may possibly have never seen the Applicant for the Degree and that some thing is: SIXTH That he shall have been heard of under the Tongue of Good Report. It is right here, my dear Brothers, that every Masonic Lodge should safe- guard its portals most carefully. It is far better to be safe than sorry. Ever remembering that It is qual- ity, not quantity, that should be admitted into our Masonic Fraternity. None but those who are in- tellectualy qualified should be permitted to enter our portals. None should be admitted or introduced into pur Fraternity whom we could not introduce into the bosom of our family. In fact, no rough stone, that cannot be formed into a Perfect Ashlar, should be used in the foundation of Craft Masonry. And it should be the Duty of every Brother to be vigilant"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"96 The Lion's Paw Series and watchful and see to it that none, but good men and true, are permitted to pass between the Columns. When a man sends in his petition for member- ship, in a Masonic Lodge, that petition must be signed by the Master Masons of that Lodge. Thus he comes, well recommended. But, this recommend, will not ad- mit him to membeiship in a Masonic Lodge. It will only recommend him as one whom the signers con- sider to be \"Worthy and Well Qualified.\" But it is very often the case, that all those who signed the ap- plicant's petition, never saw the man, whose petition they signed and who they are recommending. Let me explain more fully. A Brother Master Mason having found a friend or acquaintance, who is exceedingly anxious to become a Mason. He furnished him with a petition and fills it out for him, possibly signs it him- self and tells his friend, I will attend to it and let you know all about it when the time comes. The first meeting night of his Lodge he goes into the ante-room or the Lodge room, as the case may be. Very soon some Brother comes along with whom he is well ac- quainted to whom he says: \"Say, Joe, I've got a candidate who wants to join our Lodge. He is a good boy, I've got his fee, put your name down here.\" Joe signs the petition, some other Brother is roped in the same way, taking the voucher of the one and the signature of the other Brother as an evidence of Faith, of Truth and Right. The petition is presented in the usual way and is acted upon. The Master appoints an examining com- mittee of three Master Masons to examine the candi- date and see for themselves whether or not the candi-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 97 date or applicant is Worthy and Well Qualified to be Initiated and receive the Degrees. Now, if the examining committee does their Duty, they will investigate thoroughly and endeavor to find out all about him. Assuring themselves that he is FREE-BORN, and that he is Worthy and Well Quali- fied to enter, be Received and Initiated into our Fra- ternity. The utmost care should be exercised by the examining Committee in searching out the True Character of the solicitant. They should not upon any consideration depend upon the reputation of the petitioner for this reason It is not always safe to de- pend upon the reputation of any one. They should re- member that the status of their Lodge depends en- tirely upon the examining committee. It is not the Master of the Lodge or his Officers, nor the members of the Lodge who should be held responsible for the admission of \"Black Sheep.\" But it lies entirely in the hands of the examining committee. The Examining Committee should be charged by the Master of the Lodge, not to look at the financial condition of the Lodge. Neither should the Master himself try to beat the record of he who occupied the Oriental chair before him. And the committee should be requested to question the petitioners thoroughly and carefully, as to their Motives and Purposes in seeking admission into the Fraternity. Let them take time to do their work thoroughly and make their re- port truthfully. They should do their whole duty not only to the applicant, but to their Lodge. Then when it comes to the Lodge to do their duty they will most assuredly do it, in accord with the finding of the ex-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"98 The Lion's Paw Series amining committee. Because every Brother knows that IF THEY have done their Duty the Lodge can make no mistake in voting in accord with their inves- tigations. Thus you will understand, my dear Broth- ers, that the Status of the Lodge lies entirely in the hands of the examining committee and not with the Master, Officers and members alone. My dear Brothers, I have given you my opinion in relation to the Duties and Responsibilities of the Examining Committee, appointed by the Most Wor- shipful Master. And before closing this subject I de- sire to say that no member of a Masonic Lodge, should be too eager to sign a petition or vouch for a man of whom he knows comparatively nothing. Not until the Brother knows something definite, about the applicant, other than a casual acquaintance. Not un- til he knows something reliable in relation to his character, should he offer to sign a petition and pre- sent it to the Lodge. The kind of applicants every Lodge require are those who are worthy and well qualified, to Receive what we have to Give. Such an one are what we need in all our Lodges, Chapters, Councils and Consistories. Therefore, my dear Brothers, look to the interest of your Lodge, as well as to character of the applicant, before doing any- thing. If you are not positively certain in your own Mind, that he will not be a true Worker and Loyal to the Cause of Equity, Justice and Right, ask him to get some other one to take his name in. It is as I have previously said, better to be Safe, than Sorry. And then guard the portals of your Lodge in the usual manner."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 99 CHAPTER XL Antiquity of Masonry Before going any farther we will go back to Egypt to prove the antiquity of Masonry from the two ob- elisks called Cleopatras Needles. These wonderful obelisks were originally erected at Heliopolis in B. C. 1500, by Thothmes III, one of the greatest of Egyptian Pharoahs, in order to commemorate victories over his enemies, in the \"Golden Age of Egypt.\" They were brought from that great city of the Sun Heliopolis for the express purpose of decorating the temple of Caesar (The Caesercum) in Alexandria, dur- ing the reign of Tiberius. One of these stupendous monoliths was given to the English government by Mohammed Ali, and after considerable delay it was finally shipped to England in the year 1877, where it eventually arrived, having passed through great dan- ger of loss by shipwreck. And it stands today upon the Thames embankment, a relic of one of Egypt's grandest Monarchs. The dimensions of this stone are sixty-eight feet long and seven feet eight inches across the base. The other one was given to this country (America) by the Khedive. And it was brought to New York by Commander Goringe in the year 1880. The obelisk is seventy-one feet long and seven feet seven inches at the base, measured across the face of the stone.

Men who builded such stupeduous and magnificent monuments in the hoary civilizations of the dim and misty ages of the past. When our fore- fathers were digging clams, with stone hatchets in the lagoons of Europe and the Altars of the Druids were running red with the blood of human sacrifice. What a sweep backward, must the imagination take, in order to appreciate the almost bewildering stretch of time, from the present day of this twentieth century to the day when Eliola founded a Branch of The Great School in the early ages of Egyptian civilization. Both of these obelisks were quarried in Syene, at the first cataract of the River Nile. And it is com- posed of the same kind and quality of granite as that in Pompey's pillar. They were erected to honor one of Egypt's mighty warriors, nearly thirty-five cen- turies ago. And yet, now, they are the admiration of people, not in existence when this great and powerful King conquered the Marharania of Mesopotamia and blazoned upon their stony sides the deeds that he had done to thoroughly establish his Kingdom upon the banks of the River Nile, in the civilizations of a far away past. When Commander Goringe lowered this magni- ficent monolith from its pedestal in Alexandria in order to ship it to America, the workmen found beneath the stone a number of Masonic emblems, such as an apron, a trowel, etc. The discovery of"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 101 these emblems, which had been placed beneath this mighty monolith by our ancient Brethren, must most assuredly demonstrate to the present generation that the peculiar Rites and ceremonies practiced by the speculative Masons (?) of the twentieth century in erecting and dedicating their monuments and tem- ples, were not only performed by the practical opera- tive Masons at the begining of our present era, but in every age of the world's history. This goes to prove the verity of our Rituals in the statement that Masonry has existed from time immemorial and that the most intelligent men, in every age of the world's history have been members of our most Illustrious Fraternity. I do not wish my readers to believe implicitly in what I say in order to prove the Origin and Antiquity of Masonry and from whence it came, etc. But, in relation to \"Cleopatras Needles,\" let me ask you to procure and read very carefully \"The Obelisk and Free-Masonry\" by John A.

Kingsbury, like all other Masonic Students, was extremely interested in the account of the travels of Brother Rawson through Arabia, Pales- tine and Syria, where he had especially investigated Masonry as practiced by the Druses. For that rea- son I shall go into this subject fully and comprehen- sively from his investigations and my own. He says: \"The Master represents the unknown, the unseen, the all-powerful. And sits in the place of honor, whence he delivers his orders to his assistants who are ap- pointed at the time of the meeting.

He is then required to answer certain questions as in our own Lodges. He is then examined as to his intellectual develop- ment, very much like the candidate for the first de- gree in the Scottish Rite. Yet not a single word is said about religious faith, or creed, not even as to be- lief in Diety. By them it is presumed that all rational men are conscious of a Supreme existence, whether or not it is defined in words or Symbols. The very word Allah (God) is an exotic in Arabia.

The only world of being they know is the present and the only things worth notice are those re- lating to Man. Their Masonry, is therefore, a means of securing a better life here, without any reference to any other past or future. The idea of collective man (humanity) is very an- cient and its teachings are simple That man was de- rived from the great source, that he returns to the same and that it is his duty to make life as important as possible. First for himself, which means with the Arab a discharge of Duty to others for the sake of its return to himself. The Will of the Sheikh (Master) is the Law of the Lodge. But the Will of the Master, must be guided by the ancient Law which is unchange- able and inevitable. The teachings of the Lodge en- lightens the conscience and lifts the neophyte above himself, into a prevision of motives, the only sure guarantee of Morality. The notion, which has grown into a belief, that an injury done to any member of the race, will reflect upon any doer of the deed, not as an accident but as a necessity of Law. They consider this to be a Law of Nature Learning chiefly through observation, the Arab sees in the frequent exercise of the Will of the Sheikh, an apparent check or interference with the law of Nature. But, experience teaches him, through more careful observation that the Law invariably re- asserts itself. The Abram is the ideal of excellence in human life. The esoteric teaching and work of the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 105 Lodge would be entirely out of place here and in- telligible to only a few initiates. Consequently, a general idea of the objects and purpose of the Lodge will be far more acceptable to the reader. There is no such thing as Masonic literature among the Arabs of the desert. Outside the walled cities of the coast. But within the lodges of those cities, there is plenty of Masonic literature, but no true Masonry. Their rituals in the cities, is com- posed of a mass of garbled innovations, put there by the many Europeans who located in those cities and affiliated with them. And they, like the Prestons, Webbs and Cross', have woven into those rituals, such utter absurdities, that to the intellectual Ma- sonic Student, it is perfectly ridiculous. The True Arab Mason, never upon any consideration, records anything except in his memory. There can never be any paper Brother among them No book Mason, and to advance the candidate must have obtained what he has learned, like all those who had preceded him FROM MOUTH TO EAR. Masonry in the desert, among the Bedouins, is the privilege of the very few. None but those who can come well recommended can even hope to be admitted into their midst as a brother. Masonic knowledge is an unqualified passport and introduction.

This custom, never fails of commanding respect, even between hostile tribes. Except, the traveller be guilty of shedding blood, not in self-defense. The protec- tion of Women and Children, is an obligation that is never neglected. Any shortcoming in this matter, would heap dishonor on the head of the erring one. Literature has changed the character of our Craft in so many points that careful study is required to as- certain the ancient meaning and practice. And even the closest application sometimes fails in tracing an ancient origin for some things in frequent use in the Lodge and elsewhere by the brethren. No such in- novation (removal of an ancient landmark) is possi- ble in the desert, where the traditions of all the tribal Lodges, correct the errors that may have crept in through some over-zealous person or worker. The language used in the Arab Lodge, is not that of modern literature, but it is that of the early ages, known as YOKTAN in the centre of Ishmael to the West of Yemen in the South. The earliest language that has been preserved is poetic. The Ritual of the modern Lodge is rhymed questioned and answered in the choicest terms, according to the grammar of the present idiom, which also is the oldest. To the philo- logist those items are proof of the antiquity of our Fraternity. More convincing, even than monuments in stone, which can be made in every age.

I myself especially request every Brother Mason to investigate and search for himself and Think and Reason for himself. Do not believe anything, I may say or write until you find that it is true.

There is not a word in use in the modern lodge that has any reference to modern discoveries in science, or to the political, or religious changes of the last twenty centuries. Neither Christ nor Mohammed is mentioned. This fact opens a charming vista to the antiquarian and philologist.\" What I want my readers to thoroughly understand is that the Arab Mason in the Bedouin lodge could not have been obligated on either our Bible or the Koran, because, as I have already said, neither Christ nor Mohammed are mentioned. There is one thing certain and that is the Neophyte who was received into the lodges of Arabia, Egypt, Persia and India must have assumed obligations and they must have been sworn or obligated upon something, which they considered to be the most sacred symbol known by them. Therefore, in order to find what that symbol or emblem was, let us search the writings of the an- cient Hebrews and we shall find, that One of the most sacred emblems or symbols of those people was the organs of generation, or Man's Trinity. This fact"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"112 The Lion's Paw Series is demonstrated all through all the writings of these ancient people. One of the strongest proofs to me of the sacred- ness of the generative organs of man, is in the be- ginning of the twenty-third chapter of Deuteronomy. There we are told that he who is wounded in those parts or by some unfortunate accident loses his gen- erative organs, could not enter into the congregation of the Lord. See also Leviticus 21-20. From the above we find that the trinity of man was looked upon as something different from the other parts of the body, and it was held as the most sacred emblem or symbol known to man, because it made man a creator. Such things being the case, we find that in the days of Abram, Isaac and Jacob the people swore by or upon those organs of generation or the creative powers of man, because they were em- blematic of God, the Creator. In Genesis, Chapter 24, 2d verse, we find Abram telling the chief of all his servants to \"put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh\" and swear by the Lord God of Heaven to do his (Abram's) bidding. Again we find in Genesis, Chap- ter 47, Verse 29, that Jacob asks the same thing of his son Joseph, \"put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh,\" when he made Joseph swear to take him out of the \"Land of Egypt,\" and bury him with his father. And Joseph obligated himself upon the generative organs of his father Jacob.

The man not only vehemently denied it, but when he saw himself still distrusted he uncovered himself before the whole military staff and swore upon his trinity, that he was guiltless. Throughout the whole of the Eastern countries in the dim dawn of prehistoric ages, as well as in the present day, the virile organs of man were and are held in the greatest of veneration by the different peoples of these countries, and I do most firmly be- lieve that long before their sacred writings were in ex- istence the Craftsmen of those ancient days were most assuredly Obligated upon their own generative organs, or the Linga-stone or symbol of the procreative forces of nature. If the candidate was not sworn upon either of the above he would most certainly have to be obligated on their emblem, such as the Sun-a-flame a burning torch an erect serpent, or a tree or stone that repre- sented the phallus or creative powers of men."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 115 CHAPTER XIII. Book of the Law From what I have said above we are positively certain that there was no book of the Law in the days of Abraham and we are also positively certain that there was no book of the law when Moses was lifted from the flowing waters of the River Nile. And we also positively know that there could have been no Book of The Law as it is today, when King David bought the threshing floor from Oman the Jubusite whereon to erect the temple to the Most High God of Israel. In taking up this subject of the \"BOOK OF THE LAW\" I will quote you from my \"Egypt, The Cradle of Ancient Masonry,\" because I feel that it will interest every Masonic student and will prove a most interesting subject, especially to all Royal Arch Masons. Their ancient traditions, which have been preserved for so long a time within the Chapter will now have to undergo a test of investigation in order to prove the verity of the assertion, \"BOOK OF THE LAW.\" But, no matter if we are able to prove that it never existed, as is generally understood, the teach- ings that underlie the sacred symbol will ever remain one of the grandest features pertaining to the rites and ceremonies that should be in the Master Mason's degree where it rightfully belongs."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 The Lion's Paw Series It is not with any irreverence toward the so called \"BOOK OF THE LAW\" that I approach this sub- ject, but it is with the most profound veneration for the writings contained in the Old Testament. I sim- ply wish to show you my dear friends and compan- ions, that it could not have been what it is generally supposed to be, the canon of the Old Testament and the New combined, known as \"The Holy Bible,\" which I have frequently seen used in the ceremonies of the Exaltation. I have inquired in many countries, by what au- thority it is used, but could get no definite informa- tion in relation to my questioning. Now, this \"Book of The Law\" that is supposed to have been found and generally used in the Chapter of the Royal Arch is purely and simply the Holy Bible. I shall not enter into a long discussion upon the various translations of the Bible or try to prove which one is the most cor- rect, but we will endeavor to find out something about the \"Book that was lost.\" History informs us that after the captivity, when the Jews were rebuilding their temple under their leader Zerubbabel, and while this was going on three very earnest sojourners applied for and received per- mission to assist in the good work and that one of the very first things that resulted from their labors was the discovery of the \"Book of The Law,\" which is said to have been lost since the time when Solomon lived and reigned. The \"Book of The Law, long lost was now found and they gave praise to the Lord and from that time it has been preserved with other discoveries that were made at or about the same time."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 117 Now, the only place in the Bible that refers to the discovery of the \"Book of The Law,\" is in Kings, Chapter 22 and Verse 8, wherein it tells us that Hil- kieh, the High Priest, told Shapan the Scribe, that he had discovered the \"Book of The Law,\" in the House of the Lord, and possibly this discovery was the origin of the Book itself. But, let us who are searching for LIGHT, distinctly remember that there is one thing positively certain, and that is the book that was found by Shapan or our ancient companions, did not, nor could not have included the \"New Testament,\" with the account of The Life and Death of Christ the Master, nor anything concerning him. For that rea- son we must omit that and confine ourselves strictly to the Old Testament, if we desire to find the \"Book of The Law.\" Now, if we are very careful in our investigations, we shall find that there is no positive certainty about the compilation of the various writings that go to make up the Old Testament, or by whom or in what manner, or what time they were compiled. According to some of the Hebrew Rabbis, Ezra was the one who began the compilation of the many historical, poetical and prophetical writings that composed the Old Testa- ment. But we do not consider this information as thoroughly reliable. There is one thing positively certain, however, and that is the compilation was not made until after the exile. Ezra may possibly have commenced the compilation of this great work, which was no doubt continued by his successors, who eventually completed it somewhere about the early part of the second century B. C."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 The Lion's Paw Series In order to accomplish this great undertaking, it was necessary to write new works, based upon the tra- ditions of these people, until at last the work was completed. We now have the Old Testament, a very valuable and important collection of writings, but it is not the Book for which we are looking. This compilation is not the \"Book of The Law,\" although it may contain it. Therefore, in order to make our search complete and our investigations thorough, we shall have to strike out those books that were composed after the reign of Solomon and search for the book that had been lost for so many hundred years. Consequently we will begin our elimination with Ezra, Joel, Chron- icles, Jeremia, Ecclesiastes, Daniel, Malachi and Jo- nah, because these works were written after the Jews had been freed from their bondage in Persia, and in fact, long after Ezra had died and their temple had been completed. We must also throw out those beau- tiful poetical works, The Psalms, Lamentations and The Song of Solomon, as well as the whole of those profound philosophical aphorisms that are contained in the Book of Proverbs. We shall also have to eliminate Samuel, Ruth, Es- ther, Judges, Kings, Micah, Amos, Hosea, and in fact, we are compelled to exclude the whole of the various works, or books, that go to make up the canon of the Old Testament.

There were, however, a great many writings, no doubt held in great venera- tion by the Jewish people. The first form that all these promiscuous and scattered writings assumed was the Pentateuch, or the first five books that had been compiled and they were bound together into one volume, which was really and truly a compendium of History and Law. It began with the creation of the Universe, in Exodus, and ending with the death of Moses, in Deuteronomy. These five books have been generally ascribed to the Jewish Law-giver Moses,. but, from the general consensus of opinions of various authorities and from my own personal investigations, I find that no less than four different people were the authors of these books. In order to converge them and make them appear the work of one mind and hand, the redactor was compelled to put in addition to his own writings so as to make them appear and read as one continuous history. But if you, my dear Brothers will go over these works carefully you will find for yourselves where they have been pieced or connected together and that after they were com- pleted and formed into one volume, it was called and known as \"THE LAW.\" Now if we search carefully in this so-called \"Book of The Law,\" we shall most assuredly discover three distinct legal codes in the Pentateuch, and yet not"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 The Lion's Paw Series one of them refers to either of the others and in some cases they are contradictory. Now this fact alone would most assuredly prove that they were written by different authors, or writers. The FIRST collection is said to have been given by God to Moses at Mount Sinai and is known as the \"Book of the Covenant.\" See Exodus, Chapter 20. For an account of the SECOND, see Leviticus, Chap- ter 26. The THIRD and last code we find in Deuter- onomy and it was given to Moses on the East side of the Jordan. See Deuteronomy, Chapter 4, Verse 44, to the end of the Chapter; and just before his death, in the Land of Moab, in sight of the \"Promised Land,\" which the Lord showed unto Moses, but into which He would not permit him to enter, see Deuteronomy Chapter 34. Now my friends and readers, I do not desire to en- ter into a long discussion upon the statement that \"Moses was not the sole author of the Pentateuch, but I will simply say that if there be any companion who is in doubt upon this subject, they can easily ver- ify my assertions by searching for the proof and judg- ing for themselves. From the above we find that the Old Testament begins with the creation of the world and ends with the prophets, some time during the fourth century B. C., after the Babylonian captivity. We also find that a compilation of these writings were collected and thus formed the canon of the Old Testament. In our search for the \"Book of The Law\" we were com- pelled to cut out nearly all the books of that sacred volume in our search for that which had been lost."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 121 We now find ourselves with the Pentateuch, which contains three distinct legal codes to which I have al- ready referred. One of these must be the \"Book of the Law,\" for they existed long before Solomon lived and reigned, and it was no doubt one of these that was deposited in the Ark of the Covenant, with the Pot of Manna and the Budding Rod. And before concluding this subject I desire further to state that, the canon of the Old Testament was not and could not have been in existence during the reign of either King David or his son Solomon. We certainly admit and say, that there were at that time only a few scat- tered and promiscuous writings, which were no doubt held as sacred by a great many people at that time. These writings composed a history and a variety of legal codes that were considered to have been written by Moses and were known as the Pentateuch or the \"Law of Moses,\" but which I have clearly proven were written by different peoples at different times and here I leave it in your hands. In relation to the above, there is one thing that I know we shall all agree upon, and that is the canon of the Old Testament is not the \"Book of The Law.\" From what I have written you will be enabled to trace Masonry from the earliest ages down through the ruins of Empires of every age to the present day, and to our beloved Rite in America.

History of The Ritual In speaking of the Ritual, let me quote you from an article that was published in \"The Masonic Monthly\" of Boston, Mass., over fifty years ago. It was titled \"HISTORY OF THE RITUAL,\" and it was re-published by one of the best Masonic papers on earth and the best known, THE TYLER-KEY- STONE,\" the July issue of the year 1914 and, I, thinking it would be of interest to my readers quote you in full the reprint. \"Of the thousands upon thousands of candidates, who annually pass through the ceremonies of the sev- eral degrees conferred in Masonic lodges, but very few know anything of the history of the Ritual of the Order. This is especially to be regretted for the rea- son that there is among the members of the craft generally, a strong aversion to any change however slight in anything connected with the Ritual for fear that some of these ancient waymarks may be in- fringed upon or obliterated. Previous to the revival of Masonry in 1717, and the organization of our present system of Grand Lodge and Chartered Lodges, the secrets of the Or- der were undoubtedly communicated and the instruc- tions and explanations given to the candidates in such form of language as the presiding Master or Warden"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"124 The Lion's Paw Series could command at the time. If he were a person gifted in language and his mind well stored with the facts and lessons of scriptural Masonic history, his expla- nations would be full and interesting and his instruc- tions clear and explicit. If, on the other hand, the presiding officers were less fortunate in these respects the traditions and moral instructions would be set forth in style and language corresponding even to a meagre and barren explanation of the vital points. It is very probable, but not certain that these explana- tions and instructions, or lectures, as they were technically called, by long usage and frequent repe- tition gradually assumed a set form of words, which form was transmitted orally from one generation to another. Soon after the reorganization of the Order in 1717, the Grand Lodge of England ordered the ancient constitution and charges of the Order to be compiled and printed, which was done by Dr. William Ander- son, a distinguished scholar and Free-Mason. This volume, known as \"Anderson's Constitution,\" was published in 1723 and was the first printed book upon Free-Masonry ever issued. In his book of constitutions, Dr. Anderson, assisted by Dr. Desaguliers, arranged the lectures for the first time into the form of question and answer. Dr. Oliver informs us, that \"the first lecture extended to the greater length, but the replies were circumscribed within a very narrow compass. The second was shorter and the third, called the Master part, contained only seven questions and examinations. So favorably were these improved \"lectures\" received, that the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 125 Grand Lodge of England, (then the only Grand Lodge in existence, except the Old Grand Lodge, or Assem- bly, at York, which soon afterward expired) adopted the form and ordered them to be given in all the Lodges. Thus was compiled and disseminated the first regular form or system of Masonic \"lectures.\" The progress of the Order, subsequent to the date above mentioned, was unprecedented in all its pre- vious history and in a few years the imperfections of Dr. Anderson's loudly called for a revision. This was finally accomplished in 1732 by Martin Clare, an eminent Mason and who was afterwards Deputy Grand Master. Clare's amendments consisted of but little more than the addition of a few moral and scrip- tural admonitions and the insertion of a simple allu- sion to the human senses and to the theological ladder. A few years later, Thomas Dunckerly, an accom- plished scholar and who was considered the most in- telligent Free-Mason of his day, considerably ex- tended and improved the Lectures. Among other things, he first gave to the theological ladder its three most important rounds. According to Dr. Oliver, Dunckerly added many types of Christ. This be it remembered, was only one hundred years ago and is an explicit statement of the addition of the first Christian allusion to be found in the Ritual of Free-Masonry. The lectures of Dunckerly continued to be the standard in England until 1763, when Rev. William Hutchinson revised and improved them. Hutchinson soon boldly claimed the third degree to be exclusively Christian."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 The Lion's Paw Series He regarded the degrees as progressive steps, or schools in religion. He believed that the knowledge of the God of Nature formed the first state of our pro- fession; that the worship of the Deity, under the Jew- ish Law is described in the last and highest order. In the lectures of Hutchinson are first introduced the three great pillars Wisdom, Strength and Beauty as supports of a Lodge. He also appears to have in- troduced for the first time the cardinal virtues of Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance and Justice. He also gave to the Star its Christian significance, in fine, he appears to have exerted his utmost ingenuity to render the degrees emphatically Christian in their allusions and teachings. Hutchinson's system continued in force but a few years. His lectures gave place in 1772 to the revision of William Preston. The latter not only revised, but greatly extended the lectures and his system contin- ued to be the standard in England until the \"Union\" of the two Grand Lodges of that kingdom in 1813, when a committee of which Dr. Hemming was the chairman and leading mind, compiled the form now generally used in the English Lodges and known as the Hemming Lectures. During the unhappy division of the Craft in Eng- land between 1739 and 1813, differences had also crept into the lectures and at the Union above mentioned the committee endeavored to compile a system which, while it should be in conformity to the spirit of Free- Masonry and in harmony with the ancient Landmarks, should be a sort of a compromise between the forms in previous use by the two rival organizations."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 127 The Hemming lectures differ widely from any others previously introduced. A few of these differ- ences may properly be mentioned. English lodges are now dedicated to Moses and Solomon, instead of the two Saints John, as before. And their Masonic festival falls on the Wednesday following St. George's Day, April 23rd, that Saint being the patron of Eng- land. The symbols of an E A are a 24-inch rule, a gavel and chisel. Those of a M M are a pair of com- passes, a skirret and a pencil. The ornaments of a M M Lodge are \"a porch, a dormer and a stone pave- ment.\" Instead of following the example of his prede- cessor, in introducing new Christian allusions, Dr. Hemming expunged several in use previously. The system, however, never met the cordial approval even of the English brethren and though beautifully elabo- rate, contains so many incongruities and departures from the more simple lectures of Preston, that it can never be recognized as a universal system. The verbal ritual of Preston was introduced into this country by two English brethren, who had been members of one of the principal Lodges of Instruction in London and was by them communicated to Thomas Smith Webb, an accomplished and distinguished Mason of New England. According to the testimony of Webb him- self, he made but little change in the system of Pres- ton. In the first edition of his Free-Mason's Monitor, published in 1797 he says \"The observations on the first three degrees are principally taken from 'Preston's Illustration of Ma- sonry,' with some necessary alterations.\" Mr. Pres- ton's distribution of the first lecture into six, the sec-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 The Lion's Paw Series ond into four and the third into twelve sections, not being agreeable to the present mode of working, they are arranged in this work according to the general practice. It appears plain that Webb followed Pres- ton quite closely and one who will take the trouble to compare them will find that Cross and after him, all the rest have copied nearly verbatum from Webb, so that the esoteric portions of the ritual, as contained in Monitors, Charts, Manuals and Trestle boards, are but little more than reprints of Preston's Illustrations of Masonry. But my dear brothers I do not desire to enter into a long discussion at this time or any other in relation to the Ritual-makers in England at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It makes no difference to me whether an assemblage of so-called Masons met on the 24th day of June, (Saint John's day) or any other day, to formulate a Ritual at the Tavern of the Goose and Gridiron, the Apple Tree Inn, the Rummer and Grapes, Pig and Fiddle or any other of those Beer and Rum drinking places. Or, whether the Hemming or Martin Clare's lectures were better than the Pres- ton's and Webb's. To me they are all utterly absurd and perfectly ridiculous and not worthy the attention of the Masonic student who is searching for Light and Truth. Let me tell you what I have so often written upon and emphasized in my lectures that Ritualism is not Masonry and this fact I desire to impress firmly upon your minds. Every Master Mason who has been \"duly and truly prepared\" and found worthy and intellect- ually qualified, will most assuredly know that the Rit-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 129 ualistic ceremonies of Initiation, Passing and Raising do not unfold to us that beautiful system of Morality, veiled in Allegory and Illustrated by Symbols. In no part do they open up to us the sublime Truths that lie buried beneath them. The true meaning of the Al- legories and Symbols must be carefully searched for before the candidate can ever hope to understand what they represent and teach us. The Ritual makers, of whom I have referred to above, put in a lot of symbols and then rinding them unsuitable afterward rejected them, replacing them by others equally as absurd, Cross for instance. Our revered Brother, the late Albert Pike, speak- ing in relation to this subject says, in Morals and Dogma, page 204: \"There is no sight under the sun more pitiful and ludicrous at once than the Prestons and Webbs, not to mention the later incarnations, of Dullards and common-place, undertaking to explain the old symbols of Masonry and adding to and im- proving them, or inventing new ones. To the circle, enclosing the central point and itself traced between two parallel lines, a figure purely Kabalistic, these per- sons have added the superimposed Bible and even reared on that the ladder with the three or nine rounds and then giving a vapid interpretation of the whole so profoundly absurd as actually to excite admiration."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 131 CHAPTER XV. Lack of Interest by the Craft Before entering fully and comprehensively into the subject of the Ritual and Ritualistic ceremonies, which will be treated thoroughly and comprehensively in another volume of this series, I desire to express my astonishment at the apparent lack of interest taken in Masonic literature by the vast majority of the breth- ren calling themselves Free-Masons. It is a lamentable fact that an immense number of brothers, who call themselves Master Masons, have no more idea of the esoteric teachings of our beloved Fraternity than the Solicitant, who has not yet received the \"Light,\" be- ing bewildered as it were by its refulgence. If you take the trouble to converse upon the teachings or symbology of the various degrees, you will find many sadly deficient upon the most simple subjects. Con- tinue your investigations and you will most assuredly find that seemingly they have no apparent interest in the actual knowledge needed to make them acquainted with the Ancient Landmarks of the Fraternity, or even to converse upon general topics of interest to the intellectual student seeking MORE, LIGHT, MORE TRUTH; aye, more knowledge, not of Masonic in- terest only, but in the wonderful advance of Science, Philosophy, etc., as evidenced by researches in the realms of literature and the many remarkable discov-"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"132 The Lion's Paw Series cries made in the scientific world and utilized in this wonderful twentieth century. The true Mason will never be satisfied with the the simple ceremonies of the various degrees to which he has attained, but will search among the beautiful symbols permeating our beloved Fraternity, to dis- cover the sublimity and grandeur of the profound TRUTHS underlying each and every one of them. Every word in these degrees is frought with the deep- est significance. Every answer that you give at your initiation forms a sentence, which is the key to the symbolic degrees. And it is his duty to endeavor to discover the hidden meaning of every symbol, as well as to understand the true meaning of every word. If he has been earnest in his endeavors as a Master Mason, and if he has passed through the profoundly beautiful and magnificent ceremonies pertaining to our Ancient Scottish Rite degrees, he will at length understand their seeming mysteries and this trans- lated knowledge will make him a Mason in Truth and in Spirit plainly pointing out his Path and Duty. The great majority of those calling themselves Masons do not give enough study to the preceding degrees before entering upon the threshold of another. They do not take the time to consider or realize that the various degrees in Masonry are like the links in a great chain connecting one with the other, forming among them- selves a grand whole; and as I have often told you in my lectures, let me now repeat that: the proper un- derstanding of one degree is a key-note of comprehen- sion to the one above. Probably you may get a better idea of my meaning when I say, that the whole of"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 133 the degrees of The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite are analogous to Mathematics, because in order to thoroughly understand the science of numbers and arithmetic we must begin at addition, pass on to sub- traction, rise to multiplication and then advance to division and so on. As without the knowledge of the one we could not possibly understand the true mean- ing of the other, and so it is with the whole of Masonry, but more especially so with the beautiful degrees in Scottish Rite Masonry. Thousands of brothers who call themselves Mas- ter Masons do not care to study or learn the true meaning of the beautiful symbols permeating our be- loved Fraternity. But they take the various degrees of our Scottish Rite bodies often out of simple curi- osity, while many others acquire them in the hope that it will aid them in their business affairs. Again many are desirous of passing rapidly through the va- rious degrees and be received as a \"MASTER OF THE ROYAL SECRET\" to be enabled to wear the jewel of that degree, suspended from a watch chain, who yet knows no more of 'THE ROYAL SECRET\" than a child unborn. Or possibly, with an insane de- sire to become A SHRINER. AND THAT IS NOT MASONRY. Such brothers are simply Drones in the \"Masonic Hive,\" and not true workers, otherwise they would endeavor to learn and acquire a knowl- edge of the profound philosophies and scientific prob- lems, which permeate our most illustrious Fraternity. But still there are a vast number of brothers who are earnestly searching through the symbology of the various degrees in Scottish Rite Masonry for the ex-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 The Lion's Paw Series press purpose of understanding the grand truths that are contained in its sublime philosophies and solving the problems of Life, Death, the Immortality of the Soul and the development of the human intellect. These brothers will ever be patient with the drones and sluggards. They will strive to help them along the path leading to greater exertions. And will en- deavor to plant within their hearts an earnest desire to know the Holy Doctrine and the KEY to the \"Royal Secret.\" It is very difficult to solve some of the symbols of the Ancient Mysteries and Ancient Masonry, and many of our modern writers give a wrong interpreta- tion to them, often leading person astray who are try- ing to understand them. The old secrets and sym- bols have been veiled or hidden on purpose to conceal their real meaning from the Profane, and yet the earn- est student, who has obtained the KEY through pro- found study, finds no difficulty in coming to an un- derstanding of their sublime teachings. The word Reveal is a very curious and mis-leading one if taken in its general accepted sense, because the Latin word \"revelare,\" from which we derive the word reveal or revealed, is just the opposite to the general accepted meaning of it in English. For revealare sig- nifies to reveil and not to reveal, i. e., from RE again or back, and velare to hide, or cover: to veil from the eyes of those who were unworthy. One of the first to reveal, (reveil or hide) the sym- bology of the Ancient Mysteries of India, so as to preserve and practice them in the valley of the Nile, was Hermes, and long centuries after him the Jewish"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 135 Lawgiver, Moses, who reveiled or hid away in the Wisdom of the Ancient Egyptians, all the Egypto- Chaldean theological legends and allegories. Albert Pike was of the same opinion as myself in relation to this subject, for he says in \"Morals and Dogma,\" page 104: \"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermaticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all, except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect. And uses false explanations and misinter- pretations of its symbols to mislead those who desire to be mislead to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light from them and to draw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would prevent it. So God Himself incapacitates many men, by color blindness to distinguish colors and leads the masses away from the highest Truth, giving them the power to attain only so much of it as is profitable to them to know. Every age has a re- ligion suited to its capacity. The teachers even of Christianity are in general the most ignorant of the true meaning of that which they teach. There is no book of which so little is known as the Bible. To most who read it, it is as incomprehensible as the Sohar. So Masonry, zealously conceals its secrets and intentionally leads conceited interpreters astray. Let me again repeat, there is no sight under the sun more pitiful and ludicrous at once than the Prestons and the Webbs, not to mention the later incarnations of Dullards and common-place, undertaking to 'ex- plain' the old symbols of Masonry.\" Masonry, successor of the mysteries, still follows the ancient manner of teaching.

He who would become an accom- plished Mason, must not be content merely to hear or even to understand the lectures; he must be aided by them and they having as it were marked out the way for him, to study, interpret and develop these symbols for himself."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 137 CHAPTER XVI. The Whole of Masonry Not in the First Three Degrees There are a great number of Master Masons who firmly believe that the Blue Lodge or Symbolic de- grees contain the whole of Masonry. But this asser- tion clearly proves that they have not as yet fully comprehended What Masonry is, or what it stands for and teaches, or they would never make such an assertion. It also clearly proves that they do not realize that Masonry is a progressive scientific philosophy, veiled in Allegory and illustrated by sym- bols. We will admit that if the first three degrees had not been tampered with, by the Crosses, Prestons and Webb's, the fundamental principles of a pure scientific philosophy would be plainly seen and thoroughly understood by all those who had been \"Duly and Truly Prepared,\" and who had been found worthy to Receive. The first three degrees in Masonry are simply the foundation, upon which has been builded a most pro- found Scientific, Philosophy, Easily Learned, and thoroughly comprehended by all those who have been found worthy to Receive it. Let me make myself fully understood, by saying, that the fundamental principles of Masonry are latent in the Symbolic de-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"138 The Lion's Paw Series grees. But let it be thoroughly understood that, un- til the Master Mason has taken the Ineffable and pro- found, philosophical degrees of our beloved Scottish Rite, he will never be enabled to understand them. For what they symbolize and teach have come down to us from a Venerable Association of Perfect Mas- ters of India, the Mazdean philosophers of Persia and the Hierophants of the ancient Egyptian Mysteries. In the Science of Numbers or Arithmetic, there are certain \"Rules\" running through the whole series for our guidance and proper understanding of the whole series or science. Therefore, if a man has only a simple knowledge of the First Three Rules alone, Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication, what could he know of Proportion, Square-Rout, Mensuration, Algebra, Trigonometry, Conic, Sections, etc. Con- sequently by the same ruling, a Master Mason, who has only received the first three degrees in a Symbolic Lodge, would know comparatively nothing of the sub- lime philosophical teachings of the higher degrees of Scottish Rite Masonry. Some years ago during a visit to Chicago, I was sitting, chatting with the late Brother Gil W. Barn- ard, 33rd, in his office in presence of another mutual Friend and Brother, the late Carson Smith, 33rd, upon the subject now under discussion. When Brother Bernard arose and brought from an adjacent shelf a copy of the May number of the \"Canadian Free-Ma- son, pages 336 et seq, and read the following: \"Fre- quently we hear the remark that all of Free-Masonry is contained in the First Three degrees I cannot be justly charged with partiality when I claim"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 139 that all that belongs to Free-Masonry is not contained in the Lodge degrees. The Mark and Royal Arch de- grees of the Chapter, as well as those of the Royal and Select Masters, are not only essentiably Masonic in character, but are as much needed for a proper un- derstanding of our legends and mysteries, as any part of the first three degrees. Some say (and truthfully), that the Masonic portions of the degrees mentioned, were taken from the second and third degrees. But that only goes to prove my position. Another fea- ture and to me it is a much stronger argument, for the usefulness of the so-called higher degrees, is, that in the working of them, we find an elaboration and illu- stration in detail of the best and strongest points, con- tained in the Lodge work Nothing is more Masonic than the teaching regarding the work and wages of the Mark Master. And equally so, is the lesson contained in the Royal Arch and the Grand Omnific Royal Arch Word Holiness to the Lord is the essence of Masonry Brethren, it is true beyond question, in my experience that the Lodge is strengthened and made more useful through the lessons received by their members in Chapter, Council and Commandry. And the beautiful Aye Sublime teachings of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. One of the very first things every Master Mason will discover, will be that the secrets which lie con- cealed, in our Legends, Symbols and Allegories, are not taught openly in our Lodges, Chapters and Coun- cils. They are known most certainly, but they are not given out promiscuously to every Brother. He is left"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 The Lion's Paw Series to find the true meaning of them, by and for himself alone. In having the first three degrees conferred upon him, he will not receive that which is said to have been lost. Neither will he understand anything pertaining to the ritualistic ceremonies, excepting, the parrot-like lessons he has to learn from his ap- pointed Instructor. There are lessons to be learned, but he must search, amidst the rubbish of ritualistic ceremonies himself, in order to discover their true meaning. Then when he passes from the square and compasses, he will find himself far better enabled to appreciate that which lies before him. As Albert Pike truly says in his Morals and Dogma, the symbols of the wise always become the idols of the ignorant multitude. The Symbolic degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations in the so-called York Rite of Masonry. The whole body of the Royal and Sacerdotal Art was hidden centuries since, in the High degrees, that it is even yet, impossi- ble to solve many of the enigmas which they contain. It is well enough for the mass of those calling them- selces Master Masons, to imagine, that all is contained in the First Three or Symbolic Degrees. And who ever attempts to undeceive them, will labor in vain. And without any true reward violate his obligations. Masonry is a veritable Sphinx, buried to the head in the sands of misinterpretations heaped around it. I have often lectured and frequently written upon the Three degrees of Masonry, and I must certainly say, that I agree with what Brother Albert Pike has"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 141 said about the Blue Lodge degrees, and his comparing them to the \"broken columns of a roofless Druidical Temple in their rude and mutilated greatness,\" as per- fectly correct. And every Masonic Student who will carefully examine the Symbolic degree of the so- called York Rite, will immediately recognize their mutilated condition. And they will also find that there is nothing complete or perfect in them. Even that which every entered Apprentice and Fellow- Craft looks forward to has been lost and he is given a substitute to be used by every Master Mason, until future generations shall discover the lost one. Masonic Traditions carry us back to the most re- mote ages of antiquity. Away back beyond the dim dawn of pre-historic civilization. Long drifting cen- turies before the banks of the Nile were populated and adorned with tombs and temples, throughout the length and breadth of that wondrous valley of the Nile. In this connection let me quote you from \"Mystic Masonry\" by my Friend and Brother J. D. BUCK: \"Masonry deals largely with the Ethics and Sym- bolism of the Ancient Mysteries. The writer believes that through the well-timed efforts of Masons today, the grandest achievements in knowledge ever gained by Man, which were originally concealed in the Great Mysteries of Antiquity. And in time became lost to the world, may again be recovered. In the strictest sense this knowledge has never really been lost, as there have always existed those who were possessed of the Great Secret. And it was written in a universal language of Symbolism, that the Wise among all na-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"142 The Lion's Paw Series tions and throughout all time might read it, as it were, in their own language. It was also written in parable and allegory, so that the unlettered and common peo- ple might not be deprived of its wise precepts and of its force, in shaping character, dissipating ignorance and inspiring hope. Thus Ancient Wisdom is the fountain, from which Masonry takes its rise. The true Science of Symbolism, in time became lost; the Temples of Initiation fell into decay or were destroyed by Priests and Potentates, jealous of their influence. For many weary centuries, Men have been trying to recover the Lost Key and to restore the ancient Wis- dom from the parables and allegories in which it had been concealed. But progress in the inverse order, is not only necessarily slow, and uncertain, but all such attempts have, more or less, given rise to fantastic flights of the imagination and resulted in confusion, rather than in enlightenment. The result has been to bring the whole subject under contempt and to make the name 'Mysticism' mean something vague and un- certain, if not altogether foolish, to those ignorant of its true meaning. The causes that have led up to the re-veiling of the Ancient Wisdom and Masonic Symbols, have been many. Some of which have been previously men- tioned, such as Christian bigotry, ignorant fanaticism, misinterpretations and alterations, by those who de- sired to change the hieroglyphical characters or in- scriptions and symbols in order to suit their own ends and further their own designs. I have spoken about the destruction of Symbols, etc., so that you, my dear"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 143 friends, may give some thought to this subject your- selves. The Secret Doctrine tells that However, super- human the efforts of the early Christian or Church Fathers to obliterate the Secret Doctrine from the memory of Man, they all failed. Truth, can never be killed, hence the failure to sweep away from the face of the earth, every vestige, of that ancient Wisdom. And to shackle and gag every witness who testified to it. Let one only think of the thousands, aye, mil- lions of manuscrips burnt. Of monuments, with their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols, torn down and trampled into dust, by fanatics in every country on earth. I have written upon this particular subject, my dear Brothers and Friends, in order that you may thoroughly understand that If the First Three De- grees do contain the whole of Masonry, the Master Mason will never be able to understand or compre- hend but the ridimentary part of any of them. In fact, he will never attain to a thorough knowledge of any one of those degrees, until he has been initiated into the higher Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. And then only will he be enabled to thoroughly appreciate the beauty of the Symbolic Degrees. And then he will positively know that although they do not include the whole of Masonry, they do most certainly contain the KEY to the In- affable, Chevalric and Philosophical degrees of the Scottish Rite, which most assuredly does contain the WHOLE OF MASONRY. Consequently, every as-"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"144 The Lion's Paw Series piring Brother who is desirous of fulfilling his Vow and Keeping his First Promise to improve himself in Masonry, should never stop at the Third Degree. Because, he has only received the Light and has been raised to Life so that he may be enabled to \"Live The Life\" and continue on the Path that leads to higher planes of Spiritual unfoldment, and to a proper un- derstanding of the profound Wisdom that pertains to the Higher Degrees in Masonry. As he climbs his view widens out, and his horizon expands. He will begin to realize, not only the honor that has been conferred upon him, but also the Duties and Responsibilities that belong to all those who have been permitted to receive the glorious teaching that are embodied in the ceremonies of the Scottish Rite of Masonry of the Southern Jurisdiction. One of the very first things that he will learn, will be, that he carries within the sanctuary of his own Soul, the Lamp of Reason. And he will be impressed with the fact that \"Man should not live for himself alone.\" In all that I have written and all that is following in these pages, I have endeavored to give you posi- tive proof, not only of the Origin and Antiquity of Masonry, but what it stands for and what it teaches. Therefore, I ask all my readers and Brothers, to think, meditate and Reason upon what is to be found in the Harmonics of Evolution, the Psycological Crime and the Great Work. And upon that which I shall to the best of my ability endeavor to explain and lay clearly before you. Because, I consider Masonic knowledge, to be an absolute essential to the attain- ment of that perfection, upon which depend the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 145 Higher Degrees. And toward which, we should ever strive with an unceasing effort. Therefore, in order that you may attain to greater knowledge and more earnest devotion to Masonry, I ask you to read very carefully every page of this work, for it will positively give you Light. Let me assure you, my dear Brothers, that the teachings of that Venerable Brotherhood of Ancient India have never changed. That all its sublimely beautiful philosophies are to be found today, amidst the rubbish of innovations, that have crept into our beloved Fraternity from sources which I have so often spoken of in my lectures. Yet, notwithstanding this fact, if we search very carefully, we shall most as- suredly find that for which we are searching LIGHT. It is to be deplored that an immense number of Brothers calling themselves Master Masons, have no more idea of the Esoteric teaching of Free-Masonry, than the Man who has just made application for ad- mission into the Fraternity and has not yet passed be- tween the columns. If you take the trouble to con- verse with them upon the subject of Masonry, its symbology, or the teaching in the various Degrees, you will most assuredly find them, sadly deficient upon the most simple subjects of the Esoteric meaning of the Allegories, Legends and Symbols. They know comparatively nothing. Continue your investigations and you will find some who seemingly have no ap- parent interest in the actual knowledge needed to make them acquainted with the Ancient Land-Marks of Masonry. You will also discover that there are a"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 The Lion's Paw Series great many, who are not able to converse upon the general topics of interest, to the intellectual Masonic Student, who is seeking More Light, more Truth aye more knowledge, not of Masonic interest alone, but in the wonderful advance of Art, Science and Philosophy. The true Mason will never be satisfied with the simple ceremonies of the various Blue Lodge Degrees to which he has advanced. He will most assuredly search for himself among the Legends, Allegories and Symbols of the various Degrees, in order to discover their true meaning and the underlying Truths in each and every one of them. In so doing he will soon begin to realize the fact, that every thing he himself says, every position in which he finds himself, is fought with the deepest significance. He will also dis- cover that it is his bounden Duty to strive to discover the hidden meaning of every symbol in Masonry. Not until our Student has meditated long upon the Ethics and Symbolry, will he be enabled to understand their true meaning. He will find that a knowledge of what they teach and their fulfillment will make him a Ma- son in Truth and Spirit and point out his path and Duty. And I earnestly desire that every Master Ma- son should positively know that his Obligation does not make him a Master Mason in the true sense of the word. Only by keeping that Obligation.

They do not seem to know that a thorough comprehension of the very first Degree, is the Key to the one above. As I have so often said, in my lectures, the various degrees of Masonry, are analogous to Mathematics or the Science of Numbers. Because, in order, to thoroughly understand the Science of Numbers or Arithmetic, we must begin at addition and come to a thorough comprehension of what it teaches. Then with this knowledge gained we can safely pass on to subtraction. And with its aid we may rise to multiplication, when we shall fully realize the fact that we have now the real fundamentals of the Science. Now, having the Light of those three, we may safely Advance, on to Division, and so on, to the very highest problems of spherical Trigonometry, etc. Remember, without the knowledge of the very first, we could not possibly understand the true meaning of the others. Thus it is in Masonry and its various degrees. It would be simply impossible for any one to understand a higher degree without a thorough comprehensive knowledge of the one be- low. Therefore, my dear Brothers, begin at the be- ginning and know your lesson well."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 149 CHAPTER XVII. How to Live the Life There are thousands of Masons who do not care to Study or learn the true meaning of our beautiful sys- tem of Morality or the profound philosophy underly- ing each and every one in Masonry. There are large numbers who enter our portals and pass between the columns out of simple curiosity. Others earnestly de- sire to attain the very highest degree, in hopes that it will be an aid to them in their business affairs. There are others who are exceedingly anxious to get the Shrine. Again there are others who pass rapidly through the various degrees in order to be received as a MASTER OF THE ROYAL SECRET and wear the jewel of that Degree, and yet, know no more of The Royal Secret than a child unborn. Such Broth- ers are simply Drones in the busy hive of Masonry. Such an ones are most assuredly Drones and not true workers, otherwise they would endeavor to learn and acquire at least a rudimentary knowledge of the pro- found philosophies and scientific problems which per- meate the various degrees of our most Illustrious Fraternity.

They are no doubt earnestly striving to solve the problem of How to \"Live The Life.\" These Brothers will most assuredly be ever patient with the \"Drones.\" And they will, to the best of their ability, strive earnestly and incessantly to assist them along the path that leads to LIGHT AND LIBERTY. They will also earnestly strive to help them to comprehend that great and profound problem of PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. Because that Venerable Asso- ciation or Brotherhood of Perfect Masters in India discovered and taught in the dim and misty ages of the past that: \"PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is a fixed and immutable principle of nature and a Law of Individual Life and that there are no substitutes or antidotes for it. They have learned, therefore, long ages ago, that there is absolutely no plan or method possible, whereby Individual Intelligence may avoid it or evade it, or escape the natural results of its per- sonal application to each and every Intelligent Soul.\" Did not the Master Christ teach the same thing when he said : \"God is not mocked that which you sow that must you also reap.\" The T. K. says, in the \"GREAT WORK,\" page 386, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3: \"Slowly, laboriously and often times reluctantly, it is at last borne in upon the intelligent consciousness of every Student, that there is but one way whereby the problem of Personal Responsibility may ever be solved and that is by 'The Living of a Life.' \"Let him stop at this point and dwell for at least one silent and intense moment on the ominous sig-"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 151 nificance of these five simple, but magical words 'THE LIVING OF A LIFE; \"Then let him ask himself, how many there are to- day who are seeking or who think they are seeking for the hidden mysteries and vital truths of Life (The Life that is and the Life that is to come), who would stop, hesitate, then turn away, if they but know what every Student of Natural Science must come to know, viz.: that the definite knowledge and the independent Spiritual and psychical power for which they are seeking, can never be obtained or acquired in any manner whatsoever, except as a natural and scientific result of THE LIVING OF A LIFE, in full, and will- ing compliance with the Constructive Principle in In- dividual Life.\" Let me assure you, my dear Brothers, that only by fulfilling The Law and Living the Life, can you ever hope to rise to higher planes of Spiritual unfoldment and travel in foreign countries and receive a Master's Wages. Every Masonic Student will find it very difficult to solve some of the problems and Symbols of the \"Great School,\" and Scottish Rite Masonry, as well as those in our Blue Degrees. For many of our Modern writers give a wrong impression and interpretation of them. Often leading astray many of our Masonic Students who are trying to solve and understand them and their true meaning.

And even raised on that the ladder with three or nine rounds. And after giving a rapid interpretation of the whole, so profoundly absurd, as actually to excite admira- tion. I have no desire to go into the subject of Esoteric Masonry and point out to you the hidden meaning of many of the things that you have seen and heard; and yet do not understand. Because, I shall leave that to another volume of this series. Right here, and now, I simply want to tell you that the old secrets and symbols, have been reveiled or hidden, on purpose to conceal their true meaning from the profane. Not- withstanding this fact, the earnest student who has obtained the Key through profound Study, will find no difficulty in coming to a thorough comprehension of their true meaning and sublime teachings. The Great School in India had their watch-words. Which explained to the members thereof, the True Philosophy of Life. And the philosophy of present action and future hope (See Harmonies, page 463).

Masonry and Free-Masonry At the commencement of this volume we told you that Masonry is a peculiar system of Morality, veiled in Allegory and illustrated by Symbols. In this volume we shall omit the Legends, Allegories and Symbols, confining ourselves strictly to Morality. The T. K. in the Great Work informs us, at page 184, et sep. \"SCIENCE\" Is the exact knowledge of the Facts of Nature, classified and systematized.\" \"FAITH Is the established relation, which the facts of Nature sustain to each other and to the In- dividual Intelligence or the Soul of Man.\" \"PHILOSOPHY Is the conclusion, which man in his search for Knowledge of Truth, has drawn from the Facts of Science.\" Religion \"Is the application of the Facts of Science and the conclusions of Philosophy to indi- vidual Life and Conduct.\" From this viewpoint it will be observed that Science has reference alone to the phenomena of na- ture the terms 'facts' and 'phenomena' meaning the same thing.\" Truth has reference to the relations which the phenomena of nature, sustain to each other and to the Individual Intelligence. By reference to the defi-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"158 The Lion's Paw Series nition of 'Morality' it will be observed that the entire problem of Ethics or Morals falls within this field.\" Philosophy has reference to the deductions, which men have drawn from nature in their search for Truth. Religion is merely the application of such knowl- edge as we possess to the problems of individual life and conduct. It will now be apparent to those who have fol- lowed the subject closely, that, from the viewpoint of the Great School, science and philosophy and re- ligion are in no sense conflicting Schools. They do not antagonize each other in their essential nature. On the contrary, they are, in truth concomitant fac- tors in the same great problem of individual life and unfoldment. And Truth is the vital element which re- lates them all. It is also possible now to see and understand the clear principle of relationship between religion and morality. MORALITY, it will be remembered, is the established harmonic relation which Man, as an In- dividual Intelligence sustains to the Constructive Principle of Nature. While Religion is the applica- tion of such knowledge as we possess, to the problem of individual life and conduct, in such manner as to maintain that harmonic relation, the inevitable result of which is conformance with the Constructive Prin- ciple of Nature. But the process involved in such a life is one which also and at the same time, develops within the individual the state or condition of Constructive"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 159 Spirituality on which alone Spiritual Independence and Mastership depend. \"What does all this mean? Simply this, that Nat- ural Science and True Religion, after all, are one and the same thing. An understanding of this great Truth, makes of science a religion and lifts religion to a basis of exact science. To make this clear and cer- tain to the mind of the reader is one of the definite purposes of this chapter. \"Briefly summarizing: The Great School has dis- covered and formulated a definite system. It is based upon experiment and demonstration through personal experience. It constitutes a Scientific Formulary. Its foundation is Morality. Its application is Religion. It is Constructive in its essential nature. It is Evolu- tionary in its essential character. Its purpose is the development of Constructive Spirituality. Its results is Spiritual Independence and Mastership. Rudolf Eucken informs us that Religions, Moral- ity and the Morality of Reason, have come down to us from past ages and grew out of an inner world of Thought. The most effectual kind of Morality is as the T. K. says The religious one. Because, it completely severs moral action from all natural inclination, dis- associates it from all external performance, and give it a purely spiritual character. It supplies a most powerful impulse to action by connecting man's des- tiny with his attitude to his moral obligations. The awakening and ennobling power inherent in what Christ the Master preached and practiced, was not confined to Individuals, but was embodied in a large"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"160 The Lion's Paw Series section of the human race, creating a spiritual atmos- phere, which still acts powerfully on individual souls, even if they themselves are not conscious of it. Re- ligions, morality, still continues to influence us in this way. Religious Ethics do not seem to have sufficient latitude to transform the whole of life. We can therefore understand the widespread desire for some- thing which can sufficiently supplement religion's ethics. Religious Morality has been supplemented and completed by the Morality of Reason, which was de- veloped in the hoary ages of the past, by the learned men of Ancient India, down to the philosophers of the present day. Here Morality does not proceed from a superior and Divine Will. But from Man's own rea- sonable nature. This nature seems to demand recog- nition of a universal Law and voluntary submis- sion to it, only then does man bring his own being to perfection. The Morality arising herefrom is strong and manly, it incites man to a proud independence of Spirit and exalts him far above every day life. To this morality of reason we owe the scientific develop- ment of the moral world of Thought and the distinct formulations of conceptions, like Duty and Con- science. Let me positively assure you that MORALITY IS AN EXACT SCIENCE, just as surely and truly as any other so-called \"exact science.\" And the Great School positively declares in unmistakable terms that Morality is as truly and as definitely a matter of science as is chemistry. And this fact has not only"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 161 been taught throughout the ages by the Great Broth- erhood of India, thousands of years before the founda- tions of the pyramids of Egypt were laid, or the Sphinx, looked to the East. Which was long cen- turies before Abraham was born. Moses lifted from the bosom of the Nile, Solomon the Wise King of Isreal, or Christ the Master was over dreamed of. And yet these very Men learned the Science from the School of the Masters and they taught and demon- strated it in their own Lives. And Masonry received and gave or gives it to every member who is Worthy and Well Qualified to Receive it. And he who so re- ceives it realizes that it is his bounden Duty to demon- strate this progressive philosophy in his own Life. Because, the Members of the Great School today, as well as the Students of the various Masonic Clubs, every where, are endeavoring to educate men and Masons to a higher plane of spiritual unfoldment. To give humanity a thorough and comprehensive knowl- edge of Moral Laws and Principles. So that they might be enabled to \"LIVE THE LIFE\" and Prove the Law. Now, my dear Brothers, if Morality is an Exact Science and we know that it is not only because the Master says so, but because we have proven it for ourselves. The definition of the Word \"MORALITY\" is \"The established harmonic relation which Man as an Individual Intelligence sustains to the Constructive Principle of his own Being.\" From this definition we realize the fact that There can be no Soul growth without it. That MORALITY is the very foundation"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"162 The Lion's Paw Series of Constructive Spirituality. That on the Ethical plane of Being, it builds up that beautiful Temple of MORAL CHARACTER. And it continues to do so, just as long as man conforms his Life to the Construc- tive Principle of Nature. Which is \"That Principle in Nature which impels every entity to seek vibratory correspondence with another like entity of opposite po- larity.\" Therefore, from the above we find that Man must depend upon this Principle for all the possi- bilities of his Soul. If he will conform his Life to the Constructive Principle of Nature and \"LIVE THE LIFE\" he will prove the Law for himself. If every Mason would keep his first promise Learn to subdue his passions and Improve himself in Masonry (MORALITY) he would \"Live the Life.\" And he would fully realize the fact, that no destructive force could in any way affect him. And he would also realize the fact that Constructive Spirituality could not exist in Individual Life, except it is built upon and sustained by Morality. This is just exactly what Scottish Rite Masonry of the Southern Jurisdiction and the Schools of Ma- sonic Clubs teaches. And what the Great School of the Masters has ever taught and what it positively as- serts today, that The foundation of Moral Principle, must, be laid before any Man or Mason, can Receive Spiritual Knowledge or know how to rightly use it, for either himself or for the benefit of others. There- fore, every Master Mason, who keeps his First Promise and fulfills his Obligations and conforms his Life to the Constructive Principle of Nature and to the practice of Moral Principles, is most assuredly"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 163 \"LIVING THE LIFE.\" And this, my dear Friends and Brothers, is FREE-MASONRY. In the preceding pages we have answered the ques- tion WHAT IS FREE-MASONRY? In doing so we have shown you its Origin and proven its Antiquity. Therefore, in order to complete what I had in mind, when I started this little volume, I will quote you an article written by my very dear Friend and Brother, John L. Travis, of Savannah, Georgia:"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 165 CHAPTER XIX. What a Master Mason Is (By John L. Travis, Savannah, Georgia) \"A Master Mason is a man who has truly learned to subdue his passions and has improved himself in Masonry. \"Let us examine into this definition a little. What is that Masonry in which a man must 'improve him- self to become a Master? \" 'Masonry is a beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols.' \"But what is Morality? 'Morality is the established harmonic relation which Man, as an Individual In- telligence, sustains to the Constructive Principle of Nature.' But in other words : 'Morality is Man's estab- lished harmonic relation to the Constructive Principle of his own being.' The Great Work. \"Masonry throughout its whole fabric is construct- ive, and its allegories are based on the operations of building, or aligning one's self with the Great Con- structive Principle of Nature and of one's own being. \"Before a building is erected, however, the mate- rials are first set apart or 'devoted' to the work. Hence, a Master Mason must first have devoted or set apart his own powers and capacities to the work of build- ing a Spiritual Temple. And he must have done this freely and voluntarily. This material must be sound,"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"166 The Lion's Paw Series hence an inward preparation, one in the heart, is first requisite. For as out of the heart come the issues of life and death, so if the material be unsound at heart, the building erected therefrom cannot withstand the assaults of time or the attacks of the elements, even if it can bear its own weight. \"The material then being examined and found without blemish and well-fitted to be used for the pro- posed building, all irregularities and excrescences must be removed. This the Master Mason has done by the constant use of the Gavel of his Will, guided and tested by the Square of his Conscience. By these in- struments he has removed from his life all its vices and superfluities and has prepared himself 'as a living stone, for that spiritual temple, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.' \"Having proceeded thus far in the line of con- structive effort, he has laid the foundation of his Spiritual Temple, using the plumb of uprightness, in thought and heart as well as in words and professions, for the plumb admonished him to build upward ever. He has also used the level of equality and brotherly love, by which he has not only driven out arrogance and pride and arbitrary conduct towards others, but has also instilled courtesy, kindness, and humility. All this he has squared by the square of virtue, justice, strict rectitude, and duty, both towards his fellow man and himself. For no carpenter would undertake a build- ing without a square, neither can a man progress in the work of Spiritual Building without incorruptible virtue and purity of thought, word and deed; nor with-"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 167 out the full performance of every duty, to whomsoever owed. \"And he has covered this foundation with a Mo- saic pavement, reminding him to accept good and evil fortune with equanimity, that light and shadow, good and evil, prosperity and adversity, are to be expected equally by all men; that no matter what his posses- sions, whether wealth, intellect, knowledge, power, or health, they are but lent to him to use rightly, and that he cannot reasonably expect to enjoy them with- out paying the price and if he refuse to pay, they may be taken from him. \"No profane man, nor one who habitually takes the name of God in vain, no swearer, drunkard, libertine, retailer of filthy stories, no dishonest man, no man who is a glutton, or covetous or cruel or vain, or haughty, or intolerant, or cross, or impatient, or quick to anger without cause, can properly be called a Mas- ter Mason. How can he be a Master until he can con- trol himself? \"The foundations of Masonic character are Broth- erly Love and Humility, Uprightness, and Virtue. If any part of this foundation is taken away, the whole building must fall. \"The foundation laid, the Master Mason has learned to rise over and upon his appetites and pas- sions, to turn them into the columns that support and adorn his edifice. He does not despise his body, nor seek to destroy his natural appetites, but learns to turn them each to Constructive uses. And it may be said in passing that when his Temple is completed,"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"168 The Lion's Paw Series these very \"appetites and passions\" of the physical man (or is it not more probably their spiritual coun- terparts) the stone which the builders rejected be- come the headstone of the corner, the keystone of the gateway to spiritual knowledge and real happiness. \"The Master Mason has also improved himself, as far as possible, in the liberal arts and sciences. He is a man of liberal and generous mind, who is ever seek- ing more knowledge, or for more self gratification or intellectual pleasure, but that he may be more useful to his fellow-men. \"He also knows when he comes to the river of spirituality, and can tell what he wishes to cross, and whither he is going. He has not abandoned his un- dertaking, as did the Ephriamites, and turned back after setting his hand to the plow, but has steadily gone forward, regardless of all temptations and de- spite all opposition. \"He is of such tried courage that Death has no ter- rors for him, nor can the present and imminent threat of it deter him from his duty or induce him to betray a trust. His integrity is dearer to him than his life. For he knows that death is but a phantom, feared by ignorance, and to the wise man no more than the laying aside of one's garments when the hour for rest has come. \"In all this labor, the Master Mason has been clothed in innocence, as with a garment, the inno- cence of knowledge of the truth. He has scattered around him (and thereby increased) a love for all mankind, a toleration recognizing that each man has a right of his own opinions and that he who persecutes"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 169 for opinion's sake thereby usurps the prerogative of God. He has sympathized with the sorrows of all the world and done what he could to alleviate suffering. And he has learned to look with pitying sympathy upon diseases of the spirit and the intellect, as he would upon those of the body, with neither hatred nor anger, nor the desire to punish or persecute. Also, he has a profound Faith in God, which is in equilib- rium with his Intelligent Reason. \"Such a man will not be found seeking Masonic office, and will accept such office only as an invitation and opportunity to do more good; will not complain if the 'honors' of Masonry are given to another and not to him; will be self-controlled, courteous, consid- erate, sympathetic, and kind to all; will understand something of the true meaning of Masonic symbolism; and will be an exemplar of what is highest and best in humanity. \"Such a man may be justly called a Master Mason. Such a man is the owner in fee simple of a Spiritual Temple in that country where neither moth nor rust corrupts and where thieves do not break through and steal. \"Are there such men? There always have been, and always will be, thank God. By their fruits ye shall know them.\""},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Lion's Paw Series 171 CONCLUSION In the last chapter we gave you some idea of what a Master Mason is. Now I desire to quote you a poem written by that distinguished and celebrated Scottish poet and first Poet Laureate of Free-Masonry, who was born in Scotland on the 25th day of January, 1759, adjacent to the town of Ayr. He died on the 22nd day of January, 1796. He was an enthusiastic Mason and devoted himself to giving the Craft whole- some instruction. I need not speak of his poetry and literature for it is too well known throughout the world universal. He was a Past Master of his lodge in Scotland and he expected to leave his native home to go to Jamaica in consequence of which he wrote his farewell to one of his lodge brethren in the fol- lowing poetical lines. My reason for publishing the poem is to show you my dear Brothers, that in the latter part of the 18th century we were known as \"SONS OF LIGHT\" to the Masonic student and as I have shown in the body of the work that our revered Brother, the late Gen- eral Albert Pike loved to call all those who had been Duly and Truly prepared, and who were worthy and well qualified to be called a MASTER-MASON."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"172 The Lion's Paw Series Adieu; a heart-warm, found adieu; Dear Brothers of the Mystic Tie; Ye favour'd ye enlighten'd few, Companions of my social joy; Tho' I to foreign lands must hie, Pursuing Fortune's slidd'ry ba'; With melting heart and brimful eye I'll mind you still, tho' far awa.

And its progression rests upon the prec- tice of Morality. And the \"Living of a Life.\" It is founded on TRUTH or the great fundamental Law of EQUITY, JUSTICE and RIGHT which runs through all the manifestations and differentiations in the Kos- mos, from Atom to Man. Let me distinctly impress upon your mind that Masonry is a Teacher of Great Truths. It is the container of all the Wisdom that belonged to the learned men of every epoch of the World's history. It teaches to all Masonic students how to \"Live the Life\" in accord with the constructive Principle of Nature, which is Creative, Formative, Integrating, Developing, Organizing and Evolution- ary in its nature. It teaches every Masonic student who has been \"Duly and Truly Prepared\" how to de- velop all those Faculties, Capacities and Powers that lie dormant within the sanctuary of his own soul. A knowledge of which will enable him to \"Keep his First Promise and Live the Life.\" And do not forget that MASONRY is a most profound progressive scien- tific philosophy, whose basic principles are laid on the foundation of MORALITY. FREE-MASONRY is the practicing in his daily life what Masonry stands for and what it teaches. Free-Masonry is the \"Living of a Life\" in accord with the Constructive Principle of Nature.

Ma- sonry teaches that Man is not a mere Automaton. That man has a FREE-WILL. That man is a Free, Moral agent. That he can positively choose to be good and do good or evil if he may so desire. Because he knows that he has a Freedom of choice. He also knows that if he wants to die the death of the Righteous, he must \"LIVE THE LIFE.\" Therefore, from what I have said above you, my dear Brothers, must now re- alize the fact that a Free-Mason is one who practices and preaches what Masonry teaches and in so doing he follows the dictates of his own conscience.
