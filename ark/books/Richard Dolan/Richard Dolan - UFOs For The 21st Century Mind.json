I would like to thank my friend Kelly Weary, who in 2011 invited me toprepare an Introduction to Ufology course for the online InternationalMetaphysical University. The twelve lectures I created for that program formedthe foundation for this book, and Kelly was there throughout the creation ofthat lecture series, providing encouragement and much helpful conversationthroughout. Mike Clelland, Race Hobbes, Chase Kloetzke, Sam Maranto, Peter Robbins, andJennifer Stein. They are all my trusted friends, confidants, and professionalcolleagues. In addition to the many stimulating conversations I have had witheach of them about all matters ufological, they were careful readers of thismanuscript, whether in full or part, often providing helpful ideas for inclusionin this book. The late James Allen. During the summer of 2013, James and I had several longconversations about the science of UFO propulsion and related matters. Duringthat time, in addition to the valuable research tips he provided, we developed agenuine friendship. His unexpected death later that year was heartbreaking tome, and I shall miss him. My Rochester friends, Jason Mombert and Chuck Harrison, who listened to me sooften discussing the progress of this book, and who provided much neededcompanionship during a tumultuous year. Dr. Hal Puthoff, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Austin, who read thismanuscript carefully and, as always, provided me with invaluable commentary. Catherine Austin Fitts, who carefully read over key passages concerning blackbudget and financial corruption issues, and offered several importantsuggestions which I incorporated into the text. George Noory, host of Coast to Coast AM, who graciously offered to write theForeword to this book, and for which I will always be thankful. I alsoappreciate the support of George’s producer, my good friend Tom Danheiser. I was very fortunate to have a number of careful editors and proofreaders ofthis book. Foremost among these were Holly Kennedy, Anne Meisingset, Dr. JoeBuchman, and Debra Dalock. It is impossible to overstate how much I owe thesepeople. Each of them looked over my manuscript carefully, each of them providedunique insights, commentary, suggestions, and corrections. In particular, I owea special thanks to Joe and Debbie, who during the final stages of themanuscript attended their task with a near fanatical attention to detail and anunerring eye for the interests of the reader. Their impeccable proofreading,fact-checking, and consultation made this a measurably better book. Finally, my friend, Michelle Montany. More than anyone else, she was therefor me during this entire project. Her dedicated friendship, to say nothing ofher insightful commentary, were of greater help to me than any author has aright to expect. On top of all that, she conceived of this book’s coverillustration, and then painstakingly created it. It's the best cover I couldhave imagined. No—better than I could have imagined. Thank you, Michelle. Idoubt I can ever express to you the full extent of my gratitude. Beyond these people, there are countless others who have given me theirfriendship and advice. I can never list all of them, there are simply too many.I want all of them to know, however, that they have my undying thanks. Despite the substantial help and support I have received from such wonderfulfriends, all limitations, oversights, and errors of this book are myresponsibility alone. Richard M. DolanRochester, New YorkJanuary 2014 Forewordby George Noory I will never forget the excitement I felt as a boy when reading a book givento me by my mother: We Are Not Alone, by Walter Sullivan, the great sciencewriter for the New York Times. What an eye-opening book it was for me to learnSullivan's theories about how the universe was teeming with life, about howhumanity was probably just one tiny part of the vast ocean of activity thatfilled our cosmos. Not long after that, I read an article in Look magazine aboutthe famous UFO abductees, Betty and Barney Hill. After that, I was hooked. All Iwanted to do was go into broadcasting and interview experts on these fascinatingsubjects and learn everything I could possibly learn about the great mysteriesof our world. So there has never been a question in my mind that UFOs are real, that theymean something important, and that their existence means that other intelligentbeings are interested in humanity and this beautiful planet we live on.Throughout the many paths of my life, I never lost that interest, thatcuriosity. I kept it during my years as Executive Producer at WJBK-TV inDetroit, and also during my years in the U.S. Naval Reserve. In 1996, I beganhosting the late night program, Nighthawk, on KTRS radio in St. Louis, and wasable to fulfill my dream of talking to knowledgeable people about ideas andpossibilities that exist at the outer edges of our reality. Since then, as host of Coast to Coast AM, I have been incredibly fortunate tobe part of a growing family of over 500 affiliates around the world that bringsthe best of the best from so many subjects to millions of listeners every night.Having the opportunity to talk to such amazing guests has been an education forme. We discuss and analyze just about everything that matters in our worldtoday, whether it's current events, consumer rights, economics, newtechnologies, cutting-edge physics, mysteries in space, spirituality,prophecies, consciousness, conspiracies, or the New World Order. And of course, UFOs, a subject that continues to fascinate me. However, in afield that is so complex and mysterious, it's easy to feel like you are lost ina maze. In the first place, there are simply so many aspects to it. Not only arethere thousands upon thousands of UFO sightings of the past, but more bafflingsightings happen every day. Then there are claims of alien abduction and evenimplants, without a doubt one of the most intriguing parts of the phenomenon.Beyond this, there are countless scientific questions connected to the subject,whether you are interested in antigravity, or space travel, or multipledimensions, or time travel. It's all riveting, but there is simply so much todigest. But UFOs can be challenging for another reason. That's because there is alot of bad information out there mixed in with the good research. You know thereis something very important going on, but you can't always feel confident thatyou are getting reliable information. That is one reason I have always appreciated Richard Dolan. I first metRichard in 2001 when he was my guest on KTRS. Right away, I could see that hewas someone who was destined to make an impression in the field of UFO research.Over the years, he has been a frequent guest of mine on Coast to Coast AM, atrue no-nonsense researcher and author who probes the government's relationshipto UFOs: what it knows, what it's hiding. He always comes to the table withengaging conversation and thoughtful insights on UFOs, cover-ups, and theimportant matter of Disclosure—that is, if or when the government reveals thetruth about UFOs. The thing that comes through time and again about Richard isthat he does his homework and is one of the most committed people I know in thefield. I consider him a bulldog in search of the truth, someone who won't stopuntil he reaches his destination. In our interviews, we have discussed the themes of his previous books, histwo volumes of history, UFOs and the National Security State, probably the mostcomprehensive and reliable guides to the modern history of UFOs. That is how weall got to know him. Then he did something quite different: he peered into thefuture by writing A.D. After Disclosure, looking ahead at a world in which UFOsecrecy were to end. So many questions come to mind. Can Disclosure ever reallyhappen? How might it change our world? What happens to our politics, economy,and society? Will we ever have genuine contact with extraterrestrials? Richardtook on these questions and helped to open up an entire new area of study forthe rest of us. Now he has done something new once again with this book, UFOs for the 21stCentury Mind. In a field that can be so confusing, so complex, he has taken hismany years of thinking about UFOs and written a completely fresh overview of theentire subject. While I read this book, it became obvious to me that somethinglike this has been long overdue. Many of the topics in here are ones I've discussed with him previously: thehistory, the politics, the cover-up, Disclosure. All of these are handled withthe insight, depth of research, and passion for truth that I have come to expectfrom him. Even so, much in here is new, including several incredible UFOsightings that have never appeared anywhere else, along with a deep analysis ofjust how the UFO cover-up has damaged the civil liberties of people around theworld. But what jumps out about this book is that it is covers so much more eventhan this, everything from ancient aliens, to abduction, to channeling, andthoughts on who or what these other beings might be. There is also a lot offresh thinking about just what UFOs are. After all, how do we separate genuineUFO encounters from sightings of modern drones and other off-the-shelvetechnologies used by ordinary people? One of the most fascinating parts of this book are the many ways that UFOschallenge our scientific paradigms. From something as simple as propulsiontechnology (how do these objects travel the way they do?) to space-time, todimensions, entanglement, and consciousness—all of these are handled clearly andevenly by Richard, doing justice to difficult subjects in a way that is simplyriveting. This is an ambitious work that truly ties the many different aspects of theUFO subject together. It's rare to find something like this, especiallyconsidering the care and thoroughness that went into it. We are at a time in history when each and every one of us has got to stand upand fight for truth the best way we can. Because if we don't, those people whohave their own agenda on this planet are going to win. We need reliableinformation that makes sense of our world, that energizes us to keep going andfight on the side of the angels. We will need courage and persistence, but withtruth on our side, I believe we will win in the end. George NooryLos Angeles, CaliforniaJanuary 2014 Introduction As long as we have had eyes, we have observed inexplicable wonders in theskies, in the oceans, and all around us. Finally, during the last fewgenerations, we have sat up and noticed. Now we face the most impenetrable ofmysteries. It is not merely that unidentified flying objects have been traversing ourworld. Nor that they do things that are supposed to be impossible. Nor that theylook unlike any known aircraft, or that they seem to violate the principles ofaerodynamics. All of this has been and is true, and all of it is certainly aproblem. But the problem goes deeper. After all these years, we still don’t know who precisely is operating theseobjects. We may have ideas, but in fact we don’t know. More puzzling still isthe logic of their behavior. Why buzz our aircraft? Why play cat and mousegames? Why the bizarre (apparent) interactions with people around the world? Weare dealing with an unknown phenomenon that behaves inexplicably, and apparentlydoes not want to reveal itself to us. It is easy for a person to go through life without thinking about any ofthis. We have other priorities, and the official powers of our society dismissthe topic. Even most of the anti-establishment, alternative researchers knowthis topic is a third rail: touch it at your peril. It’s not from a lack ofcuriosity. I’ve spoken with many of these researchers. Most of them arefascinated by UFOs but fear the ridicule. You can only fight so many battles—whywear yet another albatross that only makes your life more difficult? It is hardenough to research things like government spying, financial corruption, 9/11conspiracies, chemtrails, or many other important subjects that require ourattention. For my part, I have spent the last twenty years researching UFOs. In thattime, I have found that this phenomenon intersects with many of the abovesubjects. In fact, I would go further and say that a proper study of UFOs is arevolutionary experience. It shatters old belief systems and forces us to lookat our world in a completely new way. Everything is affected: history, politics,economics, science, religion, culture, and our ultimate vision of who and whatwe are as human beings. Yet, looking back on the history of UFO research, it turns out thatsurprisingly little work has been done to describe the big picture. There havebeen many good books written, for sure. Many have focused on key sightings thathave defied our understanding. Others have discussed military and governmentpolicy on UFOs. Several have focused on abductions and other forms of contactwith these other beings. Others still have described different scientificaspects of the phenomenon. There are also a smaller number of books that dealwith the challenges of investigating UFOs, certainly an important topic. Onlythe smallest handful have ever tried to be anything like a comprehensive guide,and none have really pulled it off. Talk about a gaping hole in the field. Even worse, much of the earlier thinking on the subject feels antiquated. Upuntil roughly the end of the Cold War, that is around 1990 or so, the field wasstill something of an old boys club. A lot of good work was done but, ingeneral, less was known or appreciated about the phenomenon itself. Archivalresearch was rudimentary, as was overall historical knowledge. There was scantfamiliarity with worldwide sightings, little appreciation of abductions untilnearly 1980, and a number of sciences connected to UFOs were a completemystery—propulsion technology being one obvious example of many. Cultural beliefs of earlier decades didn’t help, either. Political insightswere naive, with a strong dose of old-fashioned patriotism and trust ingovernment, and a belief that government secrets could not be kept for verylong. Scientific attitudes were equally conservative. The dominant approach was“nuts and bolts” ufology, rather like Victorian materialism that denied (orignored) the truly strange sciences of quantum mechanics, entanglement, andnon-locality, all of which now seem relevant to UFOs. Since the 1990s, however, the field has exploded. Many more people fromaround the world are now engaged in it, with a greater diversity of beliefs andphilosophies. Ufology is now a wide-open ball game, replete with generationaldivides, cultural wars, new ideas, new arguments, and little agreement as topriorities. This trend strengthened after 9/11, an event that radicalized manypeople around the world into permanent suspicion against global politicalelites, and certainly against the U.S. national security state. The people are different, the attitudes are different, and so is ourtechnology, which has buried us in data. Prior to the 1990s, simply gettingaccess to good UFO reports was a problem that nearly every researcher faced.Today, we can sift through more than ten thousand raw reports that are filedonline every year in North America alone. Added to this overabundance arehundreds of new UFO videos posted each year to YouTube. And then there arethousands more stories and rumors that come our way via social networking siteslike Facebook and Twitter. In other words, ufology is splintered andoverwhelmed. What we need is an up-to-date assessment of where we are in this incrediblefield. That is why I wrote this book. This is a comprehensive overview of theUFO phenomenon for people of the 21st century. It offers up-to-date information and analysis relating to the full history ofUFOs, from ancient times to our own era. This alone is an incredibly rich aspectof the phenomenon, and the sheer quantity of good reports is astonishing. Tryingto make sense of it all leads us to wonder if humanity has been someone’s petproject for quite some time. However, it also appears that activity has beenheating up considerably for the past several decades. Does this mean we are onthe brink of something big? There is much more than history for us to consider, however. There areimportant political issues, such as the relationship of the U.S. government andmilitary/intelligence community to UFOs. That is, the cover-up. In analyzingthis, we find that UFOs pose a serious problem to that community, one that itsmembers may not be handling as well as they would like. It also strongly appearsthat at least some of the UFOs people are seeing are made by us as opposed tothem. Moreover, we find that the suppression of open, public information aboutUFOs has created serious distortions in our political culture and our economics.A key factor here has been the creation of an expansive national securityapparatus and black-budget society, a portion of which was created to hide theUFO reality. This apparatus has taken over much of what remains of traditionalrepublican institutions around the world, certainly within the United States. But there is more to a full understanding of UFOs than history and politics.The subject raises important philosophical and investigative issues, includinghow ordinary objects and events might fool us, and how they differ from “trueUFOs.” Moreover, in an age of Google, Facebook, and Youtube, when informationpractically overwhelms us, we might want to know how to separate fact fromfiction, and legitimate issues from fear-mongering or fantasy-peddling. Then there are issues pertaining to science and technology. To the extentthat these objects are craft, how do they operate? How might interstellar travelbe possible? How is it that these beings often seem to have a mind-to-mindcommunication with us? What does that mean about human consciousness? What can astudy of UFOs teach us about physics, dimensions, and the structure of ourreality? Nor must we forget the beings behind the phenomenon, whoever and whateverthey are. In understanding UFOs, it is crucial that we assess the history andclaims of contact, that we try to understand the nature of that contact, andperhaps puzzle out just who and what we are dealing with. There is a great dealof information from individuals who appear to have had interactions with some ofthese beings, as incredible as that may sound. Finally, to understand the UFO phenomenon with a fresh perspective, we oughtto try peering into the future. That includes what has become a pervasive topicin the field: whether or not there will be, or can be, any kind of true“Disclosure” of the UFO reality. That is, an official recognition, one thatincludes government and all the associated institutions that dominate our world.Because this can only be speculative by its very nature, we need to be carefulin forming our judgments. Yet, the matter is important enough that it demandsour attention, since we are fools if we assume that tomorrow will be the same astoday. Our civilization is rapidly changing, and with it our once-solid beliefsof what is possible and what is not. It seems likely that Disclosure, whether bydesign, accident, or necessity, will be the ultimate revolutionary experience. Any subject that provokes so many profound ideas and can take us to so manyamazing destinations is worthy of our time and consideration. But we should notexpect easy answers. I first entered the field of ufology after having studiedhistory for many years, in particular U.S. diplomacy and modern Europe. When Iinitially became intrigued by UFOs during the early 1990s, I thought I might beable to take a detour of a few months to find out once and for all if there wasanything to it. I discovered that there was indeed something to it, and I havespent the last twenty years exploring a field that has never once released itsgrip on me. Several times, it has prompted me to reevaluate the world and myplace in it. Recall in The Matrix, when Morpheus offers Neo the choice of a red pill orblue pill. The blue pill allows him to return to his ordinary conventionalworld, while the red pill offers him truth. If only it were so easy: one simplered pill and all is revealed. In reality, we must take red pills on a regularbasis, since the illusions of our world are in many layers. We realize somethingnew, something important, and that gives us clarity for a little while. Soon wenotice other oddities and discrepancies, and we realize we need to go further.And so it goes. Ufology offers a perfect example of such complexity. I started out years agowith one simple question. It was not are UFOs real? or are aliens real? I wantedto know something even more basic: were UFOs ever important to the U.S. nationalsecurity community? One simple question with one simple answer (yes). However,that simple answer led to countless more questions. I still do not have all theanswers I am looking for, and probably never will. But that is no reason fordespair, for this is a subject in which it can truly be said that the journey isthe reward. I now invite you to take that journey with me. Chapter 1What Are UFOs? In the twenty years I have studied UFOs, I have been smacked around, kickeddown, and wrestled to the ground by some of the most amazing and perplexingmysteries you can imagine. That’s been satisfying enough, but what has made iteven better is knowing that so many people like to look down their noses at thistopic. After all, UFOs are supposed to be something for fanciful minds. Ofcourse, that certainly isn’t the case, but that feeling of studying somethingalmost, shall we say forbidden, makes this subject fascinating and naughty atthe same time. What can be better than that? Make no mistake, it is a bizarre phenomenon. It is worth remembering thatmost reports of UFOs are explainable in prosaic terms. Still, it is also truethat, no matter how hard even the best analysts try, certain reports defy aneasy explanation. Some of these things appear to be somebody’s technology, doingthings that are supposed to be impossible. To whom they belong is one of themagic questions. But first I think it will be helpful to examine what constitutes evidence andproof when we talk about UFOs. This is trickier than you might think. Whatexactly would constitute proof that UFOs are real and, in some way, alien? Assuming there is reasonable evidence to support the belief that some UFOsare indeed “alien,” or something “not us” (which is my position), we cancontemplate another tricky issue. That is, who and what they are, or, morerealistically, who and what they might be. There are several interestingpossibilities. Then, I would like to open a discussion that will recur throughout this book.This concerns the many potential implications of the UFO phenomenon itself,especially as they relate to our global cultures and social organization. Afterall, what would happen to world politics if the President of the United Stateswere to state officially that UFOs are real? How would such knowledge affect oureconomics, religion, spiritual beliefs, science, and culture? What would happenif there were ever open contact between us and … them? The UFO phenomenon is not simply a fun, diversionary topic. It is notsomething to dabble with during moments of boredom. It is mind-bending andreality-shattering. What are UFOs? Wherever you travel, no matter the country or culture, you would behard-pressed to find someone who has not heard of UFOs. The term is recognizedaround the world. It is, in fact, a worldwide brand. There is a good reason for this. All you need to do is ask around a bit, andyou will find many people with their own UFO story. Often it is their ownpersonal sighting, and sometimes multiple sightings. Sometimes it concerns adramatic story told to them by a family member, often with no one else in theroom. Every now and then, a military retiree, perhaps a father, mother, uncle,or grandparent will whisper such an account. Those stories, too, are out there,many of them. Consider the following scenario. You are outside on a large front lawn after a nice dinner, relaxing with fiveof your friends, all adults and professionals. It is around 7 p.m., toward theend of a beautiful spring day. The sky is still light, and you are all enjoyingthe picturesque scene. Then, to everyone’s great surprise, an enormous, roundcraft approaches from the horizon. It is moving slowly, perhaps thirty or fortymiles per hour. White lights are visible at its outer edges and it is rotatingslowly in a counter-clockwise direction. What is truly astonishing, however, isthe object’s immense size. Your best estimate is that it is perhaps one thousandfeet wide, more than three football fields. Unfortunately, the sunlight makes ithard to notice most of the details of this gargantuan object. Then, as itappears over you, it stops. Perhaps it noticed you, you wonder. From here, your experience becomes even more incredible, more impossible. Youwatch, dumbfounded, as this giant in the sky splits into four smaller,wedge-shaped, craft. You wonder, how can this be? Then, almost instantaneously,the four objects zoom away to the North, South, East, and West. Almost asbaffling is the silence, because throughout this amazing encounter, no one hasheard a sound coming from this aerial display. The event is so shocking to youand your friends that, for many years after, none of you ever speak about it,not even among yourselves. This event occurred in the town of Hydes, Maryland, on May 15, 1976. Notuntil 1999, however—twenty three years later—was it was reported anywhere, inthis case to the National UFO Reporting Center, on the Web. This type of sighting is extraordinary, inexplicable, and utterlycommonplace. UFO reports include many examples of craft that are silent, divideinto smaller segments, and zip away noiselessly at amazing speeds. Theseseemingly impossible reports come not only from ordinary people, but also frommilitary personnel, and like those from the military, silence is usually therule for civilians when it comes to UFO reports. Military personnel have theirsecrecy protocols, of course, but trauma and fear of ridicule usually serve wellenough to keep most people quiet. However you try to interpret the phenomenon, every indication points to thenumber of UFO witnesses reaching not into the thousands, but well into themillions. Whether you consider UFOs to be nonsense or of great importance,people are seeing things that are affecting them deeply. Because there are noinstitutional structures for them to report or discuss what they see, they oftenkeep silent, and try to forget or only secretly cherish one of the mostincredible experiences of their lives. Getting Technical When we think of UFOs the natural instinct is to connect them withextraterrestrials. That is, beings from another part of the universe who havecome here to Earth. There are some good reasons for this, which we will explorein a short while. But, if you want to get technical (and who doesn’t want to gettechnical) all UFO means is “unidentified flying object.” That could be just about anything. Some people are surprised to learn that about ninety percent of all UFOreports can be and have been explained. The former Harvard astronomer, DonaldMenzel, once compiled a List of Things Mistaken for UFOs, and it is quitethorough.[1] [index_split_006.html#filepos1182635] Menzel claimed to believethat no UFO was ever an alien craft, and in fact was the world’s leadingdebunker during the 1950s and 1960s. While he certainly had his biases, his listremains relevant, as long as we do some updating for our own era. Menzel divided the causes of UFO sightings into different categories:Material Objects, Immaterial Objects, Astronomical, Physiological,Psychological, Photographic Records, Radar, Hoaxes, and various combinations ofthese. Within each category he made further distinctions. Among “MaterialObjects,” for instance, he included meteors, re-entering satellites, rocketlaunchings, blimps, balloons, aircraft and aircraft lights, clouds, contrails,military test craft or experiments, magnesium flares, migrating birds, paper anddebris, kites, leaves, insect swarms, fireworks, dust devils, elevatedstreetlights, window reflections, or lights from cars, beacons, and lighthouses. These were just a few of them. Certainly, some of the items are far-fetched.We are entitled to wonder how many people would be dumb enough to mistake aninsect swarm for a UFO. Still, it does happen that people can be fooled by manythings. It can happen to anyone, and it could happen to you. Today, there are other items we can add to Menzel’s List of Material Objects.Most important, it seems, are the many, increasingly sophisticated, objects thatpeople are putting into the air. Starting with the military contribution, moreand more craft of great sophistication are flying about, a few of which (such asNorthrop Grumman’s X-47 drone), look like a classic flying saucer when seen fromcertain perspectives. Some drones have an ability to hover for very long periodsof time, and many do not look anything like ordinary aircraft. But it is notjust the military technology that causes false UFO reports. Ordinary people arebetter able than ever to set aloft objects that may look like UFOs, but areanything from candle-lit Chinese lanterns to remotely-controlled craft with LEDlights or other video effects attached to them. Appearances can be deceiving,although there are still no known cases of human created craft that caninstantly accelerate from a hovering position, especially without a sound. So,if you witness something like that, you might want to make a note of it.[images/00046.jpg]The U.S. Navy’s X-47B, built by Northrop Grumman, a pilotless drone with thesize and performance of many piloted fighter aircraft. For Menzel material objects were only one cause of UFO reports, but othercauses were non-material. These included atmospheric phenomena such as theaurora borealis, noctilucent clouds (that is, very high clouds that sometimesshine brightly at twilight) and other phenomena such as sundogs, moondogs,paraselene (a reflection of ice crystals in clouds under the moonlight),reflections from fog and mist, and more. Then there are astronomical causes. The Planet Venus may be the cliché go-toexplanation for UFO debunkers, but it became one for a reason: it is quitebright and has fooled people for years into thinking they were seeing an unknowncraft. Besides Venus, there are other astronomical causes of UFO sightings:artificial satellites, comets, Jupiter and Mars (which can be quite bright inthe night sky at times) and, incredibly, the Moon. Stars have deceived people. Earth’s atmosphere can play tricks with our eyes.When slow-moving clouds enter the mix, it can seem as though a star is changingcolor and darting around the sky. I saw this effect myself, rather dramatically.Beneath a clear and dark desert sky, I noticed a light that seemed to be jumpingto different points. Only when I positioned a video recorder on the roof of mycar (to prevent camera shake), did I see that it was not moving in the least. Asubsequent check with astronomy software proved that it had been a bright star. As that example shows, sometimes we are deceived not so much by the objectsthemselves as by our own senses. Our bodies are instruments, and instruments canmake mistakes. It happens to everyone—we see things that simply are not there.For this, too, Menzel compiled a list (which he clearly enjoyed doing). Forexample, he realized that any bright source, such as the Sun, the Moon, streetlights, headlights, the flash of a camera, or many other things, creates an“after-image.” If you are not thinking consciously of it, such after-images canfool you into thinking you are seeing strange lights in the sky. Other problemscan simply come from poor eyesight, reflections from eyeglasses, and so on. And not simply the eyes. Our very minds can create the illusion of somethingbeing there that is not. This can simply be a matter of poor or incompleteobservation, preconceived ideas about the object itself, or a genuinepsychological disturbance. To be sure, mistakes of the human mind have causedtheir share of UFO reports. Technology can also lie. We are inundated with photographs of UFOs that arenot UFOs. Even in Menzel's day, pictures could lie, whether from internal camerareflections to defects during the photo development process to crude fakery.Today, we have PhotoShop, AfterEffects, and many other software packages forimage and video editing. Indeed, it is still possible for experts to analyzedigital evidence for authenticity, but it can be very difficult, and meanwhilewe are drowning in a flood of such evidence and claims. Photos and videos musttherefore be of limited value as evidence. No matter how genuine they may be,the hundreds of UFO photographs and videos that appear each year will not beconsidered strong evidence without something else to support them. For starters,something like corroborating witness testimony, with multiple witnesses beingmuch better than one. Then we have radar, which is certainly a reliable and important tool formanaging air traffic. Even so, radar instrumentation can be subject to illusionsand effects, such as anomalous refraction, scattering, ghost images, multiplereflections, and more. Granted, the professionals in the field are usuallyfamiliar enough with these effects that they do not pose great problems, butradar is not infallible. Finally, let us not forget that there are always people who enjoy a goodprank. When it comes to any alleged UFO sighting, we must always consider thepossibility of a hoax. It has happened many times. And Yet … Still, when we review the thousands upon thousands of UFO reports that havebeen filed, we begin to see something. After running them through the bestfilters we can, after considering all prosaic explanations, there have alwaysbeen a certain number that remain truly inexplicable. Different sources have given different figures for the percentage of thetruly inexplicable. Some have argued five percent or even lower; others havegone higher than twenty percent. Generally speaking, ten percent appears to bethe most typical, and is probably the most realistic. We should remember thatsome databases, such as the old Project Blue Book, run by the U.S. Air Forceduring the 1950s and 1960s, at times used questionable and even dishonestmethods to “solve” some of their cases. The Air Force was more concerned withsolving UFO cases politically than in any scientific sense. UFOs had to be putto sleep, at least as far as the public was concerned. This meant that anyexplanation, including the most ridiculous, could be used to explain otherwiseinexplicable cases. As a result, Blue Book’s final percentage of unsolved cases(six percent), is almost certainly underestimated. For the past few decades, the largest database of investigated UFO reports isprobably that of the Mutual UFO Network. MUFON’s database includes manythousands of reports, and the organization generally arrives at an unsolvedpercentage of roughly ten percent.[2] [index_split_006.html#filepos1183091] There has always been a remainder, a residue, of UFO cases, that are of suchdetail, backed by credible witnesses and instrumentation, that there seems to beno reasonable explanation for them. These are the true UFOs, the heart of themystery. This is where the real debate takes place. How do we interpret these cases?Some investigators have concluded: “it's real and someone is here.” Othersremain confident that there are explanations for these cases that may prove tobe scientifically interesting, but which are not evidence of alien visitation.But even this only takes us into the shallow waters. From here, matters gettrickier still. Most UFO skeptics do concede that there are some reports of extraordinaryaerial objects that we might call UFOs, but that is no reason to assume theseare alien. There are, after all, many deeply secret black budget technologiesand projects, and not all of them even American. Especially today, in a worldthat now has a few drones that look like flying saucers, it might seem that anyso-called UFO is probably something manufactured on Earth. Of course, when we talk about UFOs—true UFOs[3][index_split_006.html#filepos1184473]—we think of aliens. The real question is,are there true UFOs? Are we, the inhabitants of Planet Earth, being visited bybeings that are from some other place? Rather than trying to answer that question definitively, let us ease into it.As we shall see, there is much to consider, both pro and con. Having thought about this problem for twenty years, my personal suggestion isthat, whatever position you the reader may have, be prepared to modify it. Thereis much more of interest about UFOs than simply answering the question, “do theyreally exist, or not?” The depth and nuance of the phenomenon is beyond that ofmost other fields of study. What Can UFOs Be? One way to start would be to ask, what might UFOs be? The answer turns out tobe: many things. During the 1960s a remarkable student of this subject, a scientist and writernamed Ivan Sanderson, explored that very question, and even developed a six-pageoutline of the possibilities.[4] [index_split_006.html#filepos1184705] Thus,UFOs could be inanimate or animate. If inanimate, they might be natural orartificial, each possibility with several subsets. If animate, they could alsobe natural or artificial. If natural, they might be solid (like meteorites),non-solid (gaseous, as in clouds), or non-material (energy packets, as inbolides). If artificial, they could be self-contained items (such as artificialsatellites), transports (like freighters), manned devices (like airplanes),auxiliary devices (like space probes), or missiles (like bullets and ICBMs). But Sanderson was nothing if not imaginative. UFOs might also be alive, hepostulated. After all, why not? If so, just as with inanimate objects, theymight be natural or artificial. Natural animate objects could include life-formsindigenous to space, or indigenous to atmospheres, or to solid bodies.Artificial life forms could be natural life forms that were domesticated oraltered, genetically created life-forms, or biochemically created life-forms. Sanderson pointed out that natural UFOs (he called them Unexplained AerialObjects, or UAOs) are of little interest to our investigation. Natural phenomena(such as meteors, unusual clouds, ball lightning, temperature inversions,mirages, or swamp gas) may be interesting scientifically, but not especially tothose of us looking for true UFOs. The second category of inanimate objects, however—those classified asartificial—are much more interesting, and closer to our idea of true UFOs. Thevery idea of unknown objects being manufactured means that some life-form wasinvolved in creating them. We know that some of these unknown objects over theyears have been manufactured by our own black-budget programs using technologiesthat were well ahead of those available in the commercial world. But could someUFOs be manufactured technology made by Others? In Sanderson’s view, the answerwas obvious: of course! But Sanderson went beyond these conventional notions. More intriguing stillare UFOs that may be animate. That is, alive. We normally do not think of UFOslike that, but the idea has arisen from time to time over the years. Sanderson,a biologist by training, gave it serious consideration. “Life, and especiallyintelligent life,” he wrote, “is, to the mechanistic world, an oddity; in someways an anachronism, and in many ways a pest.” For him it was obvious that theuniverse, with a potentially infinite level of complexity and variety, couldeasily produce life forms that would stagger our imaginations. So, yes, he argued, it was entirely possible that UFOs were living,intelligent life forms, or (to put it another way) intelligent machines, bothorganic and inorganic. That is, with blood or with circuits. Sanderson wasnothing if not ahead of his time. Consider this passage he wrote in themid-1960s:> The very idea of an animated machine or of a mechanical animal is impossible> to conceive by the average person. When the average person is asked to> contemplate ‘life,’ he immediately thinks of an animal …. The variety of> life-forms found even on this, our own, tiny, insignificant planet is so great> that mere contemplation of some of them is almost more than a biologist can> stand. What forms life could take elsewhere is quite beyond the grasp of our> materialist outlook, because their variety is probably infinite. Sanderson is engaging because he opens our minds to possibilities we mightnormally discount, not because of logic, but simply because most of us had notyet thought of them. UFOs and the Problem of Science Considering the possibilities is fascinating, but UFOs are a hard nut tocrack. We naturally want that magic bullet we call proof to resolve, beyond anydoubt, that they are real and to learn what they are. Proof is the eternal ufological quest. But what is it? What would constituteproof? This is a harder problem than most people think. If you saw a large,spherical object descend silently, hover, and instantly accelerate to the edgeof the horizon within a second or two, you would probably be convinced that,yes, you just saw a real UFO. But how would you convince others of this fact?How could you prove it? Consider some tricky issues regarding UFOs and the scientific method. In the first place, a genuine scientific investigation demands repeatability,either of observation or result. There are also certain assumptions connectedwith the scientific method. One is that the scientist has some form of controlover the phenomenon under study, and that it will perform in some way that isconsistent or can be predicted. However, what if UFOs were under the control of another intelligence, onemore advanced than our own? If there were a superior intelligence operating onEarth, we might wonder whether science, as we practice it, can be of much help.What proof of them would appear, except as they might desire? That is challenging enough. But suppose also that we are dealing with animportant national security issue? Naturally, I will be returning to this idealater in this book, but for now let us suppose that this is so. In that case,this vexing scientific problem would further be hampered by secrecy protocols,censorship, and even disinformation from agencies charged with protecting whatwould arguably be the most important secret in the world. Those would be formidable obstacles, but there are others. Consider howscience is conducted today. It is easy for us to slip into outdated ideas aboutscience. Many of us stay stuck to the ideals we learned in our youth. Meanwhile,reality races ahead. Science, we were taught in school, is the bastion and foundation ofintellectual freedom in the world. It is an independent search for truth, andthe destroyer of social and religious myths. But how independent is science, really? In whose interest is it practicedtoday? This is no idle question, for gone are the days of scientists followingtheir intellectual passions in a search for truth. One of the pioneers inenvironmental science, James Lovelock, put it this way:> Nearly all scientists are employed by some large organization, such as a> governmental department, a university, or a multinational company. Only rarely> are they free to express their science as a personal view. They may think that> they are free, but in reality they are, nearly all of them, employees; they> have traded freedom of thought for good working conditions, a steady income,> tenure, and a pension.[5] [index_split_006.html#filepos1184995] The observation is so obvious, and yet we sometimes forget it too easily. Infairness, science is an expensive business. To do it well, you need money, whichmeans sponsorship. And when someone else is paying the bills, they make therules. Few are the scientists who receive a blank check to do their work. Andwho writes the checks? In most nations, it is usually either private industry ora government defense agency. Certainly this is so in the U.S., where, since theSecond World War, the military has been the largest sponsor of scientificresearch. But if the military and intelligence communities have had a strong interestin the UFO phenomenon, and deeply classified the subject, we would certainlyhave a situation in which government public funds for UFO research would beabsent, but in which black budget, classified dollars would flow more freely.This, of course, has been the claim among several researchers, includingmyself.[6] [index_split_006.html#filepos1185296] If there is no public fundingfor scientific research on UFOs, then few if any scientists will give it anyconsideration. They would have nothing to gain and everything to lose for theirefforts. The result is widespread ignorance by most scientists of even thebasics of the UFO phenomenon. Those who study outside the black world generallyuse their own personal funds and do so privately and quietly. Overlapping the world of science are the colleges and universities, where thesituation is the same. From a UFO researcher’s perspective, it would be great ifresearch could be conducted in the universities. Unfortunately, the subject isalmost wholly off-limits there. Like the world of science, the academic world isan intellectual bureaucracy with an established hierarchy. A young graduatestudent with an interest in UFOs can not safely explore it within thatenvironment except, perhaps, as a debunker. Even finding a qualified researchsupervisor would be daunting, since a cycle of ignorance has been longestablished. As a result, most of the contributions to our understanding of UFOshave come from outside the academic and scientific communities, at least withinthe United States. Let us strip away our illusions. At every level, from the bottom up,intellectual freedom is a chimera in our world of so-called education. A centuryago, Bertrand Russell commented on public schools as conformity factories(“What's the difference between a bright, inquisitive five-year-old, and a dull,stupid nineteen-year-old? Fourteen years of the British educational system.”)Today, American educator John Taylor Gatto speaks eloquently about this problem.> I've noticed a fascinating phenomenon in my thirty years of teaching: schools> and schooling are increasingly irrelevant to the great enterprises of the> planet. No one believes anymore that scientists are trained in science classes> or politicians in civics classes or poets in English classes. The truth is> that schools don't really teach anything except how to obey orders.[7]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1185781] All of which is to say: do not expect breakthroughs in UFO studies to comefrom the formal educational system. Having said that, I have sometimes wondered,if UFOs were to be studied within higher education, how would it even be done?Where? There is no simple answer. Certainly the Department of History is onelogical place. Clearly, however, there is more to the study of UFOs thanhistory. Analysis of UFO data can take one into far ranging areas, from theliberal arts into the hardest of hard sciences. It would be interesting tospeculate how ufology would be structured within a university setting: would itbe considered a subset of one of the established fields of study, or would itreceive its own department and funding? Taking all this into account, we can get a sense of how difficult it could beto establish a formal scientific study of the UFO phenomenon, something thatwould be more than a low-budget effort by interested amateurs. Yet, even considering the stark limitations imposed by having essentially nomoney to work with, ufologists have obtained reasonable proof for the reality ofa genuine phenomenon: of an intelligent something that has been operating in theskies, oceans, and lower orbit of our world. Something that is not supposed toexist, but does. In other words, although we may find ourselves outmatched bywhat seems to be a superior intelligence, our scientific tools have enabled usto 'capture' it, so to speak. More on this later. Who Decides What is Proof? There is another matter to be considered regarding science and UFOs: whodecides what is proof? The problem seems like a scientific one, but upon closeranalysis we see it is almost entirely political. Clearly, it is of great importance. Even on topics less controversial thanUFOs, the court of science can be slow-moving, confusing, messy, andunsatisfying. Egos and arguments pervade. Consider the arguments over suchpolitically charged issues as climate change or genetically modified foods.Scientists line up on either side of a huge divide, hurling conflicting data andaccusations at the other side. Meanwhile, people look on and wonder how to makeup their own minds, and whether public policies relating to these issues are intheir interest. Regarding UFOs, the combination of its bizarre complexity and the nationalsecurity obfuscation enveloping it have made the problem knottier still. In thefirst place, officially speaking, there is no true UFO phenomenon, the biggesthurdle to an intelligent, open debate. But still, we feel instinctively, theremust be a final arbiter, a judge to lay the gavel down and decide. In the past,one such arbiter was the so-called Condon Committee, an Air Force sponsoredscientific study based out of the University of Colorado, which in early 1969released its conclusion that UFOs were not a problem worthy of furtherscientific effort. Except that as we study the workings of that committee, wefind it was an intensely political situation, and one in which the conclusionwas foregone from the beginning, all for political reasons.[8][index_split_006.html#filepos1186115] In an era in which the scientific establishment has worked so closely for solong with the military and intelligence community, in which government fundingdominates every important research decision, in which the heads of keyscientific government organizations have close personal relationships with theheads of political and military institutions, how can the political be extractedfrom the scientific? The answer is: it cannot. Implications: What if They are Real? If UFOs are real, in the sense that they are (a) truly unexplained, (b) theproduct of some form of non-human intelligence, and (c) the product of anadvanced, technological, non-human intelligence that does not come from “here,”then clearly we are talking about something with tremendous implications for ourcivilization. Implications that become practically endless. Implications thatbecome, in a word, revolutionary. In the first place, let us ask, who are they and what do they want? So muchdepends on the answer to this. Unfortunately, even after all these years, thereis no clear agreement among serious researchers. There appear to be beings we have come to call “Grays.” Short in stature withvery large heads, black wrap-around eyes, thin bodies and ears, and tiny nosesand mouths. They have become ubiquitous in our culture, replacing “little greenmen” as the dominant form of alien in the popular mind. But the Grays are more than a pop culture meme. Decades of study have ledmany researchers to conclude that these beings abduct humans in the dead ofnight and perform various procedures on them. These procedures, as oftenrecounted by alleged abductees, seem to be geared toward some sort of breedingand genetic manipulation program. In other words, the Grays may be creating arace that is some sort of hybrid between human and Gray. If we ever prove openlythat the Grays and these activities are real, the public reaction would beoverwhelming. There have also been reports and claims of encounters with beings decidedlyless attractive even than the Grays. These are of beings described as reptilianand even insect-like. If such claims are to be believed, some of these creaturesmay not be especially pleasant, and some may be hostile. If they are real, andif they too are responsible for some of the UFO phenomenon, a worldwide paniccould easily follow. What might these beings want? Are they truly visitors, orhave they been here for a long while? There is also the possibility that some of these beings are human, or atleast look like us. No doubt this would be easier to cope with psychologically,in particular since many of them are described rather like Scandinaviansupermodels. Of course, learning that a race of super-intelligent Nordicsupermodels are here on Earth, perhaps even secretly ruling the world, mightgive the rest of us a serious inferiority complex. Over the years, I have formed the opinion that all of these types and moremight well be real. Of course, until I meet and touch one myself, I can never becertain. Yet, it may simply come down to bioengineering. Skeptical scientistshave emphasized the improbability of aliens from another world looking humanoid,reptoid, or insectoid. After all, those life forms evolved here on Earth.Shouldn’t we expect life elsewhere to be a bit more unusual? The answer to this is yes, but with a qualifier. The qualifier is that anylife able to reach our world, and wanting somehow to interact with it, wouldface the basic problem of biological hostility. Not so much from humanity,although we might be an annoyance. Rather, the problem would come from Earth’smicrobes, gravity, atmosphere, solar radiation, and so on. We evolved on Earth;presumably, they did not. Yet, if they want to interact with Earth in somedirect way, how better than via genetic manipulation of native life forms? Oreven breeding and enhancing their own humans, possibly over thousands of years? There are other possibilities of what these other beings might be. None areeasy to know for certain, probably even in a future world in which the UFOsecret is out. After all, what about the managers of the UFO secret? In alllikelihood, they find elements of this phenomenon just as puzzling as the restof us. Are we dealing with beings that are somehow interdimensional, whateverthat really means? Or time travelers? A lost human civilization that somehowbroke away from the rest of humanity millennia ago? Knowing who they are will be very important, but in essence everything willcome down to how we judge their intentions. Are they benevolent, benign, orhostile? And how will we know these intentions? Will they be open and honest ordeceptive? Will humanity even be able to know or agree? Political Implications No matter who or what is behind the UFO phenomenon, it carries importantimplications. We can start with politics. If we were to learn, officially speaking, that UFOs are “real,” then thepowers-that-be had better hope they convince the world that there has never beenany recent past important interaction with them. Certainly no retrievals ofcrashed UFOs. That alone would prove there has been a deep cover-up, one filledwith layer upon layer of lies. Yet, even without a revelation that we acquired any of their technology, thedisclosure of this reality would be a political nightmare to handle. Could it bethat there has been a longstanding knowledge of this phenomenon, but no realinteraction? No communication? No retrieval of technology or bodies? In theory,it is certainly possible, although, as I will argue later in this book, it seemsmuch more likely that real alien craft have been recovered. And the claim hasbeen made repeatedly that there is also communication going on, between us andthem. Indeed, I encountered one such claim myself from a source that I considercredible. For the moment, simply ask yourself: what if the crash of a real alien craftnear Roswell in 1947, or something like it, happened? What if an alien craft wasrecovered by the U.S. military. If you were the President at the time and werebriefed on this, what would you do?[images/00026.jpg]President Harry Truman with Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in 1948. IfRoswell “happened,” these two men would have been well aware. You might think the world ought to know about something so important andprofound. But then you might think again. Certainly, your advisors would remindyou of the dangers of disclosing this fact. How severe might be the publicpanic? Who are these other beings? Do we have anything to worry about? What canwe learn from the technology we have recovered, and how do we keep it from ourenemies? Other questions would arise almost immediately: how to create operations tolisten for and decipher alien communications, to retrieve future downedvehicles, to accommodate any live or dead beings. It would be quickly obviousthat all of these would require the utmost secrecy, at least for a while. Even Congress could not be told, or else the secret obviously would not lastlong. But keeping Congress in the dark would require the creation of otherwiseillegal secret appropriations. In other words, black budgets. If UFOs are real,they would have been a key foundation of America’s black budget. It would beabsolutely necessary to do an end-run around the Constitution (which tasksCongress, not the Executive Branch, with both appropriating and then reviewingall government expenditures) in order to fund a program that would deal with thepresence of Others on Planet Earth. Once such a secret system is in place, it would inevitably grow. It wouldbecome necessary to manage key institutions to keep them compliant. You wouldneed to start with the academic, scientific, journalistic, and politicalinstitutions, developing relationships with key members of those groups whowould then serve as watchdogs, keeping the rest of the pack in line wheneversomeone strayed too far into the UFO topic. Any and all tools would benecessary, starting with ridicule and censure, continuing on to the loss ofone’s career, or worse. If UFOs are real, and especially if they have been recovered, then this typeof development would be likely. Through the years and decades and generations,such a long-lasting cover-up would create a strong discrepancy between what wemight call official truth and the actual truth. All societies have such adiscrepancy to one degree or another. But year after year of UFO denial wouldcontribute to a discrepancy of massive size. After all, when the mostawe-inspiring and dramatic fact of one’s lifetime becomes off-limits to genuinepolitical or scientific discussion, when secret budgets are set aside to dealwith that reality, then what we have is a loss of the foundation of our freedomsand failure of the democratic system. With the foregoing in mind, ask yourself: what would be the political upshotif UFO secrecy were to end? We will return to this theme in much greater detaillater in this book. Economic Implications The economic ramifications of the UFO phenomenon are just as dramatic as thepolitical. We might start by asking how much money may have gone into the UFOsecret. After all, whether the policy is justified or not, whether it is rightor wrong, there is every likelihood that it has cost taxpayers a pretty penny,all without their knowledge or consent. Also relevant is whether anyone has beenillegally profiting from this secret. We can assume that somewhere the answer isyes. Let us wind back the clock to the beginning of the cover-up. Some part of ourmilitary has just recovered technology that did not come from our civilizationor our world. Obviously, this technology needs to be studied. Therefore, at somepoint, it needs to be passed on to those groups within private industry that arebest suited to study and hopefully replicate it. It should go without sayingthat all of this needs to be under tightly controlled conditions. In which case, we may ask, how long before some clever scientist or teamdevelops new ideas based on what has been studied? Is it possible that secretUFO technology has spurred advances in solid state electronics, fiber optics,high tensile fibers, integrated circuits, and other technologies? Is it possiblethat acquired UFOs have contributed to the development of human technology andeconomic growth since the 1940s and 1950s? In theory, it appears to be quitepossible, assuming of course that UFOs are real and we have acquired some oftheir technology. There is another economic factor to consider relating to UFOs. Whatever fuelthese objects use to move from Point A to Point B, it is certainly notpetroleum. Anything that can hover silently, then accelerate instantly atultra-high speed is clearly using something better than oil as its main sourceof energy. Certainly, ordinary people would appreciate having access to thisincredible source of energy, especially if it burned cleanly. If such an amazingfuel and technology became public knowledge, it would quickly replace oil, coaland natural gas as the world’s main sources of energy. This would seem to be a wonderful thing. Replacing oil is one of humanity’smost coveted dreams. By now, everyone understands that the long-term future ofour species, and our world, cannot include oil as our main source of energy. Itpollutes horribly and harms life on Earth. A better, cleaner, more abundantsource of energy would surely be more desirable, except from the point of viewof those people who own the oil industry, some of the most powerful people inthe world. For generations, they have monetized oil. What if the source ofenergy behind UFOs is impossible to centralize, and therefore harder to exploitfor money? Aside from that, oil is the foundation of our world. Even under the mostideal conditions, transitioning out of an oil-dominated world would have avolatile effect on the global stock market and economic system. After all, mostof the value of any consumer product is determined by the amount of energy thatwent into making and transporting it. Generally, that means oil. Therefore, if we say nothing else, we can conclude that the UFO phenomenonposes a threat to the established economic order: specifically to thosewealthiest people and groups that own the greatest shares in the petroleumindustry, and in general to the financial markets that would be shaken by theend of the oil era. Religious Implications What would the admission of a UFO reality do to religion? Would it meananything at all? The answer is yes, it would certainly mean something. Of course, the worldhas many different religions, so everything would depend on which one we mean.Still, to the extent that any religion deals with the creation of the world, thecreation of mankind, and to the extent to which people today continue to believein versions of those accounts, the UFO phenomenon has profound implications.This will be especially evident after we review the history of ancient UFOs, or“ancient aliens,” in the next chapter. Because, if it appears that they havebeen with us for a long time, many people will inevitably wonder if they werethe gods of ancient times, or even God himself? It doesn’t take an excess of imagination to see things in this way whenreviewing the Hebrew Scriptures, for instance. Time and again, the God of theIsraelites directly intervened to save the day, and had a very personalrelationship with Moses. Other parts of that collection are also suggestive ofaliens and their technology. The vision of Ezekiel comes to mind, in which theprophet beheld a wondrous apparition of angels in a flaming chariot in the sky.When you consider the ideas of the various ancient alien theorists, we naturallyask whether beings from elsewhere became our so-called gods and wereinstrumental in creating human religions. For practicing Christians, probablythe most sensitive question would be: was Christ an extraterrestrial? What wouldit mean if he had been? Even if aliens were to announce themselves tomorrow and make such a claim,people would still have to decide whether or not to believe them. They could belying, after all. Ultimately, arriving at sound answers to such matters, andunderstanding our long-term relationship to these other beings, may turn out tobe impossible. Regarding those people and groups that presumably maintain secrecy over UFOs,they would surely be concerned with how religious believers would respond to thenews that UFOs and aliens are real. Religions are unlikely to collapse in theaftermath of Disclosure, as is sometimes supposed. Deeply religious people areunlikely simply to abandon their lifelong convictions. Instead, we might expectthem to interpret the new reality through their religious perspective. Anevangelical Christian will interpret an alien presence very differently than aBuddhist or Wiccan or New Age believer. Of course, the end of UFO secrecy would certainly initiate powerful long-termchanges in the world’s major religions. While such change may not come fromthose who are of adult age when Disclosure occurs, it will come from theirchildren and grandchildren, who will look at the world very differently.Undoubtedly, this will include a new spirituality. Scientific Implications Beyond the new technologies that may quietly have come from the successfulanalysis of recovered UFOs, it is possible that even more fundamental scientificbreakthroughs have been made, all within the clandestine world charged withstudying them. Returning to the matter of petroleum, and the certainty that UFOs do not useit, we are faced with a new reality that portends awesome possibilities for thefuture of our energy paradigm. Scientists have long speculated about an energyholy grail, that is, something along the lines of free energy. Is this whatpowers UFOs? If so, what would it be? Scientists today have several candidates, including controlled nuclearfusion, cold fusion, and the exotic but real Zero Point Energy (ZPE). These areenergy sources that, if tapped, would transform our world overnight. What is thelikelihood that one or more of these sources of energy are understood byscientists who are studying UFOs within the classified world? Consider other fields, like computing, biotechnology, materials science, oreven more arcane subjects such as theoretical physics. It may well be that inall of these fields, and others, breakthroughs have been made within theclassified world. After all, if we consider that classified science is sometimesdecades ahead of public science, how much further ahead would a classifiedprogram be, considering that it had access to technology that was eons ahead ofour own? The open literature on artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, andquantum computing already discusses near future technologies in ways that seemmagical. Is it possible that elements of the classified scientific communityhave already achieved some of those breakthroughs? The scientific implications of UFOs hardly end here. As we shall see in thechapters describing many fascinating UFO cases, there are reasons to believethat these objects, or the beings inside them, somehow manipulate space-timereality. In other words, UFOs represent more than merely incredible technology,but a radically new understanding of space and time itself. Imagine what ourworld would be like if humanity learned how to master space and time. Could wetravel, Star Trek-like, through the universe at warp speed? Could we somehowtravel through time or into other dimensions or reality? There are many important questions nagging at our scientific community today.Are any of them better understood within the classified world in ways that havenot yet reached the public realm? Keeping scientific secrets of this magnitudeis not impossible and, as I will argue later in this book, has happened for along time. In our world today, there are important unresolved questionsconcerning such subjects as the origin of life, genetic manipulation, disease,biological evolution, memory, consciousness, gravity, and other fundamentalsabout the universe itself. As astonishing as this may at first seem, a trueunderstanding of the UFO phenomenon almost certainly has something to teach usabout each of these questions. Cultural Implications UFOs and ETs have had an enormous impact on our popular culture. Many of thehighest grossing movies of all time have dealt explicitly with space travel andextraterrestrials. Disney paid George Lucas $4 billion dollars for the rights tothe Star Wars franchise. But their influence via television has probably beeneven greater. Can anyone truly calculate the effect of the Star Trek franchiseon world culture? It is a fair guess that when people around the world envisionthe future of the human race, many will think along the lines laid down by thatpioneering television show: interstellar travel, meeting with alien races,becoming members of some sort of galactic federation, and continuing on thegreat journey of discovery. Of course, one might respond that most of thesemovies and television shows were not truly related to UFOs, which is true in anarrow sense. Yet, the UFO phenomenon was without question the major sparkbehind many, if not most, of them. Whenever the U.S.S. Enterprise separates its“saucer section” from the rest of the vessel, we can thank UFOs for theinspiration. Apart from popular entertainment, however, UFOs have had other influences onour culture, mostly as a result of the cover-up. Most of these influences havebeen negative. For if we assume that UFOs are real, and there has been acover-up, then it would be a cover-up that has permeated our society at nearlyevery level. It would mean that a major truth in our world has been suppressed,which in turn has damaged the willingness and ability of many people toinvestigate and see truth when it does appear. After all, if someone is used totaking the word of the established authorities on a particular subject, evenwhen the facts do not agree, it can cause a disconnect or discrepancy betweenwhat one thinks reality is, and what it really is. The cover-up, however, may have produced one silver lining. We like to thinkof our species as able to handle the open acknowledgment of UFOs and otherbeings, but what if we really cannot, at least not without a serious crisis?This might especially be the case if we were to learn that there is someunpleasantness to the presence of these Others. If that is so, then we mightconclude that the cover-up has preserved human culture to some extent, ratherthan allowing it to disintegrate within panic. I do not personally subscribe tothis belief, but it is worth consideration. As substantial as the cultural impact of UFOs has been on our world so far,it is likely to be dwarfed by the end of the secrecy that envelops it. This hasbeen something I have reflected on for some time. What I see is something noless than a replay of the 1960s, a decade when anything and everything seemedpossible, when people developed a powerful distrust of their government, whenthey explored an array of alternative realities. This time, however, such atransformation will occur within the social and technological frameworks of the21st century. A wild ride indeed. Because the major fact, sitting front row andcenter, will be the challenge, whether benign, benevolent or hostile, posed bythe reality of highly advanced other beings here among us on Planet Earth. Global Implications When we try to look further ahead into the post-Disclosure world, which isthe theme of this book’s final chapter, we arrive at the likelihood of politicalrevolution. Whether or not this ultimately will be something positive formankind is not something I would care to predict. If prior revolutions are ourguide, the post-Disclosure Revolution will probably usher in developments bothbeneficial and malign. Clearly, though, a major alteration of human politicswill be necessary on a global scale. This will be not merely in order to copewith these other beings, whoever they are and whatever they want, but also todeal with the new technologies that undoubtedly will arise in the aftermath.Quite probably, too, from the demands laid down by the people themselves for anew and, it is to be hoped, more open and transparent political system.Disclosure may be the signal to lay down an open form of global fascism, but itdoes not have to be that way. In the very long run, after Disclosure, humanity and our home Planet Earthwill look very different than they do today. After all, we are already on anincredible trajectory. The disclosure of an extraterrestrial reality would onlyhasten the best of that. For better or for worse, ending the Big Secret will putus on the fast track. Chapter 2Theories of Ancient Visitation We have had the ability to write and record our history for just over 6,000years. Only in the last two hundred have we even tried to understand our ancientpast with anything approaching sophistication. A mere two centuries ago, thesciences of geology and archeology were in their infancy. One hundred and fiftyyears ago, we were just beginning our excavations of early human habitations,just as Charles Darwin shocked the world with a theory that life was part of adynamic, ever-changing survival of the fittest process which he termedevolution. Even a century ago, our knowledge of ancient cultures was negligiblecompared with what we know today. Our knowledge of our deep past has come to usvery recently. We still have large holes in that knowledge and I suspect that,inside one of these holes, reside the ancient gods. Our Journey to Understand the Past We have spiritual beliefs today, but not like the ancients. Thousands ofyears ago, people confronted forces well beyond their control and understanding:hence the gods. During ancient times, it was universally held that humancivilization was a gift of the gods. Whether in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Israel,Greece, Scandinavia, Britain, India, China, Africa, the Americas or elsewhere,most people believed the gods brought them the tools ofcivilization—agriculture, writing, medicine—everything worth having. When themonotheistic religions became dominant, the gods became a God, but the beatcontinued. Then, starting around the 15th century, a revolution in thought swept firstthrough Europe, and then worldwide. From Copernicus, whose astronomy placed theSun and not the Earth at the center of our solar system, to Galileo and hisexperiments with gravity (and his discovery of Jupiter's moons), to Isaac Newtonwho presented the laws of physics, to the idea of Earth no longer as thousandsof years old, but millions and then billions, to the concepts of Darwinianevolution, genetics, relativity, and quantum mechanics. Step by step, each ofthese developments, and many others, broke down the old paradigm of belief inthe gods or God. The new idea which took form was powerful, and it continues to dominate ourcivilization today: that everything can be understood rationally,scientifically. The ancient beliefs came to be seen as quaint relics of anignorant time. Now, despite some gaps here and there, mankind has things prettywell understood, or so we tell ourselves. We see the natural world as powerful,but within our intellectual grasp. The same applies to our understanding of thepast. We see it as wholly natural, human-based, sensible. Gods need not apply. Yet, within that comfortable worldview, puzzles remain. One is the incrediblyrapid pace of human evolution. We understand the Earth to be roughly 4.5 billionyears old. Complex life started around 600 million years ago. The dinosaursexisted from around 230 million years ago to 65 million years ago, and it isfairly easy to track their development over those 165 million years. Consideringthe fairly limited changes over such a long period of time, evolution was anexcruciatingly slow process. That is the norm: slow change over millions of years. Consider the shark, soperfectly adapted to its environment that it has barely changed over millions ofyears. Or the horse, whose evolution is so beautifully depicted in New YorkCity's Museum of Natural History. Over a period of 60 million years, the horseevolved from a small, cat-sized creature with ordinary feet that lived in adense forest, to the large majestic creature of the open plains, now with hoovesthat are perfectly adapted to its new environment. Or the whale. Once a landcreature that lived at the water’s edge, it took millions upon millions of yearsto evolve into the largest mammal ever seen, breathing air but swimming to thedepths of the oceans. Now consider homo sapiens. By comparison, we have evolved in no time at all.Only four million years ago the distant ancestors of humanity, australopithecusafarensis, walked the plains of eastern Africa. They looked more likechimpanzees than human beings. A mere one million years ago homo erectusappeared. This was a radical departure from australopithecus. Erectus certainlylooked and acted more like us, but he was not a recognizable human being. In fact, according to standard evolutionary theory, it took less than onemillion years to evolve from something not us into something recognizable as us.To be more precise, the current estimate is that our species is a mere 200,000years old, perhaps a little bit older. Such amazing evolutionary speed finds noparallel anywhere else on Earth. A natural question is, why so fast? Certainly,there may be a credible naturalistic explanation, but it is not unreasonable towonder. Was our rapid evolution caused by a kind of positive feedback loop stemmingfrom our increasingly complex brains, behaviors, and discoveries, in which onedevelopment led to another, then to another, and so on? Or did we receive evolutionary help, tweaked by some more advanced species?And is that the source of our belief in the gods? Ancient Images Let us take a closer look at these possible gods. We may start by askingwhether ancient UFO stories can shed any light on the matter. How long have people seen UFOs? If we are being visited, when did it begin?If the gods of ancient times were real, were they extraterrestrial, or did theycome from some other dimension, time or reality? These are difficult questions, perhaps impossible to answer, but the first ofthem is at least within our grasp. For it surely does appear that people havebeen recording UFOs throughout the course of our history. The earliest bits of evidence may well be in European cave paintings, whichrepresent some of the earliest examples of human art in existence. Inparticular, the French cave of Pech Merle portrays several objects that bearmore than a passing resemblance to flying saucers moving among the localwildlife. The painting is roughly 19,000 or 20,000 years old. Interpreting suchimages is always a tricky business, but some ancient human artist did indeeddepict something that looks like a hat-shaped UFO flying above the animals. There are several hat-shaped images in these caves. The image above issometimes called “the banner.” But, of course, how would cave dwelling humanshave a banner? Below the object is a person who appears to have many lines goingthrough him, perhaps spears. In all likelihood, we will never know the fullmeaning of this image. Is the banner an early drawing of an alien craft?[9][index_split_006.html#filepos1186485] [images/00001.jpg]Cave art from Pech Merle depicting odd structures. Some of the most eerily compelling pieces of suggestive ancient artwork arethe cave paintings of Kimberley, Australia. These were created 5,000 years agoby the native aborigines, and they depict entities which they called theWandjina, or sky beings. In the aboriginal tradition, these beings were part ofthe beginning of creation and had great powers over nature. One of them evenbecame the Milky Way. When looking at the haunting images of the Wandjina, it iseasy to think of gray aliens: oversized heads, no hair, large black eyes, noears, no mouth, and pure white skin. Until the modern era of UFOs and depictionsof ET beings, scholars had no point of reference for the Wandjina, no way tounderstand why these native Australians would create God beings so radicallydifferent in appearance from themselves. There are many such ancient paintings on rocks and in caves around the worldthat depict what look like ET beings. In the northern Italian region ofLombardy, there is a rock painting dating to the Copper age, between 5,000 and7,000 years ago. It depicts apparent priests or God figures. Each of them haswhat appears to be a halo, except that these halos look rather more likehelmets, with straight lines extending out from them. There are also interesting petroglyphs in North America, the most spectacularbeing in Utah. These are also quite ancient, around 3,000 years old. One ofthem, in Utah’s Barrier Canyon, depicts a number of tall beings without arms,standing ominously. One of these, larger than the rest, looks very much like theimages from Kimberley, Australia. There are similarly suggestive beings paintedon rocks in Utah’s Sego Canyon. Unfortunately, these ancient people lacked written languages to moreprecisely describe what they were depicting. Certainly, these ancient artistsmay have been trying to paint something other than extraterrestrials. But theydo appear to have been depicting powerful beings of some sort. Scholars vaguelyinterpret some of these as being “priest” figures. Perhaps. Regardless, theimages are arresting. At the very least, they are suggestive that ancientpeoples perceived beings that were powerful and godlike and different fromthemselves. From where did such an idea arise? A Lost Civilization? Even within the relatively short period of the last ten thousand to twentythousand years, there may well be enough gaps in our knowledge to have includeda lost, highly advanced, human civilization. Sometimes mixed in with the idea ofa lost civilization is the thesis of ancient astronauts, that is,extraterrestrials. Mainstream scholars have long dismissed such ideas as heresyor even lunacy. Yet, the case for something like a lost civilization, althoughnot as strong as proponents argue, is also not as weak as the mainstreamarguments depict. Proponents point to a number of seemingly inexplicableoddities to support the idea of an advanced, lost civilization.[images/00014.jpg]Aboriginal rock paintings in Kimberley, Australia, roughly 5,000 years old. Some arguments are stronger than others. One that fails to persuade centersaround the Piri Reis map, said to be a copy of a map from the Library atConstantinople, which was pillaged and looted in 1204 during the infamous FourthCrusade. As argued by several researchers, most notably Graham Hancock in hisbestseller, Fingerprints of the Gods, the map appears to depict the coastline ofAntarctica centuries before its discovery by European explorers in 1820. Notonly this, but it has been argued that it depicts Antarctica’s natural coastlineas it actually appears beneath the massive layers of ice. When Hancock publishedhis book in 1995, contemporary science argued that the ice sheet coveringAntarctica was at least 14 million years old (a number that has since beenrevised to 34 million years). Therefore, if we accept the map as an accuratedepiction of the unencumbered Antarctic coast, it would mean that the continentwas ice-free during the much more recent past. Hancock put the figure at notmore than around 10,500 B.C.E. The theory he drew upon to explain the suddenclimatic shift was derived from Charles Hapgood, an American college professorwho developed a theory of Earth Crustal Displacement. Hapgood’s idea was thatthe earth’s crust, which is essentially like a thin layer of skin, can suddenlyslip and create new locations for the poles. The weight of polar ice, hesuggested, was one of the causes for these shifts. The idea has no identifiable support among professional geologists, who favorthe concept of plate tectonics as a way to explain the movement of land masses(which, they maintain, occurs much more slowly). In addition, there have beenmany core samples taken of Antarctic ice, the oldest of which is believed to be530,000 years old.[10] [index_split_006.html#filepos1186741] Other core sampleshave shown a fully developed ice cap during the entire period between 40,000 to6,000 years ago, that is, during the development of the earliest humansettlements. In addition, scholars who have examined the Piri Reis map point outmany inaccuracies on the map itself, no matter how one interprets it. Of course,one might always ask why any extreme southern continent would be on a map soold, a perfectly reasonable question. The answer is that such a continent(called Terra Australis) had been widely speculated to exist for severalreasons. One was from the idea that something was needed to “balance” the landmasses in the north, another from the observed presence of icebergs in the moreextreme southern areas.[11] [index_split_006.html#filepos1187126] With suchstrong refutations coming from contemporary research and scholarship, thereseems to be no room for a lost civilization in the history of Antarctica. But this is not to refute the idea of either a lost civilization or along-standing extraterrestrial presence in our world. There are enough mysteriesfrom our distant past to make reasonable minds wonder. Pyramids In addition to rock and cave paintings, there are archeological structuresleft behind by the ancients, some of which still defy our common sense. Foremostamong these must be the Great Pyramid of Giza. Professional Egyptologistsdismiss claims that the Great Pyramid is anything other than a pharaoh's tomb,built by human labor and ingenuity. And yet, studying the astonishingengineering, massive size, and mathematical perfection of that structure, we areforced to ask, how is it possible that such professionals could form opinionsthat fly in the face of the obvious? It is not simply the fact that 2.3 million blocks of stone were used to builda pyramid that covers more than 13 acres of land. After all, a few modernengineers have claimed that they, too, could create such a massive structure,given enough time and money. But it is the precision of the pyramid that is soastonishing. It is easy to forget that it originally had an outer casing ofwhite limestone blocks, perfectly polished and fitted. For thousands of years,the structure looked like a brilliant, white, gleaming beacon, unlike any otherstructure in existence. It required an earthquake to shake the limestone blocksloose, after which the local inhabitants removed most of them to build the cityof Cairo. A few of those blocks remain today. They average a massive sixteentons each, yet the fine joints are no thicker than a piece of paper. The overall precision of this structure is breathtaking. This enormousobject, 750 feet long at each base, is situated precisely along the fourcardinal points: North, South, East, West. The ratio of its circumference to itsoriginal height equals the value of pi: 3.14, something not supposed to havebeen known for more than another millennium. Also, the geographical position ofthe great pyramid may well be the most significant of any structure in theworld. Students have pointed out that it is positioned nearly exactly at thelatitude and longitude lines that contain more land and less sea than any otherson Earth. Thus, it can truly be said that the Great Pyramid is at thegeographical center of the Earth. From this fact alone, it would seem that thebuilders of the Great Pyramid knew a great deal about the geography of ourplanet. The Great Pyramid contains so many more incredible facts, but it is enoughhere to state that a detailed study of it yields even more questions. Yet, forwhatever odd reasons, professional Egyptologists continually ignore them. Onething is clear: prior to the 20th Century, there was no other human civilizationthat could have even considered replicating it. This opens the question ofwhether there has been much greater knowledge somewhere on Planet Earth,knowledge that has been lost, either originating from extraterrestrials or froma lost advanced human civilization. Either way, it is a genuine mystery. The mystery does not end there. Everyone knows something about other pyramidsin Egypt and Central America. However, in recent years, we have come torecognize the existence of ancient pyramids throughout the world. The number ofthem is staggering. Central America alone is said to have more than one thousandpyramids, most of which have never been properly investigated. China is nowunderstood to have many ancient pyramids, over three hundred so far. A massivepyramid in Bosnia is currently being investigated. For many years, it had notbeen recognized as such, but simply as a geometrical-looking large hill that hadbeen terraformed by earlier inhabitants. However, since 2005, investigators havedescribed it as a massive pyramidal construction with its own tunnel complex.Similar debates have been occurring regarding pyramid structures in Italy,Slovenia, Australia, Indonesia, the U.S. state of Ohio, and elsewhere.[12][index_split_006.html#filepos1187540] It is fascinating and exciting to ponder the likelihood of a relationshipamong all these structures, assuming we can definitively agree that they are infact actual pyramids. We do not yet appear to be at that point, but of coursethe research is just beginning. Yet, there are theories trying to tie themtogether. Most intriguing is that the ancient pyramids and other megalithicsites are laid out in a grid, not according to our current understanding of agrid, but one in which the patterns are based upon natural Earth energies.Further claims are that these ancient structures were positioned in a kind ofweb that tapped into a source of inexhaustible energy.[13][index_split_006.html#filepos1187986] The claim certainly feels outlandish, andis supported by nothing that a professional scientist would consider validevidence. Yet, we do seem to have ancient pyramids dotting our planet, and it isreasonable to wonder if there is a connection. If there is, what can it be? Before moving on from the pyramids, we can touch on the debate over theSphinx, situated with the three great pyramids at Giza. It became an issueduring the early 1990s, when Robert M. Schoch, Ph.D., a geologist and associateprofessor of Natural Science at Boston University, noted that the Sphinxdisplayed erosion patterns that were not consistent with the patterns caused bywind and sand, but rather by water. However, there had not been significantrainfall in that area for many thousands of years. Moreover, he pointed out thatduring most of the recorded history of the Sphinx, it had been buried undersand, often up the neck. In such a state, it would be exposed to no weatherelements at all. So how did the erosion take place? Based on what is known ofweather patterns in northern Egypt through the millennia, Schoch dated themonument to between 7,000 and 5,000 BCE, long before the dawn of Egyptiancivilization, during a period when the northern Sahara was not a desert, andreceived much more rainfall. Additional work by John Anthony West, who analyzedthe archeo-astronomical aspects of the Sphinx, supported Schoch and pushed thedate even further back. Thus, the fundamental chronology of ancient civilizationhad been challenged. The academic world dismissed this argument as nothing more than crackpotravings. Several geologists disputed Schoch’s analysis, claiming that theerosion patterns are indeed those of wind and sand. Moreover, as Egyptologistsargued, building the Sphinx in 7,000 BCE or earlier was impossible. Even as lateas 3,000 BCE, people were living essentially in mud huts; they could hardly havecreated a monument on the order of the Sphinx several millennia prior. Then came one of the most important archeological discoveries of all time:Gobekli Tepe. This is a remote location at the top of a mountain ridge insoutheastern Turkey which includes massive stones that have been definitivelydated to no less than 9,000 BCE. The site is elaborate and includes beautifullycarved stonework that staggered experts who had long maintained that suchsophistication was impossible for people at such an early stage of development.Its construction predates all the important developments of what we associatewith civilization: pottery, metallurgy, the invention of writing and the wheel,even agriculture and animal husbandry. It implies organization of an advancedorder that was not supposed to be possible. Human society, after all, was stillat a hunter-gatherer stage, not farming, not in large communities, anddefinitely not supposed to create something like this. Gobekli Tepe shows thatthere was a much more sophisticated presence on Earth around 10,000 BCE thanexperts had ever thought possible. This is not speculation, but unarguable fact. If Gobekli Tepe could exist at that early date, then why not the Sphinx?Indeed, why not the Great Pyramid, and why not some of the other pyramidsdotting the globe? The only problem with accepting such a conclusion is that itwould force us to revise long-held beliefs on the development of humancivilization. It would mean that there was a much more advanced humancivilization at that early date, a civilization which somehow disappeared orwent into remission. May we call this a lost civilization? Before we get lost in this theory, as intriguing as it sounds, we shouldremind ourselves that there are no other signs of advanced civilization frommuch before 4,000 BCE. In other words, no wheel, nor any evidence of writtenlanguage. Yet, clearly, we can at least acknowledge that scholars have greatlyunderestimated the activity on Planet Earth circa 7,000-11,000 BCE. Somethingvery interesting was going on. Other Structures, Inexplicable and Explicable There are other impressive ancient sites that cause us to wonder. Most ofthese have only been studied in relatively recent years, and we still have muchto learn. Realistically, most of them are probably not evidence of eitherancient astronauts or lost civilizations. One which has received much recent attention, primarily because of thetelevision show, Ancient Aliens, is Pumapunku, located near the town of Tiwanakuon the high Bolivian plains in the Andes. The Incas once believed this area waswhere the world was created. Small wonder, considering the magnificent stoneworkfound there. The site is a terraced earthen mound with many megalithic blocks.Most unusual are the large number of precision small holes and other shapes thathave been drilled or cut into them. [images/00019.jpg]An example of the precision stonework at Pumapunko. Even so, there is much disagreement over the crucial matter of when the sitewas built, as well as whether or not ancient peoples were capable of the kind ofprecision exhibited there. Proponents of an ancient astronaut theory sometimeshave claimed the site to be 12,000 to 17,000 years old, far earlier than anyknown advanced human civilization. It has been claimed that the stones there arepredominantly granite, andesite, and diorite, all exceptionally hard. From theperspective of mainstream scholarship, however, there is no real controversy.First, the dating of the site, based on extensive analysis of relevant organicsamples, place its age at roughly 500 CE. The reason given for the much earlierdating appears to have been a misinterpretation of a piece of sculpted artwork,which some believed to be a type of elephant. If so, this surely would beinteresting, since elephants only existed in the Americas’ distant past. Mostscholars believe that the image is of two stylized condors. Regarding the stonework itself, it is unquestionably impressive. However, thehuge stone structures are not of granite, but sandstone, which is decidedlyeasier to work. Even so, scholars concede they do not know how the heavy liftingand beautiful masonry were accomplished. That is not to say they believe thelocal inhabitants were incapable of doing it. Brian Dunning, writing in hisSkeptoid blog, pointed out that there are other equally impressive examples ofstonemasonry around the ancient world, including the Parthenon, Persepolis, andmore. He concluded, “it is unnecessary to invoke aliens to explain thestructures.”[14] [index_split_006.html#filepos1188333] Perhaps the real question is whether or not the stonework shows signs ofmachining, as this has been the claim. Indeed, many of the large pieces areidentical and made with incredible precision. It is not enough for mainstreamscholars simply to throw up their hands and exclaim “we don’t know,” regardingstonework that looks as though it was machined. But was it really? That is thequestion and we do not have a firm answer. There are other examples of ancient stonework that have probably received anoverly-enthusiastic reception from ancient astronaut theorists. One would be thehundreds of large stone spheres found in Central America, mostly Costa Rica butalso Guatemala and Vera Cruz. They are perfectly shaped, or very nearly so, andas large as eight feet in diameter. There are no comparable examples of suchlarge stone balls found anywhere else. The people who allegedly shaped them arenot known to have had anything more than crude tools, and would have had totransport them from fairly distant sources. Still, many researchers do not believe these to be evidence ofextraterrestrials or anything else equally unconventional. John W. Hoopes, forexample, argues that the balls were probably made in a manner similar to that ofmany ancient polished stone axes and statues. One would begin with a roundishboulder, then work it into a spherical shape through a combination of controlledfracturing, pecking, grinding, rapid temperature changes, more pecking andhammering, then polishing. All of this can be done without metal tools oradvanced machinery. Certainly, the quality of workmanship is exceptional, butnot obviously beyond the ingenuity and skill of ancient people.[15][index_split_006.html#filepos1188765] Still, there are ancient ruins that boggle the mind. One must be the colossalstones cut at Baalbek, Lebanon. Most of the ruins there are Roman, but the sitealso contains enormous megaliths which are believed to be 2,000 years older thanthe Roman ruins. They do not fit with any known culture. The cutting and fittingof these stones, some weighing more than 1,500 tons, was done with perfection,despite being the largest cut stones in the world (some 68 x 14 x 14 feet). Tothis day, there is no reasonable explanation of who cut and prepared thesestones, or was able to transport them roughly fifty miles from their origin, orplace them on top of each other so perfectly, so early in the history of ourcivilization.[16] [index_split_006.html#filepos1189089] Flying Trinkets Aside from huge structures, there are other artifacts and depictions that arecurious, including a few of what seem to be ancient flying craft. While suchevidence is not directly suggestive of extraterrestrial influence, it remainsinteresting enough for us to wonder about what is missing in our knowledge ofthe ancient world. One of these was an object found in 1898, in a tomb at Saqqara, Egypt, andwas dated to around 200 BC. It has the head of a bird, but otherwise looks likea glider or airplane. However, because it was found before there were anyairplanes, it was described as a “wooden bird model” and stored in the basementof the Cairo Museum. A number of years later, people began to realize itsimportance, so the Egyptian government created a special committee of scientiststo study it. Then they labeled it as (drumroll, please) a model airplane! It hasthe same proportions of a what is known as a “pusher glider,” with curved wingsthat slope downward slightly, giving the plane maximum lift without detractingfrom speed. We might wonder, then, how someone more than 2,000 years ago devised a modelof a flying device with such advanced features, requiring such knowledge ofaerodynamics. Was this simply a lucky fluke? The most famous model of an ancient flying craft comes from South America. Itis a beautiful pre-Columbian gold trinket more than 1,000 years old. To anyonewith common sense, it looks like a delta wing aircraft. Archaeologists, however,call it a “zoomorphic object,” meaning that it is animal-shaped. But what animalcould this represent? It does not resemble a bat, nor an insect, nor any otherkind of flying creature one can imagine. It looks like an aircraft. Much study and investigation have been done on this little trinket. Sufficeto say that it flies, as was demonstrated on an episode of Ancient Aliens. Areplica model of it was built, with the simple addition of a propeller. It flewperfectly. Another lucky fluke? [images/00034.jpg]A Pre-Columbian artifact. A replica of it (with an added propeller) flew. With all ancient artifacts and ruins, as with everything else in life, weshould refrain from jumping to conclusions, constantly seek out all sides to aquestion, and do our best to form reasonable hypotheses (which must always beamenable to revision, following new information). Otherwise, we spend our livesdoing nothing more than filling in the blanks of what we think we already know.Having offered this disclaimer, we must conclude that there are archeologicalmysteries which not only beg explanation, but which lead us toward a radicalrevision of our ancient past."},{"pageContent":"Ancient Writings: Vimanas Archeology can tell us a great deal, but reading ancient writings is stillmore satisfying. Sure enough, there are a number of ancient writings that arebelieved to be suggestive of UFOs and extraterrestrial encounters. Let us startwith some ancient writings that have received recent attention: the vimanas. Much has been written about vimanas, especially on the web. One can easilybecome lost amid the sites, although it soon becomes evident that most of themsimply copy each others’ statements. It is obvious that precious few sites thatdiscuss vimanas have any original research. The word vimana is Sanskrit, and has had many meanings over the years: thepalace of an emperor or a god, a temple, a chariot, or a vehicle. Today, itmeans aircraft. In Sanskrit literature, vimanas are mentioned in the poeticepics known as the Vedas. There are number of Vedas, including the Rig Veda,which does not mention vimanas, but does have a passage dealing with goldencolored birds that fly up to heaven. This has sometimes been (very loosely)translated to imply a vessel that jumps into space. However, vimanas are mentioned in the Ramayana, another Veda epic which datesfrom the fourth or fifth century, B.C. In one passage, a vimana is described asa “chariot that resembles the sun... that aerial and excellent chariot goingeverywhere at will …. that chariot resembling a bright cloud in the sky …. andthe king got in, and the excellent chariot … rose up into the higheratmosphere.”[17] [index_split_006.html#filepos1189462] Another vimana is described in the Mahabharata, another ancient text. Here,one vimana measures twelve cubits in circumference, with four strong wheels.This seems quite small, roughly 20 to 25 feet in circumference, or about sevenfeet in diameter. Still, there have certainly been reports of flying saucers ofthat size.[18] [index_split_006.html#filepos1189886] Unfortunately, most of what we hear regarding vimanas is connected tosomething that is not ancient, but entirely modern. That is the VaimanikaShastra. Some sources have claimed it is an ancient Hindu manuscript, but thisclaim is spurious. Every single scholarly opinion agrees that it is an early20th century Sanskrit text on aeronautics. In fact, It was claimed to beobtained by channeling. There is, in fact, no evidence of its existence prior to1952, when the text itself was first revealed, and we are told it was dictatedbetween 1918 and 1923. It is from this text that so many readers hear of themany allegedly technical features of the ancient vimanas. For instance, theclaim that there were “31 essential parts” of the vehicles and “16 materials”from which they were constructed, and so on. The text gives a great amount ofdetail, it is true, but it is a 20th century creation. Indeed, a number of studies of the technical illustrations make it clear thatthe vimanas as described in the Vaimanika Shastra are not even airworthy. Oneaviation engineer studied the technical illustrations, concluding the vimanaswere “absurdly unaerodynamic.” He added that “they look like brutalist weddingcakes, with minarets, huge ornithopter wings and dinky propellers. In otherwords, they look like typical early 20th century fantasy flying machines with anIndian twist.”[19] [index_split_006.html#filepos1190120] The fantasies from the Vaimanika Shastra aside, the vimanas of the ancienttexts do transport the gods through the heavens. However, before we haveanything definitive to say about them, serious and careful work needs to be doneon this topic. We deserve better than wild claims which are uncertain at bestand fictitious at worst. Speaking of wild, fictitious claims, this is a good place to lay to rest theclaim that the Mahabharata has a passage that describes nuclear devastation. Theancient text most certainly does not, although more recent ancient astronauttheorists have taken liberties in claiming otherwise. It is unfortunate that this claim has continued for nearly fifty years, whenit is clear that no one making it has been a Vedic scholar, nor even bothered toprovide a sound citation of the original text. The Mahabharata, after all, isten times longer than the Iliad and Odyssey combined. It has roughly 100,000verses, many long prose passages, and about 1.8 million words. Who amongstudents of UFOs has read any significant portion of that, or even can read theSanskrit? Nevertheless, within that massive text, we are told there is adescription of ancient aerial warfare involving nuclear weapons. Here is the keypassage:> Gurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana,> hurled a single projectile> charged with all the power of the Universe.> An incandescent column of smoke and flame,> as bright as ten thousand suns,> rose in all its splendor.> It was an unknown weapon,> and iron thunderbolt,> a gigantic messenger of death,> which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and Andhakas.> The corpses were so burned> as to be unrecognizable.> Their hair and nails fell out.> Pottery broke without any apparent cause,> and the birds turned white.> …After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected…> …to escape from this fire,> the soldiers threw themselves in streams> to wash themselves and all their equipment. The passage appears in several books and many websites. But, as researcherJason Colovito clearly shows, this translation bears hardly any relationship tothe original sanskrit. This translation derives from earlier (misleading)translations, primarily one by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier in their book,Morning of the Magicians, from 1960. The original sanskrit says nothing at allabout nuclear bombs. Colovito sums up the situation well:> Pauwels and Bergier seem to have intentionally mistranslated Sanskrit> sentences into French to create a false impression, but were honest enough to> allow that the sentences weren't related to each other and to leave in some> baffling details . . . . [others] and their followers are content to mangle a> bad English translation of a French mistranslation of a Sanskrit original> without ever checking the original source material. Texts are conflated,> separate incidents combined into one, and no context is considered or> analyzed. Details that do not support [their] ideas are eliminated with no> indication that they were dropped. Mistranslations are purposely created and> copied uncritically. Then they are changed at will to support the author’s> views and repeated endlessly as revealed truth.[20]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1190732] The quotation has been repeated endlessly from website to website, copied andpasted at will, with no thought to checking for original citations. We can dobetter. Ancient Writings: Egypt Beyond the realm of mythologies and other sacred texts, the ancient world hasleft us with several interesting UFO accounts. Calling them reports is going toofar, but they are certainly interesting stories. The earliest of these, if legitimate, is from the annals of Thutmose III ofEgypt’s 18th Dynasty, who reigned 3,500 years ago. This document is known as theTulli Papyrus, after Alberto Tulli, a director of the Egyptian section of theVatican museum, who found it in a Cairo antique shop in 1933.[21][index_split_006.html#filepos1191205] However, the price was too high, so a copywas made of the text, which was then recopied, this time replacing the originalhieratic script with more common hieroglyphic. Years later, an Italian Princenamed Boris de Rachewiltz claimed to have found the original papyrus,“untranslated and unpublished,” among the papers which had been left by thedeceased Tulli. He described his find to the Fortean Doubt magazine in 1953, andstated that the noted Egyptologist, Étienne Drioton of the Egyptian Museum inCairo, had retranscribed it from the original hieratic script intohieroglyphics. De Rachewiltz claimed that the papyrus formed part of the libraryof Thutmosis III. Although nothing in the document refers to a pharaoh by name,this is not uncommon.[22] [index_split_006.html#filepos1191453] Further complicating matters is that the document’s location is currentlyunknown, so that no scholarly analysis can be performed on it; and, while thecredentials of the associated individuals are not under dispute, there is alwaysthe possibility that the accuracy of the translations can be disputed. It ispossible that the original papyrus was accidentally destroyed; if so, we maynever be able to prove the authenticity of this compelling story. More serious is the allegation in 2006, by Egyptologist Franco Brussino, thatthe Tulli Papyrus is a forgery, prepared from fragments of nine differentpapyruses described in a 1927 book by Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner.[23][index_split_006.html#filepos1191781] However, another Egyptologist, R. CedricLeonard, argues strongly against this conclusion. The forgery would have beenmade years before the world knew of “flying saucers,” and indeed no motivationcan be seen for it. More to the point, the documents Brussino claimed were usedin this alleged forgery show “obvious textual differences” with several longphrases in the Tully papyrus. “In regard to the short phrases,” Leonardcontinued, “I have no doubt that I could locate identical short phrases bylooking in Budge's hieroglyphic text of the Book of the Dead. Would that provethat Tulli cribbed the text in question from Budge's book?”[24][index_split_006.html#filepos1192175] Here is the translation of R. Cedric Leonard.> In the year 22, of the third month of winter, sixth hour of the day [...]> among the scribes of the House of Life it was found that a strange Fiery Disk> was coming in the sky. It had no head. The breath of its mouth emitted a foul> odor. Its body was one rod in length and one rod in width. It had no voice. It> came toward His Majesty's house. Their heart became confused through it, and> they fell upon their bellies. They [went] to the king, to report it. His> Majesty [ordered that] the scrolls [located] in the House of Life be> consulted. His Majesty meditated on all these events which were now going on.> After several days had passed, they became more numerous in the sky than> ever. They shined in the sky more than the brightness of the sun, and extended> to the limits of the four supports of heaven [...] Powerful was the position> of the Fiery Disks.> The army of the King looked on, with His Majesty in their midst. It was> after the evening meal when the Disks ascended even higher in the sky to the> south. Fish and other volatiles rained down from the sky: a marvel never> before known since the foundation of the country. And His Majesty caused> incense to be brought to appease the heart of Amun-Re, the god of the Two> Lands. And it was [ordered] that the event [be recorded for] His Majesty in> the Annals of the House of Life [to be remembered] for ever. An interesting aspect to this story, incidentally, is that Thutmose III,along with his stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, initiated one of the mostglorious periods of ancient Egypt. Thutmose III extended Egypt’s empire to thegreatest extent in its history. In fact, that dynasty—the 18th—is the mostfamous of all. In addition to Thutmose III and Hatshepsut (who became one of thefew female Pharaohs in Egyptian history), it included Akhenaten, (known as the“heretic pharaoh” who instituted the first known instance of monotheism inhistory) his queen Nefertiti, and his son Tutankhamun (King Tut). Ancient Writings: The Bible In the 1950s, a writer named Morris Jessup wrote an interesting book calledUFOs in the Bible. This was the first true attempt to interpret the Bible with aconnection to UFOs and extraterrestrials. Jessup wrote about unusual elementswithin the Book of Exodus, during which Moses led his people out of Egypt. Overand over during that time, powers from the sky interacted with them, sometimesdropping plagues from some kind of aerial conveyances, sometimes keeping themalive with “manna from heaven.” Some of these passages are quite interesting. Exodus 3:2 reads, “and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame offire out of the midst of a Bush: and he looked and behold the Bush burned withfire, and the Bush was not consumed.” In Exodus 4:3, “he cast it (his rod) upon the ground, and it became aserpent; and Moses fled before it.” Or Exodus 13:21: “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar ofcloud... and by night in a pillar of fire.” In Jessup’s opinion, this seems like“an intelligently guided UFO.” There are enough passages in Exodus that suggest an extraterrestrialconnection, that Exodus certainly warrants a fresh re-read from interestedstudents. A decade after Jessup, Erich von Daniken followed up on this line of thought.In Chariots of the Gods?, von Daniken offered an interesting interpretation ofEzekiel’s vision, which he interpreted as a detailed description of a landingspacecraft with angels in the likeness of humans. Here is the most relevantpassage from Ezekiel:> As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the> living creatures, one for each of the four of them… like the gleaming of a> chrysolite, and the four had the same likeness being as it were a wheel within> a wheel … [containing] rims and … spokes, and the rims were full of eyes round> about.... The living creatures were in each wheel.[25]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1192569] A fascinating sidelight to this is that a former NASA scientist named JosefBlumrich, who had thought von Daniken’s interpretation to be ridiculous, set outto design a craft based on the passage in Ezekiel. Blumrich analyzed sixdifferent translations of the Bible in conjunction with his experience inengineering. In a book he wrote in 1970s, The Spaceships of Ezekiel, Blumrich presentedtechnical specifications of the spacecraft that, he argued, fit Ezekiel'sdescription perfectly. Of course, we should remember that Ezekiel presumably wasdescribing something well beyond his experience for his time of 2,500 years ago.If he did see a descending spacecraft, he would have lacked the language ortechnological understanding to describe it in any way other than he did.Ezekiel's description seems rather vague to be taken as an actual craft. Thenagain, why would it be impossible for ancient people to have seen genuine UFOs?And if so, why would we expect them to describe such phenomena the same as wewould today? Ancient Astronauts It was von Daniken who put ancient astronauts into the public spotlight.Before him, the idea had barely registered anywhere, but by the early 1970s, itwas everywhere. The thesis was that the technologies and religions of manyancient civilizations were bequeathed by ancient astronauts, who were welcomedas gods. Von Daniken’s interpretation of the Bible was only a small part of hiseffort. We may admire the audacity of such a grand interpretation—it was the 1960s,after all. Enough said. However, nothing in the book is scientific, preciouslittle of it plausible. Von Daniken argued that a number of the structures andartifacts of the ancient world were highly advanced technology, explainable onlyby extraterrestrials. Very prominent in his book were structures likeStonehenge, the Egyptian pyramids, the huge heads on Easter Island, and theNazca lines in Peru, the last of which he explained as landing strips for anancient airfield. All of these, he argued, were connected to the presence ofextraterrestrials. While the Great Pyramid clearly constitutes a genuine mysteryin many important respects, most of these other monuments and artifacts do notrequire unconventional explanations. Von Daniken also discussed the Piri Reis map, described earlier, andpresented the image, now famous, of the tomb of the Mayan ruler Pakal, which heinterpreted as depicting an astronaut in his spaceship. Again, this isinteresting, perhaps suggestive. Most scholars, however, have no probleminterpreting this in conventional Mayan terms, and it is certainly not proof ofancient astronauts.[images/00054.jpg]Mayan artifacts. Statuette from ruins at Tikal (l) and an illustration of thelid of the tomb of the ruler Pakal (r). Von Daniken has been ridiculed and attacked by mainstream scholars, and theycertainly have picked apart his claims that the Easter Island statues,Stonehenge, the Nazca lines, or other monuments were built as a result of humancontact with extraterrestrials. However, despite his uncritical enthusiasm for any and all apparent ancientmysteries, a few of von Daniken’s claims may have landed somewhat closer totheir mark. For instance, although his account of the Great Pyramid is far fromthe best, he did bring attention to some of the oddities and mysteries of thatstructure. And try though we might to deny it, some of the ancient petroglyphsthat appeared in his book do indeed look like people wearing spacesuits. The Annunaki Let us review another figure whose impact on the discussion over our originsequals that of von Daniken: Zechariah Sitchin. Sitchin spent much of his life studying ancient Sumerian clay tablets, whichis the earliest form of human writing. This includes cuneiform and ancientcylinder seals, and not surprisingly is understood by only a handful of scholarsaround the world. In addition to including information about ordinary thingssuch as commercial transactions and the like, some of the tablets tell storiesabout “the gods” of Sumer. In general, scholars have interpreted these as theyhave interpreted all stories of gods from other ancient cultures: as myths toldby people as a way of making sense of their world. Sitchin, who did not undertake formal university study of these ancienttablets and was entirely self-taught, argued otherwise. Starting in 1976, hebegan publishing a series of books arguing that the stories told by theSumerians were quite specific and detailed, and that they appeared to bedescribing, more or less accurately, what really happened. And what did thesetablets say? According to Sitchin, they said that the ancient Sumerian gods,called the Annunaki, were an extraterrestrial race who came to Earth about450,000 years ago. Their planet was known as Marduk or Nibiru. This planet,according to the tablets, followed a highly elongated, elliptical, orbit inEarth's solar system, making one transit around the Sun every 3,600 years. The Annunaki originally came to Earth looking for minerals, argued Sitchin,especially gold, which they found in a mine in Africa. These so-called gods, hesaid, were essentially rank and file workers of a colonial expedition fromNibiru to Earth, undertaken during one of the periods when Nibiru’s orbit tookit close enough to Earth. Sitchin wrote that one of them, named Enki, suggestedthe creation of a better class of worker by genetically engineering man to minefor the gold. In other words Homo Erectus was crossed with genetic material fromthe Anunnaki to create modern Homo Sapiens. The Anunnaki also taught humans the means of civilization, althoughpresumably this was hundreds of thousands of years later. Sitchin argued thatthe Sumerians even knew that the Sun was the center of our solar system, (a factunknown by our own civilization until Copernicus) and that all the planets wereknown to them, including Nibiru. There is a Sumerian cylinder seal, known as VA243, that seems to depict the Sun surrounded by twelve smaller circles, (one ofwhich is difficult to discern) presumably planets. In the same cylinder, aseated figure, seemingly a king of some kind, is significantly larger in sizethan the two men facing him. In Sitchin’s opinion, this King was of theAnnunaki, who were “much bigger, at least by a third … than the average humanbeing. They were giants.”[26] [index_split_006.html#filepos1193039] Sitchin expanded on this thesis over the course of many books, incorporatingthe Bible, for instance, when stating that the Anunnaki were the Nephilim asdepicted in Genesis. When the Anunnaki returned after thousands of years, theyfound Earth females attractive. As it is written in Genesis:> The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married> any of them they chose. . . . The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and> also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had> children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.[27]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1193440] That is, the descendants of the Anunnaki continued to live on, until theGreat Flood apparently wiped everyone out except for Noah and his descendants. Sitchin’s scenario is fascinating, and he has many followers, butprofessional Sumerian and Hebrew scholars are not among them. His detractorshave argued that his translation skills were spotty and his documentation poor.A key criticism is that other scholars have no way to know what the originaltablets actually show, because Sitchin provided few references or citations toenable them to look up the tablet. Certainly, the scientific difficulties of aplanet like a Nibiru supporting life ought to be evident. A planet that far outfrom the sun, vastly more distant than Neptune or Pluto, yet supporting life? Ofcourse, one might defend Sitchin on the basis that this is only what the tabletsthemselves say, but simply because the Sumerians may have recorded such a thingdoes not make it automatically true. Sitchin’s interpretation of the image on VA 243 has also been roundlycriticized. Scholars point out that hundreds of Sumerian astronomical seals andcalendars have been decoded and recorded, and the total count of planets on eachseal has always been five. That is, the Sumerians knew of five planets only, nottwelve as Sitchin asserted (the nine planets, plus the Sun, the Moon, andNibiru—the Twelfth Planet). It is true that seal VA 243 has a sun-like image,plus twelve circles around it. Of course, it is easy to think it looks like theSun, but apparently that symbol has no resemblance to the many other documentedSumerian sun symbols. According to researcher Michael Heiser, the Sun image onthat seal is not the Sumerian symbol for the sun. It is only a star, as are thesurrounding circles. In fact, scholars have translated this seal as a messagefrom a nobleman to a servant reading simply, “you are his servant.”[28][index_split_006.html#filepos1193703] [images/00033.jpg]Sumerian cylinder seal VA 243. Note the sun-like image at the upper left. Similar objections are evident regarding Sitchin’s interpretation of how thehuman race was engineered. As mentioned earlier, the rapidity of human evolutionis a true marvel. One might easily wonder if we were engineered in some way, butit is difficult to get a good understanding of Sitchin’s timeline. He wrote thatthe Annunaki arrived 450,000 years ago. As far as the most current science tellsus, this is more than 200,000 years before the appearance of the earliestanatomically modern human beings, whose remains have been found in Ethiopia, notSouthern Africa (where Sitchin said humanity was created). Does this mean thatit took them several hundred thousand years before creating anatomically modernhumans? Why the long delay? Does this mean that such humans mined for gold insouthern Africa for 100,000 years or even more? None of this really makes sense.Sitchin’s scenario, which he formulated during the 1970s, simply does not fitwith the increasingly complex understanding scientists have developed concerninghuman origins. An argument supporting Sitchin’s thesis has come from Michael Tellinger andJohan Heine, have explored ancient stone circle formations in their country thathas led them to argue that an advanced civilization existed at the southern tipof Africa more than 200,000 years ago, and that they were mining gold. Theseformations, Tellinger argues, housed advanced technology that was designed tocreate tunnels to reach the gold deposits below the Earth. The formations are certainly interesting. The stones are usually a few metershigh, sometimes in complex arrangements, almost weblike. Traditional academicarguments that they are cattle enclosures seems absurd, given their structure,and the fact that many have no openings.[29][index_split_006.html#filepos1194141] Skeptics abound, and one of many problems has been to find a way to date theruins in such a way that convinces outsiders. Another is to make a persuasivecase about their use, while another still is to find evidence of sophisticatedhuman settlements in South Africa dating back through those years. Thepresentation is intriguing, but the claims are generally recent. The task is totake the argument beyond speculation and incorporate corroborative evidence.Given the problems with Sitchin’s work, it does not help that it is used as theinspiration and source. It is not a priori impossible that humanity could have been engineered as theproperty of some extraterrestrial race, and Sitchin did create a fascinatinginterpretation of human origins. Still, the evidence he marshalled from theSumerian and Biblical texts has been problematic. For this thesis to work,better arguments need to come from elsewhere. Having said that, we would be rash to dismiss all possibilities that theancient gods were nothing more than mythical figures. For instance, there hasbeen a great deal of research (most of which is outside the academic mainstream)on ancient traditions and scriptures from the different continents that describeGod figures in such a way that certainly give one pause. Consider the many stories of serpent beings with superhuman powers. In India,for instance, they were known as the Naga. According to one Vedic tradition, theserpent Naga instructed humanity in knowledge of good and evil. It isinteresting how the serpent is seen as a symbol of wisdom or knowledge acrossmany cultural traditions. Cultures such as the Scandinavian, Slavic, Hebrew,Tibetan, Hopi, and West African all depict serpent gods possessing esotericwisdom. There are also occasional ancient depictions of deities that look decidedlyreptilian. In particular are some well-known early Sumerian lizard-headedfigurines from the fifth millennium B.C., from what is known as the Ubaidperiod, found in the Mesopotamian city of Ur. Are these actually the Anunnaki,as some ancient astronaut theorists argue? Such a conclusion seems unwarranted.After all, why would the Anunnaki be reptilian, when, according to Sitchin, theycreated mankind in their image? In fact, the female figure shown here, commonlydescribed on the web as an Anunnaki god, is actually nursing a child. In alllikelihood we are seeing a stylized form of art, the full interpretation ofwhich we may never fully grasp. There has also been discussion over the beings known as the Elohim. The wordis Hebrew, and one valid way to translate it is Shining Ones. A number ofresearchers, including Richard L. Thompson, author of Alien Identities, believethat “these beings created modern humans from earlier human forms by geneticmanipulation. Along these lines, some of these beings, called Watchers, matedwith humans. This, however, was considered a crime by the Shining Ones.” If youread the word Elohim in this manner, then Yahweh was one of the Shining Ones,but not the only one. Not all scholars accept the plural nature of Elohim.Indeed, Michael Heiser analyzed all instances in the Bible in which the God ofIsrael is the elohim, and the verbs are singular.[30][index_split_006.html#filepos1194584] There is, however, the suggestive passagein Genesis which states “the sons of Gods (bene ha-elohim) saw the daughters ofmen that they were fair.”[31] [index_split_006.html#filepos1194818] In summary, we must conclude that the stories and myths left from the ancientpast generally do not stand up to scrutiny when we consider them as evidence forthe idea of ancient extraterrestrial contact. But, that does not necessarilymean there are no reasons to speculate about an “ancient alien” connection tohumanity. There remain some intriguing possibilities. Unfortunately, we maynever get to a point where we can acquire enough evidence to settle the matter. More Ancient Stories During the last two millennia, interesting UFO-related events have continuedto occur. Having already discussed the famous sighting of the prophet Ezekiel,let us move on to another famous apparition, that of the Emperor Constantineduring the period of ancient Rome. According to legend, while Constantinemarched with his army amid a Roman Civil War, he looked up to the sky. Highabove him he saw the early Christian symbol, two Greek letters: chi (X) and rho(P). These are the first two letters in the name of Christ. Accompanying thesetwo symbols, we are told, were Greek words in the sky meaning “by this, bevictorious.” We are told that Constantine did not understand the apparition, butthe following night he dreamed that Christ explained to him that he should usethe sign against his enemies. That became the military standard used byConstantine, and he soon won control of the Roman Empire. To put it mildly, such an account cannot be taken seriously by scholars. Whoreally can imagine not merely two Greek letters in the sky, but a completephrase? And who can envision Christ coming to Constantine in a dream, persuadinghim to use a Christian symbol for victory in war? Of course, it wasConstantine's dream, not ours, and the man was a General. Perhaps there is aspeck of truth somewhere in that story, some sort of strange apparition in thesky on that day. The ancient world has other stories like this. A ninth century Latinmanuscript, called Liber contra insulam vulgi opinionem, contains a passagewhich, a thousand years later, inspired the title of one of ufology’s mostoriginal books: Passport to Magonia, by Jacques Vallée. In this document, theArchbishop of Lyons complained about a persistent belief among the Frenchpeasantry regarding a “certain region called Magonia from whence come ships inthe clouds.” According to the belief, the occupants of these vessels would“carry back to that region those fruits of the earth which are destroyed by hailand tempests; the sailors paying rewards to the storm wizards and themselvesreceiving corn and other produce.” The Archbishop even said three men and awoman who had claimed to have “fallen from these same ships” had been stoned todeath, an event he personally had witnessed. An even more interesting story comes down to us from 13th century England. Inthe year 1211, Gervase of Tilbury, a chronicler of historical events andcuriosities, recorded this bizarre story:> There happened in the borough of Cloera, one Sunday, while the people were at> Mass, a marvel. In this town is a church dedicated to St. Kinarus. It befell> that an anchor was dropped from the sky, with a rope attached to it, and one> of the flukes caught in the arch above the church door. The people rushed out> of the church and saw in the sky a ship with men on board, floating before the> anchor cable, and they saw a man leap overboard and jump down to the anchor,> as if to release it. He looked as if he were swimming in water. The folk> rushed up and tried to seize him; but the Bishop forbade the people to hold> the man, for it might kill him, he said. The man was freed, and hurried up to> the ship, where the crew cut the rope and the ship sailed out of sight. But> the anchor is in the church, and has been there ever since, as a testimony. This tale is like no other British legend or supernatural tradition. In thewords of folklorist Katharine Briggs, it is “one of those strange, unmotivatedand therefore rather convincing tales that are scattered through the earlychronicles.” Even so, Gervase wrote about a number of bizarre “marvels.”Apparently, these included ghosts, lamia, fairy creatures, “the phoenix arisingfrom the flames,” “women with boars’ tusks and men with eight feet and eyes.” Inshort, this is not necessarily a source that inspires confidence.[32][index_split_006.html#filepos1195141] Another fascinating event, one that has received much attention onUFO-related websites, took place at dawn on April 14, 1561, over the town ofNuremberg, Germany. On that morning, people noted that the sky seemed filledwith “cylindrical objects.” Emerging from these objects were disks and globescolored red, black, orange, and blue. Crosses and tubes resembling cannonbarrels also appeared. Then, the objects “began to fight one another.” Afterabout an hour of battle, they seemed to catch fire and fell to Earth, where theyturned to steam. The witnesses took this display as a divine warning and weredeeply affected. A few years later, an artist named Hans Glaser created awoodcut of it.[images/00005.jpg]Woodcut depiction of an aerial display over Nuremburg, 1561. Commentators have occasionally attributed that spectacle to the effects of asundog over the city. One supposes that anyone can say anything, since everyonewho saw the apparition has been dead for five centuries. It seems, however, thatthis description is quite specific, and many of the effects do not resemble asundog. Unfortunately, we encounter this problem with all ancient UFO stories.They are fascinating, but none of them were subjected to anything more than acursory description. Nothing like proper investigations and reports were done,in which multiple witnesses were interviewed, measurements taken, and so on. Such is also the case with a fascinating and baffling story from a centurylater. In some ways, this deserves to be called the first true, modern UFOreport, except that, once again, it received no investigation. Even so, it waswritten up as a report to a higher authority, from whom it was hoped some sortof answer would come. Of course, given the circumstances of the event, no actioncould possibly have been taken, and there is no evidence that any answer evercame. The event took place in Russia, in the town of Roboziero, on August 15, 1663.Russia at that time was the very definition of a backwater area. Utterly remote,effectively cut off from the rest of the world, with no industrializationwhatsoever. The case came to light around the year 1800, when a researcher inthe St. Cyril Monastery discovered a letter to a Bishop from a concerned priest.The priest was relating a story that had been told to him by a villager. According to the priest, people who were in church at the time heard a greatsound in the heavens. They came outside and looked above. They saw “a large ballof fire [come] down over Roboziero, arriving from the clearest part of thecloudless heavens... it moved toward the lake passing over the church.” This is surely interesting. The size of the object appears to have beenfairly substantial, perhaps between 100 feet and 150 feet in length. Two rays oflight extended from it, then it left. But then, less than an hour later, itreturned, coming to within 1,500 feet when it disappeared. And then, “to the great terror of all those who watched it,” it came back fora third time, remaining over the village for an hour and a half. According tothe priest, fishermen in their boat on a nearby lake were burned by the heat.The waters of the lake were fully illuminated down to its bottom depth of thirtyfeet, and the fish swam away to the shore. The water also seemed to be coveredwith rust under the reddish light of the object. If such a story were to be told today, we would certainly find itinteresting, but without corroboration, not much more could be done with it. Ofcourse, we might suppose this seventeenth century villager was pulling the legof his local priest. We know nothing about the priest himself, or whether or notit might have been considered fun to tell a tall tale to the village priest.However, most historians of medieval Russia would consider this very unlikely.Priests held positions of great power in traditional villages. To put it mildly,Russian villagers would never have considered such a thing. What we have insteadis a fascinating early UFO report, one which, incidentally, is reminiscent ofthe account from the era of Thutmose III in ancient Egypt. The object, asdescribed by the priest, moved with too much deliberation for this to have beena natural phenomenon. We would seem to be dealing with either a hoax or agenuine UFO type of event, centuries before the world ever heard of flyingsaucers. During the 18th century, the trickle of strange stories continued. Some ofthese undoubtedly are meteoric events, or even ball lightning (which,incidentally, is an unexplained phenomenon to this day). Others presumably couldbe One was said to have happened over the Isle of Man on February 15, 1716. Asreported that year in The Boston News Letter “... there was a Strange Appearanceof Ships in the Air, which engaged each other for about half an hour; when aCloud of Divers Colours covered and prevented any further sight of them.”[33][index_split_006.html#filepos1195669] One of the more interesting ones is from Westminster, England, from December16, 1742. The phenomenon was witnessed by a highly educated man who wrote of hissighting in a journal called Philosophical Transactions.> I saw a light arise from behind the Trees and Houses ... which I took at first> for a large Sky-Rocket; but when it had risen to the Height of about 20> Degrees, it took a Motion nearly parallel to the Horizon, but waved in this> manner [in his drawing of the object, he drew a wavy line]. Its Motion was so> very slow, that I had it above half a Minute in View, and therefore Time> enough to contemplate its Appearance fully … His drawing of the object made it appear somewhat acorn-shaped, with a longstraight flame coming out of it as it moved across the sky. Needless to say,there was nothing in 1742 that could have explained this sighting.[34][index_split_006.html#filepos1196030] Charles Fort By the 19th century, the trickle of UFO events became a small but steadyflow. It is not necessarily that there was more activity, but simply that webecame better at recording them. In this regard, the contribution of CharlesFort is of key importance. Fort was the first person in modern history to lookat the anomalies of our past with a fresh eye, understanding these anomalies as,at least in part, the result of an intelligence beyond our civilization. Fort lived through the turn of the 20th century, spending years at the NewYork Public Library, doggedly sifting through old newspaper reports, collectingmany bizarre stories that, on the face of it, simply made no sense. Forinstance, all sorts of things falling out of the sky: frogs and fish, bothliving and dead, stones, and even blocks of ice. He also collected an array of astronomical oddities. Some of these arecertainly intriguing. One report was from 1799, describing a “luminous spot seenmoving across the disk of Mercury.”[35] [index_split_006.html#filepos1196286]Another, from November, 1821, was from the Proceedings of the London RoyalSociety, concerning unusual bright spots on the Moon. Yet another report, fromthe journal, Philosophical Transactions, in 1847, concerned a very odd movinglight. According to the writer, “it looked like a star passing over the Moonwhich, on the next moment's consideration I knew to be impossible.” He added,“it was a fixed, steady light upon the dark part of the Moon.”[36][index_split_006.html#filepos1196731] Another astronomical oddity found by Fortwas recorded in the 1894 issue of the Astrophysical Journal about “a lightreflecting body, or a bright spot near Mars seen November 25, 1894, by Prof.Pickering and others at the Lowell Observatory, above an unilluminated part ofMars....”[37] [index_split_006.html#filepos1197008] One might try to argue that the astronomers of the 18th and 19th centurieswere not as precise or capable as astronomers today. But, in fact, theirequipment was up to the job, and they were certainly capable observers. Fort collected more than astronomical oddities. Indeed, he collected many ofwhat we can only call UFO sightings. Since they are predominantly from the 19thand early 20th century, we are clearly not talking about “ancient aliens.” Evenso, they are still early enough that they do not make sense in terms of secretor classified technology explanations. Moreover, they reinforce the idea of UFOsas something that goes back before our modern era. For instance, Fort recorded a number of interesting ocean-based UFOsightings. One of them, from 1845, Is especially intriguing. It took place inthe Mediterranean Sea, not far from Sicily and Malta. The latitude and longitudewere given with precision by the Captain, who described three luminous bodiesrising up from the sea about half a mile from the ship. The objects were visiblefor 10 minutes. A Malta newspaper reported the event: On June 18th, at 9h 30m p.m., the brig Victoria, from Newcastle to Malta, inlat. 36° 40' 56”, long. 13° 44' 36”, was becalmed, with no appearance of badweather, when her topgallant and royal masts suddenly went over the side as ifcarried away by a squall. Two hours it blew very hard from the east, and whilstall hands were aloft reefing topsails, it suddenly fell calm again, and theyfelt an overpowering heat and stench of sulphur. At this moment three luminousbodies issued from the sea, about half a mile from the vessel, and remainedvisible for ten minutes (it is not said what became of them). Soon after itbegan to blow hard again, and the vessel got into a current of cold fresh air. The sulphur connection is intriguing, since many UFO accounts have beenconnected to the smell of sulphur, as are accounts of so-called ball lightning.The latter is sometimes used as an explanation for UFO sightings. This isironic, since there is no adequate understanding or explanation for balllightning itself. Unfortunately, we have nothing more on this event from1845.[38] [index_split_006.html#filepos1197285] Another interesting ocean-based UFO report came from March 22, 1870, fromF.W. Banner, captain of a ship named The Lady of the Lake. As he wrote in hisship’s log, this occurred just north of the equator in the Atlantic Ocean,almost dead center between South America and Africa. For one thousand miles inany direction, there is nothing but water. On that day, the sailors of the shipsaw a remarkable object, somewhat resembling a cloud, but not exactly. Thisobject was circular and divided into four parts. According to the Captain, ithad a “central dividing shaft beginning at the center of the circle andextending far outward, and then curving backward.” In other words, it was acircular object with something that looked like a hook. The object started froma point south-southeast, about 20 degrees above the horizon, to a pointnortheast of the ship, about 80 degrees above the horizon. It was light gray incolor, and much lower than the clouds. According to the sailors, it traveledagainst the wind. They watched it for thirty minutes, when it finally was lostin the evening darkness.[39] [index_split_006.html#filepos1197533] Save a small, devoted, following, Fort received little attention for most ofhis life. Such is the price to pay for being so far ahead of your own time. Itwas not until fifteen years after his death that the modern UFO age was born in1947, with the sighting of “flying saucers” by the pilot Kenneth Arnold. It wasonly then, in the following years, that many others began to look at the earlierperiod of human history in a different light. Summary When we think about early UFOs, we ought to shed many of the arguments thatare currently used to justify them. Too many collapse under scrutiny, too manyhave relied upon sloppy translations of ancient texts, or even spurious texts.Too many others have made unwarranted interpretations of ancient artwork. Andall too many commentators have done little more than trustfully copy and pasteinformation from one website to another, without the slightest bother toinvestigate claims. As a result, many arguments have been made with poorevidence, speculation has taken on the status of “proven fact” in the mind ofthe public, and hyperbole has infested the entire subject. Responsible investigators are obligated to do more. As we work to understandthis difficult topic, we must take care to draw conclusions that are warrantedby the evidence, and to know where to draw the line. There is nothing wrong withexperiencing uncertainty. Having said that, there is some reason for the hype regarding ancient UFOs.When looking at the big picture with an open mind, we can see there are reasonsto think that they have been here for a very long time. The evidence we have maynever be enough to make it a certainty, but even now there is enough to persuadea reasonable mind that highly advanced beings may well have been interactingwith Planet Earth and its inhabitants, including humanity, for millennia. In other words, we seem to have a hole in our history. Chapter 3Into Modernity: Airships, Foo Fighters, and Flying Saucers, 1896 to 1969 Even before the term “flying saucer” became a global catchphrase in 1947,unknown and unexplained aerial objects had become surprisingly common. As earlyas the turn of the twentieth century, the phenomenon had become a genuinemystery, even if no one quite realized it at the time. Of course, the twentieth century was the century of human aviation. It isnatural that, once people took to the air, some contraptions would genuinelymystify onlookers back then, just as they do today. Even so, by the year 1900there were reports of things seen in the sky, sometimes on the ground, andsometimes in the waters of this great Earth, which baffled people then and a fewof which baffle us today. A good UFO story can be a bit like a good ghost story. Both are inexplicableand incredible; both challenge our beliefs and can make us uncomfortable. Yet,simply because we are generally taught that neither phenomena really exists,there will always be people who follow their own mind, who have an innatecuriosity about their world. For such people, stories like the ones that followcan be fascinating, even exhilarating. The Airships Many people think of 1947 as the starting point of the UFO story. This isunderstandable, since that was when the phenomenon truly entered popularawareness. But as the previous chapter has shown, unknown aerial phenomena werebeing seen long before then. Yet, sightings were sporadic and hardly of much public notice. That is, untilthe end of the nineteenth century. In 1896, save for birds, occasional balloons, and a few early gliders, theskies of Planet Earth were clear. On rare occasions, one could see anexperimental airship, essentially early blimps. But these were few indeed, andnearly all of them were in Europe. They were also primitive. The range of theseairships did not exceed five or ten miles. They had terrible steering and wereprone to crashes and deaths. Not until 1900, when the first Zeppelin waslaunched, did the golden age of airships begin, and that was across the AtlanticOcean in Europe. All of which makes the American airship sightings from 1896 to 1897 the firsttrue wave of UFO sightings in the modern world. To this day, they remain agenuine mystery. Over 1,500 newspaper articles discussed them. They flew withintensely bright searchlights, sometimes very high up, sometimes low,occasionally lighting an area as though it were daylight. Amid the fuss, peoplesometimes claimed to meet (the entirely human) occupants of these ships, whounfortunately never seemed to give away much valuable information. For sixmonths, people claimed to see them. Then, just as suddenly, the airships weregone.[40] [index_split_006.html#filepos1197787] Traditionally, the story began in Sacramento, California on November 17,1896, although later research has shown that sporadic sightings of vague aerialphenomena had been reported up and down the U.S. west coast in the previousmonths.[41] [index_split_006.html#filepos1198194] Newspapers reported thathundreds of people saw a light pass over the city, like “an electric arc lamppropelled by some mysterious force.”[42] [index_split_006.html#filepos1198527]It traveled so low to the ground that it took evasive action as it approachedbuildings and hills, and people claimed to hear voices coming from it. Then itflew away. We are told that it returned to Sacramento three days later, and thenon the following day (November 21), it was seen over nearby Oakland. In thiscase, we have an artist's illustration showing a large airship, perhaps 200 feetlong, with powerful headlights shining down. It is worth remembering that thesource of power needed for an intensely bright searchlight at that time wouldhave been extremely heavy, and definitely was not a practical item carried byairships back then. The airship, or something, returned to Sacramento on November 25. Peoplereported seeing a bright light circling the city at “high speed,” whatever thatwould have been. We are told that many observers, including high-ranking stateofficials, saw it, and they were convinced it was not an astronomical body. Whatwas it? We do not know. Some of these airship sightings were obvious hoaxes, and American journalismat the time did enjoy the occasional tongue-in-cheek story. One man, forinstance, claimed that while driving his buggy through the countryside, hehappened across a landed metallic spacecraft roughly 150 feet long. Threeslender seven-foot tall beings approached him while “making a strange warblingnoise.” They tried to force him into their ship, but were not strong enough, sothey simply flew off in their ship. This is the first modern claim of anattempted alien abduction. It is also an amusing yarn.[43][index_split_006.html#filepos1198797] Another witness said the group he met claimed to be from the lost tribe ofIsrael. Yet another group of airship pilots allegedly claimed to be going off tofight Spain (this was shortly before the Spanish-American War). One witness saidan airship landed on his pasture in Rockland, Texas. One of the pilots, anordinary man, asked for lubricating oil, chisels, and bluestone. Then he paidfor them, presumably with valid currency. When the witness tried to inspect theairship, another occupant stopped him, although he promised to return to takehim for a ride. The airship then took off “like a shot out of a gun.”[44][index_split_006.html#filepos1199048] Incidentally, bluestone has a high silicacontent that can generate electricity under pressure; one cuts it by soaking itin water and striking it with a chisel. Two of the most dramatic airship cases occurred in Chicago, Illinois, andAurora, Texas. Chicago's event took place on April 9, 1897. The local newspaperreported that thousands of people saw bright, intense, lights circling the citythat night. No one was sure if this was a true airship, but it seemed to be somesort of floating object “miles above the earth.” A few people claimed to see twocigar-shaped objects joined together and with great wings. From time to time itwas illuminated by the rays of two giant searchlights.[45][index_split_006.html#filepos1199498][images/00020.jpg]Sketch of a mystery airship seen over San Fransicso, November 19, 1896. However, the town of Aurora, Texas takes the prize for the most dramaticairship story. Early in the morning of April 17, according to a story in theDallas Morning News, one of these airships crashed into a local windmill. Theoccupant, who was declared to be “not an inhabitant of this world,” was dead andmangled. The wreckage was said to be a mixture of silver and aluminum, and wassaid to have weighed several tons. Whatever happened to it was never mentioned,other than that locals descended upon it and presumably scavenged all thepieces. Some of it was allegedly dumped into a nearby well.[46][index_split_006.html#filepos1199777] The deceased occupant had been carrying “papers” which were indecipherableand, a la Roswell, written in some unknown hieroglyphic. The dead alien had evenbeen buried in the town cemetery, according to the article. An interestingaddendum to this story is that, years later in 1973, investigators with theMutual UFO Network (MUFON) discovered the alleged stone marker used in thisburial. Their metal detectors indicated that something unusual might have beenburied there, but they were not allowed to dig. A few years later, when theyreturned to try again, the headstone was gone, as was whatever metallic materiallay beneath it. There has been a great deal written about the Aurora case, both pro and con,as with the airship mystery itself. Unfortunately, throughout the period ofairship sightings, no investigator is known to have performed a trueinvestigation or analysis. More recently, the television show UFO Hunters airedan episode in which investigators were allowed to unseal the well where it wasbelieved the remains of the wreckage had been deposited. Water taken from thewell tested normal, except for large amounts of aluminum. Although the wellcontained no apparent wreckage, it was stated that large pieces of metal hadbeen removed from the well by a past owner of the property. The investigationalso refuted earlier statements from an elderly resident in 1979, that theproperty in question never had a windmill. On the contrary, the UFO Huntersinvestigation found the remains of a windmill base near the well site. Does thismean that what happened at Aurora was a genuine UFO event? We are still far fromany confirmation.[47] [index_split_006.html#filepos1200544] Many people at the time suspected the airships were a new American invention.So many inquiries reached the inventor Thomas Edison that he made a publicstatement denying any connection to the airships. Recently, there have beenclaims that there were American inventors who were developing state-of-the-artairships at the time. It has been suggested that an unknown inventor withfinancial backing was responsible. One supposes that this could be possible, andit does seem that there were a few prototype airships being flown around theMidwest in the mid-and late 1890s.[48] [index_split_006.html#filepos1201125] Yet, the airships of 1896 and 1897 were at least ten years ahead of the restof the world. That may not sound like much, but it is of great importance. Theentire matter comes down to whether or not one credits the newspaper accounts,since the performance capabilities of these airships were vastly superior thaneven the Zeppelins of a few years later. That takes some doing if we areconsidering a clandestine human agency. How could these prototypes have remainedsecret to this day? It is also helpful to recall that many of the sightings were merely presumedto be airships. A number of them were of unusual lights in the night sky, verymuch like UFO reports of today. A number of them truly could have been anything,but that surely does not make them alien craft. In considering the airships, is it possible that we are dealing with someextraordinary agency? Could it be that some group, whether from “here” or not,allowed themselves to appear in a more-or-less conventional manner so as not toterrify witnesses? Perhaps, too, to inspire them toward new developments inaviation? Could the airships have been a demonstration by an extraterrestrialagency for the purpose of sparking human innovation? Or simply a confusioncaused by a variety of factors, including misidentification, hoaxes, andhysteria? Questions and more questions. Few answers. After the Airships It was once assumed that UFOs were not seen between the airship sightings of1897 and the 1940s. In reality, unexplained sightings, while much less reportedthan today, continued through the early decades of the twentieth century. Somewere extraordinary. One such case occurred at sea on February 28, 1904 when crew members aboardthe USS Supply, a Navy ship 400 miles southwest of San Francisco saw threelarge, red, glowing objects in a close triangle formation. For two minutes, theobjects were seen passing beneath the clouds at about a mile in altitude. Theyapproached the ship, levelled off, then climbed back through the clouds and outof sight. The ship’s Commander, Lieutenant Frank Schofield, who later became anAdmiral and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Battle Fleet, appears to havebeen one of the witnesses. The event was reported in the New York Times, whichdescribed the largest of the objects [described as “meteors” in the article] ashaving an apparent area of six suns and being egg-shaped, with the sharper endforward. The other two objects were round.[49][index_split_006.html#filepos1201684] In 1908 and 1909, there were some odd aerial events in New England, severalin December 1909. Mostly these were very bright lights, either circling in thesky or moving across. Airplanes were still not common at all, so it remainsstrange. Still, we have to be careful. During the following month, for instance,similar sightings occurred in the American South. For several days in January,1910, there were airship sightings in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thousands ofpeople rushed out of their homes in broad daylight to see a huge, white,cigar-shaped object, plainly in view, flying around above the city. This went onfor several days in a row, until the so-called airship was captured. It was a 15foot-long home-made balloon set aloft as a prank.[50][index_split_006.html#filepos1202209] One of most interesting sightings of the early twentieth century occurred innortheastern Tibet on August 5, 1927. The person who recorded it was an artistand philosopher named Nicholas Roerich, who was leading a trek in the Himalayas.In his diary, he described how members of his party were observing a large blackeagle in the sky, when someone noticed something more interesting far above thebird. Roerich wrote:> We all saw, in the direction north to south, something big and shiny> reflecting sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp this> thing changed in its direction from south to southwest, and we saw how it> disappeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field> glasses and saw quite distinctly the oval form with the shiny surface, one> side of which was brilliant from the sun. This would appear to be a very solid UFO incident. After all, what silvery,oval, huge object could fly through northeastern Tibet in 1927? Still, no caseis immune from attempts at conventional explanation. In this instance, someresearchers believe they found the answer. Amazingly, it turns out thatRoerich's group were not the only explorers traveling through China and Tibet atthat time. A Swedish expedition was also in the general region and, believe itor not, they launched several weather balloons at around this time. We do nothave precise dates, unfortunately, but some appear to have been launched inAugust, 1927, the month of the sighting.[51][index_split_006.html#filepos1202683] Could one of these balloons have been what Roerich's group saw? It would seemlogical to conclude yes, especially when recalling that weather balloons werequite rare and could well have fooled an observer. On the other hand, there isreason to doubt the balloon explanation. The main problem is that the Swedish group was never closer than 400 miles toRoerich's party, and the balloons were not larger than four feet in diameter;many were smaller. Realistically, for any of those balloons to have been visibleto Roerich's group, they would had to have been launched much closer. Oneresearcher pointed out that, even if launched a mere one mile away, it wouldhave been nearly impossible to see such a balloon with the naked eye. Considerhow insignificant a three- or four-foot balloon would have appeared at adistance of even two or three miles. Yet, Roerich described the object as huge,brilliant, and oval-shaped. The clincher, however, is that 400 miles appears to be beyond the range ofany weather balloon. Most never travel more than 100 miles from their point oforigin before bursting, although the jet stream might enable some to travelaround 150 miles in a few cases.[52] [index_split_006.html#filepos1203044] All of which leaves us with a genuine mystery. Still, there are those whofind extraordinary explanations distasteful. One supposes that such peoplecould, if pressed to the wall, argue that a small balloon miraculously traveledmore than 400 miles to be seen by a completely separate expedition. A stretch,obviously, but what else is there? Unless, of course, it was a genuine aliencraft. No doubt there were many other startling sightings from the 1920s and 1930swhich are now lost to us forever. People essentially had no way to report suchthings. However, some years ago while visiting the Canadian National Archives inOttawa, I came across several extraordinary reports. These were sightings thatordinary people reported to their government, hoping that somehow it would be ofinterest. In fact, the Canadian government did nothing with these reports, butthey are archived for anyone to read. A few of them describe events that tookplace as far back as far as the 1930s. One was submitted in the early 1980s by an elderly man who described hisexperience in the Northwest Territories in 1936. This is a remote area, nearlyas large as Alaska, inhabited by very few people. His exact location, AylmerLake, was especially remote. This is within a large region known as the BarrenGrounds, a tundra zone in the Canadian Arctic where trees do not grow and where,to this day, nobody lives. The writer was 25 years old at the time, employed bythe government in aerial mapping operations. He wrote:> At the time of the sighting, I was standing on the float of my aircraft> performing a before-flight inspection when I happened to glance skyward and> detected the vehicle in question, completely stationary. How long it had been> there and for whatever reason I have no idea. At the time the sky was azure> blue, completely clear of all cumulus and cirrus clouds (C.A.V.U.), making it> virtually impossible to determine the height of the object in question.> In trying to describe this vehicle, I can only say that it was the most> magnificent configuration of an airship one could imagine. I would say it was> very large, but this would depend on the height, which as stated could not be> determined. He then described some salient features of the object, including a lightaluminum color but no shine, an elliptical shape, and no portholes. The object was stationary for a moment, then it rotated. He continued:> From a north/south stationary position it turned east in a moment. The turning> was hardly detectable to the eye. After the turn, it took off at a fantastic> speed going east. From the time of takeoff until it vanished was a matter of> moments. He added that it made no contrail when it departed. The writer attached hisservice record in order to confirm his identity.[53][index_split_006.html#filepos1203580] Truly an amazing story. Incredible technology in one of the most remoteregions on Earth. World War Two It was during the Second World War that UFO reports became more common. Ofcourse, this makes perfect sense. It was only during the 1940s that largenumbers of people began to fly in the skies. Above the clouds with perfectvisibility, there were now many more chances to see what was up there. Radar wasanother new development, enabling electronic detection of aerial objects. Thus,our ability to sense the world around us increased dramatically. Sure enough,people began to notice many more strange things in the skies. These strangeobjects were eventually given a name: foo fighters. Even today, researchersdisagree on what they were. But there is no question they remain the greatestmystery of the war. The first important UFO sighting of the war was so significant that it hasits own name: the Battle of Los Angeles. This happened early in the morning ofFebruary 25, 1942, a mere three months after Pearl Harbor. The U.S. was in aheightened state of alert regarding the Japanese threat. In fact, Japanesesubmarines were off the U.S. coast at the time, and there had been a minormilitary engagement just a few days before. Then, at around 2 a.m. on February25, several radars detected an unidentified target over the ocean, about 120miles west of Los Angeles. Within minutes, anti-aircraft batteries were onalert, ready for action. A small number of fighter planes were on the ground butalso ready. The target was tracked on radar to within a few miles of the coast.At 2:21 a.m., a city blackout was ordered. This is when things became a bit confusing. In the first place, the radartarget vanished. Next, personnel started reporting enemy planes. One colonelthought he saw about twenty-five planes over Los Angeles. Shortly after 3:00a.m., anti-aircraft batteries opened fire. Some 1,430 rounds were fired into thesky—not over the ocean, but right over the city. Three citizens actually diedfrom the shelling, and three more from heart attacks attributed to the shelling.A great deal of property damage was also inflicted. This is not surprising,considering that roughly nine tons of ordnance had been fired into the air.Oddly, no debris of the object (or objects) was ever known to have beenrecovered. So what was in the sky that night? Army Chief of Staff George Marshall wrote to President Roosevelt that,“unidentified airplanes, other than American Army or Navy planes, were probablyover Los Angeles.” But, in fact, these could not have been Japanese planes. Theonly possible source for any such planes would have been an aircraft carrier,and none were nearby. In all the records of the war, nothing even hints ofJapanese planes flying over Los Angeles at any time. If not enemy military aircraft, could they have been commercial aircraft? Thequestion is a fair one, but, once again, there is no evidence suggestinganything of the sort. Commercial aircraft were certainly not coming in over thePacific at 3:00 a.m. Moreover, no commercial aircraft would have withstood theartillery barrage; they would have been shot out of the sky. Navy Secretary Frank Knox suggested it was all a big mistake caused by “warnerves.” Nothing flew over the city, he said. That statement earned him a heapof scorn from the Los Angeles media, and even some of the area military. Could our old friends, balloons, have been behind this? In fact, meteorological balloons were in the thick of the action that night.They may even have triggered the shelling itself. Because wind conditionsaffected the trajectory of a shell, regiments often released balloons todetermine how the wind was blowing. At 3:00 a.m., when all of Los Angeles was in a state of red-alert, whensearchlights were on and anti-aircraft gunners were ready to fire, two of theseballoons were set aloft, each one with a candle inside to improve itsvisibility. Since the barrage also started at 3:00 a.m., it is reasonable toconclude that the balloons triggered it. In fact, this is what some historiansconclude: the excitement of that night stemmed from a faulty radar reading,balloons, and inexperienced, nervous gunners. On the face of it, this seems reasonable. It may even be true. The onlyproblem is that most of the eyewitness accounts do not support it. In the firstplace, several witnesses stated that they saw anywhere from fifteen totwenty-five objects in the sky. There were two balloons in the sky, possibly afew others that remain unaccounted for, but certainly not fifteen. Additionally,people were reporting objects in the sky fifteen minutes before the firstballoon was launched. Many witnesses also maintained that the objects were unaffected by theshelling. One witness, an experienced Navy observer, counted nine silver-coloredplanes through high-quality binoculars. He said they passed from one battery ofsearchlights to another, all while under heavy fire from the guns below. There is also a photograph from that night, a truly remarkable image. Thesmall lights scattered around the searchlights are exploding shells, visuallyinteresting but not unusual. It is the object in the center of the searchlightsthat some believe is a genuine extraterrestrial craft. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an expert in photographic analysis, believed the objectto be roughly 100 feet or more in diameter. If correct, this would be a problemfor the balloon theory, since the balloons launched were a mere four feet indiameter. Ultimately, while we cannot entirely rule out a conventional explanation suchas balloons, there is reason to consider that the objects over Los Angeles weregenuine UFOs. Indeed, why not? The balloon explanation presents enough problemsto make a reasonable mind wonder. If these were UFOs from some agency not of our own society or civilization,we might naturally ask what were the operators of those craft trying to do? Werethey conducting a test of some sort? Did they make a mistake? Were theyjoyriding? Unfortunately, when reflecting on these possible answers, the UFO explanationfeels equally dissatisfying. This is a key problem of the entire phenomenon. Notonly is the apparent UFO technology well beyond contemporary human capabilities,but whatever motivates their operators remains a mystery. They simply refuse tomake sense to us.[54] [index_split_006.html#filepos1203896] So much for the Battle of Los Angeles. Its interesting that the next day, on February 26, 1942, a fascinating UFOsighting is said to have taken place in the Timor Sea, north of Australia, bythe crew of the Cruiser Tromp of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Years later, a mannamed William Methorst, claiming to have been on the ship, wrote that a largemetallic-looking disk flew toward the ship at “tremendous speed.” It circledhigh above for three to four hours, and finally flew off at an estimated speedof more than 3,000 mph. Did it really happen? Australian researcher Keith Basterfield tried toconfirm the account. He discovered that the Tromp had indeed been in the TimorSea, although a few days prior to the date of the alleged encounter. By February26, it was moving down the western side of Australia, probably near the coast.Of course, this is hardly a problem, since people can easily misremember certaindetails, especially dates. Unfortunately, no one has yet confirmed that a mannamed Methorst was on the Tromp at that time. If that can ever be confirmed, wewould have a stronger case, although, once again, a skeptic can fall back to theargument that, ultimately, the story is just one person’s allegation. Still, itcould well be that the story is true.[55] [index_split_006.html#filepos1204831] There are a number of UFO stories from the war, either confirmed in militaryrecords or obtained through witness interviews. U.S. marine sergeant Stephen J.Brickner said in August 1942 while on the island of Tulagi, just west ofGuadalcanal, that he saw a huge formation of over 150 objects, faster thanJapanese planes, with no wings or tails, wobbling slightly, and dropping nobombs. He called it “the most awe-inspiring and yet frightening spectacle I’veever seen in my life.”[56] [index_split_006.html#filepos1205397] In 1944 and 1945 reports of UFOs came in from Allied pilots over Europe, soondubbed “foo fighters” in the press. A typical account came from B-17 pilotCharles Odom on a daylight raid over Germany. He said that objects “the size ofbasketballs” approached his aircraft to within three hundred feet, then almostseemed magnetized to the formation and flew alongside. After a while, theypeeled off and left. In other reports, such objects shot straight up into theair.[57] [index_split_006.html#filepos1205893] The New York Times suggested the foo fighters were new German weapons. Eventoday, one hears the claims that these were a type of German technology. TheGermans were indeed working on novel and advanced concepts in science andaviation at this time, including objects such as the Horton brothers’ flyingwing, that were shaped somewhat like flying saucers. Other, more extreme typesof craft, have been alleged but their existence rests upon assertions that havenot led to hard evidence. It comes down to whether or not what the Germans hadwas operational, and whether their creations had capabilities comparable tothose described in these reports. It is also worth asking about the Pacificsightings. Did the Germans send their experimental revolutionary aircraft to theopposite side of the Earth to help the Japanese, especially when they weredesperately trying to stay alive themselves?[58][index_split_006.html#filepos1206226] While we are asking such questions, we might wonder why the foo fightersdidn’t attack the Allied planes? Explaining the foo fighters as Germantechnology does make sense on a certain level, but in other ways it does not(more on this in the next chapter). Incidentally, we know that U.S. and Britishintelligence both investigated the foo fighters. What we do not know are theirformal conclusions. As of this writing, that has remained classified for sevendecades. One of the last good UFO reports of World War II is the Delarof case. Yearslater, a radioman named Robert Crawford reported a sighting he had with fourteenother crewmen aboard the U.S. attack transport ship, Delarof, during the summerof 1945. The ship was on its way back to Seattle, at the edge of the AlaskanAleutian Islands near the town of Adak. This is in the very northern Pacific,almost exactly halfway between North America and Asia. At around sunset in theopen sea, an object appeared out of the water about one mile from the ship. Itwas dark against the sunset, circular in shape, perhaps two hundred feet indiameter. It flew almost straight up, then made a turn and circled the ship twoor three times. Then it flew away and disappeared, leaving flashes of light inits wake. Yet another story of a craft emerging from the water. Crawford toldthis to several researchers, including atmospheric physicist Dr. James E.McDonald of the University of Arizona. The case looks good. If this eventactually happened, we would be hard-pressed to explain this as technology fromour civilization.[59] [index_split_006.html#filepos1206493] [images/00037.jpg]Photograph of an object over Los Angeles, early morning hours of February 25,1942. The small white dots are artillery bursts. Ghost Rockets With the end of something as violent and all-encompassing as the Second WorldWar, one might suppose that UFO sightings would cease. In fact, they escalated. During the spring and summer of 1946, unknown objects were seen traversingScandinavia, primarily Sweden. These were soon dubbed “ghost rockets.” Unlikethe sporadic sightings that had occurred during the World War II, or even theflurry of sightings from the airship era of 1896-97, sightings now reached intothe hundreds. Not only that, but the reported maneuverability of these “things”was extraordinary. Several were observed descending very low or even landing. Bythe summer, things had became serious enough to warrant an unofficial visit toSweden by two American generals. By the late summer, the ghost rockets werebeing reported elsewhere in Europe, most prominently France and Greece. The Cold War was beginning and tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Unionwere already high. Some analysts wondered if the Soviets, perhaps with their owngroup of captured German scientists, were sending rockets over Europe in someact of intimidation. Of course, to do so, they would have had to have tripledthe range of the German V2 rockets within less than a year, something for whichthere has never been any evidence. Today, it is clear that the Soviet Union wasnot behind the ghost rocket mystery. Years later, the Greek physicist Paul Santorini made a fascinating statementon the matter of the ghost rockets. Santorini had been involved in the ManhattanProject, and returned to Greece after the war. When the ghost rockets were seenover his country, he was charged with leading a group of scientists to determinewhat they were. Speaking in 1967 to a private researcher, Santorini said thathis team concluded the ghost rockets were neither Soviet nor rockets. At thatpoint, the Greek government, after conferring with an unnamed foreign government(presumably the U.S.), ended the investigation. To this day there is no official answer to the mystery of the ghost rockets.However, after fifty years, the conclusion of the Swedish Air IntelligenceService finally became known. It reads:> ... some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the> conclusion that ‘these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical> skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on earth.’ They> are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously> unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the earth. It would have been nice to have made that conclusion public in 1946. Or wouldit?[60] [index_split_006.html#filepos1207040] 1947 Then came 1947. This was when matters really became interesting. As we haveseen, there was no shortage of unexplained aerial activity in the years before,but it was the sighting by private pilot Kenneth Arnold, on June 24, 1947, thatmade international headlines and created a new global awareness. Arnold wasflying near the Cascade Mountains in the state of Washington, when he saw aformation of nine bright, very fast objects moving along in a column. He wasstartled because he saw no tail on them, and initially thought they wereexperimental jets. What struck him, though, was their speed. He decided toestimate their speed between two mountain peaks that he knew were fifty milesapart. They covered this distance in less than two minutes, which he calculatedto be an astonishing 1,700 mph. That seemed too fast, so he reworked hisnumbers, allowing for all possible errors, arriving at the still amazing speedof 1,200 mph. In 1947, no flying craft could reach much more than half thatspeed. When he landed, there were reporters nearby. Arnold told them all about hissighting, describing the movement of the objects “like speed boats on roughwater” or “like a saucer would if you skipped it across water.” The phrase“flying saucer” was born. Not only that, but so was a mania. For the next several weeks, people aroundthe United States reported seeing flying saucers. Many of these were mistakensightings of aircraft, balloons, and God knows what else. Not surprisingly,there were hoaxes from people wanting to poke fun at it all. A number ofreports, however, appear to be legitimate. Several were military reports withmultiple witnesses. A good example is the series of sightings from Muroc ArmyAirfield in the California desert, on July 8, 1947 (later renamed Edwards AirForce Base). That day, there were four separate sightings of a highly unusualobject that maneuvered in ways that defied explanation. The big event of 1947 was the crash of something in the New Mexico desert,not far from the Roswell Army Air Field. The Roswell story has been studied anddebated endlessly. On July 8, the local newspaper reported that Roswell Army AirField had announced the “capture of a flying saucer.” The story made thenewswires, and the town was besieged with inquiries from around the world. Then,within hours, the Army made a second announcement, this time saying that whathad crashed had simply been a weather balloon. For more than thirty years,people simply forgot about Roswell. Then in 1978, by sheer luck, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman met the retiredLieutenant Colonel Jesse Marcel, who had been at the crash site. Marcel toldFriedman that what had crashed there was no weather balloon but, in his opinion,was technology not from our world. Through the 1980s and 1990s, and into the21st century, investigators have reopened the Roswell case, finding otherwitnesses and family members of deceased witnesses. A good argument has beenmade that the Roswell crash was indeed something exotic. Could this something beextraterrestrial? In my own view, I would say the answer is yes. Many witnesseshave come forward with explicit statements that support the story in one way oranother. We shall return to this in greater detail in Chapter 5. From this point onward, unknown craft were more or less being reported withregularity within the U.S. military. Just a month after Roswell somethingextraordinary was seen over Harmon Field, an American base on the island of Guamin the Pacific. This case is not as well-known as it ought to be. A report aboutit was sent to Army intelligence and 6th Army headquarters. It stated that threeU.S. soldiers saw two “unidentified flying objects” on the morning of August 14,1947. The objects were “small, crescent shaped and traveling at a speed twicethat of a fighter plane.” This was roughly the speed Kenneth Arnold calculatedfor his flying saucers two months earlier. The report stated that the objectspassed over the field in a zig-zag motion at roughly 1,200 feet altitude, whichis fairly low. They then went west and disappeared into clouds. Shortlyafterward, one of objects emerged from the clouds and proceeded west. Nothingelse is known of the case. Suffice to say that zigzagging was not then, and isnot today, part of the capabilities of any known human created aircraft.[61][index_split_006.html#filepos1207592] Some of the best UFO reports of this period are connected with the U.S.military. From the end of 1948 and well into 1949, a phenomenon known as theGreen Fireballs was seen and tracked over Los Alamos Laboratories in New Mexico,the main center of nuclear technology in the world. These “fireballs” traveledlow, horizontally, and silently. Within classified meetings, leading scientistsand military officers discussed the phenomenon. To this day, more than sixtyyears later, we still do not have a good explanation. It must be added that theman who studied them the most carefully, Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, a meteor expert fromthe University of New Mexico, came away convinced they were artificial—notmeteors—and perhaps one of the keys to the whole UFO phenomenon.[62][index_split_006.html#filepos1207899] The Army recorded UFOs over and over again. A January 1949 memo from KirtlandAFB, in Albuquerque spoke of a UFO being reported by around 30 people andestimated, “at least 100 total sightings” at the base.[images/00009.jpg]Classified memo pertaining to UFOs seen at Kirtland AFB, 1949. During the summer of 1950, a memo from Hanford Atomic Energy Commission inthe State of Washington—another nuclear connection—also mentioned multiplesightings of unknown “round” objects over the plant. Intriguingly, it mentionedfailed interception attempts by Air Force jets. Up to this point, there had been a handful of photographs taken of allegedUFOs. But two pictures taken on May 11, 1950 surpassed anything up to thatpoint, as well as most photos since. These were taken in McMinnville, Oregon, byMr. and Mrs. Paul Trent, a farming couple who saw a classic flying saucer overtheir land in the early evening. They took two clear photographs of it. Over the years, skeptics made several attempts to prove the photos were ahoax. This is the only viable method to debunk them, as there is no other way tointerpret them as anything other than images of a “flying saucer.” Severalcomputer enhancement tests, however, proved conclusively that the object was nota model suspended on a string—the only evident hoax possibility. Everyone whoknew the Trents judged them as good, honest people. To the end of their lives inthe 1990s, they stood by their story, and the photographs remain a major pieceof UFO evidence.[63] [index_split_006.html#filepos1208327] [images/00013.jpg]The second of the two Trent photographs, with the object enlarged in inset. Belgian Congo Mines The number of serious military and government UFO records we have is quiteimpressive. One is a CIA report from 1952, released years later via the U.S.Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It is a reprint of a news account of twocraft over a uranium mine in the Belgian Congo. The report described “two fierydisks” over the uranium mines in the southern part of the country. They weresaid to glide in “elegant curves and changed their positions many times.” Afterhovering in one spot, they took off in a zigzag motion to the northeast. Peopleheard a hissing and buzzing sound. The sighting lasted 10 to 12 minutes. The report continued:> Commander Pierre of the small Elizabethville airfield immediately set out in> pursuit with a fighter plane. On his first approach he came within 120 meters> of the disks...The disks traveled in a precise flight maneuver… the disks> often shot down to within 20 meters of the tree tops...Pierre had to give up> pursuit after 15 minutes since both disks, with a loud whistling sound which> he heard despite the noise of his own plane, disappeared in a straight line> toward Lake Tanganyika. He estimated their speed at 1500 kilometers per> hour...Pierre is regarded as a dependable and zealous flyer. There is no other information on this case, but for sure, in addition toincredible performance characteristics, we are seeing much interest by the UFOoperators in nuclear technology. 1952 and Washington, DC 1952 was a critically important year for UFOs. Within the U.S. and throughoutthe world, there were many perplexing sightings. This included several weekendsin a row of baffling objects over the Capitol in Washington, D.C. To this day,these events remain unexplained in any conventional sense. There are a number of statements from air traffic controllers and pilotsregarding visual and radar contact during the nights of July 19-20, and July26-27. According to Harry Barnes, the senior air traffic controller during thefirst weekend, the movements of the UFOs “were completely radical compared tothose of ordinary aircraft…. For six hours, there were at least tenunidentifiable objects moving above Washington. They were not ordinaryaircraft.”[64] [index_split_006.html#filepos1208721] I was fortunate to interview the last surviving air traffic controller whoworked during those weekends. Howard Cocklin was 90 years old when I spoke withhim in 2008. His testimony clearly supported what others had also said, namelythat there were visual and radar unidentifieds tracked by traffic controllersand pilots that night. He believed they were not of our civilization. Two monthsafter our interview, he passed away.[65] [index_split_006.html#filepos1208991] Air Force interceptors were sent, but never with success. On the secondweekend, one interceptor made radar and visual contact—the pilot saw severalglowing objects, but no one could catch them. The Air Force told the nation thatall the confusion was caused by false radar returns and unusual weather. Sufficeto say, many disbelieved that assessment, particularly in the classified world,but more on that in the next chapter. Aerial Encounters and Air Space Violations Fascinating UFO cases continued throughout the 1950s, many of which weremilitary encounters. One memo discusses a black colored UFO over Oak Ridge,Tennessee, another key atomic facility, in August, 1953. According to thedocument:> No sound was heard. The object flew east at a tremendous speed for what> appeared to be three miles where it stopped. The object was then joined by two> more of these same objects. A formation similar to a spread ‘V‘ was formed,> and the objects, at a tremendous speed, flew in an eastward direction. This is yet another report that describes exceptional performance that wasnot supposed to be possible. Quite a few reports describe intrusions of sensitive airspace, such as onefrom August, 1954 (with the heading “Emergency”) which originated from theflight service center at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. This was sent to theCommander of Air Defense Command (ADC) in Colorado. The report describes a“strange, stationary object, variable in brilliance” which moved rapidly, andthen returned to its original position. The base sent a helicopter toinvestigate. The pilot’s assessment: “definitely not a star.” Personnel inmilitary and civilian towers watched this object, as the object dimmed, glowedred a little bit, then disappeared. Could it have been a star? The personnel involved at the time certainlywondered the same thing. They concluded, however, that it was not. According tothe report: “...pilot of helicopter wished to stress fact that the object was ofa saucer-like nature, was stationary at 2000 ft., and would be glad to be calledupon to verify any statement and act as witness.” This report was sent to theCIA, the NSA, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and each of the military services.Apparently a number of people thought it was important. Several of the military encounters not only involved visual confirmation, butsimultaneous radar tracking. One is described in a CIA document dated July 12,1955, an extraordinary case that lasted a full 49 minutes over Newfoundland,Canada. Another such case occurred on July 17, 1957. This involved the six-mancrew of an Air Force RB-47 electronic warfare aircraft. For 800 miles, whilethis aircraft flew over the southeastern U.S., it was accompanied by a craftthat showed incredible maneuverability and speed. At one point the object simplystopped suddenly in midair as the plane flew past it; at another point, iteasily pulled away, even though the plane had accelerated to its top speed. Atyet another time, it blinked out simultaneously, both visually and on radar, andthen reappeared. All instruments were functioning perfectly. Needless to say,the experienced crew was very uneasy about their escort. After 800 miles ofthis, the UFO disappeared over Oklahoma City. Encounters with Beings The U.S. military did not have a monopoly on interesting UFO encountersduring the 1950s. People from around the world were experiencing and reportingsuch impossibilities. During the fall of 1954, from September through December, something strangewas being reported throughout much of the world. It started in France and Italy,then spread to Britain, Germany, and other European countries. Reports thensprang out of the Middle East, and the focus eventually shifted to SouthAmerica, primarily Venezuela and Brazil. Quite simply, people were claiming to have encounters with small humanoidbeings who had landed in strange craft. This was not the first time people hadmade such claims, but it was the first time so many were reported within such ashort period of time. The number of cases was unmatched for almost twenty years. One of the first such reports came from Quarouble, France, near the Belgianborder, on the evening of September 10, 1954. At around 10:30 p.m., MariusDewilde heard his dogs barking outside and decided to see what was going on. Onthe nearby railroad track only twenty feet away, he saw a dark mass. When heheard footsteps, he turned his flashlight on the path, where he saw two veryshort beings (between three and four feet tall) wearing what he called “diver’ssuits.” He approached to within a mere six feet, when a brilliant light camefrom the object on the tracks. This blinded and paralyzed him. The two creaturesthen moved toward the object. When the beam light went out, Dewilde continued toapproach the track, but the object was now rising, giving off a “thick darksteam” and a low whistling sound. It glowed red, then it flew away. On thewooden railroad ties were found five imprints; later calculations were that athirty-ton weight would have been necessary to produce them. Oddities continuedto occur in the immediate aftermath of the incident. One of Dewilde’s dogs diedjust three days after the event, and he began suffering from respiratoryproblems. Meanwhile, it was claimed that three cows in nearby farms were founddead, with subsequent examination revealing that their blood had been completelyremoved.[66] [index_split_006.html#filepos1209338] [images/00032.jpg]Marius Dewilde describing his encounter. Another case from the region, this time in Flanders, Belgium, occurred on thenight of September 26. A man was returning to the village on his bicycle when hesaw a saucer-shaped object in a field. He approached and hid in some bushes. Hesaw two small men wearing helmets and carrying instruments of some sort. Theytook something from the ground, and then one of the instruments emitted a flashof light. At this point, he saw a screen in which a face appeared to speak tohim, although he could not hear anything. The instruments then were dismantledby the little men and reloaded into the object. They then had an animatedconversation between them, sometimes pointing towards the witness. Afraid, thewitness shut his eyes and was unable to move. When he reopened his eyes, he sawone of the little beings entering the craft. As soon as it rose, he ran out, butwas struck by a beam of light and did not see the craft leave. A fantasticstory, to be sure. Not all these reports consisted of small beings. Some were of very tallbeings, and others of perfectly human-looking beings. One, from south-centralFrance on October 4, typifies this. A man, regarded as trustworthy by thelocals, saw a round flying object, about the size of a small truck, land in hisfield. A door slid open and two “normal” men in brown coveralls came out. Theylooked like Europeans and shook hands with the witness. Then they asked, “Paris?North?” The shocked witness could not even answer. The two strangers petted hisdog and flew away. The story is reminiscent of some of the airship encountersfrom years before. It also seem odd, from a 21st century perspective, that suchtravelers would lack basic navigational tools (GPS, anyone?) to such a degreethat they would ask someone for directions to Paris. Here, again, we see one ofthe core features of the UFO phenomenon: reliable people reporting events thatsmack of the absurd. There were many of these reports. The easiest thing to do is ignore them. Butthere are hundreds of them from 1954, from witnesses who were deemed to besincere at the time they were interviewed, often by police. Incidentally, even the U.S. Air Force had at least one official report of aUFO “occupant” during this period. The incident occurred in the Azores Islandson September 21, 1954. A guard at the Santa Maria Airport reported a ten-footwide, metallic blue object with a clear glass or plastic nose. It made a hummingsound, hovered, and landed vertically about fifty feet from the witness. Anormal-sized blond man emerged from the object, spoke in an unknown language,and patted the witness on the shoulder. The strange blond man returned to thecraft, attached a harness, pressed a button, and ascended vertically. The totalencounter lasted three minutes. This incident was listed in the files of ProjectBlue Book, the Air Force’s official UFO office, not as a hoax, but as anunknown![67] [index_split_006.html#filepos1210029] Throughout the remainder of the 1950s, there were many alleged encounterswith extraterrestrials. Many of these took the form of direct contact andcommunication from seemingly benevolent extraterrestrial visitors, sometimesreferred to as “the space brothers.” These claims are a distinct phenomenonaltogether, and the “contactees” will be discussed in a later chapter. There is at least one more encounter from the 1950s that deserves mention.This was not part of the 1954 sightings, but took place over a series ofencounters on June 26 and 27, 1959, in the remote region of Papua, New Guinea.It involved multiple sightings of a hovering craft, with much mutual waving andapparent good will exchanged. The main witness was Reverend William Booth Gill, a respected man on theisland, known as scrupulously honest and decent. At around 6:45 p.m., Gill andthirty-eight other witnesses saw a shining object hovering in the air, quitelow, a mere three or four hundred feet away. The object was circular and hadlegs under it. Shining directly above it was a bright blue beam of light.Everyone saw four figures on what appeared to be a deck. It was about forty-fiveminutes after sunset, and the sky was becoming dark, although visibilityremained good. The visitors returned the next day, this time at around 6 p.m., which wasjust at sunset and therefore perfectly light. Once again, Father Gill and manyothers saw four figures on top of the ship. This time, two nearby smaller craftwere also visible. According to Father Gill’s detailed account of the incident(an 11-page single spaced report signed by over 25 witnesses):> . . . two of the figures seemed to be doing something near the center of the> deck. They were occasionally bending over and raising their arms as though> adjusting or setting up something not visible. One figure seemed to be> standing, looking down at us. At this point, Father Gill waved to the figures. To everyone’s surprise, thebeings waved back. A teacher among the witnesses then raised both of her armsand waved, and two of the figures did the same. The mutual waving went on forsome time. When it became dark, Father Gill used a flashlight to make a seriesof movements toward the craft, and the craft eventually made several waveringmotions back and forth. [images/00022.jpg]A drawing (l) of the encounter by Father Gill and the local population in Papua,New Guinea. Father William Booth Gill (r). The Reverend Norman E. G. Cruttwell (not present) who investigated the eventwrote:> . . . the facts of this sighting and the waving by the men and the responses> to the [flashlight] signals are fully corroborated by ... many of the other> witnesses in personal interview with myself. Cruttwell also reported that between June 26 and 28, there were several UFOsightings at nearby Giwa, Baniara, and Sideia. UFO researcher J. Allen Hynekalso interviewed Gill some 15 years later, finding him to be wholly credible. Skeptics Donald Menzel and Philip Klass wrote debunking pieces on thesighting. Menzel did not impugn Gill’s integrity, but theorized that the wholeencounter was an optical illusion of the planet Venus caused by Gill’s badeyesight. The malleable natives merely wanted to impress “their Great WhiteLeader” who had a “god-like” status with them. Klass, for his part, did impugnGill’s character, claiming that the Reverend invented or imagined the encounterin order to please Cruttwell. Considering the incredible nature of the sighting,it is interesting that these were the most damaging arguments skeptics were ableto offer.[68] [index_split_006.html#filepos1210351] Abductions Even during the 1950s, there was more than just sightings of beings; therewere also claims of alien abduction. This will be explored in greater detail inChapter 8, but it is helpful to mention here some of the better known cases ofthe era. The first well-known UFO abduction case involved a young Brazilian farmernamed Antonio Villas-Boas, who lived near Sao Paulo. Boas had an apparentabduction experience on the night of October 15, 1957. He gave a detaileddescription of the inside of the craft and its occupants: they wore tight, whiteclothing with a light on their belt, white shoes with no heels, large gloves,and opaque helmets with a slit at the level of the eyes. He claimed to have beenstripped naked and given a medical exam in which one of the beings spread aliquid over his skin. He was then led to another room, where they took someblood from his chin, then left him alone. An unpleasant odor caused him tovomit. Eventually, an alien female entered the room, entirely naked. She wasattractive but seems very much like later descriptions of a human-alien hybrid:she had hair that was nearly white, large slanted blue eyes, an ordinary nose,small but ordinary ears, high cheekbones, and a pointed chin. They had sex, butthis was no fantasy out of Star Trek. Boas later said he was “uncontrollably”excited, despite being physically repelled by the experience. He wonderedwhether the liquid that had been spread over him had contributed to this. Whenthe sexual experience was over, the woman lost interest and left the room. Justbefore she left, she turned to him, pointed to her belly, then pointed to thesouthern sky. Boas’s case is tricky. He only discussed his experience on rare occasions andlater became a practicing attorney. Everyone who interviewed him found him to bebelievable, and he maintained his story until his death in 1992. A year later, askeptical writer argued the case was a probable fabrication, and that it seemedto be based on a Brazilian periodical that had a comparable story published inNovember 1957. In support of Boas’s case, he was examined shortly after theevent by Dr. Olavo Fontes of the National School of Medicine of Brazil. Hissymptoms included pain throughout the body, nausea, headaches, loss of appetite,burning sensations in the eyes, and lesions on the skin with slight bruising,all of which continued for months. Fontes concluded that Boas had been exposedto a large dose of radiation from some source and was suffering from mildradiation sickness. Of course, even though it would certainly be unusual for aBrazilian farmer to become exposed to such high levels of radiation, it is notproof he got it from an alien spacecraft. But it would seem that somethingunusual happened to him.[69] [index_split_006.html#filepos1211176] Certainly one of the most famous abduction stories is that of Betty andBarney Hill. After a vacation, the couple was driving toward their home in NewHampshire on the night of September 19, 1961, when they had a UFO sighting.After arriving home, they were puzzled to realize they had lost two hours oftime. Two years later, they were hypnotically regressed by one of the nation’sleading psychiatrists, Dr. Benjamin Simon. Throughout the extended process theyunderwent separate sessions, and for nearly all of that time Simon ensured thatthey did not consciously remember their experiences. These sessions wereintense. Both remembered being taken aboard a craft by humanoid entities thatphysically examined them. This involved scraping off some skin, cutting off bitsof hair, and examining their ears and throats. In Barney's case, it alsoincluded extracting his semen and the insertion of a rectal probe. In Betty's,itincluded the insertion of a long needle into her navel. There is little questionthat the Hills experienced something real and dramatic. More will be said onthis case in Chapter 8.[70] [index_split_006.html#filepos1212048] Operation Dominic: UFO Crash in the Pacific. The following account came to me personally and was prepared following adetailed interview with the witness in 2013, whose career with the U.S. Navyspanned from 1960 to 1980. It involves the attention of extraordinary, unknowncraft in the vicinity of high-altitude U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific Oceanduring the early 1960s, and what appears to be the crash of a UFO—and a failedattempt to retrieve it. During the 1960s, the witness (named David) completed tours of duty with anumber of U.S. Naval vessels, one of which included the USS Finch, a destroyerescort. In 1962, recently promoted to Seaman, he was aboard the Finch when thevessel participated in Operation Dominic, a series of high-altitude nucleardetonations over the Pacific. A little appreciated fact of modern history is that, from 1945 until the late1990s, the world experienced over 2,000 nuclear explosions. The bulk of theseoccurred in a few general regions: the U.S. Nevada Test Site, Soviet CentralAsia, and the Pacific Ocean. The amount of damage caused by these detonationshas seldom been acknowledged or studied in detail, particularly in the contextof the environmental and atmospheric problems currently plaguing the planet.[71][index_split_006.html#filepos1212604] Following an intense barrage of nuclear tests in the late 1950s, the U.S. andSoviet Union agreed to a tacit moratorium on testing in 1958, which lasted untilthe Soviets broke it in September 1961. By early 1962, the Americans were againdetonating nukes at the Nevada Test Site, and in April of that year resumedtests over the Pacific Ocean as part of Operation Dominic. From April until theend of October, 36 nuclear weapons were detonated at high altitudes over theocean. Most of these bombs were dropped from B-52 bombers, but a number werelaunched by ground- and submarine-based missiles. During October, the final fivedetonations of the program were based out of Johnston Island Atoll, about fivehundred miles southwest of the Hawaiian Islands. These detonations took place ataltitudes as high as 160,000 feet—more than double the ceiling of the ultra-highflying U-2 spy plane.[72] [index_split_006.html#filepos1213007] The second-to-last exercise of Operation Dominic took place on October 26,1962 at 9:59 a.m.[73] [index_split_006.html#filepos1213380] This detonationappears to have caused the crash of a UFO. Aboard the Finch, Seaman David was unaware that a missile had even beenlaunched. Shortly after, however, the loudspeaker carried the voice of theCaptain, ordering everyone other than a few essential personnel below deck.There, the men waited, preparing for damage control. After fifteen minutes, anofficer selected about a dozen sailors, including David, to man the starboardside of the ship. Wearing jackets, gloves, and protective clothing against thevirtual wall of sea spray, they were ordered to look forward toward the horizon.No conversation was allowed. After some time, the officer in charge ordered the men to look ten degreesoff the starboard bow. “Lo and behold,” said David,> . . . what appeared in the sky—what I saw—was a huge cigar shaped object> coming toward us at ten degrees and about 15-20 degrees off the horizon. It> looked like it was two football fields in length. It appeared to have some> kind of blue glow at the stern as it was moving past us at a moderate rate. My> judgment is that it had to be traveling at least 400 mph. When it reached> directly in front of us, it picked up speed. It just went from there to gone. An interesting aspect of this sighting is that the object moved horizontallyfairly close to the water. David also noticed what he thought might have been awisp of smoke in the object's wake. That constituted his entire observation. But David learned a bit more laterthat day while cross-training with the ship's radar technicians. Everyone, itseems, was talking about the UFO they had tracked. It had been a huge objectwith a significant heat signature. Moreover, they said, it had descended intothe ocean. Pilots of several aircraft saw it enter the water, and several shipswere currently en route to its position. Nobody knew for sure, but it wasguessed that the high altitude detonation had caused the problem. Clearly, sincethis was a scheduled detonation, it was not an intentional attack on a bogey.The object just happened to be there.[74] [index_split_006.html#filepos1213974] David was soon debriefed about the incident by a security officer who hadboarded the Finch at Pearl Harbor. He was ordered to sign an agreementforbidding him to discuss the incident with anyone for twenty years. This crash of this unknown object occurred in the context of a number of UFOand USO encounters that had accompanied Operation Dominic. Indeed, such storiesare common among U.S. Navy personnel, if only an investigator takes the time tolearn of them. More than once during 1962, members of the Finch observed strangeobjects above and below the ship. The objects below the ship sometimes inspired real fear. These might berecorded by sonar, or they might be seen visually. In the case of the latter,the sighting usually involved a luminous, fluorescent effect in the water. Thisis commonly given off by dolphins, whales, and other kinds of ocean life, butthere were times when the fluorescence was simply enormous—far too large evenfor whales. Sometimes it came perilously close to the ship. On one occasion, theFinch nearly capsized from an intense swell which David believed was caused wasa USO (the event caused the Captain to break his leg and be transferred off theship). “I would say 75-80 percent of all these bogeys were logged,” he stated.“If you could get access to these logs you would have a gold mine.” But it is in relation to the UFOs tracked high above that the crash ofOctober 26 becomes even more significant. For one of the common things thatradar personnel noticed during the course of Operation Dominic, especiallyshortly before scheduled tests, were large numbers of “bogeys” in the upperatmosphere. Nobody knew what these ultra-high altitude objects were, but theyinevitably disappeared from the radar scope moments before detonation. Theobject that crashed on October 26, 1962 appears to have been unlucky. For years after, David remained bewildered by his experience. Then, in 1976,he met a senior Navy diver while while stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Overmany drinks, the two traded stories. Amazingly, the diver told David of anexperience he had in late October 1962, in the Pacific Ocean. He had been partof of a Top Secret salvage mission to pull a UFO out of the ocean floor! Infact, he was the first man in, volunteering to go alone for an initialreconnaissance of the situation. Wearing the traditional diving bell helmets andgear, the intrepid diver went down below the surface of the water. At first, hesaw nothing unusual—until he realized he was standing on an enormous object.Loosing his footing, he slid down the object to the ocean floor. At this point,he told his astonished listener, he was able to see part of it, even inside it.It was like a gigantic sponge, he said, with organic-looking compartments. Hetouched it, and his hand went through. Now in terror, the Navy diver admitted oflosing bladder control. He was soon brought back to his ship, barely able torecount what he had seen. That was the end of his mission. Later, however, hediver learned from another member of the diving team that when they attempted asalvage the following day, the object was no longer there. Somehow, it had left. David told the diver that he too had witnessed part of that UFO event, andthe two met privately a few days later at the diver's home. They compared notes,discovering that each suffered from similar nightmares of beings (or hands)coming into their bedroom. Shortly after this meeting, however, the diver wasdead—a freak accident from a faulty electrical conduit while in the shower. I have been unable to confirm every element of this story, which includeseven more detail than I have recounted here. However, all of the technicalelements related by David concerning Operation Dominic, including several arcanedetails, turned out to be precisely correct upon investigation. Moreover, hiscomplete lack of hesitation and fluidity of explanation, along with hiswillingness to answer my myriad questions, give me reason to believe his accountis genuine. Like all UFO crash retrieval stories, this one will benefit fromadditional research, something I hope to undertake in the future. Perhaps otherresearchers will consider doing the same. If true, the UFO encounter in the Pacific points to a strong interest by theoperators of these objects in human nuclear technology. Obviously, there aremany reasons why this should be so. If they have any kind of interest in thisworld, the detonation of some 2,000 powerful nuclear bombs over a fifty-yearperiod would be certainly command their attention. Moreover, the fact that thesehigh-altitude blasts discharged powerful electromagnetic radiation would be amatter of concern. Such blasts caused retinal damage and blackouts on theground, and electromagnetic storms in the upper atmosphere. This alone couldwell explain the presence of so many bogeys during the stratospheric tests ofOperation Dominic. The Crescendo of the 1960s The 1960s brought other intriguing sightings of so-called humanoid beings(or, as researchers were still calling them, UFO occupants). One of these,concerning New Mexico police sergeant Lonnie Zamora, is nearly as well known asthe Hill case. During the late afternoon of April 24, 1964, Zamora was in theprocess of pulling over a speeding vehicle in the town of Socorro. Then he hearda roar from outside his police car, and saw what looked like a “flame in thesky.” He thought that a nearby dynamite shack must have exploded so Zamora gaveup the chase and drove part of the way up a hill, in the direction of the flame.Closer to the top, he got out of his car and walked the final part. At the top,he saw a shiny object in the distance. His initial thought was that a car hadoverturned. He walked toward it, and saw what looked like two children wearingwhite coveralls. But then Lonnie Zamora got a closer look. He noticed the object was restingon four legs, and the “children” were examining or repairing the craft. They didnot immediately notice him. When they did, however, they hurried back into theobject. Zamora became frightened. He started running back. Within moments, the objectbegan to roar, a flame appeared on its underside, and it ascended slowly intothe sky. Now, Zamora could see that it was oval in shape, and very smooth.Although he saw no windows or doors, he did notice an insignia in red lettering.He ran after the object as it continued to rise in the air and accelerate towardthe southwest. Zamora was so shocked that he asked to see a priest beforereleasing his report to the authorities. Quite simply, he believed he had seenan alien craft. Within hours, Army Intelligence and the FBI were at the site. Moreinvestigators arrived in the following days. They noticed deep landing marksleft by the legs of the craft, as well as a charred area where it had taken off.For the next week, Zamora was interviewed constantly. Everyone was impressed byhis honesty, his puzzlement, and his detailed report. Project Blue Book was the Air Force's office to investigate UFO reports.Publicly, Blue Book debunked and even ridiculed Zamora's story. However, in a1966 classified article, the head of Blue Book, Major Hector Quintanilla, wrotesomething different:> There is no doubt that Lonnie Zamora saw an object which left quite an> impression on him. There is no question about his reliability . . . He is> puzzled by what he saw and frankly, so are we.[75]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1214379] This statement sounds like an endorsement. Despite various attempts toexplain the case in conventional terms, whether as the testing of a classifiedcraft or a prank, the case has stood the test of time. Lonnie Zamora sawsomething extraordinary. What was it?[76] [index_split_006.html#filepos1214696] Through the mid-1960s, there was a gradual crescendo of UFO reports. On July1, 1965, in the south of France, a rather strange encounter occurred, somewhatlike Zamora's, which was also reminiscent of the 1954 sightings. Farmer MauriceMasse, of the village of Valensole, heard a strange noise outside his home earlyone morning. He saw an egg-shaped object in his lavender field, only one hundredfeet away. It sat on a central pivot with six legs, was about twenty feet long,and had a door showing two seats back to back. Nearby were two small beings, thesize of children. They had large bald heads and tiny mouths, but normal humaneyes and hands. They seemed to be examining one of his plants. When they sawhim, they aimed a small device at him which paralyzed him. Meanwhile, they spokebetween themselves in gargling-type sounds, and Masse actually wondered if theywere making fun of him. Soon, they entered their craft through a sliding door,and it quickly took off at a forty-five degree angle, making a whistling soundas it left. For another twenty minutes afterward, Masse was paralyzed. Holeswere left in the ground by the object, and quite a few people examined them.Masse himself was a former Resistance fighter during the Second World War, andthe police who investigated this case regarded him as reliable. Another interesting water-based UFO sighting occurred on July 6, 1965. Crewmembers of the Norwegian tanker ship, Jawesta, saw a UFO. The ship was in theNorth Atlantic, on route from Venezuela to the Canary Islands, about a thousandmiles west of the African coastline. In all directions, for thousands uponthousands of square miles, the ship was surrounded by ocean. A look-out insistedthat something appeared to come up from under the sea and then change course toapproach the ship. The First Officer watched it with binoculars. According tohis entry in the ship’s log:> It was bright like a star, and the moonlight was shining through between> the low clouds, and I could clearly see the outlines of the upper part of it.> Its shape was that of a cigar, and I could clearly see a row of square windows> and the faint golden-orange coloured light from inside it. There was no sign> of wings or rudder. The object had a bluish tongue of fire behind it, which> was most concentrated near the tail, fanning out a little further back.> A little farther back still, behind the body, I could see a tremendous> number of globes, and from every globe there was streaming out a blue beam,> away from the body. The length of the fiery tongue would, I should think, have> been about 100 metres. The object seemed to be far bigger than any aircraft> known up to this present day.> Its speed was tremendous and it was visible for about 30 to 40 seconds. It> was moving at the time in N-S direction . . . I can say with complete> certainty that it was no question of an aircraft of conventional type, or> rocket, or meteor, or ball lightning. Several of the ship’s crew saw this unusual object, and apparently someonesketched it. Report and sketch were both apparently sent to the GeophysicalInstitute at Bergen. It is not known what the Institute had to say about thismatter. In all likelihood, its scientists did not say, “flying saucer over theNorth Atlantic? You betcha!” But it seems that a large, low-flying, silentobject moved with remarkable agility and great speed above an immense ocean. Itappears to have taken note of a lone ship, and then departed.[77][index_split_006.html#filepos1215671] There are several more interesting cases from 1965, including two UFOs thatwere photographed in the U.S. in early August.[images/00029.jpg]Cropped photograph of an object taken by Alan Smith, Tulsa OK, August 2, 1965. The first photo was taken in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on August 2 at 1:45 a.m. by a14 year-old boy named Alan Smith. This was during an evening in which thousandsof people from South Dakota to the Mexican border were reporting unusual objectsin the night sky, often in formations. Alan, along with his father and threeother people, were watching an unusual, multi-colored object which moved slowlytoward them, then paused and hovered. At that moment, Alan snapped a photographwith an inexpensive camera, and the object soon left. His picture wasextensively analyzed, pronounced authentic, and later published in LifeMagazine. There are detractors to this day, arguing that the object in the photowas simply a camera defect, but Alan and the other witnesses maintained that itwas an accurate photo of the object they had seen.[78][index_split_006.html#filepos1216312] Amazingly, on the very next day, another striking UFO photograph was taken,this time in California, on August 3, 1965. Actually, this was three photographsof a UFO, plus a fourth of a smoke ring that was left behind. These were takenby a Highway Accident Investigator named Rex Heflin. While sitting inside hisvehicle on a lonely stretch of road near Santa Ana, Heflin saw a hat-shaped UFOhovering close by. It was silent, and a beam of white light seemed to rotateunderneath it. Heflin tried to radio his supervisor, but he said the radio wentdead. He then took his four Polaroid photographs. Back at his office, he put thepictures in his desk drawer. A few days later, one of Heflin’s co-workers sentthe pictures to United Press International (UPI), and from there they werepublished in many newspapers. After this, the story became even more interesting. Heflin stated that,shortly after UPI returned his photos to him, he was approached by a manclaiming to be from NORAD Intelligence, who demanded the prints. Heflin gavethem to the man, and the photos were gone. Of course, this story has never beenconfirmed, and no one has ever heard of a “NORAD Intelligence.” But during the1970s, when computer analysis of photographs was in its infancy, severalanalyses were performed on copies of the images, and at one point they werepronounced fake. Then, in 1995, twenty-eight years after the photos haddisappeared, and long after Heflin had retired, the original photos mysteriouslyreappeared in his mailbox. A detailed analysis of the originals was performed byresearchers Ann Druffel, Dr. Bob Wood, and Eric Kelson. This was published inthe Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2000, and vindicated the photos.[79][index_split_006.html#filepos1217077] Some doubters remain. More recently, researcher Anthony Bragalia argued thephotos were hoaxes by Heflin, based on the testimony of someone who claimed tohave seen them before they were published, who said Heflin claimed he had hoaxedthem.[80] [index_split_006.html#filepos1217726] Most researchers do not appearto be convinced by this, however. Hearsay testimony cannot be consideredsuperior to a detailed photographic analyses. So far, it looks like Rex Heflintook three amazing UFO photos.[images/00053.jpg]The first of Rex Heflin’s photographs, Santa Ana, CA, August 3, 1965.Note theapparent ground disturbance below the object. Minot AFB As active and interesting as 1965 had been, subsequent years of the decadeappear to have matched it. Several UFO cases directly affected the U.S.military. One report came from Minot Air Force Base, in North Dakota from August 25,1966. Minot was a major Strategic Air Command base at the time, housing ICBMsand manned bombers. That night, a team was ordered to investigate a very highmulti-colored light, well above the position of the base. The team confirmedthat, indeed, there was such a light there, as well as a second object. At thesame time, base radar was tracking the object, which was as high as 100,000 feet(almost twenty miles). Several times, it rose and descended; each time it camedown, the missile chief found his radio disrupted by static, even though he wassixty feet below ground. The object eventually descended to ground level ten tofifteen miles south of the area. Consider the capabilities of any object thatcould perform such a controlled descent from twenty miles above, particularly atnight, in the mid-1960s. A team was sent to investigate. Apparently, they saw the object, either onthe ground or hovering very low. According to the report: “When the team wasabout ten miles from the landing site, static disrupted radio contact with them.Five to eight minutes later, the glow diminished, and the UFO took off.” Thereport mentioned that a second UFO was seen visually and confirmed by radar. Oneobject passed beneath the other, also confirmed on radar. Then they bothdeparted.[81] [index_split_006.html#filepos1218059] The entire incident lasted almost four hours. It was confirmed by threedifferent missile sites. Who was playing games over this American air forcebase? Malmstrom AFB But such games continued. The following year, on the morning of March 16,1967, at Malmstrom AFB in Montana, one of the most extraordinary events in thehistory of military-UFO encounters occurred. This base controls a huge,sprawling network of ICBMs. Under a clear and dark Montana sky, an airman withthe Oscar Flight Launch Control Center (LCC) saw a star-like object zigzagginghigh above him. Soon, a larger and closer light also appeared and acted in asimilar way. The airman called his non-commissioned officer, and the two menwatched the lights streak through the sky, maneuvering in impossible ways. TheNCO phoned his commander, Lieutenant Robert Salas, who was below ground in thelaunch control center. Initially, Salas was not impressed. He ordered the NCO tokeep watching the display and report back if the objects got any closer. Minuteslater, that is precisely what happened. Shouting into the phone, the NCO toldSalas that a red, glowing UFO was hovering outside the front gate. Salas woke his commander, Lieutenant Fred Meiwald. As he briefed Meiwald, analarm went off in the small capsule, and both men saw a “No-Go” light turn onfor one of the missiles. Within seconds, about ten of the missiles went down insuccession. Twenty miles away, at the Echo Launch Control Center, the same scenario tookplace. First Lieutenant Walter Figel was at his station when one of theMinuteman missiles went into “No-Go” status. He called the missile site andlearned that a UFO had been hovering above. Like Salas, Figel doubted the UFOstory. But just then, ten more ICBMs in rapid succession reported a “No-Go”condition. The entire flight was down. Strike teams were sent to the two launch facilities, where maintenance crewswere at work and had been watching UFOs hover over each of their sites. Themissiles were down for most of the day. Neither the Air Force investigation, norBoeing’s tests found any cause for the shutdown. According to the Boeingengineering chief, “there was no technical explanation that could explain theevent.” Over the years, a number of additional Air Force personnel have come forwardto confirm that something truly strange did happen at Malmstrom AFB that day. In2010, Salas and researcher Robert Hastings organized a news event at theNational Press Club in Washington, D.C., which included a number of theseadditional witnesses of this and similar types of events. At the same time, acontroversy arose which called the veracity of these claims into question butwhich, after my own close examination, fell short of making their case—again, atleast in my view. Moreover, having met Bob Salas on a number of occasions, Ihave no question as to his truthfulness, reliability, and integrity. Somethinghighly irregular did take place, and it involved the sighting of a UFO at thesame time that ICBMs, which were all separately controlled and should not havegone offline, did go offline for reasons that remain unexplained.[82][index_split_006.html#filepos1218538] Shag Harbor Throughout 1967, UFOs were being reported across the world. South America wasa hotbed of activity that year, including several reports of humanoid beings, aswell as water-based craft, several of which involved disk-like UFOs coming outof the water. Not all were perfectly recorded or transmitted to U.S.researchers, but something was going on. Still, the best-known water-based UFO story of the decade took place not inSouth America, but near the town of Shag Harbor, Nova Scotia Canada. On thenight of October 4, 1967, witnesses saw several lights joining together in astraight line, forming a 45-degree angle, flashing on and off in sequence asthey moved over the water. The lights then seemed to glide into the sea about ahalf-mile offshore. For a while, a single white light bobbed on the water, and people heard ahissing noise. The light disappeared before anyone could reach it, but witnessesalso noticed a yellowish, bubbling froth about eighty feet wide when they wentout there. No one had ever seen this before. The Royal Canadian Navy reported nomissing aircraft or ships in the area, and no planes had been operating in thearea at the time. For two days, Canadian Navy divers searched the waters and ocean bottom. Theyfound nothing. Then, a week after the incident, several people saw more lightsin that area, less than a mile offshore, very low over the water. Theydisappeared, then reappeared, and finally seemed to descend into the water. Years later, Canadian researchers Chris Styles and Don Ledger interviewedseveral of the divers and military personnel involved in the search. Accordingto what they learned, all unofficial of course, the searchers determined thatthere was indeed an underwater object, and that it had moved northeast. This wasnear a top-secret submarine detection station run jointly by Canada and the U.S.As a flotilla of ships positioned themselves over the submerged craft, a secondunderwater object joined the first, and apparently engaged in a repairoperation. The members of the ships observed, but did not interfere. A Sovietsubmarine later appeared but was escorted away. Eventually, the two unknownobjects moved off toward the Gulf of Maine. Emerging from the water, theyascended rapidly and flew away. Such is the fascinating story.[83] [index_split_006.html#filepos1219539] Mutilations and More Incidentally, 1967 also happens to be the year of the first widely publicizedanimal mutilation. Disagreement exists to this day as to whether or not suchmutilation cases are connected to the UFO mystery, but it does appear that anunknown agency is behind at least some of them. In this case, a horse named Ladywas found on September 9, 1967, in southern Colorado's San Luis Valley. When herowners found her, she had been stripped of flesh from the neck up. The exposedskeleton was so white and clean that it looked as though it had been bleached inthe sun for days. There was also a medicinal odor about her. Yet, Lady had beenknown to be alive and well only two nights before. Oddly, her tracks stopped onehundred feet from her body. Several holes in the ground were nearby, as if (somethought) from a landed craft. According to Dr. John Altshuler, a veterinary doctor who examined her, Lady'sinternal organs had been removed “surgically with heat ...There was no blood andthe cuts were surgically precise.” Was this UFO related? Either way, it certainly was a mystery. But it is notunreasonable to wonder about a UFO connection, and there were indeed UFOsightings in the area around the time Lady died. Over the years, the San LuisValley has remained a hotbed for UFO sightings, bizarre encounters, and animalmutilations.[84] [index_split_006.html#filepos1220165] As the 1960s came to a close, UFO reports dwindled a bit in America.Elsewhere, sightings continued at a steady pace, especially in Europe and SouthAmerica. A number of reports concerned sightings of alien beings. The New YorkTimes joked about this in an article in July 1968, (“UFOs Add Spice to Life ofLatins”) but did quote an Argentine government official who said: “I have nodoubt that flying saucers have arrived here. I worry about what they are up to.I just can’t understand why they have picked on Argentina.” In fact, they hadnot picked solely on Argentina. It is evident that “they” were everywhere.[85][index_split_006.html#filepos1221259] A review of the cases in this chapter suggests that the group or groupsbehind the UFO phenomenon were not necessarily hostile to humanity. Of course,they may not have been on the most friendly terms, either, and there are a fewcases in which human fatalities are linked to encounters with UFOs.[86][index_split_006.html#filepos1221565] For those who wonder why they have notprovided more open assistance for a species that clearly could use it, we mightrecall that “assistance” is often the wrong way to promote healthy development.We often need to struggle through our problems if we are to become better thanwe were. Then again, there remains the possibility that they see humanity astheir property, as livestock to be managed. We do not have certain answers. Still, there are some instances in which these “Others” appear to have actedin a beneficial manner to individuals on a limited basis. Such was an encounterthat took place in France on the night of November 1, 1968. A prominent FrenchDoctor (referred to as Dr. X to maintain his anonymity) was home during athunderstorm with his fourteen-month old son. Outside the boy's window, thedoctor saw two luminous objects come close together, then merge. As the objecttilted, it emitted a beam of light at him for about a second. Then, it vanishedwith a flash, leaving only a slowly-dissolving cloud. Shortly after this, the man’s leg, which had been wounded in the Algerian Waryears before, healed. Several days later, he experienced pain in his abdomen,and a red pigmentation appeared around his navel, forming a triangle.Dermatologists who examined him had no answers. The case was reported to theFrench Academy of Sciences, although without the UFO connection. The baby alsodeveloped a red triangle. This case was unusually well-tracked and investigated.In the words of researcher Jerome Clark, “this is one of the most fantastic UFOstories ever, but is accompanied by “physical evidence of an eerily compellingsort.”[87] [index_split_006.html#filepos1221765] * * * One thing should be clear at this point: there is no shortage of astonishingUFO stories, and they appear to have existed throughout our recorded history.Even a cursory review such as this makes it evident that the full range of UFOcases are far more difficult to explain than simply resorting to naturalphenomenon, or even secret human technology. Something important, somethingstrange, is very much a part of our history. As the following chapters will show, this phenomenon has also had seriouspolitical, economic, and social implications. Chapter 4UFO Secrecy and Those Who Fought It Delving into the world of UFO secrecy is not the easiest of tasks. It must beexplored layer by layer, and this chapter explores the top layer. It comprisesthe public history of the UFO controversy, garnered from easily confirmed andopen sources. Before plunging into the deep waters, we must learn how to swim.Before we speculate about the coverup, we must first understand what is easilyconfirmed. That is, we need to get our facts straight. The topic of UFOs is not simply an intellectually interesting exercise (likeasking, I wonder if there is life out there in the universe?). It is not ahypothetical matter, but has several pragmatic implications for our society. One of the more obvious implications is that UFOs constitute a nationalsecurity problem. As the last chapter demonstrated, there have been many UFOencounters by the various militaries of this world, especially that of the U.S.With so many violations of sensitive airspace taking place, caused by unknownobjects with extraordinary capabilities, it would have been impossible forresponsible national security officials to have ignored the situation. This leads to the second important practical implication of UFOs, even moreimportant from a public policy point-of-view: government by secrecy. Clearly,certain implications of UFOs prompted a decision that the matter had to be keptaway from detailed public inquiry. Over the years, there have been manycontributing factors to our current culture of expansive government secrecy, andUFOs have been one of them, typically overlooked by the more conventionalstudents of history and political science. It is, of course, entirelyunderstandable that military and political leaders would wish to conceal such aserious problem from the public. Yet secrecy is a cancer that, if unchecked,kills the body politic it is ostensibly trying to protect. Another implication of the UFO phenomenon concerns exotic technology andscience in general. Consider a craft that can zigzag silently across the sky:one simple maneuver encapsulating a science that is utterly revolutionary. If weever grasp the various sciences behind UFOs, our society will be dramaticallytransformed, in ways that are probably beyond our wildest imagination. Indeed,we appear to be on the cusp of making several such breakthroughs. Finally, a study of UFOs brings us inevitably to an existential crisis. Whoare these other beings? What is their agenda? Are they friend or foe? Are peoplereally being taken by them, and if so why? These questions are of the greatestimportance, with deep implications for human society. The American power elite appears to have agreed. Those who were in the knowdecided that, for the time being at least, this was a reality too awesome, tooterrifying, too destabilizing to share with the world. What they needed, aboveall else, was time: time to gather information, time to plan, time to stall. Although a lifetime has gone by since those initial decisions were made, thebasic plan has continued. Denial and deception remain the rule. So UFOs are important to us. And yet, they are almost entirely ignored by theopen and official organs of power in our society, despite being seen worldwide.It is time to redress the imbalance. The Early Cover-Up As the 1942 “Battle of Los Angeles” shows, the U.S. military was learning tolie about UFOs at least five years before Roswell. The public, incidentally,knew it was being lied to. One of the local newspapers, the Long BeachIndependent, wrote of “a mysterious reticence,” and that “some form ofcensorship [appears to be] trying to halt discussion of the matter.” Indeed itwas, and so it continued throughout the war. Of course, warfare breeds secrecy,but all the other secrets of World War Two have long since been revealed.Everything, it appears, except UFOs. Or, as they were called at the time, foofighters. Throughout the war, some strange events were reported, and there was always adiscrepancy between what the classified community discussed and what the publicwas told. Hardly anything about foo fighters was considered openly. When theAssociated Press and New York Times covered the topic in early 1945, it wasspeculated that this might be a new form of German weaponry.[88][index_split_006.html#filepos1222222] In fact, no one had a clue. Even today,despite continued speculation about the German connection to the foo fighters,there is still no proof, nor even much in the way of evidence. Yet, we do knowthere was great interest in these strange . . . things. We have rumor afterrumor that the U.S. Eighth Air Force under General James Doolittle, the Officeof Strategic Services (the forerunner of the CIA), and British intelligence allconducted investigations of the foo fighters. The conclusion, it is said, wasthat they were neither American nor German technology.[89][index_split_006.html#filepos1222639] While we are left to speculate and piecetogether what history we can, studies were done in secret years and years beforeus. Even now, we do not know for certain what they concluded. Why? Nevertheless, some researchers are making strides. Joseph P. Farrell, in aseries of books, has built a case for a range of highly advanced Germantechnology that intersects with the UFO phenomenon, and this includes at leastsome of the foo fighters. Although the case has often been made by some UFOresearchers that the foo fighters were not overtly hostile, Farrell found casesin which they seemed to be experimental technologies designed to interfere withAllied missions. One event cited by Farrell was from a 1943 bombing run over Schweinfurt, aGerman city in Bavaria, and home to a ball-bearing factory that was targeted bythe Allies for destruction. A report on the event was dated October 24, 1943,and described interviews with American B-17 pilots of the 384th Bomb Group whoreported that the Germans had inexplicably not sent up any fighter planes toattack them, when instead they encountered a cluster of silver discs that closedon them. These objects were very small, estimated as one inch thick and threeinches wide (the exact size of a hockey puck). The pilots were astonished whenthe clusters directly struck at least one of the B-17s (apparently) on the rightwing and definitely on the tail. Although the cluster had no effect on theperformance of the aircraft, the strange absence of German Luftwaffe led Alliedintelligence officers to suspect (in Farrell’s words) “that the incidentreflected the combat use and experimentation with some sort of unusual weapon.”Indeed, an incident had occurred during a mission over Stuttgart on September 6,1943 in which another cluster of “small round objects, silvery in color,” fellin the path of Allied bombers. According to one report, “some was observed tofall on the wing of a B-17 belonging to our group. The wing immediately startedto burn.” In Farrell’s judgement, “clearly, the Luftwaffe was deploying andcombat-testing some sort of strange technology, and that technology was anythingbut harmless.”[90] [index_split_006.html#filepos1223010] Farrell also studied the more common foo fighter reports over Germany whichwere connected to sightings of “red balls of fire.” He noted that “theoverwhelming body of foo fighter reports could never pin them down to anythingexplicitly German . . . except in one instance.” This was when the IX TacticalAir Command Allied aircraft reported that a German Messerschmitt-109 fighterjoined a formation of Allied aircraft and “was seen to emit what appeared to bea red ball of fire which followed the aircraft for some 2-3 seconds.”[91][index_split_006.html#filepos1223911] This is certainly fascinating. While the above is not quite enough to serveas firm confirmation that some foo fighters were of German manufacture, it’s areasonable position to take. Farrell is furthermore on point in his suggestionthat Nazi technology bears a relationship to post-World War Two UFOs. The U.S.brought the lion’s share of the German intelligence and scientific communityinto its sphere after the war ended, and would presumably have kept the bestdevelopments classified for as long as possible. More on this in Chapter 5. Still, when considering that equally baffling foo fighter accounts came fromthe Pacific Theater of war, including the summer of 1945 after the Germans hadsurrendered, we need to question the viability of explaining all of these asGerman-derived technology. Did the Germans, even while fighting literally fortheir lives, share their most dprecious technological secrets with the Japanese(with whom, by the way, communications became increasingly difficult as the wardrew to a close, and trade-transport nearly impossible)? When we look forhistorical evidence to support such a line of speculation, we come up empty, orat least woefully insufficient. There is a truth somewhere behind these foo fighters. After all these yearsthey continue to leave us with nagging questions unanswered by our officialorgans of truth, that is, academia and the media. The same can be said of the ghost rockets of 1946. Once again, the classifiedworld showed great interest in an unknown phenomenon, none of which wastransmitted to the public. Two American generals visited Sweden, one of whom wasGeneral James Doolittle (leading us to consider that the Eighth Air Force mayhave reached some interesting conclusions about the foo fighters). After thisvisit, the Swedish government stopped talking to the newspapers. And whilepublic speculation centered on the Russians as the likely culprits, theclassified world concluded differently. By late 1946, the Swedish AirIntelligence Service arrived at a truly remarkable assessment. Unfortunately, itwas not declassified until the late 1990s. It read, in part:> . . . some reliable and fully technically qualified people have reached the> conclusion that ‘these phenomena are obviously the result of a high technical> skill which cannot be credited to any presently known culture on Earth.’ They> are therefore assuming that these objects originate from some previously> unknown or unidentified technology, possibly outside the Earth.[92]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1224174] Given the close contact between the Swedes and the Americans, the Americansobviously knew everything the Swedes knew. So here is an early example of theExtraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) making its way through the U.S. militarycommand structure. Whether America's top generals and admirals supported thesearguments is another matter. But their Swedish counterparts seem to have. When recalling the statements of the Greek scientist Paul Santorini,mentioned in the previous chapter, the argument for cover-up becomes morepowerful still. Years after the fact, Santorini said that the so-called ghostrockets were neither Soviet nor rockets.[93][index_split_006.html#filepos1224438] He also described American interference inthe Greek investigation. Just as with the Swedes, the Americans were obviouslyfamiliar with his team's conclusions. One can only wonder if Doolittle wasinvolved here, too.[94] [index_split_006.html#filepos1224680] 1947: The Dam Breaks Now we come to 1947. Despite the continual and steady upsurge of sightings,none of the prior events had proved durable in the public psyche. The Battle ofLos Angeles and foo fighters were already a distant memory. The ghost rocketshad vaguely been ascribed to the Soviets. As far as the public could tell, therewere no connections among these obscure events, and hence no phenomenon. Not so, however, among the national security elite. Every indication is thatthey knew full well that they were dealing with something extraordinary. Maybethey knew even more than that. Then, in late June and early July of 1947, the dam broke. Finally, the publicwas talking about this new phenomenon called flying saucers, and Roswell was theculmination. Something went down near Roswell in July 1947. An FBI memo fromthat week tells us that, whatever it was, it was sent to Wright Field in Dayton,Ohio for analysis—that is, the U.S. Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC).Since the Air Force has continued publicly to assert that the Roswell debris wasa balloon known as Mogul, we are obligated to ask: why would any type of balloonbe sent to ATIC? There is also a great deal of anecdotal testimony supportingthe idea that an exotic and advanced craft went down near Roswell. For instance,General Arthur Exon, who was a junior officer at Wright Field at the time, toldresearchers that, in 1947, he had heard about the materials arriving from NewMexico as being incredibly exotic and mystifying to the best scientists whostudied them. During the 1960s, Exon was Base Commander at Wright-Patterson AirForce Base. As he said in 1990:> They knew they had something new in their hands. The metal and material was> unknown to anyone I talked to. Whatever they found, I never heard what the> results were. A couple of guys thought it might be Russian, but the overall> consensus was that the pieces were from space. Everyone from the White House> on down knew that what we had found was not of this world within 24 hours of> our finding it. . . . Roswell was the recovery of a craft from space.[95]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1225058] For a brief moment one day, the world was treated to a headline confirmingthe capture of a flying saucer. Three hours after the initial press release,however, the story was ordered pulled, retracted, and then debunked. In theaftermath of Roswell, press coverage of flying saucers practically ceased. TheNew York Times, Life Magazine, and other major print media published dismissivearticles. From this point onward, UFO witnesses increasingly began to beportrayed as crackpots. The press was simply following the lead of the military. In volume one ofUFOs and the National Security State, I wrote, “the Army baked it, the pressserved it, and the public ate it.” There were no independent civilianinvestigations of UFOs in 1947, hence no one to challenge the national securityapparatus, which was the only group investigating this matter seriously. And what was occurring within that apparatus? According to Captain EdwardRuppelt, who later headed the Air Force's Project Blue Book, and who had theopportunity to review the records of 1947, the situation in Air ForceHeadquarters was “confusion almost to the point of panic,” and that the securitylid was down tight. This is perfectly logical.[96][index_split_006.html#filepos1225553] Consider the situation. The U.S. military had just fought the most terrifyingand consuming war in history. The world was broken, exhausted, and justbeginning the long road to recovery. In the two years since the war’s end, theSoviet Union and communism had given the U.S. something new to fear. Then therewas the new and terrifying technology of atomic weapons. There was a fear,almost in the air, that such weapons portended the destruction of mankind, oreven of all life on Earth. More than anything else, people everywhere wanted toreturn to some sense of normal. And yet what was happening? A mysterious phenomenon had appeared. Its sourceand intentions were as yet unknown, likewise its full capabilities.Nevertheless, whoever and whatever was behind the flying saucers, they appearedto be “ahead” of the most advanced human technology. Under such conditions, could anyone expect national security policymakers toannounce the presence of such things to the world? Wouldn’t it make more senseto keep this as secret as possible, while trying to understand what they weredealing with? Surely it would, and this appears to be exactly what happened. It is also helpful to remember that no organization as large as the U.S.military can ever operate in a completely organized manner, without some levelof confusion. Throughout the summer of 1947, it was obvious that many seniorofficers and decision-makers were not in the loop on the matter of flyingsaucers. Not everyone had a “need-to-know.” As a result, there were attempts byvarious offices to find out just what this business was all about. One suchattempt was by Brigadier General George Schulgen at the Pentagon when he wroteto Lieutenant General Nathan Twining of Air Material Command. Schulgen believedthese so-called flying discs were probably classified American technology, buthe wanted confirmation. After all, was this something he needed to be concernedwith? In reply, Twining wrote one of the most remarkable memos on the flying discsthat has ever been made public. Dated September 23, 1947, he told Schulgen thatthe saucers were “real, not visionary or fictitious.” Although he conceded thepossibility that they may be natural phenomena such as meteors, he added:> . . . the reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,> maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered> evasive when sighted . . . lend belief to the possibility that some of the> objects are controlled either manually, automatically, or remotely. Twining listed several common descriptions of UFOs. They generally weresilent, had a metallic or light reflecting surface, no trail, were circular orelliptical in shape, and often flat on the bottom. Many descriptions indicated adome on top. Several reports indicated they flew in formation. Quite specificinformation, indeed. UFO skeptics have pointed to Twining’s statement that no wreckage of a flyingdisc had been recovered. It is true that he was probably in a good position toknow. But what we do not know is whether Twining would have been able to tellSchulgen about a UFO crash, if such a thing had happened. Simply put, ifSchulgen lacked a “need to know,” Twining could not have told him. On the otherhand, Twining did state that UFOs were not secret American craft. This came as asurprise to Schulgen, who expected to learn that there was nothing to theaffair, that everything was under control. Was Twining hiding the fact that UFOs were classified technology? It is afair question, and he appears to have left the door open. He wrote:> Due consideration must be given to the following: The possibility that these> objects are of domestic origin—the product of some high security project not> known to AC/AS-2 or this command. . . . The possibility that some foreign> nation has a form of propulsion, possibly nuclear, which is outside of our> domestic knowledge. Clearly, there was much more going on than what we read in Twining’s memo. Tostart, we might ask, how much was Schulgen cleared to know? For instance, whatdoes it mean that Twining wrote there were no crashed UFOs—such as at Roswell?Logically, it would seem to mean one of three things: either there was no crashof a UFO at Roswell, or Twining did not know about it, or Schulgen was notcleared to know about it. If nothing else, we can see by this three page, typewritten, memo that theUFO issue was being taken very seriously by the highest levels of the Americannational security community. Twining later earned his fourth star and became Chief of Staff of the U.S.Air Force. As a result of his letter to Schulgen, the Air Force establishedProject Sign, based out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Sign began work inthe beginning of 1948, charged with studying the flying saucers and coming tosome sort of conclusion about them. Before leaving the Twining memo, we are obliged to ask a few more obviousquestions. First, is there any credible evidence that either the U.S. or anyoneelse had any craft in 1947, experimental or otherwise, that could duplicate thereported maneuvers of flying saucers? What aerial object in 1947 had thoseperformance capabilities, and which was flat on the bottom and domed on top?[97][index_split_006.html#filepos1226066] As mentioned earlier, much of this hinges on whether or not the Germansdeveloped technology during the Second World War that could have accounted for aportion (whether small, large, or entire) of the UFO phenomenon at this time. Itis well understood that German science and technology were quite advanced, andthat the Allies were aware of this fact during the last phase of the war as theyscrambled to acquire as many German science and intelligence specialists as theycould. There may well be a connection with what the Germans had been working on,although it remains problematic to ascribe all of the UFO sightings to this.There were simply too many of them, and there were too many that predated anypossible German-Nazi technology. Moreover, there has never been a reasonableaccount of the manufacturing infrastructure needed to develop and build theseobjects, especially in a decimated post-1945 world, nor of their mission, nor ofhow, in how in subsequent years, they were able (presumably) to create theillusion among so many witnesses that they were not normal human beings butextraterrestrial aliens. Another interesting question arises. If Roswell was the crash of somethinghighly exotic, even extraterrestrial, does that mean Project Sign was somethingother than what we have been told for years and years? Was Project Sign,instead, a kind of busy-work for certain groups in the military that did notneed to know the full truth of the matter? Might it have been an exercise to seejust how vulnerable the UFO reality was to being accurately assessed andperceived by reasonable analysis, and which would therefore provide guidance onhow further to hide it from prying eyes? After all, if material and bodies fromRoswell or elsewhere had already been recovered, surely the conclusions of Signwould not have been needed for those people who were truly in the know. But itwould be necessary to keep enough people busy “searching” for answers. So, wasProject Sign something like busy-work? The short answer appears to be yes. In any case, by the beginning of 1948, the scientists at Project Sign agreedthat the phenomenon of “flying saucers” was real, and not merely illusory, norall hoaxes. They shared a broad consensus that somebody's technology wasresponsible, probably either a secret project of the Soviets or Americans, orelse of “interplanetary” origin. They also agreed that this was seriousbusiness, and that secrecy was needed to study it. Everything was to beconducted away from prying eyes.[98] [index_split_006.html#filepos1226389] 1948: Estimating the Situation The new year began with an ill-fated attempt to intercept a UFO. On January7, 1948, while chasing an unknown object near Goddard Air Force Base inKentucky, Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell crashed to his death. He had climbedtoo high without oxygen, and certainly passed out. What he chased remainsunclear to this day. The team at Sign initially thought he had misidentifiedVenus, which was in the general direction he was going, until it was realizedthere was too much daylight for Venus to have been visible. They then changedtheir solution to “unknown.” Some years later, astronomer J. Allen Hyneksuggested Mantell might have chased one of the Navy’s classified Skyhookballoons. This answer is possible, although there still remains doubt. We maynever know.[99] [index_split_006.html#filepos1226739] For the next few months of 1948, there were few good UFO reports within theU.S. There was a crescendo that began in May, however, and included severalmilitary aerial encounters. Matters came to a head on July 24, when an EasternAirlines flight over Montgomery, Alabama had a near collision with a large UFO.Both pilots and one of the passengers saw a brilliant, rocket-like objectrushing straight at them. Then it veered to the side, gave a long gust of redexhaust, and shot up into the clouds. Both pilots stated they were able to seethe object clearly. They agreed that it had double decked rows of square windowsalong the side, and was about one hundred feet long. It was moving at anestimated speed of between five hundred and seven hundred miles per hour:roughly the top speed attained by any aircraft in the world at that time. Theywere convinced this was no natural phenomenon. A meteorite, for instance, wouldhave been much faster and would not have maneuvered as this object did.[100][index_split_006.html#filepos1227081] Upon reflection, this is a very perplexing sighting. First, if this was anextraterrestrial craft, we have ask: what were its operators thinking? Did theyhave a mechanical failure? Were they trying to terrify the locals in somecelestial game of chicken? Moreover, the craft’s level of technology did notseem more than perhaps a few decades ahead of the rest of the world, if that.After all, it was clearly burning some sort of fuel. Indeed, there were a fewexperimental designs (existing on paper only), which bore a superficialresemblance to the description of the strange object. These were the AirForce/RAND “World-Circling Spaceship,” the Navy/Martin “High Altitude TestVehicle” (HATV), and the Navy/North American HATV. All were early designs tolaunch an artificial satellite into Earth orbit, and all—if they had beenbuilt—would have been roughly the size of the object described by thepilots.[101] [index_split_006.html#filepos1227462] For all we know, this objectwas less advanced than the F-117A Stealth Fighter, although admittedly it hadmuch better maneuverability and acceleration. This sighting also prompts us torecall the airships of the 1890s, which also seemed to have been a decade or soahead of the rest of the world. [images/00060.jpg]Drawings by the witnesses of the object they saw on July 24, 1948. So what is the ultimate meaning of this July, 1948 encounter?Extraterrestrials? Extraterrestrials that live here permanently, but somehow insecret? Or, were they possibly an entirely human group, but secret? If the lastof these, it remains frustrating that, even after all these years, no one everleaked information to that effect. We are as stumped today as people were backthen. Publicly, the military did everything possible to downplay interest in thiscase, even initially calling the unknown object a weather balloon, a statementit was forced to retract. Behind the scenes, however, there was great interest.Indeed, it led the team at Sign to create a document entitled, The Estimate ofthe Situation. It was handed to Air Force Chief of Staff, General HoytVandenberg, most likely in August of that year. This document, which has takenon a legendary status, has never been made public. Yet, a number of people haveattested to its reality, including Edward Ruppelt. As he put it: “the situationwas the UFOs; the estimate was they were interplanetary!” The most likelyscenario, according to the report, was that extraterrestrials were making afull-scale observation of Earth, although attack did not seem imminent. A rathershocking assessment, to be sure.[102] [index_split_006.html#filepos1227875] Vandenberg, we are told, rejected the report’s conclusion, either because itcould not be proven, or (more likely) because he simply did not desire it. TheEstimate then died a quick death. According to Ruppelt, all but a few copieswere burned, and the personnel involved in creating it were reassigned. Laterduring the 1950s, Ruppelt spoke privately with retired Marine Corps Major DonaldE. Keyhoe, probably the most important UFO researcher of the 1950s. Ruppelt toldKeyhoe, “the general said [The Estimate] would cause a stampede.... how could weconvince the public the aliens weren't hostile when we didn't know itourselves?” Researcher Kevin Randle had another interesting story about the Estimate.Randle had met an Air Force colonel who also confirmed the existence of theEstimate. This colonel had worked with Air Technical Intelligence Command (ATIC)during the late 1940s, and told Randle that after it had been hand-delivered toVandenberg, he returned it with instructions that two paragraphs be removed.These paragraphs were said to have referred to physical existence of alien craftrecovered in New Mexico. Randle was told this before the Roswell case wasrediscovered in the late 1970s.[103] [index_split_006.html#filepos1228569] One way or another, the Estimate of the Situation led to a policy change onUFOs. Essentially, it portended the end of Project Sign and the demise, albeittemporarily, of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. But let us reflect on what had just happened. A strong and compelling UFOsighting takes place, something so profound that it shakes up the Air Force andprompts the staff at Sign to write a report favoring the ETH. Then, the reportis batted down, and an anti-ETH mood sets in. The people at Sign were notill-trained, gullible, or naive. On the contrary, they were level-headed andskeptical in the best sense of the word, and serious about the problem of UFOs.In this context, what seems most likely is that this was an attempt to keep thelow-level investigation at Project Sign from straying into highly classifiedterritory. The staff had stumbled onto the correct answer, but that correctanswer was beyond their pay grade. Certainly, the attitude of President Harry Truman would have been of greatimportance to this matter. Yet in Truman's two-volume autobiography, there areno references to anything connected to UFOs or flying saucers. One would thinkthat UFOs were simply not part of his Presidency. In fact, however, Truman was regularly briefed about UFOs. A statement fromMajor General Robert B. Landry makes this clear. In 1974, after he had retiredand Truman had died, Landry gave an interview about his career, which included atime when he served as President Truman’s Air Force Liaison. In the course ofhis interview, Landry said that from the summer of 1948 until the end ofTruman’s presidency in January 1953, he was responsible for coordinating withthe CIA to provide quarterly briefings for President Truman on the subject ofUFOs. Immediately after mentioning this, Landry downplayed its importance. Allreports were made orally, he said, and “nothing of substance considered credibleor threatening to the country was ever received from intelligence.[104][index_split_006.html#filepos1228894]“ Considering that these briefings lasted for four and a half years, it wouldseem that President Truman received seventeen or eighteen briefings on UFOs. Itcertainly would have been nice to hear those conversations, unimportant thoughLandry professed them to be. But were they really unimportant? In the firstplace, they started at the time of the Eastern Airlines incident and TheEstimate of the Situation. This alone would indicate that there was some urgencyto the matter. Moreover, for a man as busy as President Harry Truman to bebriefed every three months on flying saucers indicates that someone thought itwas important. Ditto the fact that Landry worked with the CIA on this. As forLandry’s insistence that nothing important was discussed, and that nothing waswritten down, perhaps a telling statement from former CIA director Richard Helmswould be helpful: “the first rule in keeping secrets is nothing on paper.” It would appear that President Truman and his national security teamconsidered the matter of UFOs to be very important. The Case of James Forrestal Another person of interest during this early period was America’s firstSecretary of Defense, James Forrestal. He held that position from the time ofthe great national security reorganization of mid-1947 until the spring of 1949.Forrestal ran America’s military through the early tensions of the Cold War, aswell as during the first upsurge in reports about the “flying saucers.” He wasfired by Harry Truman at the beginning of Truman's second term (for meeting withTruman’s Republican opponent, Thomas E. Dewey, during the Presidential campaignseason). At the end of March 1949, he formally left his position. He thenimmediately had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalized. On the early morningof May 22, 1949, Forrestal died after falling from the 16th floor window of theBethesda Naval Hospital, in Washington, D.C. His death was immediately ruled asuicide, and that, apparently, was that. All standard biographies of Forrestalagree with this assessment. Not everyone, however, has agreed. A number of people, including his brotherHenry, suspected that he had been murdered. There are many suspicious elementsof Forrestal's death: (1) His near complete isolation during his hospitalization, even severaltimes from his brother, as well as his chaplain. (2) He was seen to be improvingduring the final weeks before his death. (3) He had befriended one of hissecurity guards and had discussed having the young man serve as his assistantafter his release. (4) On the night of his death, that security guard had beenreplaced by a new guard. (5) At 1:30 a.m., just minutes before Forrestal’sdeath, the new security guard allegedly saw him reading and taking notes in bed,and said Forrestal declined a sedative to help him sleep. (6) The notes weresaid to be a transcription from a morbid speech from Sophocles’ play Ajax. Thiswas played up in the media as a kind of suicide note. Yet the note was barelyconsidered a matter of interest during the U.S. Navy’s Review Board, whichinvestigated his murder. Most importantly, it was decidedly not in hishandwriting. (7) Forrestal died by falling from the kitchen window in thehallway of his hospital. Yet he did not merely jump. His body was found with hisbathrobe cord tied very tightly around his neck. Supposedly, he had tried tohang himself by tying the other end to a radiator just below the window,certainly an odd—probably unique—way to attempt suicide. He did not hang himselfin his own room, which would have been far easier. (8) Scuff marks were found onthe outer window sill where he fell. If Forrestal had decided suddenly to killhimself, he apparently changed his mind right away. (9) His brother, Henry, hadjust informed the hospital that he was going to report his brother’s isolateddetention to the press, and was going to have him taken out on Monday, May 23.James Forrestal died at 1:45 a.m. on the morning of May 23.[105][index_split_006.html#filepos1229172] Several analysts, including the author, have reviewed Forrestal’s death indetail. Murder, not suicide, is the obvious probability. If so, we might askwhy? Here is where the UFO connection becomes interesting. Anyone as powerful as aSecretary of Defense has enemies coming from many directions. The UFO connectionis not the only one that could have resulted in people wanting to kill him. But,without a doubt, if one considers the UFO problem to have been real to thenational security elite, then Forrestal would have been considered a securityrisk. Over 1948, his mental state had become delicate, and who knows what hemight have said once he was released from the hospital?"},{"pageContent":"Unknown Objects Over Sensitive Airspace Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, a number of classified memos werewritten about UFOs. What we take away from them is that something was happeningthat gravely concerned people in the know. None of these documents was writtenwith the expectation that they would ever be made public. It was during thebrief window in American history when the Freedom of Information Act wassomewhat user-friendly (that is, during the Jimmy Carter administration of thelate 1970s) when most of these UFO-related documents were released. It isincredible but true that, of the thousands of pages of UFO-related documentsthat have been declassified by the U.S. government, more than half are from thatnow-distant period of time. Moreover, most of those are of lower levels ofclassification, seldom as high as Top Secret. One of these, however, an FBI memo from January 31, 1949, stated bluntly thatthe matter of flying saucers was “considered top secret by intelligence officersof both the Army and the Air Forces.” It went on to describe disturbing,unexplained events over Los Alamos and a variety of other militaryinstallations. This, at a time when government spokespersons had been assuringthe public that flying saucers were simply a combination of hoaxes,hallucinations, conventional aircraft, and misidentification of naturalphenomena. In reality, the memo described this phenomenon as positivelydangerous. Once again, there is indication that the Eastern Airlines encounterof 1948 was considered very important. This memo explained that:> . . . recent observations have indicated that the unidentified phenomena> travel at the rate of speed estimated at a minimum of three miles per second> and a maximum of twelve miles per second, or a mean calculated speed of seven> and one-half miles per second, or 27,000 miles per hour. The memo noted furthermore that several times “a definite vertical change inpath was indicated.” Whatever these things were, they were not only incrediblyfast, but had maneuverability that was off the charts. This classified memo also described incursions of unknown objects over LosAlamos, New Mexico throughout December 1948 (on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 11th,13th, 14th, 20th, and 28th). The witnesses of these “unexplained phenomena”included Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigation, airline pilots,military pilots, Los Alamos base security personnel, and private citizens. A fewsightings were of multiple craft, and analysts rejected the notion of meteoritesas an explanation. Some wondered whether or not the objects were Soviet inorigin, but this seemed to be a stretch.[106][index_split_006.html#filepos1229895] Several other memos of the period stand out. Indeed, on the same day that theFBI memo was prepared, another one was dispatched from Kirtland Air Force Basein Albuquerque. As mentioned in the previous chapter, this one declared that atleast one hundred UFO sightings had been recorded in that area, and describedconcern from many quarters. Agencies such as the Atomic Energy Commission, theArmed Forces Special Weapons Project, the Fourth Army, and local commanders were“perturbed by implications of phenomena.” Clearly, the implications of over onehundred UFO sightings in the area would perturb anyone. Another document, this one from the summer of 1950, stated that round UFOshad been seen over the Hanford Atomic Energy Commission plant. Air Force jetshad attempted to intercept the objects, but failed. Many units had been alerted,including anti-aircraft battalions and more. In other words, the matter wasserious. Within such an environment of confusion and uncertainty, how could themilitary possibly desire to inform the public about it? [images/00018.jpg]Classified memo describing UFOs over the Hanford Atomic Facility in the summerof 1950. But, despite all efforts to keep UFOs secret, to erase them from the publicmind, they would not go away. People continued to see them, and the U.S.military was in the uncomfortable position of attempting to explain them away.As long as the sightings were relatively few, perhaps this could be done. Then came 1952. The Air Force had begun to revitalize the remnants of Project Sign, which hadbeen recreated under the name Project Grudge. Through most of 1951, Grudgelooked moribund. Then, after a dramatic military UFO sighting over New Jerseyduring the fall, Grudge was handed to Captain Edward Ruppelt. In the spring of1952, Grudge received a new name: Blue Book. Ruppelt had a small staff to workwith, just in time to deal with a huge increase in UFO sightings. The Crisis of 1952 High up within the Pentagon, someone had decided to promote UFOs to thepublic. In April 1952, Life magazine published an article that had beensponsored by the Air Force, entitled, “Have We Visitors From Space?” Life'sanswer was, maybe. The article ruled out the main excuses commonly attributed atthe time: psychological phenomena, products of U.S. research, Russiandevelopments, atmospheric effects from atomic activity, or Skyhook balloons.This was not the type of debunking piece that was typical of the era.Admittedly, the New York Times quickly rebutted it, but it was nevertheless truethat the Air Force had been the main source for the article. Project Blue Bookhad even declassified certain UFO reports for it. On several occasions, Ruppeltwas asked whether the Air Force was really behind the piece. The official answerwas no, that Life's conclusions were its own. However, he stated that certainhigh-ranking Pentagon officers (“so high that their personal opinion was almostpolicy”) had unofficially inspired the article. One of these men had even givenhis opinions to the journalist of the article.[107][index_split_006.html#filepos1230314] But what does it mean? Had the power elite decide to soften UFO secrecy? Or,perhaps, was the sudden openness a smokescreen for something else? Perhaps aninside faction wanted to hedge its bet, just in case events were to spiral outof control and a full disclosure became needed? Indeed, sightings had been quitefrequent throughout 1950, 1951, and early 1952. Some had been unsettling. If thesecret-keepers were concerned that the agencies behind UFOs might soon make anopen appearance, they might seek to prepare the public, if only just a bit. Yet another question arises in connection with the article: did thepolicymakers know that UFO sightings were about to spike so high? For, oddlyenough, UFOs were reported at a record pace all through the spring and summer of1952. In April, two powerful members of America’s defense establishment had adramatic UFO encounter. U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Dan Kimball, was flying fromCalifornia to Hawaii, when he saw two disc-shaped objects moving at anincredibly fast speed, later estimated to be about 1,500 mph. They circledKimball’s plane twice and then departed. Fifty miles to the east, anotheraircraft, carrying U.S. Navy Admiral Arthur Radford, encountered what appearedto be the same objects. They circled his aircraft, then zoomed upward and out ofsight. Kimball reported the encounter to the Air Force, and was unhappy withwhat he believed was its stonewalling on UFOs. The story leaked to retiredMarine Corps Major, Donald Keyhoe, which is how the rest of the world eventuallylearned about it. But Kimball’s and Radford's sightings were only two of severalhundred intriguing UFO encounters that took place during the spring and summerof 1952.[108] [index_split_006.html#filepos1230914] April and May were busy months for Project Blue Book, with 99 and 79 reports,respectively. In June, the total increased to 149. Ruppelt described that monthas “one big swirl of UFO reports.” That month, he gave a briefing on UFOs to thehead of Air Force Intelligence, General John Alexander Samford. The small roomwas crowded. Samford’s staff was there, as were two Captains from Navalintelligence. There were also a few individuals that Ruppelt said he would notname. The meeting was tense, until one of Samford's staff members, a Colonel,argued that Blue Book's investigation was biased against the interplanetarythesis. At that point, wrote Ruppelt, “you could almost hear the Colonel add,‘okay, so now I've said it.’” Opinions were split fairly evenly and, in Ruppelt’s view, this reflected asplit in opinions at the very top. On one side were those who wanted to continuekeeping an “open mind” about UFOs, without forming a provisional conclusion asto what they were. The other group had apparently formed a conclusion and was“dead serious about the situation.” They wanted a policy starting from theassumption that UFOs were interplanetary, and they wanted to stop any furtherrelease of information. He argued that this group had taken a firm hold in thePentagon, and many other agencies throughout government.[109][index_split_006.html#filepos1231466] But the crescendo of sightings had not ended. Although June 1952 had been abusy month for Blue Book, July was the busiest of all. An incredible 536 reportscame to the group, and unknowns were running at about forty percent. Ruppeltlater wrote of rumors that the Air Force was braced for an invasion by flyingsaucers. And yet, the situation on the inside was even worse than that. “Hadthese rumor mongers been at ATIC in mid-July,” he wrote, “they would havethought the invasion was already in full-swing.”[110][index_split_006.html#filepos1231759] Matters culminated for two consecutive weekends over the nation's capital,when multiple UFOs were tracked on radar and seen visually by quite a fewpeople. On both occasions, Air Force interceptors were sent. Pilots got closeenough to track the unknowns but were unable to catch up. The events were sosignificant that they made the front page of the New York Times, even bumpingthe Democratic national presidential convention from the top spot. There is afamous photograph of the objects over the Capitol building, often argued to bereflections of lights from below, and this is very likely the case.Nevertheless, the radar and visual testimony is compelling. I was fortunate tospeak to one of the key radar operators and air traffic controllers at the time,Howard Cocklin. Howard described how he saw the unknown objects visually at thesame time they were being tracked on radar. He was ninety at the time of ourinterview, and passed away two months later.[111][index_split_006.html#filepos1232039] When unexplained objects are seen and tracked over the nation's capital,flying at will and easily evading the top interceptors available, this is aproblem. Above all else, what had to be done was to defuse the situation. Thusdid General John Samford speak to the press on July 29, 1952. He explained therecent UFO activity as the result of faulty radar returns caused by “temperatureinversion,” a particular type of weather phenomenon in which a layer of warm airbecomes trapped between two layers of cooler air, and which can affect radarreturns. While this is a real phenomenon, nearly all the radar operatorsinvolved disputed this explanation. None, however, were permitted to speak atthe press conference. It is interesting, incidentally, that accompanying Samfordwas General Roger Ramey. Five years earlier, Ramey had been the man to squashthe Roswell story.[112] [index_split_006.html#filepos1232411] The press conference effectively managed public opinion. Within theclassified world, however, no one seems to have believed the explanation. Withindays, a classified memo from the Air Intelligence Estimates Division stated thatthe Air Force had failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion to the UFOmystery. It also concluded that the Soviets were probably not behind thephenomenon, and acknowledged the possibility that UFOs were interplanetary. Inother words, the classified conversations continued to be much more interestingthan the public explanations. [images/00025.jpg]U.S. Air Force memo from July 29, 1952, stating that “the Air Force has failedto arrive at any satisfactory conclusion” regarding flying saucers. This certainly applied to the CIA, where an analysis from August 1952 gavecredence to the reality of UFOs. One statement in particular stands out:> . . . sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, at a time when> the background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here we run out of even> blue yonder explanations that might be tenable, and are left with numbers of> incredible reports from credible observers.[113]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1232841] Throughout this period, classified documents continued to acknowledge thepossibility that UFOs might represent some bizarre natural phenomenon, as yetunknown. But no one had any idea what that could be. Most discussions centeredover whether UFOs were either a secret American project or somethingextraterrestrial. In fact, very few analysts by this point considered them to bea secret American project. When considering this possibility, it is worthasking: what secret American technology would be employed over and over again totrigger U.S. Air Force interceptors? It made no sense then, nor does it today.Certainly, an occasional errant Skyhook balloon may have caused some confusion,but to think such types of events could regularly cause such concern at highlevels within the military and intelligence community goes beyond the mostgenerously applied boundaries of belief. Moreover, if such sightings of theearly 1950s were secret American technology, what became of it? Why would therehave been no sign of it in later decades? Ruppelt, who briefed many branches ofthe military throughout 1952, had a good idea of the mood among militarydecision-makers, and it is clear that the extraterrestrial explanation wasalways the elephant in the living room—that is, the obvious explanation, but onewhich unfortunately was not allowed to be discussed openly. During the fall of 1952, the Truman presidency was nearing its end. Withinthe CIA, the matter of UFOs took on greater urgency. In particular, the CIA'sOffice of Scientific Intelligence was moving ahead toward creating a panel thatwould study UFOs scientifically. From this would come a formal policyrecommendation. On December 2, the Director of that Office, H. MarshallChadwell, made an important statement attesting to the reality of UFOs. Chadwellwrote to his boss, the Director of the CIA, Walter Bedell Smith. Chadwell'sstatement was breathtaking:> . . . at this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is> something going on which must have immediate attention. . . . Sightings of> unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the> vicinity of major US defense installations are of such nature that they are> not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.[114]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1233278] This statement bears close scrutiny. A high-level U.S. official stating tothe Head of the CIA that UFOs were real, probably artificial, probablyintelligently operated, and apparently not American; nor was there seriousconsideration that these were Soviet. If not American, if not Soviet, if not natural phenomena, and if theyappeared to be technological and under intelligent control, one begins to runout of conventional options. Chadwell’s memo makes it obvious that he understoodthis, although he was loathe to state the obvious. This led to what became known as the Robertson Panel, a CIA-sponsored groupof scientists which met secretly from January 14 to January 17, 1953. Their jobwas to review UFO reports and to make a recommendation. All of the scientistsinvolved were Nobel-caliber. The Chairman was H. P. Robertson, one of America'sleading mathematicians and physicists. During the Second World War, Robertsonhad become very familiar with foo fighter reports (as had another Panel member,Dr. Luis Alvarez). The Panel concluded that UFOs were not a direct threat to national security.Yet, they could pose an indirect threat if reports from the general public orwithin the military were to overwhelm communication channels. Members of thePanel therefore emphasized a need to manage public opinion regarding UFOs,particularly by debunking the topic. They discussed the value of working withWalt Disney and other media figures to convey the message that UFOs were mundaneand nothing to get excited about. Rather insidiously, the Panel recommended that civilian groups studying UFOsbe monitored, citing “their potentially great influence on mass thinking . . .the apparent irresponsibility and possible use of such groups for subversivepurposes.” Two groups in particular were singled out: the Aerial PhenomenaResearch Organization (APRO) and Civilian Saucer Investigations (CSI). Severaltimes over the years, the leaders of APRO expressed their belief that they werebeing monitored. Unquestionably, during its final years in the 1970s and 1980s,the organization was infiltrated by intelligence operatives. Most likely it hadbeen so all along. There is also good evidence that the disbanding of CSI was caused directly bythe U.S. government. Researcher Michael Swords located FBI documents indicatingthat the noted engineer Walther Riedel was pressured to resign from CSI. Thegroup disbanded not long afterwards. In response, Robertson wrote to H. MarshallChadwell: ‟[t]hat ought to fix the Forteans,” a reference to Charles Fort andhence UFO researchers. There is also a strong case that the UFO organizationNICAP, which was founded in 1956, was infiltrated by CIA operatives. Indeed, Swords and other researchers later determined that the RobertsonPanel's conclusions were written before its members even met. In retrospect,this ought not to be so surprising. Realistically, how much work could oneexpect them to accomplish in a mere twelve hours? One of the Panel members, Dr.Lloyd Berkner, did not even show up until the final day of the gathering. One fact of great significance regarding this Panel, something alwaysoverlooked by historians, is that it was the final act of any importance of theHarry Truman Presidency. The Panel constituted the administration's final act ofhousecleaning. Its effect throughout the military and intelligence community wasprofound. In particular, Blue Book was gutted, and it became all but impossibleto inquire within the military into the matter. What appears to have happened is that the split in opinion Ruppelt haddescribed had been definitively resolved. The extraterrestrial hypothesis wasaccepted and secrecy became the rule. Clearly, the matter had already beenstrictly secret at the highest levels. Now, however, the clampdown extended muchfarther down the ladder. After all, for those few already in possession of thesecret, why seek any more input from the lower levels? What was to be gainedfrom continually stirring the pot? For the remainder of the 1950s, the U.S. Air Force and the Americangovernment assigned flying saucers to the realm of oblivion. One officialstatement after another claimed that UFOs were either misidentifications ofknown aircraft or natural phenomena; or hoaxes. There was no national securitythreat, so they stated, and, with enough data, every so-called unknown casecould be identified. Flying saucers existed solely in the imagination. Duringthat period of time, project Blue Book was ordered to bring its percentage ofunknowns to the lowest number possible. Solutions that previously had beenconsidered as “possible” now became the definitive answer, case closed. Whereasduring the 1940s and early 1950s, official unknown totals had generally beenbetween fifteen and twenty percent, by the mid-1950s the numbers were regularlytwo percent or lower. In 1956, for example, Blue Book unknowns were listed at0.4%. None of this was due to better investigative techniques. How could therebe better investigations, when the staff now consisted of only one or twopeople? In reality, Blue Book became better at one thing only: discardingscientific principles for the purposes of propaganda. Blue Book cooked itsbooks. At the same time, UFOs all but disappeared from American news coverage,at least compared with earlier years. Challenging the Air Force From the moment that flying saucers had become a public issue in 1947 untilthe mid-1950s, the extent of public participation had been nothing more than ahandful of small research groups. People relied on their newspapers and radio toenlighten them on the matter. In terms of local reportage, those institutionsgenerally did well enough. The newspapers of that era published many accounts ofsaucer sightings that were dramatic and baffling. However, in terms of nationalmedia, that is, major wire services, established radio networks, very earlytelevision broadcasting, and newspapers such as the New York Times, thesituation was different. These organs were the opinion makers and shapers of thenation, and they worked closely with the military and intelligence community. Agreat deal of research in subsequent years has highlighted that relationship.But during the 1950s, the myth of a Free Press was important in stifling publicinquiry into UFOs. The 1953 movie, The War of the Worlds, contains a tellingscene in which newspaper and radio journalists openly interview an Army generalabout the landed flying saucer that was plainly and openly in public view. Seentoday, the scene is downright humorous in its absurdity. Hardly a person alivein the 21st century can imagine such a thing taking place. And yet, that wasindeed how America saw itself during that era. Most people fervently believedthat, If something important like that were to happen, their journalists—thewatchdogs of the public—would be there to report it, rather than isolated farfrom the scene by the military. Except that those watchdogs never barked. More accurately, they were littlemore than lap dogs, and the laps in which they sat were those very agenciesseeking to erase UFOs from the public mind. However, something else began to happen: the beginnings of public dissent.First among these dissenters was Major Donald Keyhoe, who stumbled into theflying saucer mystery in 1950. Keyhoe was a retired Marine Corps Major who hadonce flown with Charles Lindbergh. He was well-connected. Among his friends wereAdmiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, who had directed the CIA from 1947 to 1950. Keyhoewas also friendly with Admiral Delmar Fahrney, known within the Navy as thefather of the guided missile. In 1950, Fahrney had privately told Keyhoe, “therehave been too many convincing reports, and if the flying saucers do exist theymust be interplanetary. Certainly neither we nor the Russians had anythingremotely like that.” [images/00021.jpg]U.S. Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe Through the 1950s, Keyhoe wrote a series of books that discussed the realityof flying saucers and their cover-up by the military. He was a conduit for manyimportant leaks. During the important year of 1952, he obtained roughly fiftyaccounts of military encounters with UFOs which had been declassifiedspecifically to be shared with him. He was the first person to write about theRobertson Panel, having immediately received leaks about it. He was prolific,and released a great amount of information to the rest of the world. Another thorn in the side of secrecy was Air Force Captain Edward Ruppelt,the head of Project Blue Book until 1953, who in 1956 published an importantbook, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. Even today, it remains amongthe most important books ever written about UFOs. Ruppelt’s treatment of thematter was sober and evenhanded. Considering his prior position as head of BlueBook, it was also unflinching in his willingness to acknowledge the difficultiesthat UFOs posed to the military. The publication of his book also posed aserious problem. Not surprisingly, it came under strong attack fromestablishment publications such as the New York Times, which labeled it“cultist,” and “the longest and dullest of the current crop of saucer books.”This was not merely unfair, but exactly the opposite of the truth. In late 1956, a new organization was founded not only to study UFOsseriously, but also to fight the cover-up. It was called the NationalInvestigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). By early 1957, Keyhoe wasrunning NICAP and had committed the organization to promoting open congressionalhearings on UFOs. Yet, while pressing for change, the people at NICAP were farfrom revolutionaries. Indeed, the organization was positivelyestablishment-oriented, and most of its board members were retired seniorofficers of the U.S. military (including Hillenkoetter, Fahrney, and manyothers). Even so, Keyhoe believed that the public had a right to know the truthabout UFOs. Like all Americans of his generation, he believed that the Americanpolitical system was the most open in the world, and that the best strategy forchange was to work within it. Several times during the late 1950s and early1960s, it looked as though this faith would be justified, and that NICAP mightsucceed in getting those congressional hearings. Every time, however, seeminglyat the eleventh hour, the initiative would fizzle out. This saga continued forseveral years. Matters came to a head in 1962. During the previous summer, Hillenkoetter hadmade a public statement that urged “immediate congressional action to reduce thedangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects.” Now, early in 1962,Keyhoe talked with him about making an even stronger statement to Congress.Hillenkoetter agreed, and they determined that spring was the best time to doit. Then, however, Hillenkoetter disappeared. Keyhoe wondered if his oldAnnapolis classmate was avoiding him. Finally, after weeks of silence, a letterarrived. The Admiral and former CIA chief did a complete about-face. Now, hedefended the Air Force's policy on UFOs. “I believe we should not continue tocriticize their investigations,” he wrote to Keyhoe, “I am resigning as a memberof the NICAP Board of governors.” It was a hard blow for NICAP. Such changes of heart seemed to be the order of the day. Just a few yearsearlier, the same thing had happened to Ruppelt. After the publication of hisbook in 1956, someone, somehow, appears to have gotten to him. In 1957, Ruppeltwas still making pro-UFO statements to the press. In 1960, however, he publisheda revised version of his book, adding three chapters at the end which debunkedhis prior thesis, that UFOs constituted a genuine mystery. The three additionalchapters, sophomoric and mocking in tone, were of a completely differentcharacter from his earlier book. Now, Ruppelt actively ridiculed the people,such as Keyhoe, with whom he had previously been collegial. In his newconclusion, he referred to UFOs as the space age myth. “I'm positive they don'texist,” he wrote. “There's not even a glimmer of hope for the UFO.” Then, as if to underscore the mystery, Edward Ruppelt died from a heartattack the following year, at the age of 37. Who knows how it all happened.Perhaps, as some researchers believed, he really did change his mind, and thensimply died of natural causes. Maybe not. It is not difficult to see that therewould be real pressure placed on outspoken figures like Ruppelt andHillenkoetter to alter their public positions on this question. Such pressurecan be made in a friendly way, or not so friendly. Whether some agency causedRuppelt’s heart attack is something that we will surely never know, unless somefresh document spills out of the archives. Such capabilities did exist back inthe 1950s; assassination techniques had already become sophisticated by thattime, including the ability to surreptitiously induce a seeming heart attack. More Sightings and A New Crisis Thus, by the early 1960s, it appeared that the Air Force, the CIA, and theirallies had succeeded in removing the UFO phenomenon from public discussion. Butthere is always one factor beyond anyone's control: those beings behind thephenomenon itself. Time and again, they never seem to get the memo that they arenot supposed to exist. Starting in 1964, a dramatic rise in well-documented and publicized UFOreports took place. Such reports peaked over the next few years, and once againUFOs were a problem, first of national security, secondly as a matter of publiccredibility. In the past, Blue Book's debunking policy had helped to submergethe problem. Now, however, it only seemed to make things worse. Newspapersstarted to demand better Air Force investigations of UFOs. By 1965, Blue Book consultant, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, recommended thatthe Air Force improve its UFO investigation. Essentially, this meant more moneyfor Blue Book and presumably a healthier philosophy toward investigating thetruly difficult cases. The Air Force, which wanted as little public attention onUFOs as possible, had always been loathe to do this. Indeed, the Air Force foryears had been trying to unload the program, but had not found a politicallyviable way to do so. Still, Hynek’s suggestion gained ground. By late 1965, theAir Force Scientific Advisory Board met to discuss the UFO question and the ideaof an independent study of the problem. Within a year, this would lead to theannouncement of the Air Force decision to commission a study of UFOs by theUniversity of Colorado, otherwise known as the Condon Committee. More on that ina moment. Before that happened, however, an explosion of UFO reports occurred in theUnited States. In terms of media coverage, this culminated in March 1966. In thetown of Dexter, Michigan, night after night, students at Hillsdale College andpeople elsewhere reported UFOs. On March 14, two deputy sheriffs in Dexter sawwhat looked like disc-shaped objects maneuvering above the town. Three otherpolice agencies reported similar sightings. Selfridge Air Force Base confirmedthat it had tracked objects on radar moving at extreme speeds andmaneuverability. On March 17, in Milan, Michigan, another police officer saw aUFO approach his patrol car to within seventy-five feet, then follow him forhalf a mile, then fly off. Something strange was going on. On the evening ofMarch 20, near Dexter, several people saw a lighted object hovering over aswamp. It was very well defined, in their opinion. Then, it rapidly flew awaywhile making a whistling sound. That night, several lights were reported movingaround the swamp. These sightings received national attention, and Blue Book dispatched Hynekto make a statement. What happened next, however, was a public relationsdisaster. Immediately upon arriving in Michigan, Hynek gave a press conference.Although he called for a thorough investigation, he focused on the lights overthe swamp, suggesting they could have been marsh gas caused by decayingvegetable matter in the swampy area. In other words, swamp gas. The statementwas obviously premature, even absurd. The press ridiculed Hynek and the AirForce, which had never looked so incompetent, even duplicitous, about UFOs as itdid in that moment. The press conference severely damaged the image of ProjectBlue Book. [images/00036.jpg]Allen Hynek at the March 1966 “swamp gas” press conference. The national media tried its best to calm things down. One such effort was aCBS television special, narrated by Walter Cronkite, which took astraightforward, debunking approach to UFOs. Researchers later proved that thisspecial was explicitly connected to the recommendations of the Robertson Panel,the guidelines of which were still being followed more than a decade later. Evenso, too many voices were speaking openly against the Air Force position. One ofthese was a Michigan Congressman and the House Minority leader, Gerald R. Ford.Many of the recent sightings had occurred in his district. Ford stated:> I think there may be substance in some of these reports and because I believe> the American people are entitled to a more thorough explanation than has been> given them by the Air Force to date.... I think we owe it to the people to> establish the credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible> enlightenment on the subject.[115] [index_split_006.html#filepos1233795] This statement is normally interpreted in a straightforward manner, to theeffect that Congressman Ford was genuinely working on behalf of his constituentsto get some honest answers about UFOs. Yet, Gerald Ford had also been an activemember of the Warren Commission, which obfuscated the assassination of PresidentKennedy under the guise of an independent review. In addition, he was afive-time attendee of the infamous (though still secret) Bilderberg meetingsduring the 1960s. It therefore seems probable that there was an ulterior motiveto his statement on UFOs. Indeed, the Condon Committee may very well have beenthe intended result. The immediate result of Ford’s news release, however, was the first-ever openhearing on UFOs within the U.S. Congress, which took place on April 5, 1966. Itmet for one day only, and was an exclusive gathering. Indeed, only three peoplewere invited to testify in person: Hynek, Blue Book Chief Hector Quintanilla,and Air Force Secretary Harold Brown. It was rather a snub to NICAP, which hadbeen pressing for ten years for this moment and was not invited.[116][index_split_006.html#filepos1234341]The results were predictable. Hynek, stilllicking his wounds, said UFOs deserved more scientific attention. Brown andQuintanilla were more dismissive, but Brown did direct the Air Force to arrangefor a scientific team to investigate and review the Blue Book sightings thatremained unidentified, which by then had totaled more than 600. That spring, a Gallup poll revealed that forty-six percent of Americansbelieved UFOs to be real. Five percent thought they had seen one personally,which projects to roughly nine million people. This was yet more evidence thatUFOs posed a potential public relations problem for the Air Force and Blue Book. Matters worsened still, at least from the perspective of the Air Force.During the spring of 1966, another personality entered the UFO debate. This wasDr. James McDonald, an atmospheric physicist from the University of Arizona.McDonald had a longstanding private interest in UFOs, but now became publiclyinvolved. The Office of Naval Research awarded him a small stipend to examinethe Blue Book material at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, ostensibly to learnwhether certain kinds of clouds accounted for the occasional radar trackings ofUFOs. In June, while at Wright-Patterson, McDonald discovered an unedited copyof the Robertson Panel report. It had been classified for more than a decade,and no one outside the military had ever read it. Seeing what surely appeared tobe evidence that the CIA was directing a cover-up, McDonald was distressed. Twodays later, he was at Hynek's office, pounding his fist on the table anddemanding to know why Hynek had not spoken publicly about the cover-up he hadobviously known about for years. It was soon evident that McDonald was thecover-up's worst nightmare: a fearless, world-qualified scientist who waswilling and able to dismantle the many pseudoscientific explanations of UFOsproffered by the authorities.[117] [index_split_006.html#filepos1234612] [images/00040.jpg]Dr. James McDonald. McDonald's visit seemed to light a fire under Hynek, who now began todistance himself publicly from Blue Book and the Air Force. He wrote severalarticles that year that highlighted the difficulty of the UFO issue, and statedthat the Air Force did have unexplained radar reports and photographs of UFOs.He called for an end to witness ridicule and said a truly scientific program hadnever been undertaken regarding UFOs. This was a direct slap at Blue Book. The Condon Committee Although it appeared that the Air Force had reached a dead end in its publichandling of the UFO problem, the chess pieces were well positioned. Now, theendgame was at hand. By late summer, the Air Force had settled on a solution:the University of Colorado would be selected to undertake an independent, formalstudy of UFOs. Leading the study was a physicist of world renown, Dr. Edward U.Condon. Many hoped this study would settle the matter once and for all. For abrief, shining moment, it looked as though perhaps there would be an appropriateresolution to this long-standing controversy. Except that it did not work out that way. In the first place, it becameevident from the beginning that Condon's public statements about flying saucerswere limited to ridicule. There was a fixation on the most fantastic, absurdstories. If he knew anything of substance about the topic, he surely was notrevealing it in public. Worse still, he seemed uninterested in learning anythingnew. A number of private researchers were brought in to brief the Coloradogroup, and frequently found Condon napping during the sessions.[118][index_split_006.html#filepos1234945] Other academicians and scientists on the team did approach the subject withthe idea that they were involved in a serious, scientific endeavor. Notsurprisingly, after some time reviewing the cases that were brought to them, anumber of them began to consider that there was a genuine UFO mystery.Suspicions surfaced regarding Condon’s apparent lack of commitment to the truth.To some, it seemed that he had decided from the beginning upon a negativeoutcome regarding UFOs. This was the claim of Dr. David Saunders, one of theteam members who eventually confronted Condon on the matter. Saunders asked him,What if you determine that these UFOs are in fact real? What then? According toSaunders, Condon replied that, if such were the case, he would take the reportin a locked briefcase to the President of United States. Evidently, there wouldbe, no matter their conclusions, no public validation of UFOs coming from theCondon Committee.[119] [index_split_006.html#filepos1235204] Morale worsened still when a particular memorandum was discovered a year intothe project. It had been written by the Project Director, Robert Low. Low wassecond only to Condon in the hierarchy, and had written the memo during thesummer of 1966, shortly before the University of Colorado had won the Air Forcecontract. The statement and tone made it look very much as though the game hadbeen rigged from the outset. Low wrote:> . . . the trick would be to describe the project so that, to the public, it> would appear a totally objective study, but to the scientific community would> present the image of a group of nonbelievers trying their best to be objective> but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.[120]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1235544] The memo had been buried in the project files and was found by one of theproject scientists, Dr. Roger Craig. It was circulated and eventually ended upin the hands of James McDonald. From there, matters became ugly. Early in 1968, McDonald wrote a long, masterful letter to Low. By this time,morale and research problems abounded within the project, something McDonald waswell aware of, despite not being a member. It was clear, McDonald wrote, thatCondon was a problem: his repeated negative comments in the press, hisdisturbing preoccupation with the crackpot aspects of UFOs, the obviousconclusion that Condon himself was not personally examining the kinds ofwitnesses and cases that had made many UFOs so compelling, the obvious lack ofcommunication between Low and Condon on the one hand, and the bulk of theinvestigators on the other, and the failure of the project to investigate casesof “obfuscation,” that is, of cover-up.[121][index_split_006.html#filepos1235887] Then, finally, McDonald mentioned Low’s memorandum itself. “I am ratherpuzzled by the viewpoints expressed there, but I gather that they seem entirelystraightforward to you. . . “ It was a bold statement and a thinly veiled accusation of scientificdishonesty. McDonald sent a copy of his letter to the project’s open files,which meant that it was available for everyone to read. Condon was furious. Immediately, he summoned each project member to meet withhim, one-on-one. He then fired anyone who had been present when McDonald hadbeen given a copy of Low’s memorandum. As a result, he was forced to hireseveral new investigators, just as the project was supposed to be winding down.These replacements comprised a major part of the team that wrote what becameknown as the Condon Committee Report.[122] [index_split_006.html#filepos1236142] Meanwhile, on July 29, 1968, while the Condon drama was unfolding, the U.S.Congress held a symposium on UFOs sponsored by the House Science andAstronautics Committee. This was a very different affair from the 1966 hearing.Many of the major UFO researchers testified, including McDonald, Hynek,astronomer Carl Sagan of Cornell University, and several others. McDonald madethe greatest impression, providing thirty pages of verified UFO reports. Hestated:> I have become convinced that the scientific community, not only in this> country but throughout the world, has been casually ignoring as nonsense a> matter of extraordinary scientific importance. . . . My own present opinion,> based on two years of careful study, is that UFOs are probably> extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that might very tentatively be> termed surveillance. . . . I have interviewed several hundred witnesses in> selected cases, and I am astonished at what I have found. I had no idea that> the actual UFO situation is anything like what it appears to be. . . . I now> regard the [extraterrestrial] hypothesis as the one most likely to prove> correct.[123] [index_split_006.html#filepos1236423] Despite the impression made by McDonald and other presenters, the symposiumhad no political impact. However, it is now part of our public history, part ofCongressional history, which is no small achievement. Meanwhile, the Colorado team worked on completing its report, and on October31, 1968, it delivered its Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects tothe Air Force. Condon's conclusion was definitive. “Nothing has come from thestudy of UFOs in the past twenty-one years,” he wrote in the report’sIntroduction, “that has added to scientific knowledge.” Further study of UFOs,he wrote, “probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will beadvanced thereby.” In other words, he was recommending that the Air Force shutdown Project Blue Book.[124] [index_split_006.html#filepos1236776] [images/00057.jpg]Edward Condon presenting his committee’s report, capped by a friendly flyingsaucers. The report certainly was massive. It also contained quite a few cases thatwere investigated with reasonable sophistication by the scientists involved.Yet, there was a striking discrepancy in the report between its contents andconclusions. Condon had concluded that science could gain nothing from studyingUFOs. Yet roughly thirty percent of the cases within the report had failed to beexplained. This was a vastly higher percentage of unknowns than the U.S. AirForce had offered in years. It was as though Condon had not bothered to read hisown report, which in fact has been a common claim and may well have been true.Condon never did show the slightest genuine interest in the topic, and there islittle evidence that he gave much energy to its scientific aspects. In addition to the high percentage of unknowns there were a small number ofcases that bordered on virtual acknowledgment of an alien reality. One such casewas from 1956, at RAF Lakenheath, a British air base. The report's statement wasclear enough: “the apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggestsa mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of thissighting.” Just as powerful was the conclusion regarding two famous photographs from1950, taken in McMinnville, Oregon:> this is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated,> geometric, psychological, and physical appear to be consistent with the> assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disc shaped,> tens of meters in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within sight of two> witnesses. Yes indeed, there was gold within the Condon Report. Yet, from a publicrelations point of view, none of this mattered. As messy as it was, the CondonReport did its job. Although many scientists individually criticized it, itreceived an endorsement from the National Academy of Sciences. One has to wonderwhether those scientists actually read the report. The national media, too,focused on Condon’s conclusions rather than the details inside the report. Howcould they do otherwise? Under pressure to write about a report that was morethan nine hundred pages, and considering the time constraints journalists wereunder, they went to Condon’s brief statement, despite its being only marginallyrelated to the actual report. The End of an Era The Condon Committee Report accomplished two main things. First, it providedan official scientific dismissal of UFOs. Second, it resulted in the closing ofProject Blue Book. The Air Force had long sought this outcome, and now with therecommendations of an independent scientific body, it was able to do so withoutmajor public outcry. In October 1969, Brigadier General Carroll H. Bolender, theAir Force’s Deputy Director of Development, wrote a classified memo recommendingthe termination of Project Blue Book. He wrote: “we agree, that the continuationof Project Blue Book cannot be justified, either on the ground of nationalsecurity or in the interest of science.” Blue Book data, he said, simply did notserve any useful intelligence function. But the important point was that“reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security...are not part of the Blue Book system.[125] [index_split_006.html#filepos1237262] Bolender pointed out that such reports were made in accordance with JANAP-146or Air Force Manual 55-11. These were explicit U.S. Air Force reportingprocedures that had long dealt with UFOs, and had done so in a seriousmatter.[126] [index_split_006.html#filepos1237487] In other words, Bolender wassaying, if it was an important UFO sighting, it was not supposed to go to BlueBook, anyway. In effect, this was an admission of Blue Book's longstanding roleas a public relations exercise. Naturally, it could be let go with no fuss, nomuss. The closing of Project Blue Book might seem to have been no great loss. Afterall, it had been clear for many years that Blue Book's job was not to explainUFOs, so much as to explain them away. In fact, that was true. It had become anational joke, and could scarcely conduct a minimally valid investigation of anyUFO encounter, much less a scientific one. Yet, if Blue Book was a farce, at least it was the people’s farce. That is,the public paid for it through tax dollars, and at least in theory Blue Book wasresponsible to the American people. During the 1950s and 1960s, Americancitizens who witnessed a UFO may or may not have believed what they saw to havebeen extraterrestrial, but they were able to report it to their local Air ForceBase with the expectation that Project Blue Book would somehow look into it.This enabled a level of engagement with the UFO topic by the American public ina way that would not otherwise have happened. This also meant that Blue Book served as a wedge with which to pry open theUFO problem. Its very existence begged an obvious question: if the Air Forceclaimed UFOs were not real, why did it have an office devoted to investigatingthem? As long as that office existed, maintaining a serious cover-up wasproblematic. As a number of declassified military records have demonstrated,UFOs were a serious matter to the U.S. national security establishment. BlueBook's role, especially after the Robertson Panel of 1953, was to pacify thepublic. This policy worked for a few years, but by the late 1960s, the officehad become a lightning rod. Blue Book therefore needed to go. Ultimately, the closing of Project Blue Book undermined democratic rule. Itremoved UFOs from the realm of public-government interaction. After 1969, anycitizen who saw a UFO had no government agency to which to report it. In other words, people now had to cope with this most awesome and sometimesterrifying phenomenon without cooperation from the government that was supposedto be responsible to them. In a society that theoretically gave sovereignty tothe people, this was, and is, a discrepancy and a problem. By the end of 1969,it appeared that secrecy had won. And indeed, the bottom had fallen out for supporters of a UFO reality. NICAPwas in financial ruins and effectively leaderless following the removal ofKeyhoe from its leadership. This was accomplished by a group of NICAP boardmembers with strong CIA connections.[127] [index_split_006.html#filepos1238092]In 1971, James McDonald died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, aterrible conclusion to a brilliant career.[128][index_split_006.html#filepos1238387] It appeared that all the efforts of thosepeople working to end UFO secrecy had resulted in abject failure. Yet, if there is one thing that can always be counted on, it is that today isnot yesterday, and tomorrow will not be like today. UFO research would regroupin the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond. New attempts would be made to understand theproblem and to crack open the secrecy. Chapter 5Digging Deeper—The Breakaway Civilization Imagine the year is 1947, and you are President Harry Truman. Key advisershave just informed you that the U.S. military has recovered technology from acrashed flying disc. You learn that this technology does not appear to have comefrom any known source, nor even human civilization itself. Surely, that would be a lot to handle. What might President Truman do in sucha situation? It is possible that his initial instinct would be to tell the worldabout this momentous discovery. After all, it would make him forever famous asthe man who announced that an extraterrestrial race was visiting Earth. It wouldprobably ensure his re-election, too, no small consideration for a careerpolitician. But then again, Truman would have had second thoughts. He would have beenreminded, as if he needed to be reminded, of just how upsetting, traumatic, andeven revolutionary such a revelation would be. Because this would pose a seriousthreat to the human structure of power, perhaps even the stability of humansociety itself. That is because in 1947, the people of Earth were lying flat on their backs,exhausted from the titanic struggle that had been the Second World War. Europeand Asia were devastated, filled with rubble, refugees, and an overwhelming taskof rebuilding. Even in America, which emerged from the war powerful and vibrant,the American people were also desperately seeking a return to normalcy—that is,to put all the stresses, uncertainties, and terror of the war behind them, andto resume their lives. An announcement of extraterrestrials could create genuinepublic panic. The question was, how severe would it be? Such factors by themselves would be enough to give anyone pause beforeannouncing the reality of extraterrestrial visitors. In addition, however, therewas the nascent Cold War. In 1947, Soviet military power rivaled that of theUnited States. Soviet troops appeared to threaten all of Western Europe at thatvery moment. Communism was the great enemy to the Western world—that iscertainly how America’s leadership saw the matter. It seemed no sure thing thatEurope would remain a free enterprise zone. Under such conditions, giving thesecret to the Soviets would mean that they, too, would possess ET technology. There is no way the American national security establishment could assent tosuch a thing. That very establishment was unwilling to share its newly exploitedatomic technology, an important political issue at the time. The United Nationshad already suggested that atomic technology was too important for any onenation to possess, and that the U.N. itself ought to control it. The U.S.position was, absolutely not. Such a development would be the quickest way togive the nuclear secret to the Soviets. If not atomic technology, clearly not something as exotic as alientechnology. Cold War requirements demanded secrecy about UFOs. Then there was the matter of oil. Even a child can understand, after somebasic observation, that that these objects do not require oil to travel fromPoint A to Point B. Any object that can hover indefinitely, accelerateinstantly, zigzag, and do all this silently, is surely using an exotic means ofpropulsion and surely a highly advanced energy system. If the President were toannounce the reality of these flying saucers, it would not be long beforescientists around the world began to study the nature of their propulsion andpower systems. This could quickly lead to a replacement of petroleum as theworld's leading source of power. Today, in the 21st century, most people are fine with that idea, at least intheory. Petroleum may underlie our world, but it is also at the center of manyof today’s important problems. But in the 1940s and 1950s, the petroleumindustry was the largest business in the world, and the very foundation of theglobal infrastructure. It had been growing for generations. It provided millionsof jobs. It supported America’s constantly growing automotive industry, anindustry that defined so much of American and world culture. Recognition of UFOs would pose a grave threat to all of this, even to theglobal financial structure itself. After all, what if this new source of energy,whatever it was, could not be as easily monetized as petroleum? Could the globalfinancial structure afford free energy? A perverse question, to be sure, but onethat had to be important to those people at the top of the human powerstructure. All of this would have been daunting enough to President Truman. And yet,there was more to consider. He had to wonder how this disclosure would affectsociety. Aside from the likelihood of some level of panic, he had to think aboutthe changes that might take place once the public had access to the radicaltechnologies being studied in secret. Was it really a good thing to let everyonehave their own flying saucer, zipping around the world at whim? Most people,undoubtedly, would say yes. From the perspective of those individuals makingnational and global policy, however, and whose first goal is usually stabilityand control, the answer would be, certainly not. More serious still would be the potential of weaponizing this new technology.The world had just been shown the awful power of the atomic bomb. With access toalien technology, might some scientist or nation create a weapon even morepowerful, more terrifying? How could such technology be controlled? The onlycertain way would be to keep it completely secret. Finally, there was the matter of assessing these unknown beings themselves.Truman and his people could not possibly have known the full scope of what theywere dealing with. Did they have anything to worry about? Were these otherbeings a threat? As the previous chapter showed, the U.S. military had continualencounters with UFOs from the 1940s onward. These objects had the ability topenetrate U.S. airspace with total ease, evading interception time and again.What were they trying to do? This matter caused concern at the highest levels ofthe U.S. national security establishment. U.S. Air Force Captain Edward Ruppelt,who had managed Project Blue Book during the early 1950s, put the matter well:“how could we convince the public the aliens weren't hostile when we didn't knowit ourselves?”[129] [index_split_006.html#filepos1238688] All of these factors—public panic and destabilization, Cold War realities,petroleum and infrastructure issues, weaponization fears, and concerns overthese Others—had to make their weight felt in the decision to keep UFOs assecret as possible. It was not simply a matter that strange technologies andbeings were operating on the Earth. More to the point, their materials and evenbodies had probably been acquired. It is this factor that made all thedifference, and which, more than anything else, required the secrecy. In other words, it would have been one thing for the military to hide theexistence of the UFO reality, as long as the UFOs and ETs remained safely “outthere.” In that case, it would simply be a matter of preventing public panic andperhaps to avoid looking helpless. But, if it were acknowledged that this samemilitary had recovered alien hardware, everything would change. It would meanthat there would need to be a program to study, replicate, and exploit thattechnology. Such a program would have to have been funded secretly, away fromCongressional oversight. After all, admitting such a secret to Congress would bethe same thing as admitting it to the world. UFO Crash: Roswell Of course, before discussing the possession of alien technology, we shouldfirst make a case for it. Upon review of the history, it appears that, not only at Roswell but inseveral other instances, military authorities came into possession of UFOs. Inhis book, Majic Eyes Only, Ryan Wood listed more than seventy cases of possibleUFO crash retrievals. With enough information, many undoubtedly would turn outto be something else. But some of these cases are compelling. Roswell, for instance, remains a strong case, even after all these years,despite being mired in confusion, argument, and obfuscation. On Saturday, July5, 1947, a sheepherder named Mac Brazel, foreman of the Foster Ranch, a veryremote place outside Roswell, New Mexico, found debris scattered over a largepasture. It seemed to him to consist mostly of metal, plastic I-beams,lightweight material, foil, and string-like material. All of it seemed to beunusually lightweight and strong. After showing some of it to his nearestneighbors, he contacted the Roswell Sheriff, George Wilcox. Wilcox contacted theRoswell Army Air Force Base, home of the 509th Bomb Group, under the command ofColonel William Blanchard. On Monday, July 7, Blanchard sent three men to the Roswell debris field.These were intelligence officer Captain Jesse Marcel, and twocounterintelligence officers: Sheridan Cavitt and William Rickett. Many years later, Jesse Marcel told his story to researcher Stanton Friedman.He said that Brazel took him and Cavitt to the debris field, which was threequarters of a mile long and two hundred to three hundred feet wide. There was agouge in the ground about five hundred feet long. Marcel noticed debris as thinas newsprint, but which was incredibly strong. Later, another soldier toldMarcel that this debris could not be dented, not even by a sledgehammer. Therewas also foil which, when crumpled, would return to its shape without wrinkles.Marcel noticed I-beams with odd symbols on them; the beams would flex slightly,but not break. Marcel told Friedman, “it certainly wasn't anything built by us.” After spending the afternoon and evening gathering as much debris aspossible, Marcel drove back to the base. Along the way, he stopped at his home.It was 2 a.m. when he awakened his family to show them what he had found. Hisson, eleven-year-old Jesse Marcel, Jr., remembered the incident for the rest ofhis life. Later that morning, Marcel and Cavitt arrived at Roswell Army AirField, each with a carload of debris. Blanchard then notified the Eighth AirForce in Fort Worth, Texas, and ordered Marcel to take the debris there. The Roswell Daily Record of Tuesday, July 8, 1947, then issued one of themost famous newspaper headlines in history: “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer OnRanch In Roswell Region.” Lieutenant Walter Haut, the public information officerat the base, on orders from Blanchard, wrote “the intelligence office of the 509Bombardment Group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at noon today that thefield has come into possession of a flying saucer.” [images/00010.jpg]Headline of the Roswell Daily Record, July 8, 1947. Immediately, the town of Roswell was overwhelmed with media requests fromaround the world. Just as immediately, a decision was made from up high to killthe story. Thus, three hours after the announcement, Jesse Marcel was in FortWorth, Texas, with the head of the Eighth Air Force, General Roger Ramey. There,Marcel was made to pose with scraps of a dilapidated weather balloon. Rameyannounced it had all been a misunderstanding. No flying saucer, just a weatherballoon. Sorry for the confusion, everyone. At the same time, a memo from the FBI offered some description of the objectand added some interesting details. The relevant passage reads:> THE DISC IS HEXAGONAL IN SHAPE AND WAS SUSPENDED FROM A BALLON [sic] BY CABLE,> WHICH BALLON [sic] WAS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FEET IN DIAMETER. FURTHER ADVISED> THAT THE OBJECT FOUND RESEMBLES A HIGH ALTITUDE WEATHER BALLOON WITH A RADAR> REFLECTOR, BUT THAT TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEIR OFFICE AND WRIGHT> FIELD HAD NOT BORNE OUT THIS BELIEF. DISC AND BALLOON BEING TRANSPORTED TO> WRIGHT FIELD BY SPECIAL PLANE FOR EXAMINATION. It is not often realized that the description of the Roswell object followsthe one given by Ramey himself, as well as a Major Curtin, to the Reuters wireservice. It also appears that the technicians at Wright Field were skeptical ofthe claim that a balloon was what had crashed. The debris that was photographedin Ramey’s office certainly appeared to be the badly torn up part of a balloon.How Ramey could describe it as hexagonal defies any logic or observationalcommon sense. Of course, just how Marcel, Blanchard, and the rest of the peopleat the 509th could make such an egregious error and identify it as a flying discis an even greater leap of logic, especially since no disc was ever photographedin Ramey’s office. An important aspect to this memo is that it stated the debriswas “being transported to Wright Field by special plane for examination.”Somehow, it was considered important enough for serious analysis by thetechnicians there. Why would a downed balloon warrant such treatment?Ultimately, what seems glaringly obvious is that Ramey released a cover storyabout what had crashed, and some of this information got into the FBI memo.[130][index_split_006.html#filepos1238942] The Roswell news made a brief splash, and then submerged so deep as to beforgotten for more than thirty years. In 1978, purely by chance, StantonFriedman met Marcel, beginning the resurrection of Roswell into the iconic caseit has now become. Through the 1980s, 1990s, and indeed into the 21st century,researchers such as Friedman, William Moore, Donald Schmitt, Kevin Randle, TomCarey, and others had interviewed hundreds of individuals with connections tothe case. Still, efforts to get to the bottom of the Roswell mystery have been thwartedagain and again. Part of the problem appears to be the national securityapparatus, which naturally has controlled access to key data. For instance,during the 1990s, New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff began to look into thecase, after hearing requests from his constituents. After stonewalling andrebuffs from the Pentagon, Schiff contacted the General Accounting Office (GAO),the official investigative arm of Congress. Unfortunately, the GAO similarly gotnowhere. In fact, one Pentagon liaison reportedly told the GAO representative to“go shit in your hat.” Ultimately, the GAO report concluded that the outgoingmessages from Roswell Army Air Field for the period of time in question “weredestroyed without proper authority.” This is very unfortunate, since thesemessages would have shown how military officials in Roswell explained to theirsuperiors what had happened. As Schiff put it, “these outgoing messages werepermanent record, which should never have been destroyed. The GAO could notidentify who destroyed the messages, or why.”[131][index_split_006.html#filepos1239298] The investigation of Roswell is a perfect example of how the formalgovernment apparatus, in this case Congress, was inadequate when dealing withthe true center of power, the clandestine secret keepers of the NationalSecurity State. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force had taken the initiative togenerate two reports on Roswell, stating first that all the confusion was causedby a downed, Top Secret, Mogul high-altitude balloon, and later by air drops ofsix-foot tall test dummies, which presumably were mistaken for tinyextraterrestrial bodies.[132] [index_split_006.html#filepos1239753] Nitpickingthese Air Force explanations is easy and has become something of a hobby amongsome researchers. Nevertheless, the Air Force's official explanation of Roswell,despite the fact that so few people believe it, has been able to maintain itsstanding within official media and political circles. There is much more to the Roswell story and subsequent debates. Muchdiscussion has occurred over how many debris fields there actually were. Morerecently, the claim has been made that some researchers have found qualityKodachrome images of a dead alien, presumably from Roswell. As of this writing,no images have been released, but such discussion at least proves that Roswellcontinues to be a fertile ground for investigation, and heated debate.[133][index_split_006.html#filepos1240969] UFO Crash: Aztec It is not possible here, nor is there need, to include all of the UFO crashretrieval stories that exist. But, it is useful to describe a few of them, ifonly to point out that claims of such retrievals include much more than theRoswell story. One such case, much-debated, took place in Aztec New Mexico, in March 1948.Aztec is located at the four corners area where New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, andArizona meet. Like the Roswell crash site, it is quite remote, nearly surroundedby Indian reservations. Few people today realize that for years it was the Azteccase, not Roswell, which was the best known alleged UFO crash. It was firstdiscussed in a 1950 book, Behind the Flying Saucers, by journalist Frank Scully.Scully had two primary sources for this story, a friend named Silas Newton, andan acquaintance and sometime business partner of Newton, a scientist Scullycalled “Dr. Gee.” According to the story, an alien saucer came down essentially intact,whereupon the U.S. military gained access to it via a punctured porthole. Insidewere anywhere from 2 to 16 alien bodies: small, humanlike, dead, and charred.The UFO was dismantled and taken to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio for study. Within three years of the book’s publication, a journalist named J.P. Cahnwrote a series of devastating exposés regarding the accuracy and truthfulness ofSilas Newton and Dr. Gee, whom he identified as Leo GeBauer. The two were simplya pair of con men in the oil industry, wrote Cahn, who had hoaxed Scully. Newtonhad lied about his education and had defrauded business associates. Indeed, soonafterwards, both were convicted of discrediting a Colorado businessman. However, Scully maintained that, while Dr. Gee was modeled primarily onGeBauer, he was actually a composite of multiple inside sources. And whileGeBauer did not study at the University of Berlin (as Dr. Gee supposedly had),and did not manage 1,700 scientists doing experimental work in secret magneticresearch related to the flying saucers, he was Chief of Laboratories of AirResearch Company in Phoenix and Los Angeles, although in charge of maintenanceequipment, not research. What is interesting is that GeBauer was the subject of an FBI file totallingat least 398 pages. Even more interesting is that less than 200 of these pageshave been declassified under the Freedom of Information Act. The rest remainclassified, exempt, according to the FBI, “in the interest of national defense.”One cannot help but wonder why this is so, after all these years. But what makes Aztec intriguing is that several researchers have foundelements of the story that continue to give pause. In 2002, investigativejournalist Linda Moulton Howe interviewed members of the Pace family inFarmington, New Mexico, who recalled hearing news of a crashed UFO during thelate 1940s. They said this took place either in March 1948, or March 1949. Thefamily recalled reading a newspaper article which stated a UFO had crashed nearAztec, in an area known as Hart Canyon. However, that article has never beenfound. Scott Ramsey did even more research and investigation into the Azteccrash.[134] [index_split_006.html#filepos1241301] Supported in this endeavor bythis wife, Suzanne, the Ramseys made contact with relatives of two former NewMexico police officers from the area, who told their families that they saw acrashed disc in Hart Canyon. The year they gave was 1948, probably March. An intriguing part of Ramsey’s research related to a witness who claimed tohave worked at Roswell Army Air Field, and said there was a concrete slab at thecrash site used to support the crane that removed the craft. Ramsey searched forthe slab, which initially was not visible. Then, however, with help from anassistant, he found it at the suspected site by probing the soil. The rebar inthe concrete was dated to the 1940s, although further tests are needed to obtaina more precise date.[135] [index_split_006.html#filepos1241588] Just as compelling as this, however, was the research by the Ramseys intoScully, Newton, GeBauer, and Cahn. Regarding the latter, they discovered anagenda against Scully that was nothing short of a vendetta. Cahn, it turned out,had been captivated by the Aztec story, fully accepting its authenticity. He hadapproached Scully with a view to collaborating on a book about it. Denied this,he never forgave Scully and set out to destroy him and his main sources. TheRamseys' research on Newton and GeBauer do not show them to be dishonest in theleast, but rather smeared by Cahn's unethical journalism. After all these years,it appears that something exotic did go down near Aztec. There are quite a few alleged retrievals of exotic, or even extraterrestrial,UFOs—far more than the average person suspects.[136][index_split_006.html#filepos1241819] What follows are only a few of the betterknown cases, and which have received a reasonable investigation by privateresearchers. Naturally, no government has ever confirmed any of these cases.Still, they remain intriguing possibilities, and some of them, at least in myown opinion, appear to genuine. UFO Crash: Kingman One of these may have occurred near Kingman, Arizona, on May 21, 1953. Duringthe early 1970s, a man spoke to two private researchers, identifying himself asan engineer with graduate degrees in physics and engineering, stated that twentyyears earlier he had been part of a group of specialists who were taken in a bus(with blacked-out windows) to the crash site to study the craft. It was thirtyfeet in diameter and embedded in sand. Inside a nearby tent, under armed guard,was a humanoid figure, roughly four feet tall, and apparently dead. Researcher Raymond Fowler began looking into the case and met with thewitness. He concluded that something significant did appear to have happened,and wrote a long report, giving the witness the pseudonym “Fritz Werner.” Therewere some discrepancies in Werner’s account of the craft, compared with what hehad told the two previous researchers, although these could conceivably beexplained by memory lapses, or the fact that Werner claimed to Fowler that hehad had a number of martinis before talking with the other researchers. Yet muchseemed legitimate. Although Fowler was unable to find other witnesses to theevent, he wrote that “the peripheral names, positions, tests, dates, and placesmentioned within Mr. Werner’s personal account all check out exceptionallywell.” Werner’s diary entry for May 21, while not confirming a crash retrieval,does appear to show that he was on some sort of special mission at the time: “.. . Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB for a job I can’t write or talk about.” Other researchers came across tidbits pointing to a UFO crash at Kingman in1953. One of these was Charles Wilhelm, whose father had an acquaintance, a“Major Daly,” who had been flown to a UFO crash in April 1953. LeonardStringfield, one of the key researchers on the matter of UFO crash retrievals,described this in one of his reports and lectures on the subject. Daly wasblindfolded and driven to a hot desert location where there was an undamagedmetallic ship that was twenty-five to thirty feet in diameter. He spent two daysthere, determining that the craft was not made on Earth. There are otherintriguing details to this account. Other than the exact date (which may havebeen misremembered), this account is consistent with that of Werner’s. Don Schmitt, author of several books on Roswell, once spoke with a womannamed Judy Woolcott, whose husband had told her of “something strange” he hadseen in 1953. Although she could not recall the month exactly, she was certainthat the location was Kingman, Arizona. Her husband had been an officer, on dutyat an air base control tower, when something strange was picked up on radar. Thetarget lost altitude and went off the screen. He and several others went injeeps to the location where the object was believed to have crashed. They founda domed disc, embedded in the sand, which seemed undamaged. Before they couldget close, however, they were escorted from the area and told never to discussit. Although Woolcott’s husband saw no bodies, he told his wife that some of themilitary police said there were casualties and they were “not human.” Another interesting element to the Kingman story was provided by Bill Uhouse,a man who served ten years in the U.S. Marines as a fighter pilot, then fourmore years as a civilian with the Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB, performingflight testing of experimental aircraft. For many years after that, he said, heworked for defense contractors as an engineer of antigravity propulsion systems.This included flight simulators for exotic aircraft as well as actual flyingdiscs. Uhouse claimed that several times he met with an extraterrestrial being,who assisted the physicists and engineers with the engineering of the craft.This being, known as J-Rod, was said to have arrived on Earth in 1953 from theKingman crash. According to the account, four entities survived altogether,although two were disabled and taken to an unspecified medical facility. Therecovery crew that entered the craft at Kingman to inspect it came down with amysterious illness. J-Rod was reportedly over 200 years old, a typical grayextraterrestrial biological entity (EBE), suffering from cell deterioration, andsaid still to be located at Papoose S-4, just south of Area 51. Researcher BillHamilton said that he had read a document purporting to be a technical paper ontissue samples taken from an EBE known as AQ-J-ROD. The AQ is believed to standfor Project Aquarius.[137] [index_split_006.html#filepos1242342] UFO Crash: Brazil Another interesting crash, of sorts, took place in Brazil on September 10,1957, although the date is approximate. According to an anonymous letter sent toa Brazilian journalist, a crash of a UFO occurred near Sao Paulo, in a townknown as Ubatuba, where several people saw a disc dive down and explode,showering the area with flaming fragments. The writer mailed some small samples,which soon made their way to a Brazilian UFO researcher named Dr. Olavo Fontes.Fontes had the samples brought to a laboratory, which showed the fragments to beapparently of nearly pure magnesium. Although this could have been produced byearthly technology, creating it would not have been an easy thing to do, andonly a very few companies in the world were capable of manufacturing it. Thereis no easy explanation as to why such nearly pure magnesium was foundthere.[138] [index_split_006.html#filepos1243019] Even if this was the crash of non-human technology, there was never anindication that bodies were recovered, and indeed the story is so threadbarethat nothing remains of it, especially following the loss of the samples fromthe files of the American organization that housed them, the Aerial PhenomenaResearch Organization (APRO). That organization dissolved in the 1980s after thedeaths of its two founders, and its files were sequestered by a private groupthat has never allowed public viewing of them ever since.[139][index_split_006.html#filepos1243569] UFO Crash: Las Vegas Yet another fascinating UFO crash case took place on April 18, 1962, not farfrom Las Vegas, Nevada. One might think that the arrival of aliens in Las Vegaswould help to explain some of the city’s current character, but of course it wasalready a wild town by then. Perhaps it was already an ET tourist attraction. In fact, an unidentified, and very fast, object was tracked by the militarymoving across the United States, from Oneida, New York all the way west to theoutskirts of Las Vegas. The entire sighting lasted 32 minutes, giving the objectan average speed of 4,500 mph. If nothing else, this was no meteor, which wouldhave travelled at a much faster speed, and would not inspire the scrambling ofjets. Yes, whatever this object was, it triggered the scrambling of interceptorjets from Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix and Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas.In fact, it appears to have landed briefly at the town of Eureka Utah, whereseveral witnesses saw it as a glowing orange oval that gave off a low whirringsound. As it landed, it disrupted the electrical service from a nearby powerstation. Then it rose, maneuvered, and headed toward Nevada. People in Reno sawit, where it turned south and was seen just east of Las Vegas. At that point, itvanished from the radar screens. Many people described it as looking like atremendous flaming sword. Thousands of witnesses saw this object. It thenexploded near Mesquite, Nevada, at which time it was being pursued by armed jetinterceptors from Nellis Air Force Base. Project Blue Book investigated the event, doing a thoroughly unsatisfactoryand probably dishonest job. It separated the sighting into two distinct events,making them appear unrelated to each other. Years later, investigator KevinRandle interviewed several witnesses and reviewed the Blue Book files, where hediscovered the major discrepancies. He also communicated with an anonymous manwho claimed to have been an officer at Nellis Air Force Base at the time of thecrash. This person claimed that he and thirty others were driven into the desertearly the next morning to retrieve the crash debris. They were loaded into a buswith blacked-out windows, but one window was not entirely covered, and the manclaimed to have seen a damaged saucer-shaped craft.[140][index_split_006.html#filepos1243972] UFO Crash: Kecksburg Next to Roswell, this incident may be the best-known possible crash andretrieval of a UFO. It took place in 1965, near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. Alsolike Roswell, it has been the subject of much debate among researchers. The BlueBook files officially listed it as a meteorite, but whatever it was, it wascertainly not a meteorite. On the evening of December 9, 1965, a brightly glowing object streakedeastward across Canada, Michigan, and Ohio before striking ground at 4:47 p.m.,near the small town of Kecksburg. Thousands of people saw the object streakingacross the sky, which left a vapor trail that was visible for more than twentyminutes. Many people thought it was an aircraft on fire. At around 6:30 p.m., awoman called the local radio station, stating that an object or fireball hadcrashed into the woods near her home. She and her two sons saw smoke rising fromthe trees, and a bright object off to one side. State police and firefighterssoon arrived. One person who arrived on the scene was John Murphy, the news director of alocal radio station, WHJB. Murphy asked questions of everyone he saw. Then hedrove to the state police barracks in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. There, he sawnot only members of the state police, but also U.S. Army personnel, and two menin U.S. Air Force uniforms, one of them a lieutenant. Murphy asked the policeofficers what had happened, and was told that there was nothing whatsoever goingon in the woods. Skeptical of that explanation, to put it mildly, Murphyreturned to the crash site. He found an investigator for the State ofPennsylvania and the two decided to enter the woods. At that point, he learnedhe was not allowed in, and the entire area was cordoned off. Still, Murphy hadtaken pictures and recorded audio while on the scene, and decided he wouldprepare a radio documentary about the event. Other citizens had more success in entering the woods than did Murphy,several of whom were firefighters. One of them, Jim Romansky, was interviewedyears later by researcher Stan Gordon. Romansky had reached a streambed wherethe object apparently had first touched down. A deep furrow had been cut intothe bed, and the object itself was nearby. It was acorn-shaped, between nine andtwelve feet in diameter. It had no wings, no visible motors, no fuselage. Aroundthe bottom was a gold band with writing on it. To Romansky, it looked like“ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.” More precisely, with characters of broken andstraight lines, dots, rectangles, and circles. The body was dented, but withoutvisible rivets, seams, or welds. Gordon found another witness, Bill Bulebush, who had gotten nearly as closeas Romansky. He described the object in a near-identical manner. Bulebush couldsee bright blue sparks emanating from it, but heard no sound. Another man, BillWeaver, was farther away from the object, but claimed to see it glowing. He sawfour men dressed in what he called “moon suits,” carrying a large white box on astretcher into the woods. Soon after, Weaver was ordered out of the area by menin dark suits, something Romansky had also claimed. The media covered the Kecksburg story almost exclusively as a fireball. Anumber of astronomers were brought in to make statements to this effect,essentially ending public interest in the story. But even the most conservativecalculations of the object's speed make it much much slower than any meteoriteever recorded. The Blue Book files also state that a three-man team had beendispatched to investigate and pick up an object that started a fire in thewoods. This was certainly part of Project Moon Dust, a classified programdesigned to retrieve unidentified flying objects for military custody. One researcher, James Oberg, a NASA employee and former Air Forceintelligence officer, suggested in an article for Omni magazine that the crashedobject was a Soviet Kosmos 96 satellite, which he believed would have caused theactivation of Project Moon Dust. But this is incorrect. The Kosmos 96 satellitewas later confirmed to have crashed thirteen hours earlier in Canada. All that is known within reason is that, within two hours of the crash, themilitary sealed off the site, but not before witnesses got a good look at theobject, and not before others claimed to see a flatbed truck, with a tarpcovering a large object, leave the area at high speed. John Murphy’s story in this adventure is of special interest. According tohis wife, Murphy was convinced the object was not a meteorite. Following thecrash, he became deeply interested in the case and wrote a news story about it,called Object in the Woods. Just before the show was supposed to air, however,he was visited at the station by two men in black suits, identifying themselvesas government officials. They met with him alone for thirty minutes, an eventrecalled by another WHJB employee, Linda Foschia, who added that the menconfiscated some of Murphy’s audio tapes, and probably his photographs also,since these were never seen again. Soon after, Murphy aired a censored versionof his documentary, which essentially told nothing of interest. He then seems tohave gone into a depression, pulling away from the case and refusing to discussit. In February 1969, Murphy was struck and killed by an unidentified car in anapparent hit-and-run while on vacation in Ventura, California. There were still more witnesses to the Kecksburg crash who came forward yearslater. One of these claimed to have worked at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base atthe time, and said that a strange object was shipped there on December 16, 1965.Before he was escorted away, he saw the object, describing it in nearlyidentical terms as had the other witnesses. It certainly appears that something highly unusual came down at Kecksburg,which could well have been a genuine crashed UFO.[141][index_split_006.html#filepos1244235] UFO Crash: Bolivia Another UFO crash retrieval took place in the mountains of Bolivia on May 6,1978. According to a declassified U.S. State Department memorandum, many peoplesaw an object streak across the sky and slam into a mountain near El Taire onthe Bermejo River, very close to the Argentine border. On May 14, the BolivianAir Force discovered the crash site, apparently working with the local police,with the police chief reporting “our men have discovered the object andinspected it.” It was “a dull metallic cylinder twelve feet long with a fewdents. No one knows what is inside it.” In one of the declassified memos, the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia wrote:> . . . the Bolivian Air Force plans to investigate to determine what the object> might be and from where it came. . . . The general region has had more than> its share of reports of UFOs this past week. Request a reply ASAP. One might wonder why a U.S. Ambassador would know about the intensity of aUFO wave in Bolivia. It is known that Project Moon Dust was activated for thisevent. Furthermore, two U.S. intelligence officers arrived on the scene and seemto have taken over the investigation. To this day, the identity of what camedown in Bolivia has not been made public.[142][index_split_006.html#filepos1244492][images/00044.jpg]A declassified Secret memo to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance about thecrash of an unknown object in Bolivia. Other Crashes There are a few possible UFO crashes from more recent years. All are spotty,unconfirmed, and mostly uncorroborated. One, rather sketchy indeed, is said tohave occurred on April 15, 1992, near Buffalo New York. An investigator known tothe author looked into this case, in which a large disc-shaped craft was seencoming out of Lake Ontario. It then flew erratically south towards the city ofLockport, then crashed. Not much more is known about it. A better-known casetook place in the Brazilian town of Varginha. In addition to involving a crashretrieval, it included the alleged sighting of a live alien being by three younggirls, involvement by Brazilian medical personnel, and of course U.S. militaryinvolvement. The case fascinates because it has generated a number of compellingwitnesses that attest to its reality. On the other hand, very little has beenverified, and naturally the Brazilian government denies that anything of thesort occurred. Finally, a lesser known case, but one which seems suggestive, is said to havetaken place in March, 1997, in Peru. The sole witness is U.S. Marine Corps LanceCorporal John Weygandt, who gave a detailed description of a crashed object andrecovery operations, all run by the U.S. military, for the Disclosure Project,headed by Dr. Steven Greer. Weygandt's opinion was that this UFO had been shotdown by a Hawk missile. It is worth mentioning that not only did the U.S. military recover apparentcrashed UFOs, but so did the Soviet military. One case occurred near the fareastern city of Dalnegorsk, in January 1986. Another possible case took place inAugust 1987, near the town of Vyborg, close to Leningrad, and yet anotherpossible UFO crash occurred in Tyumen, east of the Ural Mountains, in 1989. Inthis last instance, alien bodies were said to have been recovered. It is verydifficult to confirm these cases, but the Dalnegorsk case at least wasinvestigated extensively, and has been argued with some force to have been alegitimate UFO crash retrieval. It is sometimes referred to as the SovietRoswell. If even one of these, or any other instances, were genuine retrievals ofUFOs, we are talking about something of great importance. Clearly, suchretrievals would require programs to study the technology and (presumably)biology. It is obvious that the acquisition of alien technology would demand aprogram to study it. Indeed, there have been many leaks from the classifiedworld exactly to that effect. Stringfield’s Leaks Such leaks go back to the 1950s and 1960s, but not until the late 1970s didlarge numbers of them begin to appear. The researcher Leonard Stringfieldpublished a book in 1977, titled Situation Red: The UFO Siege. It was the firstserious book in years to discuss crash retrievals as a legitimate phenomenon.Stringfield’s mention of such stories was brief, but it was enough to capturethe attention of quite a few people who had stories of their own. These includedstories not only of UFO crash retrievals, but sometimes of individuals who hadseen dead alien bodies. The stories Stringfield collected were astounding. He was able to investigatea number of these, unable to investigate others, and at all times used his bestjudgment and common sense in evaluating them. Overall, they tell a consistentstory. Several intriguing stories had reached Stringfield prior to publishingSituation Red. One came through Sherman Larsen, a UFO researcher with abackground in the U.S. Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). Larsen had knowna Presbyterian minister who, as a boy, had been with his father (also aminister) on a visit to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Afterstraying into a “labyrinth of corridors” and becoming lost, they entered a roomin which they encountered a large, glass-covered case. “Peering inside, theywere shocked to see a number of small, preserved humanoid bodies. They wereimmediately grabbed by security and taken to another room. The boy’s father wasforced to sign papers before they were allowed to leave the museum. By chance,Larsen also learned that the Security Intelligence Corps office in Chicago wasin that very building. Stringfield wrote, “Perhaps forever unanswered is thequestion: Was there a secret link between the SIC and the preserved littlecreatures?” Other stories came to him through Charles Wilhelm. As an adolescent in 1959,Wilhelm listened to a deathbed “confession” from a neighbor whose lawn he usedto cut. The woman was dying of cancer, and told him that she once held a TopSecurity Clearance at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and had seen twosaucer-shaped craft in a secret hanger. One craft was intact, the other damaged.She also knew of two small “creatures” preserved inside another secret building,and had personally handled the paperwork on their autopsy report. “Uncle Samcan’t do anything to me after I’m in the grave,” she told him. Wilhelm relatedanother story to Stringfield of something he was told in 1966 by a friend whosefather had worked with Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson. It was nearlyidentical to what his dying neighbor had told him. On the father’s deathbed, hetold his son that he had seen two disc-shaped craft, one intact and one damaged,along with four preserved small alien bodies “packed in chemicals.”[143][index_split_006.html#filepos1245008] [images/00011.jpg]Leonard Stringfield, one of the most important American UFO researchers of the1970s and 1980s. But such stories were a mere smattering compared with what Stringfieldcollected after publishing Situation Red. They came in, dozens and scores ofthem. One source said that the U.S. military was designing a radar system todetect UFOs, and that Navy nuclear submarines were equipped with instruments todetect submerged UFOs. Another related a retrieval of a UFO somewhere in theAmerican southwest in 1957, in which four humanoid bodies were recovered withgreat difficulty. In another, a witness claimed to see nine alien bodies atWright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1966. They were four feet tall. He added thatthe craft was also at the base, and at certain military bases, mobile units wereready at all times to recover downed UFOs. Yet another of Stringfield’switnesses—a doctor whom he interviewed several times—claimed to have autopsiedan alien body himself. This doctor gave Stringfield a great deal of informationwhile they were in communication. There were more witnesses. One, a contractor at Wright-Patterson during the1960s, claimed to have seen seven alien bodies under conditions of extremesecurity. Yet another, a former Air Force intelligence officer, said that in1948 he saw a top-secret manuscript about a UFO crash in New Mexico in whichcraft and bodies were recovered. Yet another witness, a radar specialist at FortMonmouth, New Jersey, told Stringfield that in 1953 he had been shown a film ofa crashed UFO in the desert, which included the interior of the craft, and deadalien beings inside a tent. This individual had been given no explanation ordebriefing regarding what he had been shown. Stringfield held onto the stories quietly for a while, but eventuallypublished them for the UFO research community.[144][index_split_006.html#filepos1245162] Going Deeper Still: The Sarbacher-Walker Saga During the 1970s and 1980s, Stringfield was not the only researcheruncovering a fascinating saga supporting the existence of a UFO retrievalprogram. The Canadian UFO researcher, Arthur Bray, gained access to the papersof the deceased Canadian government scientist, Wilbert Smith. Smith had had alongstanding interest in UFOs dating back to the 1950s. It had already beenknown from a released Canadian government document that in 1950, during a tripto Washington D.C., Smith had discussed the matter of flying saucers with asenior American defense scientist. It was known that this scientist confirmedthe reality of UFOs to Smith, and stated that the matter of UFOs was “the mosthighly classified subject in the United States government, rating higher eventhan the H-bomb.” What was not known, however, was the identity of this scientist. Braydiscovered this because he located Smith's original handwritten notes describingthe interview. The scientist was Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a brilliant physicist whowas a prominent consultant to the U.S. defense community. This was a stroke ofvery good fortune, because Sarbacher was still alive in the early 1980s, whenSmith discovered his identity. Two researchers, Stanton Friedman and WilliamSteinman, both interviewed Sarbacher, and Steinman hit paydirt, receiving atwo-page, single-spaced, typewritten letter from Sarbacher. Not only did theletter confirm all the essentials of what Smith had written about long before,but it went much further. Sarbacher told Steinman that, yes, there have beencrash retrievals of UFOs, and that there was a program in place to do this. Heeven named famous names, such as Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, Dr. Vannevar Bush, andDr. John von Neumann. He wrote:> . . . about the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials> reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very> tough. I am sure our laboratories analyzed them very carefully. There were> reports that instruments or people operating these machines were also very> light weight.... I remember in talking with some of the people at the office> that I got the impression these aliens were constructed like certain insects. Sarbacher’s letter was written in 1983, and he died shortly thereafter.Before he died, he gave one more clue to help unravel the mystery. During atelephone conversation with Steinman, Sarbacher said that although he had notattended the UFO meetings at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, he knew of anotherscientist who had. This was Dr. Eric A. Walker. Sarbacher was certain about it. Steinman and several other researchers, including Grant Cameron and T. ScottCrain, interviewed Walker a number of times through the 1980s. Walker had beenPresident of Penn State University, but more important was his work as a memberof the elite think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), which hechaired for many years. Cameron and Crain wrote extensively on Walker and theIDA, describing the organization as “the think tank to the highest echelons ofthe Pentagon “ and “the principal advisory organization serving the office ofthe Secretary of Defense as a whole.\" In a conversation with Steinman, Walker said, “yes, I attended meetingsconcerning that subject matter.” When asked about the group known as MJ-12,argued to be the secret group in charge of managing everything related to UFOs,Walker said that he did know about it and then told Steinman that he was“delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about.” Leave it alone,he told Steinman. In subsequent communications, however, Walker became less andless forthcoming. He apparently decided that perhaps he should not have beentalking about this topic, after all.[145] [index_split_006.html#filepos1245471] Bodies, Technology, and Area 51 There is no shortage of stories from impressive people attesting to thereality of UFO technology or extraterrestrial bodies held in secret atWright-Patterson Air Force Base, or near Area 51, or elsewhere. One such personwas Senator Barry Goldwater, who not only was a General in the U.S. Air ForceReserve, but ran for President on the Republican Party ticket in 1964. Goldwaterwas as military-friendly a politician as one could find in Washington, and thatis no small matter. He was even one of the first civilians to take a ride in thelegendary aircraft, the SR-71 Blackbird. One of his closest friends was GeneralCurtis LeMay, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. Several times,Goldwater discussed how LeMay had rebuffed his attempt to gain access to thearea in Wright-Patterson where alien bodies and technology were believed to beheld, sometimes referred to as the Blue Room. According to Goldwater, this wasthe only time in their friendship that LeMay had gotten angry with him. He toldthe Senator never to mention the topic again. In a letter to a constituent,Goldwater wrote “this thing has gotten so highly classified... it is justimpossible to get anything on it.”[146] [index_split_006.html#filepos1246063] LeMay may have gotten testy with his friend Barry Goldwater, but he did lethis guard down at least one time. I met a gentleman who told me of his encounterin 1987 with the retired Air Force legend. After meeting with this witness andlearning his key personal details, I will only add that there is no doubt in mymind that his account is truthful. The witness (“Jim”) was an active Ham radio operator living in Orange County,California. During early October 1987, he struck up an engaging radioconversation with an elderly gentleman about various aircraft, when he overheardthe operator refer to his companion as “General.” Jim did not know the identityof his new friend until he called the FCC office in Long Beach to look up theaddress of “W6EZV.” The result: Curtis E. LeMay, in Newport Beach. A week later, Jim found LeMay on the air talking with “K0dwc” (who turned outto be three-star General Francis H. “Butch” Griswold). After that conversationended, Jim contacted LeMay again for another pleasant conversation aboutaircraft and the band leader Tex Beneke, whom Jim had previously encountered onthe Ham airwaves, and of whom LeMay was a fan. Jim decided to try meeting with LeMay. He drove to Newport Beach and foundhis home. At 11:00 a.m., he rang the security door button as a camera swivelledto face him. Helen LeMay, wife of the General, answered. When she learned thiswas “Curt’s” friend, her voice brightened and she let him through. Inside theLeMay house was a four-foot high bust of the general—and then the man himself. For a short while, the two talked cordially about aircraft, and then TexBeneke. Then, Jim asked a different sort of question. “General,” he said, “wasthe 1947 crash at Roswell related to an alien craft?” LeMay looked at himsilently. Without saying a word, he nodded his head up and down. He wasobviously saying “yes” and just as obviously did not want to say it out loud.Perhaps he was being monitored, Jim wondered. Meanwhile, in the next room, Helen had answered the telephone. Jim heard herspeaking with someone, and then saying, “Butch, you would not believe what Curtis talking about right now!” A moment later she entered the room. Butch Griswoldwas on the phone, she said to her husband, and he wants to talk with you. Jim took the opportunity to say goodbye to the four-star general and drovehome, his head swimming. Later that afternoon while on his Ham radio, he saw theaddress “K0dwc” make a statement: “Well, we figured out who the mystery guestwas.” General Butch Griswold was clearly none-too-pleased about his friend’sindiscretion. That was the end of Jim’s communication with Curtis LeMay. The general diedthree years later. Perhaps some people might not believe that Jim’s encounterwith Curtis LeMay really happened. To those people I will only say that havingmet with Jim and reviewed his Ham radio information—including Curtis LeMay’s Hamradio information, which was legally available—and going over the encounterrepeatedly in detail, I am entirely convinced this event took place as told.LeMay, nearing the end of his life, for reasons we will never know, decided tomake an important admission to a new acquaintance. Stranger things havehappened. Through the 1980s and 1990s, other leaks continued to emerge. One importantsource during this period was aerospace journalist, James Goodall, who wrote forsuch publications as Jane's Defense Weekly, Aviation Week and Space Technology,and Interavia. Goodall interviewed quite a few members of the clandestine world,especially from within Groom Lake, Nevada, including Area 51. As a result of hisinterviews, Goodall concluded that there were at least eight “black” programsflying out of Groom Lake, not counting the ones that were already known, such asthe B-2 stealth bomber. One of those programs, he determined, was a silentflying triangle. Many of these used radical and highly unconventionaltechnologies. Goodall also had several contacts telling him that the technology at GroomLake was essentially out of this world. When asking one Groom Lake insider if hebelieved in UFOs, his contact replied, “absolutely, positively they exist.” WhenGoodall asked if he would expand on that statement, the man said he would not,although he later said, “we have things in the Nevada desert that would makeGeorge Lucas envious,” a clear reference to Star Wars technology and beyond.Another source told Goodall, “we have things out there that are literally out ofthis world. . . . better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies.”He, too, would not expand on this statement.[147][index_split_006.html#filepos1246225] Some of these accounts make the story of Bob Lazar seem almost pedestrian bycomparison. And yet, it was Lazar's story, which came out at the end of 1989,that once and for all blew open the secrecy and anonymity of Area 51. Moreaccurately, Lazar discussed an area just south of it, which he said is known asS-4. He claimed to have seen discs at S-4 several times in 1988 and 1989. All inall, he said there were nine extraterrestrial vehicles there. A great deal hasbeen said about Lazar, both pro and con, but it is worth consideration thatGeorge Knapp, a journalist with KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, investigated Lazarextensively, and was able to confirm key elements to the story. He alsointerviewed more than two dozen Area 51 and Groom Lake insiders who corroboratedmany of the kinds of things Lazar was discussing. None, however, were willing togo public.[148] [index_split_006.html#filepos1246727] If Lazar’s basic account is true, the U.S. black budget world has been inpossession of extraterrestrial technology and attempting to duplicate it sincewell before the 1980s. This rather confuses the matter of what a witness sees,when they look up and see what looks like a UFO. Is it one of ours, or theirs? Despite the frequency of leaks coming from people like Bob Lazar and so manyothers from within the classified world, they still lack the power of aconfirmed government statement. But how does one deal with leak after leak,claim after claim, coming out of that world, saying essentially the same thing?What does one make of the statements given by Ben Rich, for instance, the manwho for many years headed Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works division. Ben Richhas been called the Father of Stealth, having overseen the development of thestealth fighter, the F-117A Nighthawk. Before Rich died in January 1995, he madeseveral startlingly open statements about the reality of UFOs andextraterrestrials. One was in a 1986 letter to friend and colleague John Andrews, one ofLockheed’s great engineers. Andrews had written to Rich, stating his own beliefin “lots” of UFOs, both man-made (“Category A”) and extraterrestrial (“CategoryB”). Andrews asked Rich if his own belief covered extraterrestrial as well asman-made UFOs. Rich’s reply was succinct, yet a tad enigmatic. “Yes,” he wrote back toAndrews, “I'm a believer in both categories. I feel everything is possible. Manyof our man-made UFOs are Un-Funded Opportunities” (and here he underlined the U,F, and O of that phrase). It is important to recognize Rich’s stated belief that extraterrestrials werehere on Earth. True, he stated this as belief rather than knowledge to Andrews,but one must remember that Ben Rich was the CEO of a large organization. Suchpeople are not prone to making blatant statements about anything, certainly notsomething as sensitive as UFOs. Rich was in an excellent position to form hisopinion. During the course of his career, he had access to individuals of thehighest intellectual caliber, who in turn were exposed to some of the mostsensitive secrets in the nation. He himself was one such person, having managedthe stealth fighter program. Ben Rich was in as good a position as anyone tohave genuine information on the matter of UFOs. The most provocative part of his reply to Andrews was his remark aboutUn-Funded Opportunities. What might that mean? There seem to be twopossibilities. One is that the program to build UFOs was so secret, so “black,”that funding would be so deeply hidden as to be “nonexistent”—hence the projectwould be unfunded, so to speak. The other possibility is that man-made UFOs werederived from the active study of extraterrestrial UFOs, presumably in the formof crash retrievals or other freebies. Hence, unfunded. Ben Rich had more than this to say on the matter of UFOs. On March 23, 1993,he spoke at the UCLA School of Engineering, presenting a generally standardhistory of Skunk Works. Then, however, he ended his presentation with aremarkable statement: “we now have the technology to take ET home.” This happens to have been a tagline that Rich used for many of his lecturesover the years, and seems to have been more coy and humorous than provocative inintent. Since 1983, in various lectures, he had referred to Skunk Works gettinga contract to “take ET home” (a reference to Steven Spielberg’s movie, ET: TheExtraterrestrial, which came out in 1983). Nevertheless, the statement startled a few in attendance, and after mostattendees filed out, some stayed behind, in the hopes that Ben Rich wouldclarify or expand on what he meant. Two of these people were Jan Harzan, asenior executive with IBM, and also Director of the Orange County Mutual UFONetwork (MUFON), and Tom Keller, an aerospace engineer who has worked as acomputer systems analyst for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. According to both of them, Rich was surrounded by a small group of people andmade a few other statements. “We now know how to travel to the stars.” “There is an error in the equations, and we have figured it out, and now knowhow to travel to the stars and it won't take a lifetime to do it.” “It is time to end all the secrecy on this, as it no longer poses a nationalsecurity threat, and make the technology available for use in the privatesector.” And, finally, said Harzan, a statement which he considered to be a very closeparaphrase: “there are many in the intelligence community who would like to seethis stay in the black and not see the light of day.”[149][index_split_006.html#filepos1246836] Rich did not explicitly state that extraterrestrials were among us. Nor didhe even state explicitly that UFOs were real. On the other hand, he did make avery clear statement that the technology within the classified world was vastlybeyond anything imaginable in the public realm. After all, he essentially saidthat the classified world had the capability for interstellar travel. James Goodall knew Ben Rich very well, and also had something to add aboutthe aerospace legend. In a video interview, Goodall said that he spoke to Richabout ten days before he died, which would have been shortly after Christmas of1994. According to Goodall:> About ten days before he died, I was speaking to Ben on the telephone at the> USC Medical Center in Los Angeles. And he said, Jim, we have things out in the> desert that are fifty years beyond what you can comprehend. They have about> forty five hundred people at the Lockheed Skunk Works. What have they been> doing for the last eighteen or twenty years? They're building something.[150]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1247514] As if these stories were not enough, there is a final, very intriguing storyabout Ben Rich. This came from Bill McDonald, a forensic illustrator for theaerospace industry, and a good friend of John Andrews. After Andrews died in1999, McDonald wrote in a private email, since republished many times, thatAndrews had told him of claims made by Ben Rich during private communications. First, Rich told Andrews that there were two types of UFOs: “the ones webuild, and the ones they build.” According to this account, Rich said that theU.S. government actively managed the UFO program until a 1969 purge by PresidentRichard Nixon. After this, administration over the program was handled by aninternational Board of Directors in the private sector. Rich also reportedlydescribed to Andrews the attitude taken by his predecessor at the head of SkunkWorks, Kelly Johnson. According to Rich, Johnson's attitude toward theextraterrestrials was negative. In private conversation with Rich, Johnsonimplied that factions from “out there” were more of a threat than they were ablessing, and that the cost of having them around was “unimaginable” and“unbelievable.”[151] [index_split_006.html#filepos1248126] McDonald's letter on the subject continued.> It was Ben Rich's opinion that the public should not be told. He believed they> could not handle the truth—ever. Only in the last months of his decline did he> begin to feel that the ‘international corporate Board of Directors’ dealing> with the ‘Subject’ could represent a bigger problem to citizens’ personal> freedoms under the United States Constitution than the presence of off world> visitors themselves.[152] [index_split_006.html#filepos1248471] Ben Rich appeared to be conflicted about what he knew. He may not havebelieved most people could handle the truth about UFOs and extraterrestrials,but he also appears to have felt the need to confide to a few people on alimited basis toward the end of his life. [images/00038.jpg]Ben Rich, a man with an interest in UFOs, and evidently some knowledge. There are other stories, fascinating but so far unprovable. One is the thealleged Alien Reproduction Vehicle, or ARV, allegedly seen at a secret displayat Lockheed’s Helendale facility in November 1988. The source for this accountwas a technical design engineer named Brad Sorensen, who told his friend andrespected aviation/aerospace illustrator, Mark McCandlish. The design was of aclassic flying saucer, except that this was made in the USA, and designed fromacquired alien technologies. According to a lecture from a four-star generalthat Sorensen heard while there, some form of antigravity was in effect, and theARVs in operation had already traversed much of the solar system by then. Thestory is fascinating, and a number of prominent individuals have interviewedSorensen about his account. Those who listened to him stated that he seemsentirely truthful, but the story of course remains officially unconfirmed.[153][index_split_006.html#filepos1248764] One more final high-profile individual ought to be mentioned in this context:former Apollo 14 astronaut, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, who was the sixth man to walk onthe moon. As such, Mitchell has had access to elite figures throughout the U.S.national security structure. Certainly, he has been in a good position to knowmatters of importance relating to space and national security. Therefore, it isof no small significance that for many years on various occasions, Mitchell hasspoken publicly about the reality of a deeply secret program to studyextraterrestrial technology and bodies. In several private conversations withmyself, he added that he learned this from two “very elite” connections who toldhim about the existence of this program at “great risk personally,professionally, and to their families.” The fact that mainstream news media hasignored, marginalized, or belittled his various statements will remain a blackmark as long as such a policy continues. When considering the likelihood of actual retrievals of crashed UFOs,combined with the many leaked accounts emanating from the world of nationalsecurity, there is a compelling argument that exotic technology in the form ofUFOs came into the possession of the American military, and almost certainlyothers such as the Soviet military. This technology appears to have been studiedfor many years. Indeed, the observations of many citizens from California'sAntelope Valley, where many of the leading aerospace and aviation designs arecreated and tested, confirm that extremely advanced technologies are being seenand flown there. The same can be said for the Area 51/Groom Lake region. Whatdoes one make of the 1994 video of a very bizarre UFO being flown over theNevada Test Site? This video was leaked in early 1995. It shows an object movingin ways that defy conventional aviation physics. Multiple analyses indicate thatit was roughly fifteen feet wide and ten feet high. Within minutes its speedranged from as low as 20 mph to as high as 500 mph. It made very sharp-angledturns, including a right angle turn at approximately 140 mph. What can do this?Since it was recorded inside one of America's most secret testing facilities, itis reasonable to assume that we ourselves made it. Can this be related to theprogram to study crashed UFOs? The answer may well be yes.[154][index_split_006.html#filepos1249239] [images/00050.jpg]From the 1994 video of an unknown object recorded at the Nellis Test Site. German Technology Starting in the 1960s, another idea was introduced into the UFO researchfield, one which has received significant attention throughout the 21st century.It is the idea that a certain portion of what we call UFOs has derived fromclandestine German technology from the Second World War, technology whichcontinued to develop during the 1950s and beyond.[155][index_split_006.html#filepos1249608] There are a number of permutations on thisidea, including a covert research and development program based in the U.S. withthe help of Nazi scientists, various programs in South America (most notablyArgentina and Bolivia) run by escaped Nazis, and even a secret Nazi base inAntarctica. It is worth remembering that from the very beginning of the modern flyingsaucer era, many researchers speculated that the mysterious objects wereclassified technology, presumably from either the Americans or Russians. Duringthese early years, very little was known of the importation of Nazi scientists(Project Paperclip), but the idea was there that these objects were of entirelyterrestrial manufacture, and it has never gone away. Starting in the late 1960s,Italian researcher Renato Vesco argued that the Germans had developed severaltypes of alternative energy devices, even some form of antigravity. Disc-shapedand tubular craft were built and tested near the end of the Second World War,which, he argued, was the proper explanation of the foo fighters. Theseconcepts, he maintained, were developed by the Americans and Soviets and leddirectly to flying saucers. In 2002, aviation writer Nick Cook investigated this possibility further. Hisconclusion was that the Nazis had experimented “with a form of science the restof the world had never remotely considered,” and which has continued to besuppressed to this day. The most famous of the Nazi achievements was said to bea flying disc, the so-called V7, which flew out of Prague on February 14, 1945.It was said to have climbed to an altitude of 40,000 feet within minutes andreached a speed of 1,200 mph, far and away beyond what any fighter aircraftcould achieve at the time. According to the source, it was either destroyed atthe war’s end, or captured by the Soviets. Cook also discussed the work ofViktor Schauberger, who investigated alternative energy and “levitationalflight,” including flying saucer-shaped craft. During the war, his work wastaken over by the S.S. under the direction of the notorious General HansKammler. According to one of Cook’s sources, a Schauberger prototype, using“wholly unconventional” science, successfully rose twice to the ceiling and thenwas wrecked.[156] [index_split_006.html#filepos1250795] Shortly after this,Schauberger himself was captured by the Americans and detained until March 1946. Cook also investigated the so-called “Bell Experiment,” something thatreceived significant follow-up in the work of Joseph P. Farrell. In the regionof Lower Silesia, under Kammler’s management, work was underway that seemed tobe related to antigravity. It involved using large amounts of electricityfeeding into a below-ground chamber with two contra-rotating cylinders filledwith mercury (said to produce terrible side effects on humans). Sixty-twoscientists working on the program were allegedly shot by the S.S. just beforethe German surrender. It has even been suggested that the Bell experiments werepossible efforts into time travel. Farrell’s research goes further still. In his judgement, the Bell was:> . . . a gateway technology, a hyper-dimensional torsion-based technology that> the Nazis had developed to investigate its potential applications in three> areas:> 1) As a means to tap into the zero-point energy, or, to phrase it differently,> the energy of the physical medium of space-time itself;> 2) As a means to manipulate gravity itself, i.e. as an advanced prototypical> field propulsion technology; and,> 3) As a means to the ultimate, potentially planet-busting, weapons. The conceptual key to the Bell, as both he and Cook noted, was themanipulation of rotating magnetic fields via the two contra-rotatingmercury-filled cylinders.[157] [index_split_006.html#filepos1251396] It is unclear how much of “The Legend” (as the story of Nazi UFOs hassometimes been called) is true, and how much fantasy. The existence of the Bell,for instance, relies on a small handful of witnesses who claimed knowledge of itafter the war. None of the stories have benefitted from solid documentation, andsome of them, such as the Prague flying saucer, seem outlandish. One wonders howa pilot would have managed a feat of flying in a completely new type of airframeat three times the speed of the world’s best fighter aircraft at the time. Buteven these speeds pale in comparison with the speeds said to have been attainedby the fabled Haunebu craft, a literally unbelievable 17,000 kph (over 10,000mph). The technology enabling this fantastic performance was described as:> . . . a revolutionary electro-magnetic-gravitic engine which improved Hans> Coler’s free energy machine into an energy Konverter coupled to a Van De Graaf> band generator and Marconi vortex dynamo (a spherical tank of mercury) to> create powerful rotating electromagnetic fields that affected gravity and> reduced mass.[158] [index_split_006.html#filepos1251666] Some descriptions of Nazi manufacture of these discs are quite specific.Their only problem is they lack evidence. Sources are not cited; photographs areeither indistinct or look Photoshopped. Moreover, claims of such speeds lack anysemblance of credibility. Two problems that immediately come to mind are heatshielding and human survivability (let alone control over such a craft). In thecontext of the 1940s, these would be insurmountable. What we appear to be leftwith are claims of individuals, some of which may have had validity, some not,but which nearly all lack supporting documentation. Still, Farrell’s work bears close scrutiny, as he makes a strong case that,at the very least, the fundamentals of the Nazi’s fringe research continued onafter the war, especially in Argentina but perhaps elsewhere, with substantialcooperation from within the U.S. First, the massive Nazi intelligence group ledby Reinhard Gehlen was brought into the Anglo-American fold organizationallyintact and run essentially by the same people after the war as during it—andwith a great amount of independence. Secondly, not only did the importation ofso many Nazis into the CIA via Project Paperclip fundamentally undermine thenature and purpose of that organization, but many Paperclip Nazis who wentelsewhere (such as into the U.S. rocket program in the Southwest) also exhibiteda striking level of independence from U.S. military authority. These Nazis,Farrell suggested, were a “classic Trojan Horse operation.” Thirdly, theseU.S.-based Nazis were in all likelihood collaborating with Nazis elsewhere inthe world, most importantly Argentina but probably other places, too. “‘OurNazis,” he wrote, “may not really have been ‘ours’ after all.”[159][index_split_006.html#filepos1252276]Argentina under Juan Peron provided themwith a secure home and infrastructure, in return for Nazi gold and whateverother ample financial resources they brought with them.[160][index_split_006.html#filepos1252538] To his great credit, Farrell went further still and analyzed declassifiedU.S. military documents, especially the “Schulgen Intelligence Collection” memoof October 1947, which clearly showed a belief that the flying saucer phenomenonnot only may have been derived from Nazi technology, but that a rogue Nazi groupmay well have existed at the time and had to be dealt with. Not only this, buthe demonstrated that a forged version of this document, which almost certainlywas crafted by UFO researcher Bill Moore in the 1980s, was designed to takeattention away from the Nazi connection in favor of an ET connection that neverexisted in the original memo.[161] [index_split_006.html#filepos1252800] If I have a quibble with this analysis, it is that Schulgen’s conclusionsshould not in any way be taken as definitive for the U.S. national securitycommunity as a whole. In the first place, during the 1940s and 1950s, opinionsvaried widely within that community regarding the flying saucers. Some includedspeculations along the lines of Schulgen, others were explicitly alongextraterrestrial lines. Secondly (and as Farrell also showed), Schulgen wasessentially guided into his position by a previous memo from Air Force GeneralNathan Twining, who may well have had good reason for steering the lower-rankedSchulgen into the direction he did. Few of the critical details can be known for sure. Clearly, if the saucerswere being manufactured by a rogue post-war Nazi group that was beyond the reachof the American military machine, this would have been explosive news for theAmerican and world public. Especially if it were learned that thousands of hardcore and unrepentant Nazis were working illegally in highly sensitive scientificand intelligence positions throughout the U.S. On the other hand, a truly alien(e.g. extraterrestrial or similar) answer to the flying saucer phenomenon wouldhave required just as much secrecy and disinformation. Still, there is cause for believing that some Nazi technology during the warwas of a genuine proto-UFO nature. There is even good reason to consider that,somewhere, someone was trying to build genuine flying saucers in the immediateaftermath of the war. But it must be emphasized that the evidence for this isslender, and based on a surprisingly small number of claims. Nor has it everbeen answered satisfactorily where they were based, who built them, what theirmissions were, or what relation (if any) they had with pre-war sightings ofapparent UFOs. And again, most important is the lack of any historicaldocumentation leading us to a firm conclusion. One scenario that has often been raised is that the Nazis set up a base inAntarctica (Neu-Schwabenland) which became a major problem after the war’s end,as it contained all their advanced science and weaponry. This in turn underliesthe claim that the American expedition known as Operation Highjump, which tookplace in late 1946 and early 1947, was in reality a failed military expeditionagainst the secret Nazi base. Highjump was indeed a large expedition, including13 ships and nearly 5,000 men, and as recent scholarship has shown, “it wasdesigned to train the U.S. Navy for a possible war with the Soviet Union in theArctic, and not to attack an alleged German base in Antarctica.”[162][index_split_006.html#filepos1253100] The Operation did end earlier than scheduled, and there were also deaths, butall of the problems appear explainable by bad weather, which became quiteserious by February 1947. The Commander of Highjump, Admiral Richard Byrd, gavea statement to the March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper, El Mercurio.This is sometimes used to indicate that Byrd was hinting at the reality ofdangerous, revolutionary, technology in Antarctica. In fact, his statement doesnot appear to do this. The article, in part, reads as follows:> Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt> measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country> by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he> was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new> war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both> poles. This statement was made as part of a recapitulation of his own polar> experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking> about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important> result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they> have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed> with which the world is shrinking—recalled the admiral—is one of the most> important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to> warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge> in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and> the poles were a guarantee of safety.[163]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1253567] Unless one decides to speculate that Byrd was speaking in code, there is nojustification for interpreting his statement any other way than how it wasreported, barring new facts or developments. Moreover, if Highjump ended indisaster, why then were subsequent, smaller expeditions sent to the same regionlater in 1947 and 1948? Such was Operation Windmill, described as an explorationand training mission in 1947-1948. In addition, the private explorer Finn Roneorganized an expedition to the same area at this time. In other words, the ideaof a Nazi base in Antarctica has no foundation, only speculation. So the Nazi-UFO connection, just like the ET-UFO connection, offers its ownfrustrations and dead-ends. And yet, we can at least acknowledge the genuinepossibility that there was a connection, and that the Americans, British,Russians, and others were very interested in such Nazi technology. As Cook,Farrell and others have pointed out, it has always been suspected that HansKammler, who disappeared at the end of the war, went to work for the Americans. Moreover, there can be no question that a clandestine “flying saucer” programwould have been desirable within the U.S. and possibly elsewhere in theimmediate post-war era. This would presumably include science related not onlyto acquired technology—whether from Nazis or extraterrestrials—but also to thepioneering research of people like Nikola Tesla and Townsend Brown (bothdiscussed in Chapter Eleven). The question is not was there a terrestrial effort to build flying saucers.Rather, whether or not this scientific work comprised the sum total of what wecall the UFO phenomenon. That is, are UFOs a completely man-made phenomenon, andis the alien connection merely disinformation and a distraction? For thoseresearchers who believe this, the reasoning is (a) that aliens from anotherplanet, arriving in “flying saucers” that look like human designs from the1940s, is implausible; (b) human science and technology is more than sufficientto explain the operation of UFOs, as long as we include hidden, suppressedtechnologies; and (c) the “alien” connection is pure disinformation designed toconfuse the public from the reality of a fully terrestrial breakawaycivilization that has no intention of sharing its technology with themasses.[164] [index_split_006.html#filepos1253880] As I have been suggesting, and will continue to argue in this book, there isa certain logic to the position, but only if a substantial body of otherevidence is ignored. Moreover, there is more evidence that the core UFOphenomenon derives from others not from our civilization. The Requirements of Secrecy Let us return to 1947, to President Harry Truman, facing the shattering newsthat other beings of some sort were here. Moreover, that the U.S. military hadrecovered some of their technology, and even bodies. We may assume that thiswould require the creation of black budgets. After all, it would be necessary tofund these programs, and it would not exactly be the wisest idea to informCongress about it, considering that so little would be known about these beings,considering the desire to keep such technology away from enemies real orperceived, and for so many other reasons already discussed. Thus, layer uponlayer of secrecy would need to be established to hide these UFO-extraterrestrialtechnology programs. As we know has become the norm within the black budgetworld, such a program would be nested within other classified programs,providing deep layers of protection from outside observation. Such a program of secret study would also require ongoing influence and evencontrol over mainstream radio, newspapers, and television. This does not meanthat the CIA would control every piece of information coming through the media.It might mean, however, that there would be key, strategically placed,individuals who would influence stories as they came out. In other words, spincontrol: promoting certain types of stories and killing others. Over the years,there have been a number of exposés detailing the relationship between the CIAand the news media. One was from 1977 by journalist Carl Bernstein, of Watergatefame. Bernstein concluded that since the end of the Second World War, the CIAhad recruited more than four hundred U.S. journalists and placed them secretlyon its payroll.[165] [index_split_006.html#filepos1254479] Any private citizenmight well ask what he or she could accomplish with four hundred journalists,many in highly influential positions, as secret employees? Certainly there wouldbe a great ability to influence the news, and therefore influence publicopinion. The same situation applies to the academic and scientific communities, aswell as to Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Influencing them is easierthan most people realize. With a few leading professors at the rightinstitutions—Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, Berkeley, University of Chicago—the guarddogs would be in place. A young professor who develops an interest in UFOs wouldthen be smacked down by the leading lights. In fact, this is known to havehappened. Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel fulfilled precisely this role duringthe 1950s and 1960s. Not only was he the leading debunker of UFOs in the worldduring that period of time, but he had a secret relationship with the NationalSecurity Agency. Not even his wife knew about that. In today's world, such relationships are sometimes barely even concealed, asif no one cares. There is a virtual revolving door between thegovernment/intelligence community and the most prestigious elements of theacademic world. The situation is even worse in the world of scientific research,where everything is controlled by funding, and the largest share of funding forthe scientific community comes from the U.S. government. Scientists who strayinto areas not approved by their paymasters quickly find that they lose theirfunding, after which a loss of standing and prestige are a constant threat.These are very big incentives to toe the line. Thus, control moves beyond the classified world to become cultural. The Breakaway Civilization What happens when teams of brilliant scientists, under conditions of totalsecrecy, and utilizing limitless black budget money, are able to study recoveredextraterrestrial technology for many years, and even decades? Consider the Roswell crash. More likely than not, technologies recoveredthere would have been well beyond the understanding of the scientists studyingthem. But, given enough time and effort, we might assume that even if they couldnot replicate what they found, they might have learned new things. Such claimshave been made, and it is reasonable to suppose that new breakthroughs inunderstanding would have been made from such technology. Breakthroughs such assolid-state electronics, fiber optics, high-tensile fibers, lasers, and an arrayof other money-making opportunities for the defense and other industries. Noneof this has been proven, of course, but it is also true that the privateresearch undertaken in deeply classified environments is not easy for outsideresearchers to observe. In fact, it would be be very easy to hide the Roswellconnection in the historical treatment of these and other technologies. Another relevant consideration of such breakthroughs is that they wouldreduce to zero any incentive to reveal the secret to the public. Why give up thegoose that lays golden eggs? But now matters become even more interesting. For what if some of thebreakthroughs were even more significant than defense industry money-makers?What if they included secrets to antigravity, for example? What if they includedan understanding of a new source of energy, something that could make petroleumobsolete? It would seem that these would be breakthroughs of vastly greaterimportance than anything imaginable. In the first place, they would threaten theworld's largest industry, one that is entrenched within most aspects of ourlives. If, hypothetically, such breakthroughs were made during the 1950s or 1960s,it is conceivable, even likely, that those managing the program would make surethat the secrets never see the light of day. Certainly, those scientists engagedin the investigation would need to continue their research to learn everythingthey could about electrogravitics, antigravity, new sources of energy, and anyrelated studies. Science does not progress in a haphazard fashion. It is more like a series ofconnections in which knowledge must progress in a certain way for breakthroughsto be achieved. One does not simply go from the discovery of fire straight torockets leaving Earth's atmosphere. There are necessary steps along the way. Butwhat happens when a necessary link in the chain remains unavailable to the restof the world, known only to a few clandestine scientists? It would mean thatthose scientists have the ability to add more links to the chain, moving fartherand farther away in their knowledge from the rest of the world. Without question, the classified world is far ahead of the rest of us. Someyears ago, I had a conversation with a scientist who had worked for the NationalSecurity Agency during the mid-1960s. I know this man fairly well. He statedthat in around 1965, the NSA had computers running at a clock speed of 650 MHz.Today, that is decidedly slow, but in 1965 it was extraordinary. In the firstplace, computers were virtually absent outside the classified world. Moreover,that clock speed was not reached by the personal computing market until the year2000; that is, thirty-five years later. It is worth adding that in 1965, the NSAwas still virtually unknown to the world. It had only been outed for the firsttime in a book the prior year.[166] [index_split_006.html#filepos1255093] Inother words, during the early 1960s, an agency that nobody knew existed had themost advanced computing capabilities in the world. Returning to our hypothetical UFO technology group, we might ask, how manyyears ahead of us might they be? What new understandings of our world anduniverse might they have that we lack? Would they have the ability to develop afleet of clandestine flying saucers, with the ability to leave Earth's orbit andenter space? Would such capabilities allow them to have interactions orencounters with non-human intelligences? Would they have a significantinfrastructure, perhaps some of it underground? What are the features that constitute a distinct civilization? Admittedly,this is not always easy to quantify, yet we can identify certain key factors.The level of technology would be one. Scientific and cosmologicalunderstanding—that is, how one sees oneself in the grand scheme of things—wouldbe another. By both of these features, the deeply clandestine black budget groupmight be so far ahead of the rest of us, that we might justly consider them tobe a separate civilization, one that has broken away from our own, or abreakaway civilization. Undoubtedly, its members would continue to interact withour own society, since in all likelihood Earth is where the action is. But theirlevel of knowledge, and the technologies at their disposal, would give them aunique and very advanced position in the grand scheme of things. It seems unlikely that such a group would answer to the President of theUnited States. Simply based on the known structure of power in the world today,it seems much more likely that private international finance would exercisedominant control over the group, or somehow be merged with it. The office of theU.S. President, while still important, is no longer the central pivot that itwas just after World War Two. Studies of the black budget world, for instance,have emphasized that at the deepest levels of secrecy, it is not officialDefense Department personnel, but private contractors who usually dominate mostof the Special Access Programs—that is, black budget programs.[167][index_split_006.html#filepos1255384] Why should it be any different regardingthe UFO secret? Paying For It All Funding such a program would be a nightmarish prospect, at least if donethrough formal legal channels. What we call the black budget is usuallyunderstood to be classified appropriations and, within the U.S., part of thenormal budgetary process which must be approved each year by Congress. In otherwords, while it may be secret, it would at least have the veneer of legality.Officially speaking, the U.S. black budget is estimated to be around $50billion.[168] [index_split_006.html#filepos1256252] This is an enormous sum, butkeeping in mind that it is allocated for the entire U.S. defense community, onlya certain portion would be available for an undoubtedly expensive UFO researchand development program. Not nearly enough. One conversation I had with aninsider with some knowledge of such matters is that, if nothing else, thisprogram is expensive.[169] [index_split_006.html#filepos1257030] In this context, it is worth pondering the research of several analysts,notably Catherine Austin Fitts, John Perkins, and Joseph Stiglitz. Fitts wasUnder Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)from 1989-1993; Perkins worked during the 1970s for the internationalengineering consultancy Chas T. Main as an “economic hitman,” and Stiglitz wasChief Economist for the World Bank from 1997-2000. The first conclusion ofimportance reached by these and similar analyists is that internationalfinancial power is irredeemably corrupt and controls entire nations. The nextconclusion, for our purposes at least, is that there is a great deal of moneyfloating around the world that is free for the taking and requires no openaccounting, at least for those groups in a position to take advantage. Perkins described how he was charged with enticing developing countries toborrow money for poor infrastructure investments which were ultimately designedto cheat them out of trillions of dollars, increase their debt to the West, andmake them dependent in every way. This was pure economic colonization on behalfof powerful corporations and banks that use the United States government astheir tool. Signficantly, Perkins added that behind his formal employment, theU.S. National Security Agency was essentially calling the shots, and was evenbehind hiring him for his job.[170] [index_split_006.html#filepos1257331] Stiglitz described precisely the same process via the operations of the WorldBank via its “four-step plan” for debter nations. Step One involves pressure forthose nations to privatize state industries. Step Two involves capital marketliberalization, meaning that speculative investment money comes—and then goes,draining national reserves and prompting IMF demands for large interest hikes.This destroys property values, industry, and national treasuries. He describesStep Three as “Market-Based Pricing,” meaning higher prices on food, water andcooking gas. That inevitably leads to “Step Three and a Half: The IMF Riot.”Such riots have occurred in Indonesia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and elsewhere, andaccording to Stiglitz is entirely expected by the Bank. This is also whenforeigners pick off remaining assets at firesale prices. Finally, we reach StepFour, which is “free trade,” in which the last barriers to sales are destroyedand domestic markets are barricaded against their own local produce.[171][index_split_006.html#filepos1257620] Other international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization,enforce this financial misrule. The WTO is not part of any government and iswholly an instrument of corporate power. It enforces privatization of naturalresources like water and deems the environmental, health, and food safety lawsof nations to be barriers to trade. Effectively, it gives corporations a vetoover national environmental and labor laws. Fitts’s analysis perfectly rounds out this scenario with special attention onthe black budget. Recognizing that the rule of law does not apply to the globalfinancial elite, she has described how the “real” black budget involves morethan classified appropriations but also includes monies obtained by intelligencegroups by way of narcotics trafficking, predatory lending and numerous otherforms of financial fraud. She concluded that at least 85 percent of the U.S.federal budget is unauditable. Furthermore, that HUD (and probably other federalagencies) served effectively as a cut-out operation for drug trafficking andsecurities fraud. She wrote about the lack of accountability of billions ofdollars in several classic analyses, “What’s Up With the Black Budget?,” “TheMyth of the Rule of Law,” and “Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. & the Aristocracy ofStock Profits.” Fitts also argues that the housing bubble collapse and financialcrisis make sense when viewed through the lense of mortgage and securities fraudused to finance the black budget.[172] [index_split_006.html#filepos1258321] Getting to the financial roots of the UFO cover-up may well require theskills of a large team of financial wizards, wending their way through layerupon layer of classified (and largely privatized) programs, nested within eachother like an elaborate Matryoshka doll. Just as ordinary national andinternational policy of most nations has long been hijacked for privatefinancial interests, so too almost certainly for the UFO cover-up. For this is asubject that most assuredly involves a tremendous amount of power, and thereforemoney. What this means is that we have an upside down reality. The things that arereal are the things that are denied to us. The things that we see in ourentertainment-dominated mass media are the most illusory. This is no accident.Given the long-term relationship between the intelligence community andmainstream media, it is most reasonable to assume that the public is beingsubjected to a pacification program, one in which people are explicitly beingdistracted and brainwashed for the purpose of getting them to sit down and shutup. But not everyone can do this. Not everyone can sit quietly, passively,unwilling to ask the difficult questions. It is up to those people who careenough to become truth warriors. To fight for the truth, however, it isnecessary first to realize that the deception exists. Next, in order to discernthe truth amid a tissue of lies, perseverance is necessary. This is not alwayseasy to cultivate, for Truth does not simply appear in all her shining glory.Like a rare archaeological find, Truth must be excavated. She must be dug out.And, even then, interpreting Truth can be maddeningly difficult. Finally, onemust learn to speak out on behalf of Truth. In so doing, we find ourselves atodds with a formidable structure of power. Becoming a truth warrior requiresintelligence, perseverance, and courage. It means remembering that the nail thatsticks out is the one that gets hammered. Still, upon reflection, in the context of something as brief and ephemeral asa human life, what can be more rewarding, what more worthy, than an unswervingdedication to the fight for Truth? Chapter 6High Strangeness—UFOs from 1970 to 1990 As 1970 began, the Condon Committee of the University of Colorado had justdebunked UFOs to the scientific community, and the U.S. Air Force had closeddown Project Blue Book, its long-standing office which accepted and investigatedUFO reports from the public. UFOs had become passé. The world had been there,done that. The operators of these unidentified craft never seem to get the message. Fornot only have UFOs failed to go away, but since 1970 they have become morenumerous than ever. In the 21st century, thousands upon thousands of reports arefiled every year at various online repositories. But even during the 1970s and1980s, before the Age of the Web, UFO reports rose steadily in the UnitedStates. More importantly, they spiked elsewhere in the world. UFOs had alwaysbeen noticed worldwide, of course, but now reporting and communication systemswere improving enough that they could be recorded more readily. The Delphos UFO of 1971 One of the most memorable UFO events of the early 1970s occurred in the smalltown of Delphos, Kansas. On the evening of November 2, 1971, sixteen-year-old Ronald Johnson wastending sheep on the family farm when he and his dog saw an object hovering twofeet off the ground about twenty five yards away, among some trees. According toRonald, it was shaped like a mushroom, covered with multi-colored lights,roughly nine feet in diameter and ten feet tall, and made a sound like avibrating washing machine. Suddenly, it became bright at the base. Then it tookoff at an angle, temporarily blinding him. Although his dog was extremely quietduring the sighting, the sheep had been bleating nervously. After his eyes adjusted, Ronald went into the house and told his parents.Once outside, they also saw the object, easily visible in the sky before itvanished toward the south. The three approached the site where the object had been seen. They found aglowing ring on the ground, about eight feet in diameter, and some sort ofglowing material on nearby trees. One tree had been crushed; presumably theobject had landed on it. They also noticed the broken limb of a live tree; thisseemed to have been caused by the object as it descended. The limb snappedeasily, as if it had been dead for some time, yet it was green under the bark,and the upper area still had green leaves on it. When Mrs. Johnson touched theglowing area on the ground, her fingers went numb. When she wiped the substanceonto her leg, she became numb there as well. For two weeks, her fingers remainedslightly numb, although she never saw a doctor about it. Meanwhile, Ronald'seyes became red and irritated for some time after the event, and he alsosuffered from nightmares. Police investigated and found a corroborating witness to the event. A fewmiles away, someone else had reported “a bright light descending in the sky inthe Delphos area” just at the time of the Johnson sighting. The ring was visible for a month afterwards, and was examined by UFOinvestigator Ted Phillips. He found the soil beneath the ring to be dry to adepth of at least twelve inches, whereas the soil outside the ring was wet anddark. Samples were brought to a laboratory, which determined that the soilwithin the ring was resistant to water. It also contained more calcium and moresoluble salts, and was also more acidic, than soil from outside the ring. Inaddition, the soil from inside the ring contained an unidentified hydrocarbonand an organic material composed of white, crystal-like fibers. Researcher Jacques Vallée discussed the findings of a French biologist, whoasked to remain anonymous, but who identified the white fibers as a fungus-likeorganism of the order Actinomycetales. This organism apparently can cause acircular pattern to form on the ground. In addition, the biologist stated thatthe fungus is often found growing with another fungus of the orderBasidiomycetes, which may fluoresce under some conditions. [images/00041.jpg]The Delphos ring after 10 minutes, 16 hours, and 3 1/2 years (top to bottom). Accordingly, some analysts have labeled the case as solved. However, thisdoes not explain the witness accounts of the UFO. One may also ask, even if thering was not related to the UFO sighting, how did the fluorescent material getonto the surrounding trees? How did the branches break? What crushed the deadtree? Police told Phillips that the Johnsons were well-respected, and that theydid not believe it possible that the family had perpetrated a hoax. There thecase remains, still a puzzle after so many years.[173][index_split_006.html#filepos1259305] The Wave of 1973: Two Interesting Cases Despite several interesting reports, there was no identifiable “wave” of UFOsightings until the latter part of 1973. During October, particularly in thesoutheastern United States, there were a number of startling and disturbingencounters, by ordinary people, with the extraordinary. Probably the best known of these is the so-called Pascagoula Incident, whichtook place on October 11, 1973. This involved two men, Charles Hickson, in hisforties, and Calvin Parker, age nineteen, who were fishing in Mississippi’sPascagoula River when they heard a buzzing noise behind them. They turned andwere terrified to see a glowing egg-shaped object with blue lights in front,hovering just above the ground. It was not especially large, roughly ten feetwide and eight feet high—in other words, of a very similar size to the objectseen two years earlier at Delphos, Kansas. The men watched in terror as a doorappeared in the object and three strange beings came out of it, floating overthe river towards them. They were extremely odd-looking. They were the size of a short human adult,perhaps five feet tall, and they had arms and legs, but there the similaritiesended. These beings had no necks, but instead had bullet-shaped heads comingstraight from the shoulders. There seemed to be no eyes, and mere slits servedas mouths. Instead of normal looking noses and ears, they had thin, conicalprojections, described “like carrots from a snowman's head.” Their skin was greyand wrinkled. Instead of human-looking hands, they had claws of some sort.Frankly, a body plan that makes no sense to us. Two of the beings seized Hickson; the third one grabbed Parker, who thenfainted. According to Hickson, his body went numb and he was floated into abrightly-lit room inside the craft. He received a medical examination with afloating eyelike device. The beings then left Hickson, still floating andparalyzed, apparently to examine Parker. Fifteen or twenty minutes later, he wasfloated back outside and released. Parker was weeping and praying on the ground.The object then rose straight up and shot out of sight. How does one tell people a story like that? Not surprisingly, the two meninitially decided to keep quiet. But they soon changed their minds and spoke tothe local sheriff, who interviewed them carefully, then left them alone in aroom wired for sound. The sheriff assumed that if the men were hoaxing, thiswould be when he found out. It became obvious, however, that the men were veryserious. The case soon received a great deal of attention and was investigatedby a number of researchers. Both men passed polygraph tests, and Hicksonunderwent hypnotic regression which had to be terminated when he became tooupset. The two men consistently impressed people with their account and demeanor.Scientist J. Allen Hynek, giving an opinion shared by many, said: “There wasdefinitely something here that was not terrestrial.”[174][index_split_006.html#filepos1259952] Another interesting case from that period occurred the following week nearthe town of Mansfield, Ohio, involving a U.S. Army Reserve helicopter crewcommanded by Captain Lawrence Coyne. On October 18, 1973, just after 11 p.m.,the helicopter was at an altitude of 2,500 feet with good visibility, when thecrew noticed a red light abruptly change course and move directly toward them.Captain Coyne put the helicopter into an emergency descent at the rapid speed of2,000 feet per minute. At the same time, he noticed that all radio frequencieswent dead. When the helicopter was an altitude of 1,700 feet, the objectstreaked in front of the crew and remained directly in front of them for tenseconds. All four crew members said it looked like a gray cigar with a smalldome on top. The red light was still there, but now there was a white light onthe side and a green one on the bottom. The bottom light swung around like asearchlight and bathed the entire cabin in green light. The object thenaccelerated to the west, made a sharp turn, and was lost above Lake Erie. Just as astonishing, when Coyne next checked his altimeter, he saw that hischopper was rapidly climbing, and was already past the altitude of 3,500 feet.There was no reason his helicopter should have been that high. Somehow theobject had pulled them up. It took Coyne several minutes to regain control ofthe helicopter. Later inspections showed no mechanical problems. This isconsidered by many researchers to be a very good case, and Coyne later describedit to a United Nations subcommittee in 1978.[175][index_split_006.html#filepos1260590] High Strangeness in Spain Spain was another area of interesting UFO activity during the early 1970s.Something very unusual was going on there during the spring of 1974. Severaldozen reports made it to local police and newspapers, a number of which includeddescriptions of apparently alien figures. For some reason, they were collectedby the U.S. Defense Attaché and were later released to the public through theFreedom of Information Act. Very interesting, very odd. Unfortunately, only thesummaries are available, but they are suggestive enough.[176][index_split_006.html#filepos1261226] One, from March 23, concerned a sighting near the Gulf of Cádiz. A localpolitician and his chauffeur were driving along an empty stretch of road at 3a.m., when they were shocked to see what was described as a “luminous, metallike” object. The two men felt a strange sensation as the car came to a nearstop. The object soon took off. A few nights later, about 100 miles west of Madrid, a truck driver claimed tosee “three silver ships on the highway” with intensely bright lights. He saidthat figures approached him, and he ran. When they followed, he threw himselfonto the road. They came to within six feet of him. They were allegedly verytall, roughly six-and-a-half feet, but the man could not see their faces. Theyreturned to their ships and left. A police investigation the next day found ahole in the ground which the driver said he had not made. Another report described a “round intense torchlike light” which in the wordsof the report, “rose out of the water near a huge rock, traveled at lowaltitude, then fell into the water again. This happened twice.” And so it went for the next few months. It is not clear what the U.S. DefenseAttaché thought about these reports. They were merely passed on to Washington,as he put it, “strictly for the information of those parties interested.” Nodoubt, there were some parties that were quite interested in these reports. The Strange Year of 1975 Within North America, UFO sightings increased dramatically in 1975, making itone of the most important years in the history of UFO reports, ranking alongwith 1947, 1952, or any other year. Several important developments becameprominent at this time. One was cattle mutilations. Going back to the 1960s,there had been reported cases of bizarre mutilations of cattle. But starting inlate 1974, the number of these skyrocketed, especially in the American West.Another new development was reports of unmarked, black helicopters. These werefrequently noticed in the same areas where mutilations occurred, and also oftenwhere UFOs were being reported. Perhaps these helicopters were part of a covertmilitary group that monitored the mutilations or UFOs, or had something else todo with all this. Some analysts have argued they have been behind themutilations themselves. Another important development of 1975 was the rise in the number of credibleaccounts of alien abduction. There will be more to say about this in laterchapters, but it is noteworthy that several of these cases occurred in the midstof all the other activity that was going on, that is the American West duringlate summer and fall of 1975. Among these was the famous Travis Walton case,sometimes known by the title of the book and movie based on it: Fire in the Sky. When examining the long history of U.S. military encounters with UFOs, themore you search, the more you find. The U.S. military has engaged UFOsthroughout the post-World War Two period, with good cases from nearly everysingle year. Nevertheless, several years stand out, one of which is 1975.Perhaps it is simply a matter of good fortune to have received confirmation ofmany cases from that year via the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. During thelate 1970s, when FOIA was at its peak effectiveness, many of the most dramaticconfirmed military cases were revealed. That includes the events of October andNovember of 1975. What happened, as far as can be determined, was a systematic incursion ofmilitary bases along both sides of the vast US-Canadian border. Severalcompelling but unconfirmed reports describe such cases throughout the summer,but confirmed cases via official documentation start from late October.[177][index_split_006.html#filepos1261665] Intruder Alert On the evening of October 27, 1975, a low-hovering object invaded theairspace of Loring Air Force Base in northern Maine. This object penetrated theperimeter at an altitude of just 300 feet. Personnel inside the base said it hada white strobe light, and what appeared to be a red navigation light. It circledinside the base and came to within 300 yards of the nuclear weapons area. Bythat time, it was only 150 feet above the ground. For about an hour, while theobject was being observed, the base was on high alert status. All attempts toidentify the object failed. It then left and went north toward Canada. Twenty-four hours later, the scene was repeated. Security personnel saw anobject approaching from the north at an altitude of 3,000 feet. It had flashingwhite lights and a solid amber light. Even though it was under constant radarand visual observation, it somehow disappeared several times. On the previousnight, the base commander had been denied air support; this time he receivedpermission for a National Guard helicopter to be dispatched. Before thehelicopter arrived, however, this object did something rather impressive. It hadbeen keeping a distance of at least three miles from the base all the while;now, somehow, it penetrated the base perimeter and appeared over the end of therunway, not more than 150 feet off the ground. Personnel nearby described it asred and orange, and resembling a stretched out football. The object hovered inmid-air, then turned out its lights and seemingly disappeared. Its lights wenton and off several times. When, on one occasion, the lights turned back on, theobject had gotten very close to the weapons storage area. By now, it was 1 a.m.,which means the encounter had been going on for more than five hours. There is arecord stating that the National Guard helicopter unsuccessfully attempted tocontact and identify the object at this time. Then, for another two hours, theobject remained inside or very close to the base, as it was seen over theweapons storage area once again at 3 a.m., completely unlit but visible toground personnel. Consider how ominous and provocative this action was. When thehelicopter again arrived to investigate, its crew members could not see theobject, even though the frustrated ground personnel plainly saw both objects.Shortly after, the unknown craft flew off. It had been inside the base for sevenhours. Those who insist upon conventional explanations to this event might considerthe possibility of the intruder being a helicopter. Indeed, one of thedeclassified documents refers to the unknown object as a helicopter. The problemis that no one heard any sounds from the object, despite its low altitude.Moreover, several times, personnel could see its shape, yet none described it asa helicopter. As with the other incursions of this period, the identity of thisintruder has never been confirmed. In fact, in all the decades since the event,the military has never even offered a reasonable guess. There were equally baffling incursions over other U.S. bases at this time. OnOctober 30, an unidentified object entered restricted space at Wurtsmith AirForce Base in Michigan. This was a Strategic Air Command (SAC) base off thecoast of Lake Huron. Again, we have an object that acted like a helicopter, butthen again not exactly, and demonstrated interest in the weapons storagefacilities. In this case, a tanker aircraft which was on approach was vectoredin to observe and follow the object, which had just departed, going south downthe lake. An interesting cat and mouse chase ensued, until the object rapidlyaccelerated and was gone. Equally fascinating were the events of November 7 and 8, 1975, at Montana’sMalmstrom Air Force Base. The base contained ICBMs over an area of many squaremiles. At 3 p.m., electronic sensors detected an intrusion at one of the missilesites. A Sabotage Alert Team was ordered to investigate, and when the memberscame to within a mile of the site, they reported by radio that they could see abright, glowing, orange disk as large as a football field. It was simplyhovering there, over the missile site. It was apparently an unsettling sight tobehold, because when they were ordered to proceed to the site, the men refusedto go any further. The object soon began to rise, whereupon it was registered onNORAD radar. F-106 interceptors were scrambled, but the object continued to riseto the incredible altitude of 200,000 feet. This is more than double the ceilingof the ultra-high flying U-2 spy plane, and the intercepting jets never saw theobject. Upon inspection, a missile at the site showed indications that itscomputerized targeting system had been tampered with, and it had to be removed.It would appear that the UFO was responsible. More UFOs were reported the following night at the base. Once again, twoF-106s were scrambled, whereupon ground personnel observed a cat-and-mouse gameduring which the UFOs turned off their lights each time the jets approached.When the jets departed, the objects would turn their lights back on. Clearly,these objects were able to outclass American intercepting jets with ease.[images/00039.jpg]A declassified memo on UFOs over Malmstrom AFB in November, 1975. These were only the best known events. There were several others thatfollowed them. For instance, there is an interesting report of two UFOs overCannon Air Force Base in New Mexico, on January 21, 1976. A report by securitypolice stated they were “25 yards in diameter, gold or silver in color with [a]blue light on top, hole in the middle and red light on bottom.” This is a veryspecific observation. Records also exist of UFO incursions at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida onJanuary 31, 1976, and over Fort Ritchie in Maryland, on July 30 of that year. Inthe latter case, it was reported that the object hovered over the ammunitionstorage area at low altitude, just as had happened at Loring and Wurtsmith AirForce Bases the previous year. In lieu of obtaining a public confirmation from the U.S. government,something we have not gotten, all we have are these declassified reports. Theytell us nothing of substance regarding the motivations of whomever or whateverwas responsible for these UFOs. Common sense would indicate that they wereobserving various North American weapons facilities, possibly even tamperingwith them. In other words, there appears to have been some kind ofconfrontational relationship between these objects and the U.S. military.[178][index_split_006.html#filepos1262391] A Sphere over the Canaries UFOs were never restricted to the United States. In every decade, they havebeen reported worldwide. Some of the events reported from around the worldduring the 1970s were truly amazing. One spectacular case occurred in the Canary Islands on the night of June 22,1976. Witnesses from several locations saw what can only be described as atransparent, spherical craft containing two very tall human-like figures. Onewitness, a medical doctor, described the object to be the size of a three-storybuilding, and perfectly round. It was transparent enough that he could see starsthrough it, and two human-like figures inside. Witnesses elsewhere on the island gave comparable, or even identical,descriptions. Astronomers at a nearby observatory saw it with their unaidedeyes, as it was below the line of sight of their telescopes. One astronomerstated that, whatever this was, it was definitely not a planet. Nor did he haveany scientific explanation for it. The object was also seen by the crew of theSpanish naval vessel, Atrevida, which was several miles offshore. James Oberg, writing for Omni, was skeptical this event was anything frombeyond. He suggested that witnesses had probably seen the launch of Poseidonballistic missiles by the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy did indeed launch thosemissiles somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean at that time. However, the exactlocation of the launch is not known, and considering the vastness of the ocean,this explanation is a stretch. Even on the chance the launch had been visible tothe Canaries, it is hard to imagine how witnesses could have described it asthey did.[179] [index_split_006.html#filepos1262777] Incident over Tehran More fascinating still was a case that occurred a few months later, one ofthe most astonishing in the history of UFOs. This was the incident over Tehran,on the night of September 18, 1976, and has been described many times over theyears. We are fortunate to have a four-page U.S. Defense Intelligence Agencyreport describing it in detail. In addition, both of the pilots involveddiscussed the event years later. That evening, residents of the city noticed an unusually brilliant object inthe sky. After enough phone calls to the local airport, the traffic controllerdecided to look. He saw exactly what had been reported to him: an intenselybright object that was not supposed to be there. He contacted the Iranian AirForce, which dispatched two F-4 fighter jets, one after the other. Iran, at thistime, was still under the rule of the Shah, and was a close ally of the UnitedStates. An unknown intrusion like this was of interest not only to the Iraniangovernment, but also to the U.S. government. Indeed, a report of what happenedwas sent to the top national security officials in the U.S.: President Gerald R.Ford, CIA Director George Bush, and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger,among others. A rather impressive distribution list. Each of the F-4 interceptor pilots saw the object visually and tracked itwith their airborne radar. In both cases, critical electronics andinstrumentation went offline at a distance of twenty-five nautical miles fromthe object. In one case, the pilot was about to fire a missile when his controlsceased to work. In the case of the second pilot, an excerpt from the report isworth noting:> . . . as the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all> instrumentation and communications. . . . When the F-4 turned away from the> object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all> instrumentation and communications. . . Another brightly lighted object . . .> came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the> F4. A rather alarming development. The report then went on to describe how thissecond object turned inside the arc of the F-4 itself and then rejoined theoriginal object for a perfect rendezvous. It is worth asking what could do that today, much less almost four decadesago? Officially speaking, nothing. Yet, something clearly did. The Iranian UFOcase is strong because it is a spectacular event on its own merits, but alsobecause it has supporting documentation, proving that UFOs have importantnational security considerations. An exotic object that can disable keyinstrumentation and electronics from top jet fighters is something that needs tobe taken seriously. Indeed, it was. It is simply that national security groupscontinually try to hide that fact from the rest of us.[180][index_split_006.html#filepos1263344] Around the World During the Late 1970s The late 1970s saw many bizarre and disturbing UFO cases. An intriguing eventoccurred over NATO’s Aviano Air Base, near Venice, Italy, on July 1, 1977.During the evening, several U.S. Air Force personnel saw an unknown objecthovering just outside the base perimeter. While the object was there, part ofthe facility lost electrical power. One prosaic explanation attributed the eventto an electrical phenomenon related to geological stresses in the earth.Clearly, this does not square with witness accounts that claim to have seen astructured craft, if one chooses to accept witnesses testimony, of course.[181][index_split_006.html#filepos1263919] Meanwhile, South America, and especially Brazil, was experiencing dramaticsightings that appear to have caused the death of some individuals. Obtainingcertain proof of this has not happened, although Brazilian military officers offthe record told this to investigators, and there is some corroboration that theBrazilian military investigated these events. This was throughout much of thelate 1970s, frequently deep within the Brazilian rain forest.[182][index_split_006.html#filepos1264644] UFO sightings became much more dramatic during 1978. Like 1975, it was a verybig year for UFO reports. Some people have attributed the high number ofsightings to the release of Steven Spielberg’s movie Close Encounters of theThird Kind. It is true that the movie made a major splash into popularconsciousness. But, the UFO events of that year were of great specificity,occurring across every cultural and linguistic barrier. Looking into the detailsof the hundreds of cases from that year, one quickly realizes how ludicrous itis to suggest that all this was caused by Steven Spielberg, and yet some havetried to do this. One key factor of that year is the number of sightings of alien or humanoidtypes of beings associated with UFOs. Nearly five hundred such reports have beencollected from that year.[183] [index_split_006.html#filepos1264973] One of these involves the shooting of an apparent alien being at McGuire AirForce Base in New Jersey, just over the fence from Fort Dix. This is said tohave occurred on January 18, 1978. At around 3 a.m., a Fort Dix militarypoliceman, who had been pursuing a low-flying UFO, saw a small being with alarge head and a slender body appear directly in front of his car. He panickedand shot the being several times with a .45 caliber pistol. The being ran to adeserted runway at McGuire Air Force Base, where it died. Throughout themorning, the shooter was interrogated at McGuire Air Force Base. One of the menwho spoke to him was Air Force Major George Filer, who has spoken about thisevent a number of times, including with the author. Other conservative, veteranresearchers, such as Richard Hall and Leonard Stringfield, also interviewed thisman, finding him completely credible. Filer, who arrived at the base at 4 a.m., about an hour after the shooting,noticed that something important was happening. When he arrived at the commandpost, he learned that UFOs had been flying over the base “all night.” He waseven more surprised when he learned that a military policeman had shot an alien.When he heard the word “alien,” he replied, “you mean foreigner? That kind ofalien?” “No,” came the reply, “an alien from outer space.” According to Filer, aC-141 transport plane from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base arrived to acquirethe body. For a short while, Filer was told that he would brief the basecommander on all this, but at the last moment he received a phone call informinghim there would be no briefing. Proving this case has been a frustrating experience. A document of unknownorigin surfaced which described this event. However, a retired military policeofficer who studied it pronounced it as “probably a forgery.” Seemingly on thatbasis alone, many researchers have shied away from the document and the caseitself, which admittedly describes a rather extreme event. Nevertheless, theevent may well have happened. This is yet another case demonstrating howdifficult it is to obtain undeniable proof of what we are dealing with.[184][index_split_006.html#filepos1265349] Other UFO events of 1978 include the previously discussed crash of an unknownobject in Bolivia on May 6, an event in which U.S. took over the operation, as adeclassified document stated. There was also the tragic case of Frederick Valentich, the young pilot whowas flying across the Bass Strait from Australia to Tasmania, in October, 1978,but never reached his destination. The transcript of his radio conversation withground control is chilling and unforgettable. In terror, Valentich described anobject that continually buzzed over and around his aircraft. It obviouslyinterfered with his radio, and ultimately interfered with the operation of hisengine, causing him to go down into the sea.[185][index_split_006.html#filepos1266111] Just days before, in the northwestern Chinese province of Gansu, severalhundred military personnel were watching an outdoor movie, when they saw anenormous object pass over their heads. It had two searchlights and a glowingtail, and was close to the ground. They saw it for two or three minutes. Many ofthe witnesses were fighter pilots, but none had the slightest idea of what theobject could be. According to a report in the CIA files, “it covered half thesky.” The object has always been, and may forever be, unknown.[186][index_split_006.html#filepos1266597] Then, from November 9 through December 14, at least eight major UFO eventsoccurred over the oilfields of Kuwait. At times, they appeared to have disruptedthe operation of the equipment there. This received attention and generatedreports from the Kuwaiti government, and not surprisingly, received attentionfrom the U.S. Embassy and government.[187] [index_split_006.html#filepos1267033] Perhaps most dramatic of all were two encounters on December 16 by theChilean Air Force with a UFO utterly gargantuan in size. Early that afternoon,two pilots on a training mission, each flying an F-5 fighter aircraft, trackedthe object on their airborne radar. It gave a return equal to ten or moreaircraft carriers—except this object was in the air, not floating on the water.Each pilot assumed his radar equipment was faulty, until he learned that theother pilot was also getting the same return. Not only this, but ground radarfrom a nearby airport also picked up the object and confirmed its huge size. Thepilots also saw the object with their own eyes. One pilot later said that at adistance of twenty miles, it looked “like a plantain banana swathed in smoke.”The pilots were frightened, having no missiles or weapons. As they approachedthe massive object, which had been motionless all this while, it took off at anunimaginable speed. All at once, it vanished from the three radar screens. Some hours later that evening, three more Chilean F-5s were sent to intercepta very large UFO. Whether this was the same object as earlier, or not, is notknown. Two pilots saw it, describing it simply as very large and very bright.Several months later, the Chilean Air Force formally acknowledged the events ofthat day. Not surprisingly, no one could explain what had occurred. After all,what could be said?[188] [index_split_006.html#filepos1267902] Thus, throughout 1978, it surely appears in retrospect that some sort ofconflict, or at least confrontation, was occurring, very secretly, between theworld’s military forces and something far more advanced. Enter the 1980s During the 1980s, researchers sometimes commented on what seemed to be aslowdown in UFO sightings. Perhaps this was so for a few years during the middleof the decade, but UFO statistics are inherently spotty, if for no other reasonthan most people do not report them. This was especially true in thepre-Internet era. Still, there were excellent sightings throughout the decade,many of them quite dramatic. 1980 itself boasted several riveting military encounters with UFOs. We havethe record of a tracking and attempted engagement of a UFO by the Austrian AirForce on May 7, 1980. The object was also seen by several commercial airliners.It was something extraordinary, whatever it was.[189][index_split_006.html#filepos1268378]"},{"pageContent":" Immediately after, on May 9 and May 10, the Peruvian Air Force had twosuccessive encounters with an unknown object hovering just outside the airfield.Both times, the base commander ordered an SU-22 fighter bomber to intercept theobject. This is an excellent aircraft, one of the best in the world at the time.During the first encounter, the pilot fired a missile directly at the object.According to a declassified U.S. Defense report, the missile had no effect onthe object. It apparently departed soon after that. On the second day, an SU-22was again scrambled, but this time with orders not to fire on the object.Clearly, it made no sense to bother with obviously futile weapons, which wereexpensive and might serve only to annoy whatever this was.[190][index_split_006.html#filepos1268796] The Peruvian encounter is an incredible story, and yet it is supported bydeclassified U.S. military documentation. It deserves to be better known than itis. The next case, however, is very well known, deservedly so. This concerns a series of events that took place in an area known as theRendlesham Forest in late December, 1980. The action occurred between twomilitary bases, one of which was RAF Woodbridge, the other RAF Bentwaters. Forthis reason it is often known as the Bentwaters case.[191][index_split_006.html#filepos1269166] It has been over three decades, and researchers are still learning new thingsabout the Bentwaters case. That by itself is a rare thing. The incident receivedno publicity until 1983, when one of the airmen from the base, Larry Warren,alerted the media. Around the same time, researchers obtained a single page memofrom the Deputy Base Commander, Colonel Charles Halt, succinctly (althoughsomewhat inaccurately and incompletely) describing strange unidentified lightsover and around the base. On Christmas night, going into the early morning of December 26, airmen fromthe base investigated what initially appeared to be an aircraft that had gonedown into the nearby woods. What they found instead was a landed or very lowhovering craft. One of the men, Sergeant James Penniston, approached the craftand even touched it. He noticed strange markings or writing on it which he couldnot recognize. His companion, airman John Burroughs, was with him nearby. In theyears that followed, both of these men struggled to regain all of their memoriesfrom that evening. An investigation of the site the next day found high levelsof radiation, distinct impressions on the ground consistent with that of alanded craft, and other signs of evidence. That was not the end of the Bentwaters case. On the night of December 27-28,security personnel saw lights floating in the sky above the forest. Ultimately,Colonel Halt, accompanied by a security team, went out to investigatepersonally. He had a cassette recording device with him, and he gave a runningcommentary throughout the evening. The recording and transcription are availableonline.[192] [index_split_006.html#filepos1271467] The men saw things they couldnot understand. Initially, they noticed an odd, intensely flashing, bright lightin the forest. It is possible they had a close observation of a landed craft,although this has been disputed. They did see strange lights maneuvering inseemingly impossible ways. One of these lights shot down a beam of light whichpenetrated alternating layers of steel, earth, and concrete which housed abunker containing nuclear weapons. (Which have yet officially to be acknowledgedeven to exist). In an off-the-record interview Halt gave some years later toLarry Warren and researcher Peter Robbins, he said that beam “adversely affectedthe ordinance.” According to Warren, there was also a third encounter. This has been disputedby Halt, Burroughs, and Penniston. It was, however, Warren’s account that brokethe story to begin with. Halt has always denied Warren was involved in theevents, while Warren adamantly maintains that he was. Warren stated that he waspart of a large group that went out with bright lights, Geiger counters, andother equipment, and came to within ten or fifteen feet of a landed UFO. Heclaimed that Base Commander, Colonel Gordon Williams, approached the craft andsomehow communicated with the creatures or beings inside it. Warren said hecould tell by their large heads and black eyes that they were not human beings.He claimed to have been subjected to a detailed debriefing during which mindcontrol and memory erasure procedures were implemented. He later amended hisstatement to say the procedures had been done to his fellow airman, AdrianBustinza, but that Bustinza was so traumatized by the event and unwilling totalk, that for years Warren told the world it had happened to him instead,simply to get the story out. This case is fascinating for many reasons. It has a large number of witnessesand a declassified military document supporting it. Unfortunately, there hasbeen confusion surrounding it from the beginning. Yet, the deeper one searchesinto the case, the more there is to find. This was a UFO encounter of greatsignificance. Frustratingly, despite tremendous publicity and support fromhigh-level officials, such as retired former British Admiral of the Fleet, LordHill Norton, the official statement from the British Ministry of Defence—withoutattempting to explain whatever had occurred—has been to brush off the matter asof “no defence significance.” This is a position the MoD has taken to thepresent day: effectively a straightforward, straight-faced denial. There are other fascinating events of that period which have received muchless attention. One occurred near Huffman, Texas, just days after the Bentwatersevents, and is known as the Cash-Landrum case, after the two women involved andthe seven-year-old grandson of one of them. These three received radiation burnsand poisoning from a bright, diamond-shaped object which happened to beaccompanied by a large number of double-rotor Chinook-style helicopters. On thatbasis, one might think that the UFO would appear to have been one of “ours,” butno agency has ever taken responsibility for the event. A lawsuit by Betty Cash,seeking damages for her burns and suffering, went nowhere.[193][index_split_006.html#filepos1271842] Another intriguing case took place less than two weeks after Bentwaters, inthe French region known as Trans-en-Provence, on January 8, 1981. On thisoccasion, a small flying-saucer-type of object landed in a field belonging to afarmer. After it departed, ground impressions and other traces were observed andsubject to detailed laboratory analysis.[194][index_split_006.html#filepos1272692] One of the more interesting photographs ever taken of a UFO dates fromOctober 1981. Hannah McRoberts was vacationing with her family in BritishColumbia, when she decided to take a picture of a mountain. The image shows anabsolutely perfect flying saucer nearby. Oddly—although, as it turns out, notunusually—no one saw it when she took the picture. The negative was subjected todetailed analysis by Dr. Richard Haines of NASA’s Ames Research Center. Hainesalso interviewed the family. There was no evidence of hoaxing. The photo isreal, and quite extraordinary.[195] [index_split_006.html#filepos1273383] [images/00028.jpg]Photo by Hannah McRoberts, October 1981. Object enlarged in inset. The Hudson Valley Sightings During the early 1980s, a number of odd triangular craft were reported inWestern Pennsylvania, mostly to researcher Stan Gordon. In fact, triangles hadbeen reported sporadically in prior decades, particularly since the mid-1970s,but some fascinating cases going back much earlier.[196][index_split_006.html#filepos1273896] What happened in 1983, however, and for several years afterward, was atremendous number of reports of triangular and boomerang-shaped craft in thelower part of New York State, an area known as the Hudson Valley.[197][index_split_006.html#filepos1274333] The sightings extended into Connecticutand northern New Jersey, as well. There are too many to recount here, but themonth of March, 1983, deserves special attention. Whereas witnesses had reportedlarge boomerang-shaped craft in January and February, what occurred on the nightof March 17 went far beyond anything seen previously. On this evening, largenumbers of people observed an extremely large boomerang-shaped object for thirtyminutes. For much of that time, it hovered over Interstate Highway 84, but wasalso seen to make a right angle turn without banking. Motorists pulled over tosee rows of multicolored lights along the sides of the object, as well as abright light in the center. At one point, it bathed the area in very brightlight. Local police stations received many calls; indeed, several policeofficers also reported the object. Even at this early stage during the Hudson Valley flap, lies were spewingforth as a way of explaining (or more accurately containing) it. Policedispatchers, for instance, told frightened callers that they were seeing a typeof experimental vehicle from nearby Stewart Air Force Base, a statement with nobasis in fact. Moreover, to add to the confusion, the Sheriff’s office laterdenied making such a statement. Exactly one week later, on March 24, 1983, more people reported the same typeof craft, behaving just as it had done before. Switchboards were jammed withreports of a large, boomerang-shaped UFO. It seems that there might have beentwo objects flying that night because witnesses fifteen miles apartsimultaneously saw a low-flying object with red, blue, and green lights arrangedin a boomerang pattern. The objects were silent. Astonished motorists pulled offthe side of the Taconic Parkway, simply to gaze in awe. Several witnessesreported bright beams of white light coming from the underside of the craftshining down onto the cars. So it was in the Hudson Valley for the rest of the spring, the rest of theyear, and the next several years. 1984 was the peak year for sightings in that region. Once again, the month ofMarch stands out. On the night of the 25th, off the Taconic Parkway near thetown of Peekskill, drivers stopped their cars, stepped outside, and watched inamazement. Everyone saw the same thing: a slow moving, boomerang-shaped objectwith six intensely bright lights and a green light in the center. The lightsmoved like one object, even when making a sharp turn. The light was so brightthat people had to shield their eyes. At least one witness, a professionalphotographer, discerned a dark structure connecting the lights, which heestimated to be at least three hundred feet long. Police were overwhelmed withcalls that night. It was like this all through the spring. On the night of June 14, atriangular or boomerang-shaped object entered the premises of the Indian PointNuclear Facility. Several plant employees saw it, describing it asfootball-field-sized, with intensely bright lights along its sides. Despite highwinds that night, it moved very smoothly and then departed. That nuclear facility experienced another violation of its airspace on thenight of July 24, 1984. At least a dozen plant workers and security personnelwatched a boomerang pattern of lights approach. The workers could plainly seethat these were not disconnected lights, but a solid body of enormous size. Inthe words of one guard, it was about the size of three football fields. Theenormous object moved toward the sole operational reactor at the plant, and thenhovered directly over it. The guards stood, awestruck. Shortly before the orderwas given to activate National Guard helicopters, the object moved off and wasgone. Guards were initially told to forget about the event, but receivedpermission to speak to investigators shortly afterwards. July 24, 1984, was an active night in the Hudson Valley. Nearby the IndianPoint Nuclear Facility, another witness recorded video of a large object thathas defied explanation ever since. It was studied by the Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena, whose analysts agreed the video was authentic, and thatno one could explain the object. Sightings like these continued in the Hudson Valley well into the 1980s. Tothis day, there has never been an adequate explanation of what these objectswere. Occasionally, one hears attempts to explain them as illegal aviatorsflying ultralight aircraft in incredibly tight formation. While this is known tohave happened on at least one occasion, this in no way explains the puzzlingsightings of that period. In fact, it appears that those aviators flew with theexpress intention of causing confusion and providing a pretext to explain it allaway. In the first place, they were never caught or arrested. Yet, they wereexpected to have been flying in such illegal and impossible formations for fiveyears or more with impunity. Such an explanation has no merit. Ultimately, however, what could the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) orany other federal agency have said about these sightings? Any credence given tothe reality of the situation could easily have caused panic. More seriouslystill, it could well have prompted a public investigation that would have leddirectly to the core of the UFO reality. Around the World and in Space The 1980s provided several good examples of UFOs recorded in space. RonaldRegehr, a former employee of the aerospace firm, Aerojet, accidentally, butlegally, came into possession of an important database of the Defense SatelliteProgram, or DSP. This is a satellite made by Aerojet for military espionagepurposes. The database was a list of objects known as fastwalkers, which weretracked by the DSP satellites. Fastwalkers, of course, is a term for space-basedUFOs. The DSP database listed 283 fastwalkers recorded from the years 1973 to1991, an average of more than one per month.[198][index_split_006.html#filepos1274753] One of the most amazing of these occurred on May 5, 1984. A UFO enteredEarth’s atmosphere from deep space, slowed down, turned, and returned to deepspace. The observation lasted for nine minutes, and the object came to within amere three kilometers of the satellite. A detailed investigation failed toexplain what caused the sensor reading, other than a real object of some type.In fact, another deep space platform detected the same object optically,operated by a group that collaborated with Regehr’s. During the period of the Hudson Valley flap, there was another valley,elsewhere in the world, that also experienced recurring and baffling UFOsightings. But unlike the Hudson Valley, a densely populated suburb of New YorkCity, this region—Norway’s Hessdalen Valley—was remote and sparsely populated.The sightings began in 1982 and increased greatly in 1984. In fact, theHessdalen sightings have continued sporadically to the present day. What makesthem particularly interesting is that they had been subject to detailed trackingand recording by teams of dedicated scientists, braving the subzero temperaturesfor months at a time. The Hessdalen phenomenon has defied any simpleexplanation. It encompasses not simply mechanical craft, although some of thesightings appear consistent with that conclusion. Other sightings, however,appear to be the result of intelligent light phenomena. There have beentrackings on radar and with other electronic means. The entire valley, roughlyten miles long, today has a population of 150 people; it was less during the1980s. Loud noises can be heard for miles around. Something, however, has causedan unusual number of people to report these baffling phenomena in the area.[199][index_split_006.html#filepos1275082] Throughout the 1980s, every region in the world at some point was the sceneof an extraordinary encounter. One of these occurred in Brazil on May 19, 1986,in which an enormous portion of Brazilian airspace was the scene of UFOactivity, including the scrambling of a large number of Brazilian jets to dealwith the matter. This elicited a statement by the Brazilian military andgovernment expressing its utter bafflement at what had just happened. In thewords of the Brazilian Minister of Aeronautics, Brigadier General Otávio MoreiraLima:> . . . at least 20 objects were detected by Brazilian radars. They saturated> the radars and interrupted traffic in the area. Each time that radar detected> unidentified objects, fighters took off for intercept. Radar detects only> solid metallic bodies and heavy (mass) clouds. There were no clouds nor> conventional aircraft in the region. The sky was clear. Radar doesn’t have> optical illusions.

It’s very remote and it’s not the case here in Brazil. It’s> fantastic. The signals on the radar were quite clear.[200]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1275822] Another took place over Alaska on November 18, 1986. This involved acommercial flight that was transporting expensive French wine from Japan to theU.S. For nearly thirty minutes, while flying over the Alaskan arctic, the crewtracked on radar, and saw with their own eyes, an enormous, gargantuan-sizedobject. Meanwhile, ground-based radar also recorded the event. At one point, ina manner similar to the Iranian case of 1976, the large object detached twosmaller objects that remained directly in front of the airplane’s cockpit. Theseobjects maneuvered and danced about before returning to the mother craft. There was great pressure to keep this case out of the public eye, and then,once it became well-known, to disable it as something pedestrian. The pilot,Captain Kenju Terauchi, an ex-fighter pilot with more than 10,000 hours flightexperience, reported the encounter and was promptly assigned to a desk job forseveral years. Philip J. Klass, on behalf of the Committee for the ScientificInvestigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), initially stated the UFOswere the planets Jupiter and Mars, despite the object being in a part of the skyopposite the position of these planets; despite, the two smaller objects havingmoved from positions one above the other to side by side. CSICOP later issued asecond explanation that the UFO was light reflecting off of clouds of icecrystals, even though the sky was clear at the reported altitude of the UFO.These explanations, bogus though they were, received positive mainstreamcoverage. The FAA had no explanation for the visual sighting, but attributed theground-based radar images to a “split radar return from the JAL Boeing 747.” FAAofficial John Callahan later described how the CIA and other intelligence groupssought to confiscate all information pertaining to the case and to silencerelevant personnel.[201] [index_split_006.html#filepos1276859] U.S. defense records reported an interesting UFO sighting by the Ghana AirForce on July 27, 1987. This involved a large, silent object over southeasternGhana and the Gulf of Guinea, shortly before midnight. Some people recorded thesound of explosions that seemed to be connected to the sighting, making uswonder if this was a military encounter. According to the U.S. Defense memo, aGhana Air Force pilot was not flying, but standing on the ground near the cityof Accra, when he saw the object. It was two or three times larger than a Boeing747, he said, and shaped like a missile. The object dropped altitude, thengained altitude, then was replaced by small bluish lights arranged in a circularformation.[202] [index_split_006.html#filepos1278470] Gulf Breeze As the 1980s came to a close, sightings increased in many parts of the world.A few areas seemed to be hot spots, and the most prominent of these was near thetown of Gulf Breeze, Florida, where sightings seemed to begin in November, 1987.A great deal has been written and said about Gulf Breeze, both pro and con. Mostof the negative conclusions were directed at the town’s most prominent witness,Ed Walters. Several times, Walters was accused of hoaxing his astonishinglyvivid photographs, pictures which gained worldwide attention. [images/00062.jpg]One of Ed Walters’ photos from November 1987. However, Walters was by no means the only witness of UFOs at Gulf Breeze.These numbered in the hundreds. Second, an apparent model of the UFO he hadphotographed was found in the attic of his former home. This was used todiscredit him on the grounds that it supposedly proved that he was busy makingUFO models as part of his hoaxing campaign. In fact, a study of the model provedthe opposite. The model was constructed with Walters’ own discardedarchitectural plans. Crucially, these plans were dated after the time he movedout of that house. It is this date that proves the case. In other words, someonewent trash-picking in front of Walters’ new residence and acquired some of hisdiscarded architectural papers. Then, they created a UFO model out of thesepapers, and then planted the model in the attic of his former home. There iscertainly no reason in the world why Walters would do such a thing. At the time,he was regularly complaining of people fishing through his garbage. Clearly,someone or some group attempted to discredit him and gave the story immediatepublicity.[203] [index_split_006.html#filepos1278760] [images/00004.jpg]The so-called Gulf Breeze model. An analysis of the paper used to make it provesbeyond a reasonable doubt that it was created solely to discredit Ed Walters. That Ed Walters was a repeater seemed to cause a great deal of skepticismamong many people. In other words, he had multiple encounters with theseobjects, and claimed to experience telepathic communication with the entitiesinvolved. For many researchers, this was simply too much to believe. Adding tothe skepticism in some quarters was that Walters eventually published a bookabout his experiences, which sold rather well. But when one analyzes the specific sightings, not merely those of Ed Waltersbut of the many other witnesses, the Gulf Breeze phenomenon becomes verycompelling. The entire area is replete with military bases. It has often beenspeculated that that some of the UFOs people witnessed were military craft.Perhaps this is so, although that would need to account for the many cases ofhigh strangeness. What remains evident, however, is that something very advancedand unusual was traversing the skies over Gulf Breeze, Florida.[204][index_split_006.html#filepos1279121] Area 51 While Gulf Breeze was heating up, so to speak, there was another region whereunusual craft were being seen on a regular basis. This was Groom Dry Lake inNevada, better known as Area 51, as well as the nearby Antelope Valley in theCalifornia desert. The entire region contained, and still contains, high-endmilitary research and development projects. Based on the many sightings (to saynothing of the insider leaks discussed previously), it seems obvious thatrevolutionary technologies were being developed and tested there, possibly withan extraterrestrial boost. By the late 1980s, a number of people were aware ofwhat was happening, and began to trek to these remote regions with cameras andvideo recorders. This was when Bob Lazar’s claims, discussed in the previous chapter, werebeing publicized. Instantly, Area 51 went from being one of the most secretplaces on Earth to one of the most notorious and sought-after. From 1989 until1995, UFO hunters, aviation watchers, and curious tourists, most of them armedwith cameras and binoculars, journeyed to “Freedom Ridge,” where there happenedto be a clear line of sight to the base. There were frequent sightings of highlyunusual craft, often disc-shaped and moving in ways that were beyond ordinaryaerodynamics. In April, 1995, the Air Force purchased the land around FreedomRidge, effectively ending an era. After that, there remained the more distantTikaboo Peak, offering a clear view of the base for those bringing a telescope. One important UFO video from Groom Lake came not from the observers atFreedom Ridge, but from inside the base. In early 1995, a video was leaked tothe television show Hard Copy. It was later determined to have been recorded byan Air Force surveillance camera in November, 1994, somewhere within the NellisTest Range, which includes Area 51 at Groom Lake. The object bears more than apassing resemblance to the so-called Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV), discussedin the previous chapter. Moreover, its movements were truly radical. Itaccelerated rapidly from speeds as low as 30 mph to over 500 mph, and made rightangle turns at roughly 140 mph. The video is authentic. We can assume it is oneof ours. If so, then the clandestine military-industrial complex developedextremely advanced technology two decades ago, which has still not beenofficially recognized to this day. Unless, of course, it is one of theirs.[205][index_split_006.html#filepos1279916] Soviet UFOs Not only were UFO reporting systems wildly uneven during this period, butthere were entire regions that were essentially cut off from elsewhere. Mostnotably, this was so in the Communist nations of China and the Soviet Union.Certainly these and other relatively closed societies had their share of UFOsightings, but reports only seeped out sporadically. Then came the late 1980s:Gorbachev and glasnost. It is an interesting fact that as the Soviet Unionspiraled into disunity and oblivion during the final years of the 1980s, untilthe end of 1991, UFO reports increased dramatically. Certainly, most or even allof this can be accounted for by the new period of openness in that nation. Butit is worth wondering if the rise in reports had any relationship to the demiseof the Soviet Union itself. Many of these have probably been lost to us, but a good number did becomeavailable. One of the most interesting Soviet UFO events of the 1980s is theDalnegorsk case, sometimes referred to as the Soviet Roswell. Dalnegorsk was amining town in the eastern Soviet Union. On January 29, 1986, only eighteenhours after the explosion of the U.S. space shuttle, Challenger, local peoplesaw a reddish orange sphere flying at a low altitude. It moved on a level flightpath and was absolutely silent. It was fairly low in the sky, probably nothigher than 2,500 feet altitude, and was very slow moving, with estimates ofroughly 30 mph (slower than the stall speeds of most aircraft). The objectapproached a low mountain near the town and apparently slowed down. Somewitnesses claim to have seen it raise and lower itself several times. Each timeit rose, the light became brighter; each time it descended, the light dimmed.Then, suddenly, it dropped like a stone. A Soviet scientific team arrived days later. Researchers today are divided asto whether the object was a Russian military probe or somethingextraterrestrial. A few have argued that it was some sort of natural event,perhaps an electromagnetic phenomenon caused by anomalous stresses within theEarth’s crust. This seems least likely. The analysis of the investigation teammade a case for the object being of artificial origin. An answer to what crashedthere may be very long in coming.[206] [index_split_006.html#filepos1280411] As the 1990s approached, more interesting Soviet UFO cases came along. One ofthese, albeit in partial and truncated form, comes from the files of the Sovietstate security agency, the KGB. It contains first-hand testimony from soldiersdescribing an incident near Kasputin Yar, a major rocket launch facility in thesoutheastern Soviet Union, on July 28-29th, 1989. The area is equivalent toAmerica’s White Sands Proving Ground, and indeed it was there in 1947 that theSoviets launched their own captured German V2 rockets. Near midnight, according to the file, a disc-shaped object flew silentlytoward the area, flashing intensely bright lights from beneath it. It hoveredover the weapons site less than one hundred feet above the ground. It wasapproximately fifteen feet in diameter, and was illuminated with a dim, green,phosphorus-like color. A bright beam appeared from beneath it, and the objectcircled a few times, moved away, then returned. The KGB documents indicate thatan order was given to scramble fighter jets to intercept the object, but theobject never allowed the aircraft to come close to it. After ninety minutes orso, it flew away. The case has several corroborating witnesses to it, and readslike so many American cases.[207] [index_split_006.html#filepos1281119] Explaining cases such as these as secret classified technology isproblematic. Could this really have been a secret American flying saucer, spyingon the Soviets? Or, did the Soviets have their own secret program that spied ontheir own facilities? Or, was there—is there—an off-the-grid society that wasspying on both of them, and everyone else? Another fascinating and controversial case occurred in the Soviet city ofVoronezh, on September 27, 1989. It involved a landed craft, a tall,bizarre-looking entity, and a public park filled with children and a few adults.There were many witnesses, much testimony, and much ridicule in the Westernpress. To this day, the case is something of damaged goods, in large partbecause of the sensational nature of the encounter, and the supposedunreliability of Russian witnesses, at least in the opinion of Westernjournalists. Yet, the case retains its defenders to this day.[208][index_split_006.html#filepos1281542] An event much harder to dispute took place near Moscow on March 21, 1990.That night, in the hours before midnight, a number of unknown objects were seenover a wide area. Many residents contacted authorities, all describing what theysaw in highly unconventional terms. Two Soviet interceptors were dispatched. As one pilot closed in on theunknown, he saw two white flashing lights on the UFO while tracking it on hisairborne radar. He ordered the target to identify itself, whereupon it changedits speed and altitude. The pilot turned and reapproached the UFO, passing itvery closely this time. This time, in addition to seeing the flashing lights,the pilot briefly saw a silhouette of the object. Still, however, he could notidentify it. Ground-based personnel saw the encounter. They noticed that the UFO seemed todisappear as the aircraft approached it. They also saw it turn and approach thejet at a very high speed. It would disappear, then reappear behind and above thejet. One of the military witnesses said it maneuvered in an S-turn flight, bothhorizontally and vertically. Another said it looked just like a flying saucer. The case received comment by the Soviet Minister of Defense, Ivan Tretyak, aswell as the Chief of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, General Igor Maltsev.Maltsev stated there were over one hundred visual observations of the objectmade by military personnel, and that two photographs were taken, which havenever been released. He confirmed the extraordinary capabilities of the object,including a speed that exceeded modern jet fighters by two or three times, allthe while moving silently. Maltsev added that whoever was operating these craft“had somehow come to terms with gravity.” He refused to speculate on theidentity of the object, but added “at the present time, terrestrial machinescould hardly have any such capabilities.” A truly remarkable admission comingfrom such a high-level figure.[209] [index_split_006.html#filepos1282865] Whatever it was, clearly this was an object that had no problem easilyoutperforming a Soviet military jet. Triangles over Belgium Through the winter of 1989 and into 1990, the nation of Belgium experienced asignificant wave of UFO activity. Many of the sightings were of triangularcraft, but which otherwise acted very much like traditional disc-shaped flyingsaucers. That is, silent maneuvering, extended loitering and low-hoveringcapability, and instant acceleration. Many of those reports were well-attestedto, including quite a few by police officers. The most dramatic night of this wave of sightings occurred on the night ofMarch 30 into the 31st, 1990, only a week and a half after the Moscow sighting.A policeman contacted a NATO radar station, reporting three unusual lightsforming an equilateral triangle, something which other police patrols soonconfirmed. NATO radar then confirmed an unknown target moving at a very slowspeed. For the next two and a half hours, a number of police officers andcivilians noticed up to three sets of triangular lights, much larger inappearance than stars, often accelerating and maneuvering in unusual ways. Atcertain times, when the lights came down low enough, some witnesses were certainthe lights were attached to a huge triangular craft. NATO Air Defense scrambled two F-16 jets. Both jets quickly tracked unknownobjects on their radar, but each time they approached one of the objects, theradar lock was broken and the object took evasive action. Ground witnessesconfirmed that the lights of the UFO went out every time the F-16s approached(reminiscent of the events over Malmstrom AFB in 1975). According to a statementby the Royal Belgian Air Force, the speed of one UFO changed immediately from150 knots to 970 knots (roughly speaking, miles per hour) and dropped itsaltitude from 9,000 feet to 5,000 feet—nearly one mile—in one or two seconds, asimply astonishing maneuver. For several hours, the unknown objects seemed to betoying with the interceptors. Because the stealth fighter and stealth bomber had recently been revealed bythe U.S., and because both of them had unusually angular designs for aircraft ofthe time, there was some speculation that people had seen some new version ofstealth technology. However, this is not tenable. Neither of those aircraft, norany other known craft, possess the maneuvering capabilities of the objects seenover Belgium (and northern Germany) that night. They remain unknown. If they arepart of a clandestine but wholly terrestrial program, it still begs an array ofquestions: What agency was responsible? Why engage in such maneuvers? What wouldbe the purpose or mission of these exercises? Why have such aircraft not beenacknowledged for the past two decades? Why is there nothing to this day,officially speaking, that can duplicate their maneuvers?[210][index_split_006.html#filepos1284336] It may well be that the events over Belgium were somehow related to theevents near Moscow from just over a week earlier. Today, more than twenty yearslater, there has been no confirmation from any agency regarding what might havecaused the Belgian sightings. It is evident, however, that these UFOs did notrequire jet fuel to carry out their incredible aerial performance. Of course,that applies to all the UFOs covered in this book. Such performance, clearlypoints to another source of power, a new technology altogether. More on thislater. Summary If one thing is glaringly obvious, it is that the UFO phenomenon is globaland has included many military encounters. The question must be asked: if UFOs are the product of a clandestinetechnology, something unrelated to extraterrestrials or some form of being wecan describe as “other,” then what agency has been responsible? Does it belongto any of the world’s governments? Where is the scientific and technologicalinfrastructure responsible for it? Are we dealing with the effects of what Ihave elsewhere described as a Breakaway Civilization? To answer this question, we must, unfortunately, speculate rather than relyon confirmed knowledge. Nevertheless, the strongest answer continues to appearthat the core of the truly extraordinary UFO sightings of the period justdiscussed are indeed not us. Whether extraterrestrial or not, they do not appearto be from our civilization. This seems especially so when we explore, as weshall in the next several chapters, some of the experiences and sightings thatincluded claims of encounters with non-human beings. Even so, the 1980s generated enough evidence, some of which was admittedlyanecdotal, indicating that the clandestine human infrastructure was developingcapabilities that might begin to approximate “true” UFO characteristics. Inparticular, the sightings of objects near Area 51 during the late 1980s give usreason for thinking this. But could clandestine human technology have been behind all of the trulydifficult UFO sightings of the 1970s and 1980s? The aerial activity over thevarious nations of the world: the U.S., Soviet Union, Brazil, China, Africa, theMiddle East, and elsewhere indicate that something extraordinary was going on.Something of global reach, with technology vastly beyond anything officially onthe books. Considering that the UFO phenomenon presents evidence of such advancedtechnology, able to outclass the world’s best militaries with utter ease, it isnot difficult to see why there would be secrecy enveloping the entire subject. Chapter 7UFOs, 1991 to the Present Since the 1990s, perhaps the most striking feature of the UFO phenomenon hasbeen the sheer number of incredible, inexplicable, and just plain impossiblesightings. Doing justice to all of those which are good and genuine would fillseveral thick volumes. What follows here, of necessity, can convey only theessence of this explosion of activity. There are several major repositories of UFO reports, but it has been decadessince any researcher has collected and published anything that could remotely beconsidered a complete list for any given year. Conservatively speaking, thereare no less than 10,000 UFO reports generated every year in North America alone,judging only from the top two websites that collect them.[211][index_split_006.html#filepos1285515] Even after accounting for some probableduplication of reports, it is obvious that UFO sightings are not merely a daily,or even more often occurrence, but are plentiful and widespread. Of course, readers should remember that ninety percent or more of all UFOsightings are explainable in more-or-less prosaic terms. However, it is alsotrue that most people do not report their UFO sightings, and very possibly thisis by a factor of ten or more.[212] [index_split_006.html#filepos1285952] Inother words, there is a good chance that these two factors roughly even out. To consider that there may well be something like 10,000 genuine UFOsightings each year, simply in one region of the world, forces us to take afresh perspective on the nature of our society, our world, and our reality. Itmeans that there may be, on average, twenty-five to thirty genuine sightingseach day of what we may reasonably describe as non-human technology. This seemsextraordinary, and it is. Nevertheless, this is still a tiny number compared tothe amount of conventional traffic traversing North American air space.[213][index_split_006.html#filepos1286302] While UFOs are fairly widespread, theirobservable activity is still dwarfed by the non-stop buzz of human civilization.Yet, they are most definitely out there. The Beginning of the Video Era UFOs have been recorded on film since the 1950s. Many of these appear to havebeen hoaxes, although some appear to be legitimate and mystifying. It was notuntil the end of the 1980s, and particularly the 1990s, that the era of theportable camcorder arrived. Suddenly, a great many bizarre aerial objects werebeing captured on video. One of the first great examples of this new development was during a masssighting of UFOs over Mexico City on July 11, 1991. Because a total solareclipse was taking place, many people had their video cameras ready and pointedtoward the sky. This was no ordinary eclipse. In the first place, it was a“monster eclipse,” lasting over six and a half minutes of totality at themaximum (the theoretical maximum of an eclipse is just over seven minutes, andmost last less than two minutes). Moreover, there was a great build-up to thisone, as many people claimed it was predicted by ancient Mayan prophecy, and thatit was going to herald major Earth changes and greater cosmic awareness. Thesechanges were believed to stem from an encounter with the “Masters of the Stars,”which would occur during the eclipse.[214] [index_split_006.html#filepos1286702] Within the context of such a build-up, Mexicans witnessed a striking aerialdisplay. Several bright objects, all of which looked solid, even metallic, wereseen by thousands. One in particular looked very much like a silver disc. Theyappeared to reflect light and seemed to move intelligently across the sky.Digital enhancements revealed them to be shaped somewhat like a hockey puck,nothing like a star or planet. The clincher for most students of the videos washow the objects moved in front of passing clouds. Whatever they were, they werenothing conventional. [images/00027.jpg]Object video-recorded over Mexico City, July 11, 1991. Interpreting this amazing display is another matter. Believing whether or notthis was a sign from the Masters of the Stars will hinge upon assumptions thatmay forever be unprovable. However, Mexico has been the scene of a large numberof UFO sightings in subsequent years, many of which were videotaped. Another interesting piece of video evidence of UFOs was recorded on August23, 1995, near Gulf Breeze, Florida. This area had been well known for UFOsightings since the late 1980s. However, whereas most of the photos from GulfBreeze had been associated with Ed Walters and had come under dispute (although,in the opinion of many analysts, without justice), this video was shot by a mannamed Mike Hawkins. Strikingly, it showed an object that looked identical tothose photographed previously by Walters. The video is compelling and lacks anyreasonable conventional explanation.[215] [index_split_006.html#filepos1286994]Instead, it provides good corroboration to the Gulf Breeze UFOs of the previouseight years. As time passes, it seems increasingly clear that the attacks on EdWalters were motivated to destroy his credibility and hence the entire wave ofsightings themselves. In other words, the Gulf Breeze UFOs of the 1980s and1990s were real. Photographic evidence, naturally, will never be as strong as video recordingsin supporting the existence of UFOs. This is especially so regarding images thatare submitted anonymously. Still, a few are worth consideration. On September16, 1996, six photos were taken in the town of Valley, Alabama, then sent to alocal radio station and newspaper. The photographer claimed he was repairing afence on his property when his dog began barking loudly. He noticed a low-flyingobject, shaped like a capsule, looking as though it belonged in the U.S. spaceprogram of the 1960s. It hovered and then moved slowly over one of his cowpastures. What makes the six photographs so interesting is that each onecaptured the object at a different angle and elevation, making a hoax a muchmore challenging proposition. Intriguing though the photos are, their anonymityultimately prevents them from being considered stronger evidence.[216][index_split_006.html#filepos1287317] Just a month later, on October 27, 1996, a very interesting snapshot wastaken in Hungary. The photographer, Lajos Kosina, took a picture of hisgirlfriend in front of a field. Upon having the photograph developed a few weekslater (this was before digital photography became common), he was surprised tosee a disc-shaped object clearly in the sky behind her. This type of thing hashappened quite frequently. But this is surely one of the best cases of a UFObeing photographed without being seen at time. The photograph, in particular thenegative, has been studied using optical and computer techniques. According tothose analyses the object in the sky is not the result of a film fault, nor isit a small model suspended on a wire. It appears to be a genuine, flat,disc-shaped object reflecting the autumn sunshine—a flying saucer.[217][index_split_006.html#filepos1287695] [images/00058.jpg]UFO in Hungary, October 27, 1996. Enlarged object in inset. Another interesting video was shot on July 4, 1998, in Somerset England, byman named Rod Dickinson. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of camera shake inthe video, making it difficult to follow the object, or even to see it clearlyat times. However, a detailed analysis by a Hollywood movie professionalconcluded that the shake provided good evidence for the video’s authenticity. Inother words, the specifics of the camera shake made fakery more difficult. Thewitness certainly seemed sincere to all those who interviewed him. Incidentally,on the frames of the video where it can be seen clearly, the object looks like aclassic flying saucer.[218] [index_split_006.html#filepos1288008] UFOs that Weren’t Despite some fascinating video and photographic evidence of UFOs, it is goodto remember that not only are most of these things not alien craft, but therehave been several cases that have gained acceptance among some researchers whichare probably not legitimate. Consider the following cases to be cautionarytales, lessons in how we can be fooled. One is a photograph from July 17, 1992 which aired later on Chileantelevision. It was taken from a Chilean satellite, about 400 kilometers (250miles) above the Earth's surface. The image shows something that appears to beeither an enormous UFO, or something very close to the camera. In fact, it isalmost certainly the Moon. There are elements of this image that we still don’tfully understand, but the camera from that satellite requires eighteen minutesto take a picture of the Earth. During this time, it is still in motion, as isthe Moon, giving ample opportunity for distortions to occur. More than once hasthe Moon been mistaken for a UFO.[219] [index_split_006.html#filepos1288452] [images/00059.jpg]UFO? No, the Moon. The Chilean satellite image of 1992. Another prosaic case which is widely discussed as a genuine UFO eventoccurred on February 2, 1993. That evening, several people in Jefferson County,Kentucky, reported a UFO. There was indeed an object in the sky and a policehelicopter even had an encounter with it. At times the object looked like a hugeball of fire, larger than the helicopter. It changed its brightness erratically,and made what the officers perceived as ramming attacks. The policemen, who wereunquestionably honest and reliable, were convinced it was a genuine UFO. Thecase later received television coverage and has been considered a strong case bysome researchers. Yet, the object was certainly a lighted balloon, described indetail shortly afterwards by the man who had lit it and sent it aloft. He hadnot considered that his balloon would be reported as a UFO, he said. The case isinstructive, showing that ordinary objects can be interpreted by intelligentpeople to be something other than what they really are. We always have to becareful.[220] [index_split_006.html#filepos1289095] The last example, for now, of well-known UFO evidence that appearsquestionable is a series of photographs from 1993, taken at Australia's MaslinBeach. These photos, which show a UFO over a body of water have a detailed storyaccompanying them, at least according to the person who submitted them. A closeanalysis, however, reveals strong evidence that these images are hoaxes: modelsthat were most likely suspended in front of the camera. The windows are the bestgiveaway, clearly looking as though they had been cut out of cardboard.[221][index_split_006.html#filepos1289804] Not all prosaic explanations of UFOs are the result of hoaxes. Most aresimply misinterpretations by honest people of something that surprised them.However, even accounting for cases of mistaken identity, a review of the lasttwo decades makes it evident that there is an abundance of truly mystifyingcases. The Tether Incident Of all videos that are accepted in some circles as genuine UFO evidence, butwhich probably are not, perhaps the best known was from NASA’s STS-75 mission,more widely known as the Tether Incident. This occurred in late February, 1996,during a mission to carry and deploy a Tethered Satellite System into orbit ataround 200 miles, within the Earth's ionosphere. The purpose of this, amongother things, was to demonstrate electrical power generation. The tether was12.9 miles long and nearly all of it was deployed when it broke while in orbiton February 25, 1996. A few days later, NASA recorded what looked like a veritable armada ofobjects moving and maneuvering around the tether. This has been the subject ofengaging debate ever since. NASA has maintained that the cameras recorded debrisfrom a recent water dump. Others have argued that the debris in the videoappears to go behind the tether, which would clearly be too far away for a waterdump. In addition, the video shows so many of these objects, all appearing aspulsing, circular discs, often with a hole in the center, and what appears to bea notch cut out of the edge. Certainly, the fact that they appear to go behindthe tether is suggestive that they are real. At the time of the recording thetether was approximately one hundred miles away from the camera. At thatdistance, any visible object behind the tether would have to be enormous.[images/00023.jpg]The broken NASA tether, seemingly in front of an enormous object in Earth orbit.In reality, this is an optical illusion. This would be true, if the objects actually were behind the tether. In fact,the video shows a number of optical illusions. Fundamentally, the objects thatappear in this video look nothing like they actually were, primarily because ofeffects caused by the camera’s electronics, lens and sunlight. First among these is the thickness of the tether itself. The video shows along, illuminated tether floating away in space, which looks fairly thick to theeye. In reality, the tether was less than one centimeter thick. It looks thickin the video because of the intense reflectivity from the sunlight. Thereflectivity is strong enough that a small ice particle could pass in front ofthe tether, but the tether's brightness would make it seem that the object ismoving behind. This can easily be duplicated with any ordinary digital camera bytaking a picture of the full moon behind bare tree branches. The moonlight willoften appear to wash through the branches, making it seem that the entire treeis behind the Moon. This is the basic effect one sees regarding the STS-75 video. After all, ifthese were truly enormous objects moving behind the tether, they would haveseemed as bright as the Moon itself down on Earth's surface. This was not anevent in deep space, but in the Earth's ionosphere. Yet they were never noticed,unlike the tether itself, which was noticeable for some time before it fell fromorbit. Complicating the analysis, some of the objects (or, more accurately,particles) appear to change speeds and directions. However there are a number ofthings that might have accounted for this, including collisions with otherparticles that happened not to be visible to the camera. Moreover, the particlesin the video look very much like the so-called “orbs” that many people havecaptured on their digital cameras. Although there are those who believe suchorbs are actual anomalies, even entities of some sort, it seems more likely thatOccam's razor cuts differently. It is much more reasonable that the so-calledphotographic orbs are caused by reflection of light on dust particles, butrecorded by digital technology in a way that film-based photography usually didnot. Hence their proliferation in the age of digital photography.[222][index_split_006.html#filepos1290203] Incidentally, the objects in the tether incident look very much like anobject captured on video by a British woman named Sharon Rowlands in 2000. Withher brand new camcorder she recorded a distant bright object that, upon zoomingin, showed the exact look and texture of light seen in the objects on the tethervideo, as well as of standard digital photographic orbs. While one person calledher video one of the top five UFO videos of all time, it is more likely theresult of an optical effect. It may never be known what the source of the effectwas, but the movement of the object was not unusual. Generally, it appeared tohover motionlessly, although there were times when it seemed as though it wasmaneuvering. What Sharon Rowlands recorded remains unknown, but the fact thather object looked precisely like the objects in the tether incident ought toprovide a hint that they are the result of the same effect inside the digitalcamera.[223] [index_split_006.html#filepos1290560] Although the tether incident is not good evidence of space-based anomalies,there are other cases that offer credible evidence. Some of these were publishedon the website of the late Jeff Challender, who assiduously recorded NASA's manyshuttle mission videos and found many oddities. One that is especiallyintriguing is the example of a U-turn in space by an unknown something duringthe mission of STS-114, on August 6, 2005. Even more intriguing was a motionstabilizing enhancement of the object, when it became obvious that the objectwas maneuvering to the left and right as it moved through space. This is a trulyremarkable video.[224] [index_split_006.html#filepos1290920] Photographic and video evidence is important in the overall case for UFOs,but such evidence is not infallible. Researchers must evaluate it carefully.Indeed, this includes all types of instrument-recorded evidence. We mustremember that instruments can make mistakes, can cause illusory effects, and cansometimes fool even the best and most sober of investigators. Terror in the Air Still, only fools ignore all evidence, and that includes the evidenceacquired by our own eyes. Some of the cases that follow ought to produce a chillinside any reasonable human being who spends any time in aircraft. That isbecause recent history has produced a number of close encounters with UFOs byaircraft, including a few that were very close. There appears to be a great dealof unaccounted-for activity in our skies. On the night of April 21, 1991, for instance, a London-bound airliner flyingat 22,000 feet over the coast of Kent came to within 1,000 feet of an unknownobject. The incident was classed as a near-miss, and an official inquiry waslaunched by the British Civilian Aviation Authority (CAA). The officialconclusion: “Extensive inquiries have failed to provide any indication of whatthe sighting may have been.” The report did note the pilot’s observation of theobject, which was, “light brown, round, three meters long,” and with no clearmeans of propulsion. While no other aircraft was supposed to have been near theairliner, the report stated that, “a faint radar trace was observed ten nauticalmiles behind the ... aircraft.”[225] [index_split_006.html#filepos1291316] There are quite a few of these cases. Another occurred on June 1, 1991, whena yellow-orange, cylindrical object, ten feet long, was seen at close quartersby the crew of a Britannia Airways Boeing 737 en route from Dublin to London.Just over two weeks after that, yet another cylindrical-shaped UFO was seen,this time by a German engineer aboard a flight headed toward Hamburg,Germany.[226] [index_split_006.html#filepos1291703] Air France had a dramatic aerial encounter on January 28, 1994. While flyingover the Paris region, the crew noticed a large brown-red disc hovering on thehorizon. It seemed constantly to be changing its shape. In the words of thepilot:> This object seemed to us then absolutely abnormal by its size which seemed> immense, its dark red color and of the fuzzy edges. I had the impression to> observe a gigantic lens in evolution. It did not resemble anything we had seen> in our flying careers.[227] [index_split_006.html#filepos1291755] Another near-miss was reported by pilots of a British airliner on January 6,1995. Captain Roger Wills and copilot Mark Stuart were beginning their descenttowards Manchester Airport in a Boeing 737 with sixty passengers on board.Seventeen minutes before touchdown, a mysterious, triangular-shaped UFO flashedpast the right-hand side of the aircraft at a distance described as being “veryclose.” So close, in fact, that the crew instinctively “ducked” in their seats.Their conversation with air traffic control is on record. The encountercertainly disturbed the pilots.[228] [index_split_006.html#filepos1292239] Later in 1995, on May 25, over the Texas panhandle, a cigar-shaped objectwith a row of brightly flashing lights along its length was seen by the crew ofan America West airliner. The case was thoroughly investigated by the astronomerand experienced UFO researcher, Walter Webb, on behalf of the UFO ResearchCoalition.[229] [index_split_006.html#filepos1292615] Again in 1995, this time on July 11, a wingless object was seen near aNorwegian plane. This was a Dash-8 passenger plane that had taken off from Osloand was about forty miles north of Trondheim. The co-pilot caught sight of aflying object that moved to the right of the aircraft.[230][index_split_006.html#filepos1292976] On Feb. 28, 1996, the pilots of two airliners near Cleveland reported a verybright pulsating light below them. One pilot dropped his altitude to makecertain that the lights were not ground-based. They were not, as he was thenable to see them above his position. Ground control suggested the light might bea reflection in the clouds from another aircraft, but the pilots of bothaircraft were adamant that the light had a distinct source of its own. Apassenger on one of the flights is known to have taken photographs, but nonehave been publicly released. A detailed transcript of the encounter is availableon the web.[231] [index_split_006.html#filepos1293225] There are so many of these encounters. Another one occurred on August 9,1997, near New York City’s Kennedy Airport, when a Swissair flight had a closeencounter with an unknown object.[232] [index_split_006.html#filepos1294004] OnFebruary 3, 1999, an object described “as big as a battleship” was seen over theNorth Sea by the crew of a British charter jet.[233][index_split_006.html#filepos1294364] On November 23, 2003, shortly beforelanding at LaGuardia in New York City, while still over New Jersey, an airlinerencountered a bright red circular disk, seen clearly by one of thepassengers.[234] [index_split_006.html#filepos1294758] On November 3, 2004,during a descent to San Francisco, an experienced airline pilot reported amaneuvering orange light. The pilot was very cautious and checked for anyatmospheric explanation, but there simply was none. The object then justdisappeared.[235] [index_split_006.html#filepos1295040] Of course, these and many other aviation encounters do not prove that UFOsare extraterrestrial. They do not even prove that UFOs are necessarilyunconventional objects. If pressed to the wall, one might find excuses for everyone of these cases. But that does not mean those interpretations would becorrect. Some of these encounters may have prosaic explanations, but it doesappear that something important has been going on in our skies. Whether it stemsfrom unknown others or secret technologies of our own civilization, it shouldremain important to any thinking person. Encounters with “Them” If close encounters in the air leave one unimpressed, perhaps we can move onto actual encounters. Not with UFOs, but with what surely appear to be nonhuman,alien beings. Again, it must be emphasized that the cases described here are amere sprinkling of what has been reported. After studying many of these casesover the years, it appears that some form of memory manipulation and erasure hasbeen involved on people who have had these experiences. Yet, not all people are the same. Some people’s apparent alien experiencesseem to bleed through into their normal waking consciousness. They remember, orat least they seem to remember, enough. Also, judging from the testimonies, itseems that not all of the beings themselves are equally concerned withattempting to control human memory. What we do have are a certain number of cases that are difficult to dismissout of hand. The Khoury Incident One of these is the remarkable experience of Peter Khoury, in Sydney,Australia, on July 23, 1992. Khoury was alone in bed at 7:30 a.m. Suddenly, he awoke very alert and satup. Two humanoid females were sitting on his bed, both entirely naked. Theylooked human but, then again, not quite normal. One looked somewhat Asian, theother looked perhaps Scandinavian, with light-colored eyes and long,exotic-looking, blonde hair. They both had unusually high cheekbones and verylarge eyes. The blonde woman also had an unusually long face. Both had nearlyblank expressions. The blonde woman seemed to be in charge. She sat in a kneeling position onthe bed directly facing Khoury, who was nearly in shock. Then she reached outwith both her hands and cupped the back of his head, drawing his face toward herchest. Khoury resisted, but she pulled harder, so that his mouth was on hernipple. Who knows why, perhaps just terror, but he bit hard. A small piece ofher nipple came away in his teeth. Oddly, she did not cry out. Her expression simply conveyed the idea to Khourythat, whatever he was supposed to have done, he did it wrong. The small fragmentbecame caught in Khoury's throat, and he went into a coughing fit. Suddenly, thetwo women simply disappeared. Once he realized they were gone, he tried clearing his throat with water. Itdid not work. Then he had an urge to urinate and went to the bathroom. Herealized that his penis felt very painful. Standing in the bathroom, he pulledback the foreskin and found two thin, blonde, strands of hair wrapped tightlyaround. The hairs were not easy to remove, and the process was painful. Finally,he removed them and placed them in a sealed plastic bag. The object in Khoury's throat remained lodged there. He coughed constantly.He tried clearing his throat with water, bread, and anything else he could thinkof, but nothing helped. Finally, after three days, it just went away. The hair samples became the subject of the first openly-reported DNA test ona possible alien abduction. Tests noted how extremely thin, and almost clear incolor, the hairs were. Under normal circumstances, hair that clear would almostcertainly have been chemically treated, but this hair was not. Had it been so,the mitochondrial DNA could not have been recovered. Analysts concluded that,even though the hair was unquestionably very light blonde, it was not from alight-skinned caucasian racial type. Instead, the hair showed five distinctiveDNA markers that are characteristic of a rare sub-group of the Chinese racialtype. The scientists examined a database containing tens of thousands of samplesof mitochondrial DNA. Of these, only four other people had all five of thosemarkers. All were Chinese, and each one had black hair.[236][index_split_006.html#filepos1295441] Mitochondrial DNA is passed only from mother to child, so this suggests thatthe mysterious blonde woman shares a common female ancestor with the fourChinese people in the database. But how could that be? As researcher BillChalker put it, it seems unlikely that any person with blonde hair and an exactDNA match to the mysterious blonde woman could be found in the city of Sydney,nor on the continent of Australia, nor probably anywhere in the world. All of which begs the question, who were these two female beings? It wouldappear there had been a sexual encounter, or perhaps a close call, somethingwhich Khoury did not recall for whatever reason. How else, one wonders, wouldthe woman’s hair become wrapped around his penis? The fact that they were bothfairly attractive (albeit odd and a little too exotic for comfort) andespecially the fact that they were naked, makes it seem obvious that there wassupposed to be a sexual encounter, or that there already had been one. Theblonde woman seems to have been the instructor, and the Asian-looking woman thestudent, perhaps there as an observer. Are we dealing with humans with very rare and somewhat anomalous DNA? Thiswas Chalker's suggestion, which seems reasonable. In other words, this wouldsuggest the existence of a clandestine human group, long distinct from themainstream of humanity, as being behind part of, or most or all of the UFOphenomenon.[237] The Kelly Cahill Case Another Australian UFO encounter of the early 1990s has also gained someprominence among students of ufology. This was the August 1993 experience ofKelly Cahill and her husband, along with two other motorists who were in aseparate vehicle. Although all four people seem to have experienced something,Kelly Cahill has been by far the most public of them. Around midnight, the Cahills were driving home in the province of Victoriawhen they noticed lights of a rounded craft in front of them. The craft andlights appeared simply to hover silently above the road. Kelly thought she couldeven see people through the windows. She screamed to her husband and the craftzoomed away. They continued driving home, shaken. Then they noticed another light, one sobright that it nearly blinded them. Immediately, they felt unusually calm andrelaxed. At some point, Kelly asked, “What happened, did I black out?” Herhusband said nothing, and they continued to drive home. Upon arriving home, Kelly detected a foul odor, something like vomit, andthen realized she and her husband had an hour of missing time. As she undressedfor bed, she noticed a strange, new, triangular mark on her navel. For the nexttwo weeks, she experienced severe stomach pain and was hospitalized for auterine infection. Without hypnosis she began remembering details of the encounter. She recalledthat her husband had stopped the car, that they had both left the vehicle andhad walked toward the massive craft. She remembered another car having stoppedon the side of the road. As she and her husband approached the craft, they saw astrange creature, about seven feet tall. Kelly described it as black, but notthe color black. Rather, she said, black as though all matter had been removedfrom it. She later described it as evil and lacking a soul. The eyes of thisbeing were large, similar to the eyes of flies, and they glowed red. She thennoticed that there were many more of these beings in the field beneath theimmense hovering object. One group of them glided very rapidly toward Kelly andher husband, covering one hundred yards within a few seconds. Another groupapproached the other car. At this point, apparently, she became unconscious. Hernext memory was of being back in her car. The occupants of the other car later came forward and told a similar story,showing marks on their body and drawing pictures of the same craft and beings.For her part, Kelly later had dreams of a black alien stooping over her helplessbody, as if he were kissing her navel. The case is generally considered among the better ones. There are photographsof Kelly's triangle and the marks on Glenda, the other woman who was there. Someskeptics have wondered why the other witnesses, including Kelly's husband, havenot been more forthcoming themselves. Nevertheless, most researchers of the casehave considered Kelly Cahill to be sincere.[238][index_split_006.html#filepos1296562] Schoolchildren in Zimbabwe As if the two preceding cases were not startling enough, another one from theearly 1990s is more compelling still. This concerns an encounter with over sixtyschoolchildren in the town of Ruwa, Zimbabwe, on September 16, 1994. These children were outside during recess when they saw a large craft land inan adjoining field. But there was more. Three or four beings, clearly not human,were beside the craft, and one was apparently perched atop it. The children allran into the building, to the shock of their teachers and administrators.Unfortunately, and for reasons that are unclear, there were no adults presentwhen this event happened. It is not unusual for a child to tell a strange UFO story, nor for an adultto dismiss it. But what makes this case so compelling is that each of thesechildren adamantly told precisely the same story, with much detail. They wereobviously sincere about their experience. These children were young, around theages of seven and eight. South African investigator Cynthia Hind did a thoroughexamination of the case, and Harvard University psychologist, Dr. John Mack,interviewed many of these children personally when he visited shortly afterward. [images/00012.jpg]Some of the school children of Ruwa, Zimbabwe and their drawings. There is a powerful and compelling ten-minute video of these children onYouTube, talking to Dr. Mack about what they saw.[239][index_split_006.html#filepos1297215] They described their experiencesidentically. Their drawings, too, both of the craft and beings, are remarkablyconsistent. The beings were short, with black wraparound eyes ending in points.Each of the children seem to have been deeply afraid, and it appears at leastsome of them received mental impressions from the beings. It is easier to acknowledge that the event happened than to understand whatit signifies. Did the beings simply stumble, accidentally, upon these childrenwhile engaged in other matters? Did they explicitly decide to make theirappearance when there were no adults present? What would be the purpose ofhaving such an encounter with these young children?[240][index_split_006.html#filepos1297574] An Entity in Varginha, Brazil As the above cases hint, many of the most compelling “alien” encounters ofthe 1990s took place outside the United States. This includes a famous incidentthat occurred in the Brazilian town of Varginha. According to multiple alleged (but unconfirmed) leaks from within theBrazilian military, U.S. North American Air Defense (NORAD) contacted itsBrazilian counterpart at midnight on January 20, 1996. The Brazilians were toldthat there was a UFO coming down over the southern part of the country. The nextmorning (again according to the anonymous informants), the Varginha FireDepartment received a phone call about a “strange creature” seen in an areaknown as Jardim Andere. Assuming the call was either a prank or a drunk witness,the department ignored the report. Then came a second call, then a third, andthen a fourth. At this point, the Fire Department, which in Brazil is part of the military,responded. When the firefighters arrived upon the scene, they were shocked tosee that there was indeed a creature. It had three protrusions on its head,almost like small horns, and had glowing red eyes. It had long arms, short legs,and large feet. It appeared to be dazed, and the firefighters easily capturedit. Later that day, three young women were walking home after work. Taking ashortcut through a wooded area, they stumbled upon another one of these strangecreatures. It appeared to be identical in appearance to the one captured by thefirefighters. There were other creature reports from that day and there are unconfirmedreports that a number of others were captured. One was said to have been takento a small hospital before being transferred by military personnel to a largerfacility. At least one of the creatures was said to have died and then taken tothe University of Campinas for an autopsy. Two others were said to be taken tothe University of Sao Paulo for examination. A few weeks after the event a 23year-old military policeman named Marco Eli Cherese, who was involved in theinvestigation, died. Supposedly, he fell ill from the effects of contact withone of the creatures. There is much more to the case, including an interview conducted by Americanresearcher Dr. Roger Leir with a doctor who examined one of the beings. The caseis fascinating, but nothing is confirmed, everything is alleged. It is somethinglike Roswell, in that a great deal of witness testimony is pitted againstgovernment denials, except that in the case of Roswell, one could always fallback on the newspaper account of a crashed flying disc. In the case of Varginha,there is not even that level of confirmation. Still, the case is intriguing, andit could be true.[241] [index_split_006.html#filepos1297970] The Washington Elk Case Every so often, witnesses testify to seeing UFOs take livestock or wildanimals. According to three witnesses who spoke to UFO researchers, one suchevent took place in the State of Washington on February 25, 1999. During the late morning, fourteen forestry employees of a large, unnamedcompany were planting trees in the Cascade Mountains. Through the morning, threeof the men were observing a herd of elk in the valley below them. Suddenly, totheir great surprise, a flat object, curved at one end and straight at theother, shaped something like the heel of a shoe, appeared over a ridge. Theynoticed two stripes on its back end. At first the three men thought the objectwas something like a parachute. But then they noticed it closely following thecontours of the terrain below it and began to think otherwise. When the object moved toward the herd of elk, the men called out to theirco-workers. Now, all fourteen men watched the silent object approach the elk.When the object got fairly close the herd bolted toward a densely wooded area. All but one. Oddly, one elk did not run. Instead, it trotted nonchalantly in an entirelydifferent direction. The mysterious object floated over this elk, then appearedto lift it off the ground. While the elk slowly rotated beneath it, seeminglyfloating in the air, the object began to move off. It barely cleared some trees,and then glided over to the next valley and was out of sight. A few minuteslater, it reappeared, with no elk in sight, and rose at high speed until itdisappeared into the sky. The case was reported to Peter Davenport of the National UFO ReportingCenter. Davenport and another investigator traveled to the site and interviewedseveral of the witnesses. They also examined the body of a female elk that wasfound north of the site, although it could not be determined whether or not thiswas the same elk that had been lifted into the air. Many of the witnesses hadbeen with the company for years and were deemed to be reliable, but beyond that,investigators hit a dead end. Indeed, how would one obtain additionalinformation?[242] [index_split_006.html#filepos1298557] Who Are These Beings? The preceding encounter cases are among the more spectacular ones of the1990s. Clearly, they are distinct from one another, but they do share someimportant similarities. First of all, the beings all seemed to have an agenda ofsome sort. None of them spoke, nor even showed recognizable emotions. In three of theencounters, (Peter Khoury, Kelly Cahill, and the Zimbabwe school children) theentities seemed quite formidable in their capabilities, sometimes moving fromplace to place with a speed that would be impossible for any human. Indeed, inthe Khoury case, the two female beings appear to have simply vanished, somehowable to leave the physical space instantly. Perhaps they entered anotherdimension, or were beamed up, like in a Star Trek movie. In the Washington elk incident, no actual beings were seen, but, thisencounter also showed the UFO operators to have very powerful capabilities.Presumably, they intended to use the elk for some reason, perhaps as food,although not if the elk found by the two investigators was the same elk.Frankly, not enough information is available for a determination. One noticeable feature of these cases is that the entities all lookeddifferent. In Khoury’s case, they seemed essentially human, but very unusual. InZimbabwe, they appeared to be classic Grays. In the Cahill case, theirappearance somewhat matched descriptions of tall hooded Greys, except they wereeven taller and had red eyes. Then there is the Varginha case, which (ifdescriptions can even be credited) is an outlier in terms of physicalappearance. In other words, we are left in some confusion. Could it be that we are dealing with multiple groups? Or different lookingbeings which work for the same group? Are they biologically engineered,customized life forms, and as such, capable of incredible variety? Or, are theseall screen memories, unrelated to the actual appearance of the beingsthemselves? It may be that no one truly knows, not independent researchers, norperhaps even those in the classified world. There will be more to say on thismatter in the next chapter. The Spectacular Yukon Sighting It seems odd that the following case is not very well known. However, itoccurred in a remote area, far removed from major media centers or much of theUFO research community. This was in Canada's Yukon province and occurred onDecember 11, 1996, a cold, dark, wintry night in the Great White North. The mainobservations were near Fox Lake, roughly ten miles long and frozen at this timeof year, not far from Alaska, and hundreds of miles distant from any major cityor publicly known military base. According to more than twenty witnesses, an enormous aerial object, lit uplike a Christmas tree, drifted past the lake between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Two ofthe witnesses were cousins, driving in separate vehicles. Each saw it over thelake, slammed on their brakes, and got out of their vehicles. They watched thehuge object as it slowly drifted towards one of them and was soon almostdirectly overhead. It then moved slowly across the highway and over a hill tothe east, whereupon it was lost to view. Both men drew pictures of the object,and it certainly looks very impressive. One might think a huge, slow movingobject such as this could be a blimp, but this seems very unlikely. The Goodyearblimp, for instance, is quite large, nearly two hundred feet long, but whocannot recognize that? Besides, this object was much, much more brightly litthan the Goodyear blimp ever was, and seems to have been much larger, rounder,and taller. Moreover, why would the Goodyear or any other blimp even be in sucha remote area? While the two cousins were observing this object, a married couple with theirbaby were a bit farther to the south along the same highway, driving towardthem. They too saw the object. By the time they caught up with the cousins andpulled over, the object had moved off. The married couple continued drivinguntil they arrived at a lodge farther ahead. There, they told the owner aboutwhat they had seen. He promptly recounted a sighting from an earlier witness,who had gotten very close to this object. [images/00056.jpg]Illustration by investigator Martin Jasek of the Yukon object of 1996, based onwitness accounts. At the nearby village of Pelly Crossing other people described the sameobject. In one case it seemed to respond to a man’s flashlight by acceleratingtoward him. When he turned off his flashlight, the object stopped. By then, ithad gotten quite close to him, filling much of the sky. It also emitted severalbeams of light, including one that swooped along the ground. The man ran acrossa clearing, perhaps to get a better view. When he turned to look for the object,it was gone. Altogether, there are twenty-two known witnesses of this object. The eventwas investigated by Canadian engineer Martin Jasek, who wrote a detailedaccount. The sighting is extraordinary and the case includes many drawings anddetailed interviews many, if not all, of which are available online. Its remotelocation, unfortunately, has hindered it from becoming better known.[243][index_split_006.html#filepos1299170] In 2012, some researchers claimed to have solved the case. It was discoveredthat the Russians had launched a satellite earlier that day, and that there-entry of the second stage of the rocket occurred in the same location and atthe same time as the sighting. The coincidence seems compelling. It would seemthat the witness testimonies were not reliable, and that when seeing somethingunfamiliar they unwittingly created a spaceship out of rocket debris. However,it is not so simple as that. While the re-entry lasted just a few minutes, thesightings were recorded over a series of hours. Moreover, many analysts areunconvinced that the consistent, detailed, and numerous witness descriptionssquare with the re-entry of a rocket into Earth’s atmosphere.[244][index_split_006.html#filepos1299572] The Phoenix Lights All of which brings us to the most famous UFO event of the 1990s, theextraordinary Phoenix Lights of March 13, 1997. Entire books and documentarieshave been devoted to this event.[245] [index_split_006.html#filepos1300206]Actually, this was comprised of two events, and therein lies some of theconfusion regarding the case. Initially, people reported a boomerang formation of lights, first seen inHenderson, Nevada, and then as it moved south, down the state of Arizona. Someof these descriptions were not merely of lights, but of an actual craft whichwas reported to the National UFO Reporting Center, police, the media, and LukeAir Force Base. Among witness descriptions, there was some variation. Allreported lights, but sometimes as a pattern of five lights, sometimes seven, andsometimes even more. Occasionally they were red and orange, at other timesyellow and white. Sometimes they moved rapidly, sometimes slowly, and sometimesthey hovered. This object appears to have been seen just north of Phoenix where threewitnesses reported it as a huge, wedge shaped, craft with five lights. It passeddirectly over their heads. Another nearby group of witnesses described very muchthe same type of object, and added that it hovered directly over them for aboutfive minutes. As it did so, it filled a huge part of the sky. They were able tosee individual features along the bottom of the object, and there was noquestion in their minds that they were seeing a large, solid object. There werequite a few more of these types of sightings. That, in essentials, was Phase Oneof the Phoenix Lights sightings. Phase Two began later that evening, between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., when thepeople of Phoenix were treated to an amazing display of hovering lights overtheir city. These lights appeared to be motionless and in perfect formation.They were a truly astounding sight to behold: an enormous semi-circular stringof lights in the night sky. Despite being video-recorded by multiple residents,media coverage was practically absent for several months. Then, the storyexploded, especially after the public affairs office at Luke Air Force Baseannounced that the lights were flares launched from A-10 warthog aircraft. Somevideo and photo experts who analyzed these lights have concluded that they areflares, despite how amazing they look. Among these is Dr. Bruce Maccabee, anoptical physicist who has analyzed many UFO images and videos. Other analysts, however, do not. One of the most prominent of these is JimDilettoso, who compared the lights to the thousands of images on his database,which he likened to testing fingerprints or blood samples. He tested for size,brightness, movement characteristics, and more. “I didn't get a match to flares,airplane lights, Venus, swamp gas, flashlights, whatever,” he said. “That meansit's unknown. Not a spacecraft necessarily, but unknown.”[246][index_split_006.html#filepos1300821] Many years after the incident, a pilot of the Maryland Air National Guardstated he had flown one of the aircraft in question, and a history of theMaryland Air National Guard asserted that its 104th Fighter Squadron wasresponsible for the incident. Is this true, however? In a private communicationwith me, Dilettoso wrote:> I spent much time . . . with top 2 officers of the Arizona National Guard.> They dismissed the fact the lights could have been flares, and moreover,> heavily dismissed the claim that the Maryland National Guard had been dropping> flares that night. These 2 people I know were the commanding officers who> 'trained' the Maryland National Guard. Not only were they on the ground by 6> PM, the MNG never mentioned a word about being up that night, when the news of> the Phoenix Lights paraded on TV for the next few days, including while the> MNG was still in Arizona being trained.[247]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1301391] Perhaps pressure has been exerted to promote the flares theory. Withoutquestion, there was great pressure put upon the Phoenix City Council not toinvestigate the incident. It even led to the ouster of City Council memberFrancis Barwood, the one member who called for a genuine investigation. It alsoled to a press conference by Arizona Governor Fife Symington, in which a personwearing an alien costume was trotted out for the television cameras as anobvious joke. Largely overlooked, however, is Symington’s public statement in2007 about the matter. By then he was no longer governor, and was lessconstrained in his public statements. Symington admitted that he himself hadseen the object on that day. It had upset him deeply and he organized the pressconference in order to defuse media interest and the threat of public panic.“I'm a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies,” he said. “It wasbigger than anything that I’ve ever seen. It remains a great mystery.”[248][index_split_006.html#filepos1301613] Something important happened over Phoenix that day. It is interesting that,despite the fact that the first series of sightings lacked any video orphotographic evidence, many researchers continue to consider it to be thestronger case. Still, both sightings have good reason for support. One wonders, however, if the lights from later that night were part of thetried and true method of sowing confusion into genuine UFO sightings. During the1980s, in New York’s Hudson Valley, amid numerous reports of large boomerang andtriangular objects flying low over the highway, there were a few confirmed casesof pilots flying small ultra-light aircraft in close formation. The presence ofthese pilots was used, and is still used, to discredit the entire wave of thosesightings. Now consider Arizona, and how even the state's governor acknowledgedthe threat of public panic. Is it really so hard to think that an order wasgiven to drop flares over the city, an explanation that would eventually be usedto disable the story? No, not at all. But, conclusions must rest solely on theevidence offered. This includes not only official statements, but also testimonyfrom the many witnesses, as well as a close analysis of the videos themselves.On this measure, the notion of flares as the culprit remains too debatable to beconsidered a certainty. If only the entire event had occurred a few hours earlier, when daylightwould have left the matter in no doubt. Triangles Whatever the objects over Arizona may have been, the earlier one at any rateappears to have been something like a triangle. Perfectly triangular craft havebeen noted for quite a few decades now, despite the fact that there are still noperfectly triangular craft officially flown by the air force of any nation. In2012, NASA and Boeing announced they had successfully demonstrated the X-48C, a“hybrid wing body” that is somewhat triangular and offers advantages in fuelefficiency. It is also extremely quiet.[249][index_split_006.html#filepos1302043] Perhaps this is why some researchers thinkof triangles as somehow less exotic than spherical or disk shaped flyingsaucers. There is no inherent reason why this should be, since none of thoseshapes were aerodynamic within conventional technologies of the twentiethcentury. Yet, reports of triangular objects go back through the 1940s and evenearlier, becoming more widely seen since the 1970s. The question arises, who hasbeen making them? Us or . . . them? The answer may well be both, but certainly part of the answer is us. Onesighting in particular has always led inexorably to this conclusion. In August1989, a world-class aircraft recognition specialist named Chris Gibson wasworking at a North Sea oil rig installation, when he happened to see a blacktriangular aircraft refueling from a KC-135, accompanied by two F-111 fighteraircraft. Gibson was explicit about what he saw. He is difficult to refute.[250][index_split_006.html#filepos1302511] There has also been a great deal of talkof the perfectly triangular TR-3A and TR-3B aircraft, sometimes known as theBlack Manta. Yet there remains no confirmation. Officially, only mockups wereever built of those aircraft.[251] [index_split_006.html#filepos1303104] Yet, sightings of perfectly triangular craft continued through the 1990s andbeyond. One occurred in November, 1993, by a motorist driving along Interstate 5in Seattle. He saw what could only be described as an immense, black triangle.It was perfect in shape, with red lights at each corner, flying low and silentover the highway. He was convinced that hundreds of motorists had to have seenit. Most intriguingly, the object flew toward the airfield at the Boeingfacility. It was then lost to view.[252] [index_split_006.html#filepos1303480] There are many of these reports. Some are of smaller triangles, and othersthat are simply immense. The large ones are often referred to as Big BlackDeltas, or BBDs. Quite a few of these have also been seen in the Seattle area.In other words, near Boeing’s manufacturing plant. Most of these have been reported from within the United States, but not all.There was a rather good sighting from September 7, 1997, over Paris. This isfrom the files of the official French government UFO research program, GEIPAN.Shortly after 1 a.m., a man on his balcony saw a triangular form with threelights (two blue and one green), moving slowly. He heard nothing, but felt hisbody vibrate. He tried to take a picture of the object, but apparently by thetime he got his camera ready, the object was blocked from view. He estimated theobject to be enormous, “approximately 700 meters,” presumably meaning either indiameter or one of its sides. Either way, this would be gigantic. According tothe witness, the entire sighting lasted for twelve seconds, although one wondershow he could be so confidently exact.[253] [index_split_006.html#filepos1303874] One of the best known triangle cases occurred on January 5, 2000, and isoften referred to as the Illinois cop sighting. Between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. onthat cold, dark winter morning, a number of witnesses, including quite a fewpolice officers, saw a large, low-flying, extremely quiet triangular craft glidepast above them. It was said by witnesses to be two stories high, with two rowsof lights clearly visible. Most witnesses said this object was very large,several city blocks long, possibly as long as the proverbial football field,although one of the officers doubted this. Police officers fully supported thestatements by civilian witnesses. One officer rushed to grab his Polaroid camerato photograph the object, but the picture unfortunately came out poorly. This isnot unusual when people try to photograph a UFO. Frankly, photographing anymoving object in the dark without preparation is going to be difficult at best. [images/00061.jpg]Path of the large triangular craft, from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of this sighting was how the object couldpivot and accelerate so rapidly. Several officers attested to this. Suchobservations make it highly unlikely that the culprit was a balloon of somesort.[254] [index_split_006.html#filepos1304263] Another interesting element of this story concerns its treatment in theAmerican news media. After the standard chuckles and woo-woo allusions, somereporters suggested that the object was an experimental military craft, possiblyassociated with nearby Scott Air Force Base. It is perfectly reasonable towonder about this. But left unasked was the obvious question: how could theobject fly as it did? That is, nearly silently, and with instant acceleration?It might not be a bad idea also to ask why the U.S. military might build anaircraft of such immense proportions? Forgetting the issue of extraterrestrials,these are simply questions of great public and scientific interest. Yet suchobvious questions have been unasked. Sadly, within the establishment-oriented media, so it has always been withsignificant UFO cases, including the triangle cases. I personally investigated an interesting triangle case that took place inKingston, Ontario, on January 24, 2003. The case was reported initially to theNational UFO Reporting Center. The witness had seen an absolutely perfectequilateral triangular craft with sharp, not rounded, corners, and lights ateach corner. She had been driving home from work and saw the object appear frombehind some trees and approach her position. Rolling down her car window andslowing to a near-stop, she leaned out and looked directly above, astonished.The object then glided in the direction of the Canadian Forces Base at Kingston.Again, we have a suggestive possibility that these triangles are somehowconnected with military operations. [images/00006.jpg]Illustration by witness of triangular object over Kingston, Ontario, January2003. Such a connection is probably real, but there are a number of UFO trianglesightings that are of a high strangeness nature. Some of these would seem to bebeyond the capabilities even of the black budget world. This was so even duringthe Hudson Valley sightings of the 1980s. Even so, it must be acknowledged thatthe capabilities of the black budget world may be quite advanced—indeed, I havespeculated about a so-called Breakaway Civilization. Thus, we are stillgrappling in the dark. Beyond a doubt, however, somebody is flying thesetriangles. Getting to the bottom of this issue could very well be an importantstep toward understanding the UFO issue in general. UFOs in the 21st Century Upon reviewing UFO sightings of the 21st century, it is striking just howmany good ones there have been. Especially puzzling and fascinating is a wave ofsightings in an area that is truly remote and quiet, and yet from 2002 to 2004was among the most active UFO hotspots on Earth, not merely for sightings ofcraft, but also apparent encounters with beings. This is an isolated region inBritish Columbia centered around the town of Houston. Unlike its giganticnamesake in Texas, Houston, British Columbia has a population of roughly twothousand. There has never been much happening there. Yet, for some reason,Houston and its surrounding region had an incredibly high number of sightings ofunusual and unconventional craft that have never been explained.[255][index_split_006.html#filepos1304782] Another wave of sightings was occurring at that time in the nation ofArgentina. Sightings of enormous cigar-shaped craft, stories of large well-litUFOs stopping cars and affecting electronics, and one from the late 1990s ofUFOs stealing water from an Argentine military base.[256][index_split_006.html#filepos1305152] One of the most important cases of the new century took place very close toWashington, D.C., on the night of July 25-26, 2002. A number of witnesses in anearby suburb saw what can only be described as a chase of multiple UFOs by atleast two F-16 aircraft. I interviewed two of these witnesses at length. Theincident was reported in the Washington Post, which published a tepid articlediscussing only the later part of the evening, when a solitary UFO was observedbeing chased by two F-16s. The article itself appears to have been publishedonly because a local radio station had already reported the incident. Yet, thearticle did describe an interesting fact: an unnamed Air Force spokespersonstated that not only did the object outperform the F-16s, but suddenlydisappeared from the radar. In other words, it had been tracked on radar, andthen just disappeared.[257] [index_split_006.html#filepos1305663] According toone of the witnesses, the object at one point descended at an eighty-degreeangle and then stopped, apparently waiting for the two F-16s to catch up,whereupon it zipped away. Another witness, a retired police officer, saw atleast two UFOs being chased by multiple F-16s. In his opinion, the UFOs weresubstantially larger than the F-16s. Recall that all of this was near thenation's Capitol in post-911 America, a serious violation of airspace. The year 2002 also offered very good photo and video UFO evidence. DuringOctober alone, three striking photographic or video images of UFOs wererecorded. On October 5, one person photographed what certainly looks like aflying triangle over Las Cruces, New Mexico. The incident was filed with theNational UFO Reporting Center. Actually, the photograph shows two unknownobjects, one of which is clearly triangular.[258][index_split_006.html#filepos1305965] On October 20, 2002, a very interesting photograph of a UFO was taken. Thephoto was of a saucer or disc type object clearly in the sky over some trees inthe town of Tyrone, Pennsylvania. It was investigated by researcher Stan Gordon,who found the witness to be sincere and the photograph to be genuine.[259][index_split_006.html#filepos1306248] Meanwhile, just one state over on the same day, a good video of a UFO wasrecorded in the city of Albany, New York. A cameraman with the local Foxtelevision station was at the Albany airport, recording stock video of aircrafttaking off and landing. After the video was brought back to the station’sstudio, it was noticed that a strange object of some sort had flown across theframe. Such objects have been recorded many times, and are typically referred toas rods. The object here was very long and thin, like a needle, with four shortappendages jutting out. There has been much debate over what these rods are.Many have argued, convincingly in some cases, that they are simply insectsflying close to the camera. [images/00003.jpg]Frame from the video of the object at the Albany airport, October 2002. Objectenlarged and seen more clearly in inset. Not everyone is convinced, however. In the case of the Albany rod, I havebeen able to find no insect matching its appearance. Moreover, an extendedanalysis of this video was done by optical physicist Dr. Bruce Maccabee.Although his analysis was inconclusive (he was unable to obtain the originaldigital copy of the video), he conceded the distinct possibility that the objectat one point went behind a cloud. Looking at the video, this appears to be thecase. Maccabee also left open the possibility that additional “noise” from thesecond-generation copy might have accounted for this. How much noise thisgenerates (if any) is a fair question. And where, we may ask, is the originaldigital recording? It turns out that the FBI has it. Immediately after the videowas shown on local television, the FBI asked for and received the original, sothat only copies are available to the rest of the world. I confess I have alwaysbeen baffled by the analysis conducted by New York's MUFON chapter, whichsomehow concluded the object was an insect.[260][index_split_006.html#filepos1306653] Quite a few interesting UFO videos have been recorded in the United Kingdom.One was shot in Lancashire on November 16, 2003, by a man named Martin H. (hislast name is unavailable). The full video is more than eight minutes long, andshows a bright, golden, spherical object in the sky. Eventually, it moves behinda cloud and is lost to sight. It certainly is not any recognizable aircraft.While its shape is circular, it does not behave like a balloon. Instead, itseems to move quite deliberately and looks as though it has an internal sourceof light.[261] [index_split_006.html#filepos1307274] Several excellent videos and photographs of UFOs appeared in 2004. One of mypersonal favorites was taken in Australia, on January 15, by a highway inspectorwho was photographing a railway crossing. Only later when he looked at the imageon his computer monitor did he notice a disc-shaped object in the upper rightportion of the photograph—a common occurrence. Many people have looked at thisimage and all that can be said is that the photograph is genuine. Somethingquite unusual was captured in the sky. Why is it, we may wonder, that there areso many instances of such objects being photographed when they are notseen?[262] [index_split_006.html#filepos1307593] Later that same year, the Mexican Air Force announced that one of itsaircraft had electronically recorded something in the air that was not seenvisually. That is, there appeared to be one or more aerial objects that wereinvisible. These were captured by two different electronic methods: airborneradar and forward looking infrared (FLIR). Something appears to been there.Skeptics immediately offered a variety of explanations, including geologicalstresses causing “Earth lights” and classified American craft. If the latter,the question remains how total invisibility was obtained.[263][index_split_006.html#filepos1307852] There are many more excellent cases from 2004 and 2005, not simply video andphoto, but attempted jet interceptions of UFOs, and much else that one canimagine. UFO Over O’Hare Airport Certainly, one of the most important UFO sightings of the 21st century so farhas been the Chicago O'Hare Airport incident of November 7, 2006. Indeed, thisparticular sighting can claim a great deal of responsibility for kickstartingincreased UFO media coverage which, as of this writing years later, has notabated. On that day, about a dozen employees of United Airlines saw an oval ordisc-shaped object hovering in the sky below the level of the clouds. The objectwas visible for roughly 15 minutes before it instantly accelerated and departed.According to the witnesses, it flew through the clouds so quickly that itpunched a hole in them that was visible for some time afterward. The employees at United were told not to discuss the matter. One of them,however, reported it to the National UFO Reporting Center. From there, the storymade it to the Chicago Tribune, which in turn led to the interview of about ahalf dozen other witnesses. Initially, United and the Federal AviationAdministration denied any knowledge of the incident, but each was forced torecant after it was clearly shown that they had been lying, following a Freedomof Information Act request by the Tribune.[264][index_split_006.html#filepos1308369] So, what object might hover over one of the busiest airports in the world?Could this have been a military test of some sort? This seems unlikely, butagain this is one reason we still use the phrase UFO. After all, the object wasunidentified. Unidentified, and certainly quite extraordinary. The NationalAviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP), which specializes inanalyzing UFO encounters by aviation professionals, soberly concluded that:> . . . a potentially significant air safety problem existed at O'Hare> International Airport on the afternoon of November 7, 2006. Anytime an> airborne object can hover for several minutes over a busy airport but not be> registered on radar or seen visually from the control tower, constitutes a> potential threat to flight safety.[265] [index_split_006.html#filepos1308852] And Over Stephenville, Texas The last spectacular American UFO account, at least which has receivedsubstantial media attention, took place on January 8, 2008 over central Texas,near the town of Stephenville. This may well be the most extraordinary of allAmerican cases from the 21st century, at least so far. Much evidence isavailable, both in witness testimony and in FAA radar records, indicating thatan extraordinary and large object was pursued by American F-16 fighter jets. Theobject was so large that one witness described it as a “flying Walmart.” Theobject came in at a very high speed, and then just stopped. One witness said itstopped directly above him, where it blocked out the entire sky. He saw a greatamount of detail of its underside. It then took off and was gone, pursued byfighter jets.[266] [index_split_006.html#filepos1309735] There are quite a few witnesses to this case. One of the extraordinary thingsabout it is that MUFON obtained FAA radar records for at least the initialportion of the event. These confirmed the presence of not simply one, butseveral unknown aerial objects in the area at that time. The radar records didnot indicate that U.S. jets attempted to intercept these objects, despite beingin their proximity. Even more interesting is that the records indicated that theobject’s last direction indicated it was moving toward the Crawford ranch. Thisis where President George W. Bush was residing at the time. Incredibly, the FAAsaid it had no additional records to offer.[267][index_split_006.html#filepos1310097] Incidentally, the Air Force, as it had always done, initially denied thatanything unusual had occurred. Not only did it deny any knowledge of UFOs nearStephenville, it denied that there were any F-16s in the area, as well.Eventually, however, it was forced to admit that there were some F-16s in thearea, but then claimed it was solely for a scheduled training exercise. TheMUFON investigation and files on this case are very good. They still await aproper documentary treatment and retelling that would do the case justice. Northern Canadian Military Encounter The following encounter came to me via an active duty Canadian soldier in2013. It is as-yet officially unconfirmed, but my interview with him wasextensive and I consider this a good case that has a likelihood of furtherconfirmation in the future. The event in question occurred in mid-January 2008 (precise dateundetermined), the same month as the UFO encounter at Stephenville, Texas,except that this event happened in one of the most remote places on Earth: theCanadian military base, CFS Alert. This is the most northern human habitation onthe planet, directly west of the northwest tip of Greenland, on the shoreline ofthe Arctic Ocean. The base was established during the 1950s as an electroniclistening post directed against Moscow and remains active today, particularly asa communications station for NATO’s nuclear submarines that patrol the area. Itis manned year-round by roughly fifty personnel. The closest habitation to it isAmerica’s Thule Air Base, 400 miles to the south, and the tiny village of GriseFiord (pop. 130) about 460 miles to the southwest. Beyond that, there is nothingin any direction for a thousand miles or more.[images/00049.jpg]Location of CFS Alert (circled). During the winter months, it is dark twenty-four hours a day. Weather isoften treacherous. For several days before the encounter, weather had been bad,and the men stayed inside. Finally, the weather cleared enough that the basecommander took ten or fifteen men outside for a constitutional hike and to getsome fresh air. The witness who related this event did not go outside, butstayed at the base and was in the cafeteria getting a meal. Large windows showeda black sky outside. Suddenly, outside the windows a bright light turned on, brighter thandaylight. The witness, and the other few men in the cafeteria at the time,assumed that someone had turned on floodlights for some reason, although itseemed very odd that lights would be on. For about ten minutes or so, itremained extremely bright, and then the light suddenly was gone. The mencontinued to eat their meal. A short while later, the men who had been outside returned to the base. Theirfaces expressed shock and bewilderment. Upon questioning several of them, it waslearned that when the men were less than a hundred yards from the base, they sawa metallic-looking cigar-shaped object silently glide from the south to aposition directly over the base, where it stopped. The object then shone anintensely bright beam of light onto the station. The men were astonished. Theyhad a very good view of it, seeing it clearly against the background of knownstructures and landscape, agreeing that its size was roughly 200 feet long. Thelight lasted for about ten minutes. Then the object began moving off to thenorthwest, directly over the ocean and was soon lost to view. The following day, the station received an unscheduled visit from a U.S. AirForce Colonel. The witness, who was good friends with the base commander, sawthe two of them talking in the cafeteria. He approached, said hello, and thenbrashly said, “You must be here because of our UFO sighting yesterday.” In frontof everyone present, and using some strong language, the colonel reprimanded thesoldier, tersely informing him that he was completely out of line and had noneed to know about any of this. Turning to the base commander he said, “getcontrol of your men,” and then walked out of the room. The colonel did not even spend the night, but flew out shortly afterwards. Afew days later, the base commander had the occasion to speak privately with thewitness, saying only that he was told by the colonel that the UFO event was “themost serious air space violation in the history of CFS Alert.” Several long conversations and much research by myself and the witness causedus to rule out any conventional explanation for this event. The range would bedaunting, nearly impossible, for any helicopter, and Thule would be the onlypossible candidate, although a helicopter flight from there would be little morethan a suicide mission, considering a range of 400 miles in blackness andquestionable weather. In any case, the object’s silence, shape, and continuedflight over the frozen Arctic sea clearly ruled out “helicopter.” Its ability tohover ruled out anything else we could think of. Whatever the origin of this craft, it appeared to show a definite interest inthe station, and may well have had a connection to the nuclear submarines withwhich the station regularly communicates. The Turkish UFO Videos For anyone interested in UFO videos, a quick search on YouTube will notdisappoint, at least in terms of quantity. Every week, someone asks me for myopinion about some UFO video. It is difficult to know which are legitimate. Onecase, however, that I have come to believe is genuine is actually a series ofvideos that were recorded at the coast of Turkey in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[images/00008.jpg]One still image (of many) of the object over the Sea of Marmara, Turkey. The videos look too good to be true, but the man who recorded them has beeninterviewed extensively, and a number of other people have confirmed the UFOs,including the respected American researcher, Dr. Roger Leir. This is an objectthat is not readily visible except as a moving light over the water. However,upon zooming in, a very definite shape of craft becomes evident. The quality ofvideo is excellent. A skeptical argument claims that it is nothing more than thereflection of lights from distant yachts on the water. However, no skepticalargument has been provided with any true technical or photometric analysis,while conversely supporting arguments have persuasively demonstrated that thealtitude of the light is far too high to be from any waterborne craft. Inaddition, the video is so clear that the argument of reflections of anywaterborne object surpasses the boundaries of even the most slavish credulity tothe established dogma: that UFOs cannot possibly exist.[268][index_split_006.html#filepos1310585] I think the Turkish videos are legitimate and I do not believe the craft isone of “ours.” Nevertheless, responsible researchers must leave the case openfor further research. How Deep Does This Go? Without question, the last twenty years have been full of UFO activity. Whenwe examine the sum total of what has been going on, it is mind-boggling. Interms of quality as well as quantity, the 21st century has seen an unrelentingwave of UFO activity and encounters with the extraordinary. The cases recounted in this chapter consist of a mere scratching of thesurface. There remains much more to discuss, and many more questions to ask. Whoare we dealing with? How strange does this phenomenon really get? Are peopleactually being taken and, if so, why? and how? Are they also having telepathicand even spiritual encounters with some of the beings from, shall we say,elsewhere? If so, what does it all mean? And, how do we hope to investigate thisphenomenon in a way that is both scientific and creative, in a way thatproductively grapples with this mystery? And what of the future? Will we beforever stuck in this netherworld of ignorance and cover-up? What happens if,and when, and after the secret comes out? The good news is that these are questions that will be treated for theremainder of this book. Chapter 8Contact and Abduction Studying UFO history and politics only begins the process of grappling withsome of the complex, mystifying, and at times disturbing elements of thephenomenon. When we really think about it, the fundamental issue is one ofcontact. That is, between us and them, whoever they happen to be. There is, of course, a school of thought arguing that the most credible UFOsightings are not extraterrestrial, but rather the product of secret terrestrialtechnology. From this perspective, the UFO phenomenon does not equal contactwith some variety of Other. Yet, I suggest that the idea of human contact withOthers has much logic to it, and good evidence as well. Where the Rubber Meets the Road Over the decades, or even centuries, the claims of contact have been many.People have described their experiences with beings that are not human andsurely do not appear to come from here. Frequently, although not always, thesehave been in connection with UFO sightings. Evaluating these claims is tricky.Yet, if we are to have any understanding of this critically importantphenomenon, we must consider them carefully. Some are easier to study than others. Cases that involve clear witnesstestimony, especially including multiple witnesses, are nice to have. Physicalevidence, whether in the form of marks on the body, implants, or other types oftrace evidence, are obviously helpful. These are some of the classic hallmarksof what we would call alien abduction. Also quite prevalent, although even more difficult to assess, are claims ofcommunication with extraterrestrial intelligences, sometimes while in thephysical presence of actual beings, and sometimes purely telepathic with noapparent beings present.[269] [index_split_006.html#filepos1310913] Often thishas been seamlessly integrated with other forms of channeling, involvingentities from other dimensions, other periods of time, and various distantplaces. Such claims have spiked significantly since around 1990. Several questions naturally arise. First, are the claims and encountersconsistent? If they are, then to what extent is any consistency explainable as acultural phenomenon and essentially a situation of people copying from eachother? Is there evidence that some of these channelers are sincere? Or hoaxing?If sincere, is there evidence that they are correct or accurate? Not everyonewho follows such channelers seems to care about such things as scientificevidence. There is, in fact, a powerful philosophical divide within the UFOresearch community reflected in these questions. More on this later. Therefore, let us explore both sides of contact: abductions on the one hand,intentional contact on the other. In many ways, perhaps fundamentally, these areentirely different phenomena. Still, we shall consider the possibility that theymay be two sides of the same coin. What follows is a brief historical overview of how some of these encountersevolved over time. But it is important to stress that encounters continue tothis day. Many researchers are actively investigating them, trying to untanglethe threads of reality from those of dream and fantasy. Contact vs. Abduction Contact and abduction have each been described as physical and non-physicalevents. Generally speaking, however, claims of alien abduction are most oftenperceived and described as physical events. That is, in most cases, a personseems to be taken physically from one place, is brought to another placewhereupon things are done to that person, and then he or she is returned at theend. It may well be that what we think of as physical abductions are morecomplicated than mere “physical” events. Essentially, however, most allegedalien abductions seem to be physical events, and have to do, at least in part,with our physical bodies. Such is not always the case regarding alleged contactees. During the 1950sand 1960s, it was fairly common for people to claim physical contact withbenevolent extraterrestrial races. Nearly all of these claims involvedextraterrestrials that looked entirely human, and who were mostly concerned withprotecting mankind and the universe from the danger of atomic weapons. Later,the concerns shifted to the threat posed to Earth's ecosystem by mankind. Such claims of physical contact continue to this day. More recently, however,and roughly parallel to the rise of the New Age movement from the 1970s onward,there has an additional emphasis on claims of nonphysical, channeled contactwith extraterrestrials, or sometimes even humans of the future. Of all suchcases, none have risen to the level of scientific evidence (more generously, weadd that the scientific community has not made an effort to investigate theseclaims). However, there is certainly no shortage of detail, often very rich, inthe statements of some of these channelers. That makes them very interesting,and for some people, quite compelling. There is another difference between abduction and contact encounters. This isin the perceived motivations and actions of these other beings. Overall(emphasizing that I am painting with rather broad strokes here), people who haveexperienced apparent alien abductions have been more likely to see the event asa negative or disturbing experience. Not always, but in general. Typically, people with apparent abduction experiences feel traumatized bytheir memories. Whatever else we say about the UFO/ET phenomenon, there is agreat deal of pain and suffering associated with abduction. This is made worsethan many other types of trauma, simply because the victim feels constrainedfrom discussing it openly, often not even with family members. Such men andwomen go through their lives doing their best simply to put this piece of theirlife in as remote and tiny a corner of their minds as possible. On the other side of the coin, those who claim to be channelers ofextraterrestrial intelligences nearly always interpret those entities in apositive or benevolent light. The beings, whether they be the Pleiadians, AshtarCommand, Bashar, or the plentitude of other allegedly channeled entities, arenearly always interpreted as helpers of humanity. Typically, they seek toelevate human consciousness enough so that we might enter the greater galacticcommunity. This idea has gone through its own evolution during the last fewdecades. The result is that we have, in a sense, two political parties within thecommunity of people interested in UFOs. One might see them as the Good ET andthe Bad ET parties. A bit simplistic, perhaps, but a fair generalization whenlooking at the big picture. Alien Abductions: Birth of an Idea One interesting point historically is that, for quite some time, alienabductions were not believed to be real. Indeed, with few exceptions, no form ofextraterrestrial contact was accepted by either the general public or UFOresearchers during the entire decade of the 1950s, and most of the 1960s. A fewresearchers began to consider the possibility more seriously during the 1970s,but it was not until Budd Hopkins published his first book, Missing Time, in1981, that the phenomenon came to prominence, first among researchers and thenaround the world. Upon reflection, this lag in acceptance should not surprise us. All importantideas need time to be accepted. Usually they meet with some resistance along theway, sometimes a great deal of resistance. In the case of abductions, it was notso much that researchers changed their opinions as that they died off and a newgeneration of researchers replaced them. This is the pattern with all importantnew ideas. The UFO phenomenon is so complex, representing technologies and realities sofar beyond our normal understanding, that it was not possible for the generationof the 1950s to dive into that ocean and swim in the depths, not without firstlearning to swim. For the more we learn, the more complex this subject becomes. There were, in fact, a few encounter cases during the 1950s that came to theattention of researchers. A few of them even appear to have been genuineabductions. However, little to no investigation was done. Such cases just seemedtoo fantastic to merit study, but one also suspects that researchers simply didnot know how to proceed. The best known of those cases, and most interesting of that decade, is thatof the Brazilian farmer, Antonio Villas Boas. He claimed to have been takenaboard a craft on October 16th 1957 where he was forced to have sex with asomewhat human-looking female, and then to have been deposited back on his farmafterward. It was implied by his alien lover that the purpose of their tryst wasfor her to become pregnant and to raise their child in space. His story hascertain similarities to later abduction cases. The forced sexual encounter is abit more rare, although the Peter Khoury encounter, discussed in the lastchapter, may have been similar. As interesting as the Boas story is, all we haveis his detailed written testimony and statements over the following years. Whilesome have doubted his veracity, he may well have been telling the truth. Theproblem is that he was the sole witness to this extraordinary event and noresearch for trace physical evidence, or anything else, was done at the time. Assuch, the case will always be considered problematic.[270] The Hill Abduction Case The most important abduction case, in terms of its historical impact, was the1961 encounter of American New Hampshire residents Betty and Barney Hill. It wasthe first abduction to receive an investigation not only by UFO researchers, butalso by an internationally respected psychiatrist. That man, Dr. Benjamin Simon,conducted many hypnotic regression sessions on each of them. There is a greatdeal to work here to enable researchers to reconstruct what appears to havehappened. The case is also important because it was the true pioneer case forthis topic. The Hill abduction was the first to gain widespread media attention.It enabled other researchers to follow up and investigate other apparentabduction cases. On the night of September 19, 1961, the Hills were driving back from avacation to Canada. Their route took them through New Hampshire along US Route3. They expected to get home by around 2:30 a.m., perhaps 3 a.m. at the latest.Along the way, they were puzzled by an object in the sky. It seemed to moveunpredictably towards them. Barney, always a strict rationalist and non-believerin UFOs, assumed it was a satellite, then perhaps a star, and then a commercialaircraft. Betty was not persuaded. Through binoculars, she saw the objectsilhouetted against the moon. It seemed to be a UFO. Barney continued driving. All the while, the object almost seemed to betracking them, several times changing speed. When their dog in the back seatbegan to whine, they looked up and realized the object had descended to just afew hundred feet away from them. What they saw was a large structured craft withdouble rows of windows. Both of them now had no question of what they wereseeing. Both were terrified. Barney stopped the car in the middle of the road and got out. He walkedtoward the craft, possibly to within one hundred feet of it. Betty screamedafter him, but he did not hear her. When he got close enough, he saw a doublerow of windows and at least six figures inside. They seemed to be wearinguniforms and staring directly at him. At this point, the memories of both became blurred. All Barney could rememberwas running back to the car, screaming. Now driving again, the two heard astrange beeping sound, and they seemed to become drowsy. After more time hadpassed, the beeping repeated itself and they were fully alert. The car was stillmoving. Finally, at 5 a.m., they arrived home. For quite a while, a great deal of anxiety affected both of them. Barney, whowas an impeccable dresser, noticed that the tops of his shoes were scuffed. Thathad never happened before. There were also strange circular marks on their car.For the next few nights, Betty was haunted by intense, exceptionally vividdreams of non-human beings taking them away. Eventually, she wrote to DonaldKeyhoe of the National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP).Still, the case did not gain much traction until several years later when, atchurch meetings, they began discussing their incident. Two attendees, whohappened to be in the U.S. Air Force, subtly encouraged the Hills to undergohypnotic regression. Eventually, the couple began seeing Dr. Benjamin Simon, oneof the world’s leading experts in hypnotic regression and, interestingly, aleading doctor and officer at the U.S. Army's chief psychiatric center duringWorld War II. This military connection to the case remains very interesting. Itcertainly leads one to wonder if what really had happened to the Hills was amilitary abduction, and not an alien one.[images/00048.jpg]Betty and Barney Hill. Simon's sessions with the Hills lasted from January to June, 1964. Duringmost of this time not only did each not know what the other’s session hadrevealed, but neither patient was even aware of their own regressions. Not untilthey were nearing the end of treatment did Simon stop inducing amnesia followingeach session. The extraordinary transcripts are readily available throughvarious books and websites. This even includes the audio recordingsthemselves.[271] [index_split_006.html#filepos1312240] In short, Betty and Barney both independently recalled being taken out oftheir car by a small group of beings that did not look human, but were humanoid.The beings even wore clothing and uniforms. Barney recalled a physicalexamination, one that was rather intrusive: he was made to lie down on a table,a cup was placed over his groin, and his semen seems to have been extracted.Skin scrapings were taken, his ears and throat were examined, and a device wasinserted into his rectum. Betty recalled comparable elements. Her skin was scraped, a sample of herhair was taken, as were fingernail clippings. Her mouth, throat, ears, and handswere studied. She laid down on an exam table, and one of the procedures involveda needle being inserted into her navel, something, although she was not pregnantat the time, like amniocentesis. Before leaving, she communicated with theleader, later believing that this was done telepathically. She asked if shecould bring something back to prove her experience, and the leader seemed toagree. She picked up a large book with strange symbols, but was forced to returnit when other crew members objected. Then she asked the leader where he wasfrom. He went to a wall and pulled down a strange map of space, showing manystars connected by broken or solid lines, all curved. The lines, he said,represented expeditions. Then he told her she was going to forget all about thisencounter. It was not until 1966 that the Hill case was written about in the form of abook, called Interrupted Journey, by journalist John Fuller. From this point,the case began to receive attention not only from UFO researchers, but thegeneral public at large. Without a doubt, Betty and Barney both presentedthemselves in a very positive and credible manner. No one ever seriouslyconsidered them to have been hoaxing. The question comes down to whether or nottheir memories were accurate. Dr. Benjamin Simon, for his part, did not believein UFOs or extraterrestrials, and suggested that Betty's initial dreams hadinspired Barney's account, which was simply a confabulated fantasy. The Hillsnever believed this. Barney said that he wished the whole thing had been nothingmore than a hallucination. To this day, arguments over alleged alien abduction boil down to this matter.Are the memories accurate or not? The Herb Schirmer Abduction Another interesting early case, one which has been somewhat forgotten, tookplace on December 3, 1967 to a young police officer named Herb Schirmer, ofAshland, Nebraska. On the job at 2:30 a.m., he noticed an object on the roadwith flickering lights. Thinking it was a truck, he flashed his high beams. Tohis surprise, the object took off. His police report read: “saw a flying saucerat the junction of highways 6 and 63. Believe it or not.” He could not sleepthat night; a strong headache and buzzing noise in his head kept him awake. Thenext day, he noticed a red welt just below his left ear. Schirmer also realized that there was twenty minutes of time that he couldnot account for. He soon met with Wyoming psychologist, Dr. Leo Sprinkle, toundergo hypnotic regression. That was when Schirmer recalled some missingdetails of his encounter. First, his radio and car engine had died. Then, somesort of white object came out of the UFO. Then it communicated with himtelepathically. Schirmer was unable to draw his gun. Somehow he had gotten theinformation that the craft belonged to a sister ship and that the occupants werebased in our solar system but originated from another galaxy. They were here toprevent humans from destroying the Earth. Later, Schirmer underwent a second hypnosis, which gave more information. Henow described the object as metallic, football shaped, and glowing. He wanted toleave, but something in his mind stopped him. Beings came out of the craftwearing coveralls with an image of a winged serpent. They shot a greenish gastoward the car, flashed a bright light at him and then he passed out. When he woke up, one of the beings asked him, “Are you the watchman over thisplace?” They pointed to the power plant and asked if that was the only source ofpower. They took him aboard and he saw control panels and computer-likemachines. They told him they came from a nearby galaxy, had bases in the UnitedStates, that the aircraft was operated by electromagnetism, that they drew powerfrom large water reservoirs, and that radar and ionization disrupted thefunctioning of their ships. They told him they had been observing Earth for along time and would contact more people. Then they said, “You will not speakwisely about this night. We will return to see you two more times.” Schirmer drew a picture of the Being he best remembered, which may havelooked slightly odd, but entirely human, although about a foot shorter than mostadult males. Yet, this was no gray alien. Although Leo Sprinkle believed in thebasic truthfulness of Schirmer's account, the story was still too far out formost researchers, who dismissed it at the time as a fantasy. What strikes onetoday is how comparatively tame it is compared with many more recent abductionstories.[272] [index_split_006.html#filepos1312774] The Charles Moody Abduction During the summer and fall of 1975, a great deal of UFO activity was reportedin the Western United States. It was a time of many violations of airspacearound U.S. bases, numerous sightings of unidentified black helicopters, reportsof cattle mutilation, and a few fascinating abduction cases. One concerned an Air Force sergeant named Charles Moody. On the night ofAugust 12/13, 1975, Moody was working his shift at Holloman Air Force Base inAlamogordo, New Mexico. When his shift ended, he decided he would view thePerseid meteor shower. Just after midnight he drove a short way out of town,into the quiet night country of the American southwest. The meteor shower was not especially captivating, but Moody saw somethingelse. An object about fifty feet in diameter descended from the sky and hoveredjust off the ground. He watched it glow, wobble, then make a buzzing sound, amere three hundred feet away. Through a window in the craft, he saw humanoidforms moving around. Frightened, he returned to his car, but the battery wasdead. Then the buzzing stopped and he felt an odd sense of calm as he watchedthe object ascend into the sky. The only problem was that he had losteighty-five minutes, and could not understand how he arrived home as late as 3a.m., where his wife was waiting for him. The next day, Moody experienced lower back pain. He wondered what hadhappened. Over the next week this pain worsened and he developed a rash on hislower body. Eventually, local UFO researchers interviewed him, including formerAir Force Colonel Wendell Stevens, and James and Coral Lorenzen, leaders ofAPRO, a major UFO organization at the time. Before Moody even met with anypsychiatrist, a physician friend of his suggested a method of self-hypnosis, andthis appeared to uncover more memories. Moody began to remember his captors.They were, as he put it, “very much like us.” Perhaps like humans, but then again, not exactly. Their heads were larger andhairless, the ears and nose were very small, their eyes somewhat larger, and themouth had very thin lips. Moody said they were very patient with him, as heremembered fighting with the beings before being taken, which might account forhis soreness. They used a kind of light or sound frequency to disable him, andthen he found himself on a table in a very clean environment. They also seemedto communicate with him telepathically. Moody even gained some information from his captors. Their main craft, theysaid, was four hundred miles above the Earth, and this ship was used forobserving. He was told that several races from different places were workingtogether. Radar was a problem for their craft, as it sometimes jammed theirnavigation. Apparently, they also told him that in the near future, there wouldbe contact made with humanity on a limited basis. This might be roughly twentyyears in the future: only then, after deep consideration by them, perhapshumanity would be accepted. Of course, this would have been around 1995. Perhaps they changed theirplans. Or, perhaps they did make limited, quiet contact. Or somehow CharlesMoody got it all wrong. Or perhaps the beings purposely gave theatricallymisleading information.[273] [index_split_006.html#filepos1313353] Fire In the Sky: Travis Walton The abduction of Travis Walton, often known as the Fire in the Sky case,[274][index_split_006.html#filepos1313934] may be the single most famous alienabduction event ever. Like the Betty and Barney Hill case, there is much todigest. Also like that case, we find ourselves wanting to know more about thecaptors themselves. Still, what information we have is certainly intriguing. Like the Moody case three months earlier, this incident occurred amid a waveof truly awe-inspiring and serious violations of U.S. airspace by unknownobjects. It happened on November 5, 1975, in a national forest northeast ofPhoenix, Arizona. Travis was a member of a six-man logging crew that wasfinishing up a day of work. He was just 22 years old at the time. Around 6:15 p.m., the men left the worksite and began the drive down thelogging road toward home. Then, all seven saw a glowing, silver object hoveringnot far above the ground. No one saw the object move—it simply was there. It wasnot especially large, they estimated perhaps fifteen feet in diameter and abouteight feet high. It had complicated markings on it, and it seemed to light upthe area. Walton was riding in the front passenger seat, and impulsively leftthe truck to walk toward the craft. It wobbled a bit, then struck him directlyon the chest with a beam of bluish white light. According to men in the truck,the beam lifted him into the air. Then he was knocked back and fell to theground. His friends panicked and drove off in terror. They assumed Travis was deadand that they were going to be next. After a few minutes, however, they regainedenough composure to drive back. Travis was gone, and so was the object. The menheaded back to town and immediately reported this to the police, who brought asearch party and tracking dogs. No physical evidence was found. Police wonderedif Travis Walton had been murdered by his coworkers.[images/00035.jpg]Illustration of the Walton abduction experience. For five days, Travis Walton was nowhere to be seen, despite policehelicopters, mounted police, jeeps, and tracking dogs combing through the area.Under suspicion of murder, the crew members took polygraph examinations. The menall passed, with the exception of one man whose result was “inconclusive” andwho later admitted hiding an unrelated criminal record. Still, the examinerstated the results were conclusive, proving that these men did see an objectthey believed to be a UFO, and that they did not injure or murder Travis. Consider what it means that each of these men passed a polygraph testattesting to a UFO striking Travis Walton. Then consider the likelihood that allsix could fool the test, and the most reasonable conclusion is that these mensaw what they claimed to have seen. Late on the night of November 10, Travis Walton reappeared. He made a phonecall from a phone booth, and when his brother and a friend came to him, he wasstill in the booth, looking exhausted, confused, and with a heavy growth ofbeard. He still wore the same clothing from the night he had disappeared. What followed upon Walton's return was nothing short of a circus,characterized by tremendous press coverage and the inevitable debate betweenskeptics and believers. Walton took two polygraph tests. On the first one, thepolygraph examiner said he failed. However, in the interest of fairness, it mustbe said that it was an incompetent and antagonistic polygraph examination. Thequestioner interrupted Walton twenty-eight times during the questioning, and atone point berated him when Walton was confused about dates, actually saying tohim, “Where have you been, in a vacuum?” It certainly appeared that heintentionally asked Walton embarrassing and irrelevant questions in order tocreate conditions more likely to produce a negative result. This is especiallydisturbing if we consider that, if Walton’s story was true, he had just gonethrough the most harrowing experience of his life. Years later, an investigator who had been skeptical of the abduction arrangedfor another polygraph test for Walton and two of his co-workers (including theone who had originally tested inconclusively). All three passed. What exactly did Travis Walton remember? His recollections involved two kinds of beings. One of these looked human,the other did not. First, he was examined in a white room by hairless, non-humanbeings in tight-fitting blue clothing. They made no sound. They held him downwhen he tried to get up, and he even took a swing at one of them, although inhis weakened state this did not amount to much. After this, the creatures simplyleft the room. Travis then got up and went into another room which contained achair. He sat in it and pressed some buttons on the arms of the chair, at whichpoint the ceiling slid back and he saw stars going by. A human-looking being,wearing a helmet, entered the room. He smiled and silently escorted Travis to alarge room where he saw a parked spacecraft. Other people were there, all ofthem with long hair. They placed an oxygen mask on Travis's face and, the nextthing he knew, he was lying on the pavement on the highway. He saw the UFO abovehim, hovering. Then it shot away, and he made his telephone call. Considering that he was gone for five days, it is remarkable how littleTravis Walton remembered. What exactly happened to him? It might very well be that Walton was unconscious for most of that time.After all, he was struck with an intense blue beam in the chest and knocked out.Years later, Travis offered his own opinion that he was struck unintentionallyor by accident and may well have been near-death. He would then have been takenaboard so that his life could be saved and the awful mistake rectified.[275][index_split_006.html#filepos1314126] It is also interesting that Travis recalled both human and nonhuman entities.How could it be, one might ask, that humans would be working alongside aliens inthe operation of UFOs? Perhaps it would not be so unusual if we consider thatother beings had taken to breeding their own stock of humans, presumablyenhancing and tweaking them as they like. After enough generations overcenturies or millennia, it would be obvious that the humans working with anothercivilization would seem nearly as incomprehensible to us as the aliensthemselves. While this is pure speculation, with a phenomenon as strange asUFOs, perhaps it is not so outrageous, after all.[276][index_split_006.html#filepos1314333] The Andreasson Affair By the late 1970s, more and more alleged abductees were describing smallaliens with large heads and eyes and no hair, who communicated by telepathy.Some of these beings looked rather human, sometimes entirely so. Exactly whatthe so-called alien agenda might have been was still a matter of debate, but itappeared at the least to be some sort of information gathering effort, withabductions being part of that. Overall, the aliens seemed to be lacking in whatmost of us would consider an upbeat personality, but they also did not appear tobe especially dangerous. Some even appeared to be somewhat benevolent. In 1979, Raymond Fowler, a serious and experienced UFO researcher, publisheda book about the experiences of a woman named Betty Andreasson. He organized aseries of hypnotic regressions for Betty, a deeply religious woman who had beenexperiencing abductions since at least the 1960s. These sessions produced adetailed story of interaction with creatures with gray skin, large heads,cat-like eyes, tiny mouths, three fingered hands, and dark blue uniforms.[277][index_split_006.html#filepos1314874] They moved by gliding and communicatedtelepathically. In 1967, several of these beings entered her home through asolid door. They “switched off” all of the family members except for Betty andher daughter. Then, they took Betty to their ship, leaving her daughter behindbut somehow “frozen.” Betty was examined. A needle was inserted into her nose and head, but withoutany physical pain. Somehow, she was transported to an alien realm, whetherphysically or by means of mind control. She went through tunnels, saw a red andthen green atmosphere, strange creatures and plants, and pyramid-likestructures. She also encountered other types of beings, including golden-haired, robedfigures, perfectly human looking. She was given a message focusing on love andnature. Humans were destroying the Earth, she was told. The beings could not lethumanity go down its current path. They gave her a vision of a Phoenix risingfrom the ashes of its own destruction, which seemed to symbolize humanity’sability to survive the dangerous times ahead. They also indicated to her thatthey shared her belief in the sacredness of Jesus Christ. He was coming soon,they said. Interpreting this has been extremely difficult. This event took place nearlyfifty years ago at the time of this writing. There is certainly no evidence thatits prediction has come to pass. Of course, the word “soon” is subject tointerpretation. It seems that Betty Andreasson and Ray Fowler were sharing thisinformation honestly. Yet we may ask to what extent her recollections, andFowler’s retelling of them, were influenced by their pre-existing belief system,as both were very devout Christians? To what extent were those recollectionsclouded or managed by the aliens themselves? Can we expect alien entities to beentirely, or even mainly, truthful? None of these questions are easily answered. Enter Budd Hopkins Consider the field of UFO and ET research in 1980. The UFO phenomenon hadbeen out in the open for more than thirty years. And yet, abductions, somethingthat may well be at the heart of whatever this phenomenon is all about, was onlyjust beginning to be investigated, much less understood. That is a great deal ofactivity occurring in a nearly completely clandestine manner, which is onereason why the work of Budd Hopkins is so important. In 1981, he published Missing Time, probably the single most important bookin all of abduction research. That is because Hopkins, after many one-on-onemeetings with abductees, argued that the abduction phenomenon was not simply arandom occurrence. It was not simply a case of being in the wrong place at thewrong time, at least not normally. Instead, his research pointed to somethingquite disturbing: that most abductees were taken multiple times for years andyears, starting in their youth, if not infancy. Abduction was a recurrent,albeit largely hidden, feature of their lives. Even more upsetting still, thephenomenon appeared to run in families. Hopkins speculated that there wassomething important to these beings about certain genetic lines. He did not express these ideas cavalierly. Hopkins was a careful interviewerof people. In the early years, he did not lead the hypnotic regression sessions,but instead relied on certified hypnotherapists, most prominently Dr. AphroditeClamar, under whom he trained for seven years. Hopkins himself developedoutstanding skills at conducting hypnotic regressions, and even trained HarvardPsychologist, Dr. John Mack (who stated that Hopkins’ skills in hypnotherapyexceeded his own). Everyone fortunate enough to have known Hopkins, as I did,agreed that his kindness and bravery brought comfort to many distraught people.More to the point, Hopkins was careful, conscientious, and explicitly avoidedleading his clients into preconceived conclusions. Many transcripts of hissessions are available in his books. Hopkins’ work implied that abductions are a widespread operation involvingsignificant resources, presumably for something considered to be of greatimportance to these other beings. That gives the phenomenon an ominous feeling,even if not necessarily evil. After all, no matter how extensive and potentiallyimportant abductions may be, it is easy to see why alien entities would wish toconceal what was going on from humanity. If abductions were or are as widespread as Hopkins believed, we have aphenomenon that, if revealed publicly, could shatter millions of people. If itis true, and of the dimensions believed by Hopkins, it could easily become themost politically explosive topic not only in the US, but globally. Into the Darkness Budd Hopkins was not the only important abduction researcher of the last fewdecades of the twentieth century. In the early 1990s, Temple Universityhistorian Dr. David Jacobs become deeply involved in abduction research. He hasmade several important contributions."},{"pageContent":" His book, Secret Life, published in 1992, was the first attempt to organizethe abduction process into distinct episodes. He did this based on a closeanalysis of three hundred hypnotic regression sessions he conducted from sixtyindividuals. Jacobs uncovered many consistencies, both broad and arcane, amongpeople who had not shared their information before, many of whom were ignorantof abduction research. The abductors were typically less than four feet tall, with large bald heads,huge dark eyes, no ears, and a slit-like mouth—in other words, Grays. Theseabductors took great care to take their subjects in a covert manner, when theywould not be missed. Frequently, they would place a screen memory into the mindof the abductee, often an unusual owl, deer, or other type of animal. The personwould be under complete neurological control, unable to move a muscle unless theabductors allowed it. They would often be floated through closed doors andwindows, or even walls and ceilings. Jacobs admitted that this seemedimpossible. Yet, he argued, somehow these beings had figured out a way of doingit, while also rendering themselves and the abductees invisible. Abductees would typically be brought into rooms that seemed designed for thepurpose of studying humans. They would be undressed and made to lie down on acentral table. A physical examination would follow, lasting no more than twentyminutes. If the person had been previously abducted, any changes in the body,such as scars or even braces on teeth, would be examined by the aliens. Near theend of the experience, the beings would implant a small, metallic object intothe abductee through the nose or ear, or else remove a previously implantedobject. Communication between abductees and these aliens was always telepathic.Throughout the process a being slightly taller than the others would calm theabductee by staring into his or her eyes. Jacobs coined the term “Mindscan” todescribe how the tall alien would peer into the mind of the abductee. Throughthe various recollections, it almost seemed as if the procedure were suckingthoughts and memories out of the abductee’s consciousness. Frequently, theabductee would be given reassuring statements, such as,“You are very special tous.” Sperm would be collected from men, eggs and fetuses from women. Many femaleabductees reported having fertilized eggs inserted into them, while others whowere already pregnant had their implanted embryo extracted. It also appearedthat abductees were targeted in their childhood and mined of genetic andreproductive material throughout their lives. All this information, drawn with consistency from abductees, led Jacobs toconclude that these abductees were living “a secret life,” one that was beingexploited by a secret alien group operating on Earth. These beings, heconcluded, are not here to help us, nor are they here for scientific inquiry.They are pursuing their own agenda, which is the creation of a human-alienhybrid species. As Jacobs put it: “We have been invaded. This is not anoccupation, but it is an invasion. At present we can do little or nothing tostop it.”[278] [index_split_006.html#filepos1315094] Unsurprisingly, there have been critics. Several countered that, despite hiswell-put together study, Jacobs did not give much attention to earth-boundexplanations for abductions, such as “hysterical contagion, psychogenic fuguestates, temporal-lobe dysfunction, and the like.”[279][index_split_006.html#filepos1315410] More fundamental are criticisms about thevalue of hypnotic regression at all. Many times, careful regression, which isoften no more than a state of deep relaxation, can indeed help to recovergenuine memories. But there does remain the danger of unintentionalconfabulation: the creation of a detailed scenario that never happened. Humanmemory is powerful and often accurate, but not always. After all, even withoutany leading questions, it is possible that the consciousness of thehypnotherapist can influence at least some patients. Therein lies the problem.Are these uncovered memories accurate? On the other side of it, however, can wereally believe that Jacobs was so able to influence his sixty hypnotic subjectsthat all of them reported fundamentally the same type of scenario? Granted, ahypnotherapist might possess some influence over what the subject recalls, but .. . that much? A few years after writing A Secret Life, Jacobs wrote an even more disturbinganalysis, appropriately titled, The Threat.[280][index_split_006.html#filepos1315733] Here, he delved more deeply into theapparent alien plans to infiltrate humanity by creating a hybrid race andreplacing humans as Earth's dominant species. By now, his research pointed todecidedly psychopathic personalities held by many of these hybrids. Again, allof this is drawn from the individual recollections of interaction with aliensthrough regressive hypnosis. The book is disturbing, and indeed Jacobs himselfwas disturbed by it. Understandably, the most normal human reaction upon readingit would be to hope that he is wrong. Once again, much of the issue comes down to the reliability of hypnoticregression. We know that regression can cut both ways: to help someone findrepressed truth and inadvertently create false memories. The latter can happennot merely through direct mind manipulation techniques, something that has beenstudied in detail for many years, but also simply during the course of ordinarylife. People do misremember things. The pertinent question here is whether thepractitioners of hypnotic regression have been guilty, whether intentionally ornot, of influencing the memories of the people they have regressed. It may be impossible at present to give a clear, quantifiable, answer to thatquestion. On a personal level, having known Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, andother individuals who have practiced hypnotic regression, as well as having seena number of regressions occur, I believe that the best practitioners areprofessional and do not unduly influence their subjects. But no one knows withcomplete certainty where the actual memory ends and confabulation begins. It is helpful, however, to remember that many people do not need hypnosis torecall their apparent alien encounters. There have always been a certain numberof experiences that are remembered spontaneously, sometimes immediately,sometimes a bit later. For most of these people, there is no question of thestrength of their conviction, and often of the clarity of the memory itself. Sowe have a phenomenon that, despite all efforts of skeptics to debunk and dismissit, is more complex than any single explanation, or even several explanationscan provide. Alien Implants One criticism leveled by skeptics of alien abduction is the lack of evidenceto examine. In fact, there are claims of evidence, in the form of body marks andextracted implants. Quite a few people have described seeing odd marks on theirbodies following either an evening of disturbing UFO-related dreams, or othersigns like waking up with drops of blood on the pillow. There are a great manyphotographs of such body marks, many of which are in an equilateral trianglepattern of red dots on the wrist or near the ankle. Also common are “scoopmarks,” in which it appears as if a small amount of tissue was removed frombeneath the skin, leaving an indentation. When I visited Budd Hopkins on oneoccasion, he showed me a large collection of photographs he had received frompeople showing him such marks on their bodies. In some cases people have gone missing, and concerned friends or relativeshave called the police, especially in cases when the missing person was veryyoung. At some point, the person would simply reappear from a room that had beenthoroughly searched. There are police records that verify these events, some ofwhich were discussed in Hopkins’ book, Sight Unseen.[281][index_split_006.html#filepos1316035] More interesting still are extracted implants. Implants are widely reportedby abductees, especially via regressive hypnosis. According to the memories ofthe individuals, these tiny devices are usually inserted through the nose intothe sinus cavity, or behind the eye, or in some other part of the body, such asthe foot. There has been much speculation about the purpose of these implants.Clearly, they could be useful for tracking a subject, or even serving asstorehouses of information, much as veterinarians today retrieve medical data ontagged animals. Could they even be used as a form of behavioral or mentalmodification? There are a number of alleged alien implants that have been extracted frompeople. The person best known for this has been Dr. Roger Leir. Over the years,he has performed more than fifteen surgeries that removed sixteen separate anddistinct objects. These have been investigated by several prestigiouslaboratories, including Los Alamos National Laboratories, New Mexico Tech, andothers. At the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on April 20, 2009, Roger Leirgave an update on his work. He described the various implants he had extractedfrom people, all roughly the same size, and seven of which were so identical toeach other that, as he said: “You could line them up on a surgical drape . . .[and] not be able to tell one from the other.” The objects were typically just afew millimeters long to as long as a centimeter, and as thin as pencil lead.Leir was amazed during each surgery by the lack of inflammation or rejectionreaction in any of the subjects. In his view, this is impossible with ourcurrent, known technology. No point of entry was visible, nor was any scarring.Each implant had a very tough, biological type of coating, which presumablyaccounted for the lack of inflammation. This coating, said Leir, was so toughthat a surgical blade could not cut through it.[282][index_split_006.html#filepos1316363] But Leir, a medical doctor, was not qualified to comment on the metallicobjects inside these implants. For this press conference, he was accompanied byDr. Alex Mosier, whose Ph.D. is in physical chemistry. Mosier and Lier studiedone implant in great detail, using a battery of tests. Several fascinatingfeatures stood out. First, the object had certain things in common with meteorite fragments, butalso interesting differences. It had certain metals common to meteorites, suchas Gallium, Germanium, Platinum, Ruthenium, Rhodium, and Iridium. But, ofcourse, why would identical-looking meteor fragments be embedded inside so manydifferent people, without having caused pain or inflammation? Mosier also sawsomething very interesting. He noted “a deviation of nickel from terrestrialratios that the analysis lab couldn't explain.” In other words, he wassuggesting that the implant contained nickel with an isotopic ratio not found onEarth. Second, the object contained nanofibers very similar in appearance to carbonnanotubes. This is something no meteoric sample has ever been observed to have.This suggests engineering and manufacture. As Mosier put it, “You don't findthese things in nature. They have to be processed, engineered, and they're noteasy to make.\" Third, sodium chloride—that is, salt crystals—were detected, but in a veryunusual shape and configuration. Mosier believed that this also suggestedengineering. Finally, and very striking, the object was magnetic. It gave off a radiofrequency in the range of 14.7 MHz. To Mosier: “the combination of all this data indicates some kind of unusualengineering within this object. Elemental analysis indicates it's likelynon-terrestrial. It could be meteoric, possibly. It could be something else.” Something else seems more likely, especially considering the presence of whatappear to be carbon nanotubes and electromagnetic emissions. To Mosier, thissuggested the possibility of what he called “a functional device that may serveto monitor or control.” Incidentally, the frequency of the object, 14.749 MHz, is, in the UnitedStates, assigned by the FCC for low-power, short range-use, mostly for objectsknown as data tags. These typically track objects or transfer digitalinformation within a very short range, for instance inside a large room orwarehouse for purposes of tracking inventory with a handheld device.[283][index_split_006.html#filepos1316829] Leir’s battery of tests were done with a barebones budget. He and Mosier bothemphasized the need for more and better testing. Clearly, to be consideredscientifically valid, the results need to be replicated by other laboratories.Not to fault Leir and Mosier, who did everything within their capability, butthe demands of scientific proof are very high. The next step is obvious:significant research money allocated to the study of these implants. However, we are obligated to state what seems to be obvious: the objects hadelements that appeared to be extraterrestrial and of extraordinary technology.It produced a radio transmission. It had nanofibers similar in appearance tocarbon nanotubes. It was contained within a type of cocoon that prevented thebody from creating an inflammatory response. And the subject, as all of Leir'ssubjects, had UFO sightings and apparent abduction experiences. Consider how often human beings tag other creatures. Perhaps advanced lifeforms treat humanity in the same way. Of course, we must also consider thelikelihood that these implants could be a black budget or classified militaryoperation. After all, it might strike some as a bit “old school” for an advancedextraterrestrial race to use RF emitting magnetic chips. The technology behindthese devices is clearly very sophisticated, but if we consider the possibleadvances made in secret by a breakaway civilization, or something along thoselines, probably not beyond their capability. These implants are important, they are real, and they could be at the cusp ofgaining scientific credibility. But we are still not any closer to answering thequestion: who is making and implanting them? Human, alien, both, or somethingdifferent entirely? John Mack During the early 1990s, John Mack, Harvard professor, psychiatrist, andPulitzer Prize recipient, became very interested in the topic of alienabduction. Within a few years, he had personally interviewed over one hundredabductees, which formed the basis for his important book, Abduction, publishedin 1994.[284] [index_split_006.html#filepos1317151] As a medical professional, Mack’s first responsibility was to the health andwell-being of his patients. Even so, he did not regard abductees as patients inthe usual sense. With a few exceptions, he considered them normal and healthypeople who had experienced something disturbing and mysterious. In fact, heconsidered it remarkable that, despite the obvious trauma they had undergone,most of these people were not medically or psychiatrically disturbed. [images/00052.jpg]The three key pioneers of abduction research: Budd Hopkins (l), David Jacobs(c), and John Mack (r). Whereas Hopkins and Jacobs tended to view abductions as an assault byextraterrestrial beings upon humanity, Mack did not. He observed that manyabductees believed that they had gained greater spiritual awareness or insightsas a result of their experiences, which benefit humanity’s continued evolution.In other words, contact between human and non-human extraterrestrialintelligences could have positive outcomes. Like other abduction researchers, Mack noted the apparent telepathiccommunication between aliens and abductees. But out of this, he drew a newconclusion: this communication appeared to be instrumental in altering humanconsciousness. This direct mind-to-mind communication was not especiallypleasant. It involved implanting horrible images such as environmentaldisasters, earthquakes, or other catastrophes. The aliens seemed to bemonitoring the response of the abductee and sometimes provided information aboutwhen a future disaster would occur. The mental connection was not always aboutdisasters, though. It could simply be the transmission of some piece ofinformation that spurred the abductee to grow in some way. As an example, Scott, one of the subjects in Mack’s book Abduction, had beena skeptic on the matter of extraterrestrials, but then was humiliated to recallhow beings had laid him on a table and used various wires to stimulate sexualarousal and ejaculation. In his words, all of this was in order to “makebabies.”[285] [index_split_006.html#filepos1317441] He felt violated and angrythat the beings were controlling his memories and “messing with his head.” Onanother occasion, he was shown cylinders with tiny babies, presumably from hissperm. He was also taken to an underground facility, where he saw that the alienbeings were something like an extended family to him, in the sense that theyknew everything about him. Indeed, they knew more about him than any humanfamily would have known. Scott learned, somehow, that these beings were in the process of changingthemselves physically so that they could breathe on Earth. This is a key part ofthe hybridization process, he said. He also observed that they think much fasterthan humans do. During telepathic communication, he said, they need to slow downin order not to overwhelm us. Scott believed that their intention was to live onEarth, but possibly without humanity—unless humanity were to change, in whichcase we might live together. Scott contrasted human and alien existence. Humanbeings, he said, are alone. They do not share their thoughts, or much ofanything. Among the aliens, conversely, nobody is alone, there are no secrets.Everybody knows everything. Based on his recalled experiences, Scott concludedthat if humanity does not change, our world will change for us. Disturbing though these recalled memories were, they spurred Scott to becomemore aware of the need to protect the Earth, of finding ways to explore andexpand his own thinking and consciousness, and of fundamentally becoming abetter person. Thus, while Mack agreed with other researchers that abduction experiences areoften traumatic, and even appear cruel at times, he believed it could still bespiritually transformative. He saw no inconsistency in this, “unless,” as he putit, “one reserves spirituality for realms of the sublime that are free of painand struggle.” Going on, he wrote, “sometimes our most useful spiritual learningand growth comes at the hands of rough teachers who have little respect for ourconceits, psychological defenses, or established points of view.” In effect, suggested Mack, the abduction process has the potential to freeour minds. In the first place, acknowledging the very existence of these otherbeings, after the initial shock, may be “the first step in the opening ofconsciousness to a universe that is no longer simply material. Abductees come toappreciate that the universe is filled with intelligences and is itselfintelligent.” This was why Mack often used the less value-laden term, experiencer, insteadof abductee, to describe these individuals. His impression was that theabduction process is not evil, “and that the intelligences at work do not wishus ill.” He came to the belief that the phenomenon is fundamentally about the“preservation of life on earth, at a time when the planet's life is profoundlythreatened.” Throughout his life, Mack kept his mind open to the possibilitiesof what humanity is facing, and even questioned whether these beings wereactually extraterrestrial. He never made the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH)his definite conclusion. He wrote that they come “from a source that remainsunknown to us.\" The Other Side of Contact From here we move to the other side of contact. It is a side with a muchlonger pedigree than alien abduction, at least insofar as how long it has beendiscussed. This is intentional contact by humans with nonhuman entities, whetherthey be conceived as extraterrestrial or otherwise. The idea is ancient. What is a shaman, after all, but someone who makescontact with entities from another realm in order to provide guidance orprotection for their own society? Even the neighborhood priest comes from a longhistory of spiritual masters and adepts whose job was to serve as the receptaclefor the divine or holy spirit in order to bring enlightenment, or at leastguidance, to the people. In essence, such endeavors are no different fromcontemporary claims of channeling extraterrestrial beings. Whatever it may bethat is happening during such an experience, no answer is going to satisfyeveryone. The idea of communicating in this manner with extraterrestrials (as specificfrom other types of entities such as ghosts or divine beings) seems to date tothe 18th century, when the philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg claimed to have donethis telepathically. Then, during the 1870s, the mystic Helena Blavatsky claimedto have done the same. A few decades later, Aleister Crowley, after performingsexual rituals and taking opium, engaged in a state of meditation something likeself-induced hypnosis. He also claimed to have contacted an extraterrestrialbeing, although in this case not merely in a spiritual manner, but physically.In fact, he drew a picture of this being, whom he said was named Lam. Lam had alarge head and bears a passing resemblance to large-headed alien grays. [images/00047.jpg]Helena Blavatsky (l) and Aleister Crowley (r). Blavatsky and Crowley were two key figures in the creation of today’s New Agephilosophy. Blavatsky in fact created a new movement based on an ancient term,theosophy, which means “divine wisdom.” It is a philosophy of mysticism,fundamentally at odds with the scientific method. That is because it is premisedon the idea that knowledge comes from both external and internal sources. Intheosophy, internal truths have equal validity as scientific truths. In otherwords, if something 'feels' true to oneself, it is just as valid as ascientifically observable fact. This may seem outrageous or simplistic to some,but it is in fact a core tenet of theosophy. The obvious reply is that such a philosophy is quite convenient for hoaxersand delusional people, since internally intuited or heartfelt truths—or, for ourpurposes, nearly all channeled ET communications—are not falsifiable, notverifiable, and therefore could easily be fabricated. But from a theosophical point of view, this is missing the point, which isthat by going “inside” to one's truth, one delves into esoteric, internal,divine realms not accessible by normal waking or upper consciousness. That isthe claim. Essentially, theosophy continues the ancient, mystical, esoterictraditions. In this respect, it is also not very different from standardChristian, Muslim, or Hindu religious beliefs, or the beliefs of many othertraditional cultures around the world.[286][index_split_006.html#filepos1317661] But it is not merely the methods of theosophy that have influenced modern NewAge culture, including alleged channelers and contactees of extraterrestrials.It is the very content of belief itself. A key part of theosophy has to do withthe “Ascended Masters,” sometimes called the Mahatmas. These beings, it is said,once lived on Earth. Through their various lives, they learned the many lessonsthey needed to learn, balanced at least 51% of their karma, and gained masteryover the limitations of the material planes of existence. Thus, they fulfilledtheir Divine Plan, or dharma. As a result, they are considered God-like and asource of divine love. Claims of channeling Ascended Masters have become fairly common. During the1920s, and well into the 1940s, the theosophist Alice Bailey channeled anascended Tibetan master who relayed information on such topics as ancientwisdom, philosophy, science, contemporary events, and more. In later years,people have claimed Ascended Masters to be part of various interdimensional, ortranscendent organizations, such as the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, the GreatBrotherhood of Light, or Great White Brotherhood, and similar names. From here,we easily arrive at such groups as the Galactic Federation of Light, one of thecommonly alleged extraterrestrial organizations that channelers discuss today. One idea that has become part of New Age culture is that people willeventually attain “Ascension,” moving forward in spiritual evolution beyondPlanet Earth. In this formulation, the Ascended Masters (or theExtraterrestrials) are here to help people do that. In the years leading up toDecember 21, 2012 (the end of the Mayan Calendar and a date many thought theworld might end), there was an incredible build-up about the Ascension, and somebelieved it would elevate humanity into the next “density,” or level ofconsciousness, particularly for those who had 51% positive karma. Theconnections with 19th century Theosophy are obvious. This philosophy is an important foundation of the ideas espoused by peoplewho claim to have had intentional contact with extraterrestrials, eitherphysically or spiritually. Clearly, we are still wanting to answer theall-important question: is any of this for real? Or is it all nonsense? Does iteven belong in a study of the UFO phenomenon? Before trying to answer this, let us explore a bit more. Adamski and the 1950s As soon as flying saucers became a media sensation, there were those who cameforward claiming to have had contact with the operators of those craft, not asabductees or merely observers, but as people who had actual communication.Typically, they relayed the philosophies of these beings, most of which followedfrom the principles of Theosophy. The most prominent of these early contactees was George Adamski. Adamski wasa Polish-born amateur astronomer who had moved to California and then claimed tohave had multiple contacts with human-looking extraterrestrials throughout the1950s and early 1960s. On November 20, 1952, accompanied by a small group of friends Adamski set outto an area of the California desert where, he said, his intuition told him heneeded to go. He told his friends that he believed he was going to have anextraterrestrial encounter. Arriving at the spot, he walked far ahead of hisfriends. There, alone, he claimed to have met a completely human-lookingextraterrestrial pilot, dressed in a kind of jumpsuit. The person hardly spoke aword, but Adamski claimed that, through telepathy and hand gestures, he was ableto understand most of the conversation. The pilot, whose name he later learnedwas Orthon, told him many things. First, that he came from the planet Venus.Also, that all the other planets in the Solar System are inhabited, that allextraterrestrials essentially look human, and that a nuclear war on Earth wouldcause serious disruption in the cosmos. This last statement explained theircurrent interest in humanity.[287] [index_split_006.html#filepos1318079] The problem with this is that, although Adamski claimed his companions wereable to see the extraterrestrial, all of them later admitted they had not. Theyhad not even seen the spacecraft. Adamski had simply gone off on his own andthen returned to tell them what had happened. [images/00031.jpg]George Adamski next to a painting of Orthon. This was not the only time Adamski pulled such a stunt. He did precisely thesame thing in 1963 at the Vatican, when he claimed to have met with the Pope andto have received a medallion. Accompanied by two friends, he went off ahead ofthem in the crowded Vatican Square and was gone for thirty minutes. He then cameback, claiming he had met with the Pontiff. Research into this matter has provenconclusively that this was a lie. Adamski's medallion was merely a touristtrinket. He did not even enter the Vatican through the area where the Pope wasat the time. Nobody ever saw him with the Pope, and his two friends were forcedto take him at his word. This is not how to build a solid case, but it wasAdamski’s typical modus operandi. Incidentally, he told his friends that thePope’s health was very good when, in reality, the Pope was gravely ill and wouldbe dead within two weeks. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Adamski was a hoaxer. In my ownjourneys through this field, I have met a number of people who believed in him,and a few who knew him personally and supported him. Yet, too many facts get inthe way.[288] [index_split_006.html#filepos1318273] In addition to Adamski, there were many other individuals of the 1950s whoclaimed similar types of contact: Daniel Frye, Howard and Connie Menger, GeorgeVan Tassell, Cedric Allingham, Orfeo Angelucci, Truman Bethurum, ElizabethKlarer, and many others. Each of these people claimed to have had personalcontact with human looking extraterrestrials, and all of the extraterrestrialshad messages for humanity. In the 1950s, that message was almost exclusivelygeared toward the dangers of atomic power and weaponry. Over time, the messages evolved somewhat, but still retained the basicconcept that the beings from elsewhere had knowledge that could be used for thebetterment of both humanity and the individual. This, too, has always been acentral tenet of theosophy. During the 1970s, for instance, Italian contactee,Giorgio Dibitonto had a number of alleged contacts with “space brothers,”including rides in starships. These beings were claimed to be the angels of theBible, still charged with revealing spiritual truths to humanity and withguiding us on the path toward higher development. They told Dibitonto:> You have set matter and spirit against each other.… If you could free your> mind from its presumptuous arrogance, and become meek and simple, pure and> good… Then you would solve the whole problem of evil and your unhappiness. The> intellect becomes ensnared if it represses or subverts [the wisdom of the> heart]. Then the heart and the mind become enemies of each other, and the> result is all manner of misfortune and sickness.[289]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1318774] This is a classic presentation of theosophical thought, and a perfectencapsulation of most messages from the “space brothers,” whether received inperson, or via channeled or telepathic communications. Indeed, since the 1990s,the message from the space brothers has become almost exclusively spiritual.Even nuclear weapons and the environment have taken a back seat to the need forhumanity to ascend to a higher level of consciousness in its ongoing process ofspiritual evolution. In such a way, we can peacefully join the greater galacticcommunity. I would suggest that it shows how the Theosophical influence has had adamaging effect on the UFO subculture, just as it has done more generally withinour broader society. Focusing on love over hatred is a good thing, of course,just as seeing the ultimate unity of all life forms. But the emphasis, again andagain, on the “heart” over the intellect, on intuition over rational thought, oncleansing one’s own spirit before working together in a communal, politicalmatter to effect change, take away our most important tools to function in aworld filled with gross injustice, government secrecy, and the loss of humanrights around the world. That is, the New Age movement, insofar as it has becomea force in our world, has never been a force for fighting real injustice, hasnever worked for political change, and has arguably only caused people to spintheir wheels in a self-indulgent yet ultimately fruitless path toward“enlightenment.” Like early Christianity, it is a religion of the powerless. But whereas thepowerless adherents of early Christianity included many women and slaves whowere clearly attracted to a better world in the afterlife, in the case of theNew Age movement today, the powerlessness of our society is of a different sort.That is, people have understood more and more through the twentieth century andbeyond that the problems in our world in terms of environmental degradation,warfare, injustice, and more are so bad that we often despair of being able tofix them at all. Therefore, the Escape into Self has become very appealing tosome. If the world is going to hell, why not make your private life a littlemore beautiful while you can? Why not keep out all “negativity” and essentiallypretend it doesn’t exist? Living in a bubble can be attractive for a while. It is like living in awonderful dream while your house is burning down around you. What’s better:dying while you dream, or waking up and trying to deal with the fire? But the political dangers of New Age thought are separate from the truth ornon-truth of the alleged communications with extraterrestrials. On this matter,there is more to say. Telepathic Contact: The Affa Case Generally speaking, there has been a trend over the decades, moving fromphysical to non-physical forms of alleged contact with extraterrestrials. Buteven during the 1950s, communications with extraterrestrials via Ouija board,spirit mediums, and channeling was fairly common. One especially interesting case was that of Affa. According to UFO researcherand historian, Jerome Clark, Affa rst appeared in 1952 to a small group inPrescott, Arizona, headed by George Hunt Williamson. These communications weremainly through automatic writing, identifying Affa as from the planet Uranus andliving above Earth's atmosphere in a very large space ship. Then, in 1954, Affa appeared in the automatic writing of Mrs. Frances Swan ofEliot, Maine. Here, too, Affa said he was from Uranus and in a huge ship abovethe Earth. What is hard to reconcile are the many conflicting elements of whatSwan transcribed. On the one hand, there was a great amount of detail, includingtechnical knowledge that surely seemed beyond her education. On the other, thereare passages in her transcription that certainly do not strike one as from anextraterrestrial source. For instance, here is a description by Affa of hisship. He described it as over two hundred miles long, essentially the size of asmall nation, and said:> We have recreational centers and swimming pools here. There are no women on> this ship because the nature of the work is for the strong ones. We have to> keep in training at all times as the work is most strenuous… My favorite sport> is fencing. I like swimming and hiking also. Many of the sons box and wrestle> with the exception that no one ever gets hurt. We do this on a point system> only. I also ride horseback and do some target shooting. We have rifles much> the same as your own but we use them only for sports of which we have several. Extraterrestrial? If there was ever a smell test to detect such a thing, thepreceding passage would cause Affa to flunk it. But the Affa story does not endhere. Swan happened to live next door to retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral, Herbert B.Knowles. Knowles believed Swan was legitimate. He tried to interest the U.S.military as a way to establish useful communication with these extraterrestrialsand arranged for two officers from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) tomeet her on June 8, 1954. They asked questions of Affa, the answers of whichwere presumably unknown to Swan, such as, “What is the length of Uranus’ day?”and “What is the distance between Jupiter and the sun at Jupiter’s apogee?”According to her investigators, the answers were correct. But Affa also promiseda radio transmission on June 10. When this did not happen, ONI apparently lostinterest. This is a curious pattern, incidentally. Often, one hears ofchannelers and people claiming contact with aliens who may have some initialaccuracy in their more mundane claims. Yet, their grandiose proclamations fallflat. Matters did not end here, however. Although there are somewhat conflictingaccounts of what happened next, Affa was a subject of interest at the CIA’sNational Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC). During the summer of 1959,Navy Commander Junius Larsen learned of the incident at Swan’s home from theprevious month. He had a strong interest in spiritualism, and was also an ONIliaison officer with NPIC. Larsen met with Swan, whereupon she taught himautomatic writing. Larsen believed that he, too, had communicated with Affa,although Clark related that Swan was skeptical. Larsen returned to Washington and met with the head of NPIC, Art Lundahl, aswell as Lundahl’s assistant, Navy Lieutenant Commander Robert Neasham. Larsenentered a trance and believed he contacted Affa. When the men asked Affa toprove that he was there, Affa told them to go to the window. Neasham saw what hebelieved was a craft among the clouds, although clearly it could not have beenthe enormous craft Affa previously described to Swan. In any case, Lundahlclaimed he never saw any craft. Neasham described the event to Air Force MajorRobert Friend, head of Project Blue Book. For Friend’s bene t, Larsen relatedtelepathic messages from Affa and other space people, but on this occasion thealiens refused to appear. An alternate version has it that Lundahl was notpresent during the first session, in which the craft was clearly visible, andwhen he was present for a second session, Affa did not appear.[290][index_split_006.html#filepos1319208] What exactly was going on during Francis Swan’s automatic writing? Or, forthat matter, in the communications with Larsen and George Hunt Williamson? Wasthis just a facet of the mind of the person engaged in the act of automaticwriting, disconnected somehow from one’s ordinary consciousness but stillentirely one’s own? Or was it really true? Was it some form of gentle deceptionby these other beings? Or worse? Towards Assessing the Claims Regarding channeling, or automatic writing, or any other form ofcommunication like this, there appear to be sincere people who mean well but aredeluded, and there are also hoaxers. But perhaps there are a few cases that arelegitimate. If so, what was Affa? The question is important because, starting in the late 1960s, such allegedcommunication with extraterrestrials became more prevalent, not so much viaautomatic writing as through channeling. Today, along with people who claim tohave telepathic “downloads,” this is easily the dominant form of “talking” withaliens. Setting aside the obvious theosophical content of most of thesecommunications for the moment, it is important to ask whether or not there issomething to it? And if so, how might it work? For example, is there something to the practice of deep meditation andchanneling that allows a human being to reach into a certain inner “place” andcontact a higher intelligence, perhaps one that is extraterrestrial? I will return to this issue in more depth later in the book. But I maysuggest that the answer is, at least partially, yes. The question is really not much different in substance from questions overthe power of prayer. Does prayer work? There are people trying to prove this,with results that everyone continues to debate. Regarding UFO contact, we would do well to recall that most contactees andabductees have claimed some form of telepathic connection with these otherbeings. In fact, such connections are often felt by people who have UFOsightings, without even experiencing the extra level of abduction or contact. Inother words, these beings appear, somehow, to connect to us telepathically. Anecdotally, there are many interesting examples of people who have meditatedor engaged in some other esoteric practice which seemed directly related totheir encounter. Even the previously mentioned 1927 UFO sighting by explorerNicholas Roerich falls into this category. The event occurred in theultra-remote Altai Himalaya region of Tibet. It turns out that Roerich and hiswife, Helena Ivanovna Roerich, who was also there, happened to be activeTheosophists. Both were brilliant. Nicholas was probably a genius: a first-rankpainter and visionary philosopher who wrote essays about the cosmic evolution ofmankind, the spiritual factor in the development of humanity, the need forinternational peace and brotherly love, and the need to protect the Earth. Hereceived several nominations for the Nobel Prize. Helena Roerich was his partnerin everything. In fact, shortly after the sighting, she would translate twovolumes of the writings of Helena Blavatsky. And there, in the middle ofnowhere, they saw a truly intriguing UFO. What are the odds? Ultimately, the problem with all esoteric information and communications isthat they are almost always unverifiable. When predictions have been made, theyhave invariably been wrong, or else a big, obvious, so what? In the current cropof channeled information, allegedly from extraterrestrials, there is anabundance of theosophical platitudes concerning the need to raise humanity's“vibrational frequency” to achieve higher consciousness and open portals to thenext dimension. There is little to nothing, however, that is verifiable oramenable to scientific testing. Regarding both basic forms of contact with extraterrestrials, whether byabduction or intention, we have a great deal in the way of claims, and a greatdeal that has not met contemporary standards of scientific validity. The mostpromising avenue for research at this point seems to be into alleged alienimplants. Still, neither abductions, nor contact have impressed many scientists. But both have, arguably, made changes in what we call human consciousness.Within the human mind, they exist. And, it is not the worst bet in the worldthat both have some correspondence with an external reality. Unfortunately, bothare littered with junk claims that must be discarded. It is a bit like searchingfor treasure in a landfill. There is something valuable hidden within, but wemay need to hold our noses while searching. The matter of contact provides endless fascination, leading to manyquestions. Perhaps the most important of all is, Who are these entities? We maynot be able to answer that question to everyone’s satisfaction, but we shallcertainly explore the rabbit hole. Chapter 9The Growth of Ufology Ufology in 1970 was a field in need of a facelift. The 1960s had seen acrescendo of tension amounting to a crisis. It developed and festered until therelease of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects by the CondonCommittee in early 1969. This report, conducted through the University ofColorado, was meant to be a legitimate scientific analysis that would determinethe validity of the UFO phenomenon, or at least to decide whether it wassomething truly unusual and extraordinary, or unworthy of scientific interest. The Committee’s verdict was definitive, and very much negative. UFOs,concluded Edward Condon, were of “no probative value” to science, meaning thatthe study of them did not promise to advance scientific knowledge. Condonrecommended that the Air Force drop Project Blue Book, its office devoted toUFOs, which the Air Force promptly did. It was as though a balloon had been inflated, and inflated again, andinflated still more, only to be popped. From the Ashes of the Condon Committee Granted, the Condon Committee study had been a rigged game, with apreordained negative conclusion. Nevertheless, the study of UFOs became aserious twofold problem: first, how to study the topic scientifically andsecond, how to earn respect from the public? It did not help that UFO sightings appeared to have subsided at that time.Throughout much of the 1960s, there had been many sightings and a fair amount ofpublic attention brought upon on the subject. Indeed, there would again be moreactivity later on in the 1970s. But for now, it seemed, not much was happening.Perhaps, some wondered, the skeptics were right, that the UFO phenomenon hadbeen nothing more than a passing fancy of popular culture and hysteria. Perhapsscience had shone its light upon the subject. It had opened the vault and foundit empty. American Ufology: The Big Four Naturally, UFO research did not cease. Within a few years of the CondonReport, there were four research groups in the United States that, small thoughthey were, had some claim to being “national” organizations. One was the National Investigative Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP),based out of Washington, D.C. For years, NICAP had challenged the Air Forceposition on UFOs and tried to initiate open congressional hearings on thematter. But NICAP in the 1970s was circling the drain. Its longtime director,retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe, had been ousted in 1969 by ColonelJoseph J. Bryan III, a man later discovered to have once headed the CIA’sPsychological Warfare division. Leadership of NICAP passed to John Acuff, whohad been the head of another military and CIA-affiliated group. Acuff endedNICAP’s criticism of government UFO policy. More significantly, he destroyed itsinvestigative and reporting network. Acuff also plundered the organizationpersonally and essentially destroyed it. Through the 1970s, NICAP was a mereshell of its former self. By 1980, it was no more.[291][index_split_006.html#filepos1319972] For years, NICAP’s main rival had been the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization, (APRO) based out of Tucson, Arizona. Founded in 1952 by James andCoral Lorenzen, it had developed an impressive structure. A typical APROBulletin of the late 1960s listed some 40 or more Ph.D.s or M.D.s asconsultants, covering a wide range of disciplines. The organization hadrepresentatives from forty to fifty nations. It was a worldwide network,subsisting on memberships of less than $10 per year. Thus, with NICAP’s willfully incompetent leadership, one would think thatAPRO was primed to lead American ufology. But APRO received its own unwelcomeshock in 1969, when one of its regional officers, Walter Andrus, took manymembers with him to form the Midwest UFO Network based out of Seguin, Texas.Many NICAP members also joined. Soon renamed the Mutual UFO Network, MUFONquickly became a leading UFO research group. Andrus focused on building agrassroots investigative organization. It is interesting to note that he wasformerly in the U.S. Navy, and many of MUFON's board members had Navy andintelligence community backgrounds. Among the most prominent was Thomas Deuley,a former Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy and former employee of theNational Security Agency. In time, a great deal of speculation and suspicionwould develop on the matter of MUFON's relationship to the U.S. intelligencecommunity. It is worth noting, too, that MUFON’s grassroots efforts neversucceeded past membership levels of a few thousand. In 1973, yet another American UFO organization was founded. This was theCenter for UFO Studies (CUFOS) near Chicago, created around the astronomer Dr.J. Allen Hynek. Hynek was the most famous name in ufology at the time, havingformerly been consultant to the Air Force for Project Blue Book. However, Hynekwas not the founder, but co-founder of the organization. The other co-founder,Sherman J. Larsen, was quite obscure. Although UFO researcher and CUFOS member,Jerome Clark, once described Larsen as little more than “a retired ...businessman,” as naive and not very intelligent, Larsen almost certainly hadbeen in the U.S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC). During World War Two andafterwards, the CIC was an elite intelligence agency, essentially thespy-catchers of the U.S. military. The great researcher Leonard Stringfield, whohad been a friend of Larsen’s, mentioned that Larsen had worked for CIC, and hadeven told him where CIC’s Chicago-area headquarters were. Larsen also hadcontacts with the RAND Corporation—a major Defense think tank—and claimed tohave obtained UFO documents via that agency.[292][index_split_006.html#filepos1320361] Then there was Hynek. Because of his longtime connection with Blue Book,other researchers often held a certain amount of suspicion against him. CoralLorenzen, for her part, never forgot that Hynek was comfortably paid as an AirForce consultant, often in a skeptical or even debunking role, during the 1950sand 1960s. For years, she and her husband had believed (correctly) that thegovernment was spying on them. They also knew that the CIA-sponsored RobertsonPanel of 1953, of which Hynek was a member, had recommended monitoring theirorganization. Granted, Hynek was a junior member of that panel, but he had beena member nonetheless. Nor was Coral Lorenzen the only one with a problem aboutHynek: many MUFON members also distrusted him.[293][index_split_006.html#filepos1321022] [images/00002.jpg]Leaders of 1970s Ufology: James and Coral Lorenzen (l), J. Allen Hynek (c),Walter Andrus (r). These were the four major American groups receiving UFO reports, conductinginvestigations, and trying to understand the mystery. Memberships were low forall of them. APRO and MUFON had no more than two or three thousand members each,CUFOS and NICAP hardly anything. All had prominent members with connections tothe U.S. military and intelligence community. Maybe some of this was becausepeople in those fields developed a genuine interest in the subject. Still, giventhat surveillance of the UFO research community had been going on for years, itwould not be especially paranoid to wonder if something else was going on. Scientific Ufology All of these groups promoted “scientific ufology.” This was in directresponse to the rejection of UFOs by the Condon Committee. Hence the term“Ufology” came into use, along with the perception that the study needed to beconducted scientifically. All of this effort was toward the eventual goal ofattaining social respectability. MUFON for its part began developing aninvestigative methodology and a network of trained investigators. Of course,that was the ideal; reality often lagged behind. But, there were MUFONinvestigators who investigated baffling UFO cases: doing the legwork,interviewing witnesses, analyzing possible landing sites, preparing reports. The goal of scientific ufology is surely laudable, and considering the stateof affairs after the Condon Committee, understandable. It also served tode-politicize the issue to a large extent. Cover-ups and conspiracies weredefinitely out during the first few years of the 1970s. The main problem with implementing scientific ufology is that real sciencerequires real money. One can employ scientific principles in an investigation;one can create methodologies and protocols with which to conduct investigations.But without funding, investigators must work on their own time and money, doingthe best they can to investigate reports. In practice, to this day this means that investigators seldom arrive at thescene of a sighting quickly enough, and often only after driving long distances.Then they interview whatever witnesses they can, doing their best to check withlocal airports and meteorologists and other experts for conventionalexplanations. They also need to check the background of the witnesses, ifpossible. If they are very lucky to find physical evidence of some sort, theymust find a way to have it analyzed scientifically. This is when things canbecome expensive. Furthermore, what laboratories would even dare to beassociated with helping to analyze alleged UFO-related evidence? That is a best-case scenario. Groups like APRO or MUFON were fortunate tohave investigators at all. The vast majority of sightings of necessity remain,years ago as well as today, as little more than raw reports awaiting a competentinvestigation to determine whether they constitute a genuine mystery. Intelligence Community Penetration And yet, the problems of investigating UFOs go deeper still. Over the years,there have been many direct connections between the U.S. intelligence community,especially the CIA, and UFO research. This is not paranoid conspiracy theory.Ever since UFO research has been conducted, people from the military andintelligence community have been involved in it, and indeed have monitored it.We must ask whether they have also influenced it and, if so, has it been for acovert agenda? The 1953 Robertson Panel mentioned APRO as a UFO research group that neededto be monitored. APRO’s leaders described several instances from the 1950s and1960s that strongly appeared to be attempts at infiltration by covert operativesinto their group. During the 1970s and 1980s, one of APRO’s most prominentmembers, William Moore, worked closely with Air Force Intelligence and,apparently, the CIA. It is known that Moore passed on information to hisintelligence handlers and also knowingly disseminated at least one tampereddocument into the UFO research community, as well as the still-disputed MJ-12documents. He did much of his work in conjunction with Richard Doty, a member ofthe Air Force Office of Special Investigation, (AFOSI) who has regularly beenaccused of spreading disinformation into the UFO field. In fact, Doty admittedmore than once to having done so. Then there was NICAP, dominated throughout its history by prominent militaryand intelligence figures. Many members of its founding Board of Governors andleaders in the 1950s were senior members of the Navy or CIA. RoscoeHillenkoetter was a Navy Vice Admiral and former head of the CIA. Nicolas deRochefort (NICAP's first Vice Chairman) was a scriptwriter for theCIA-controlled Voice of America, and was also a member of the CIA'spsychological warfare staff, something unknown to the public at the time. DeRochefort's boss at that department was Colonel Joseph Bryan, who joined NICAPsboard in 1960. Bryan’s CIA pedigree was unknown at the time. During the early1960s, Karl Pflock, a CIA briefing officer, joined NICAP and chaired itsWashington, D.C. subcommittee. In 1969, after Bryan led the ouster of Keyhoefrom leadership of NICAP, the organization was essentially destroyed by oneCIA-connected leader after another: Alan Hall, Stuart Nixon, and Jack Acuff. Itis interesting that, throughout NICAPs history, the organization focused on theAir Force as the source of the UFO cover-up. When Keyhoe began focusing on theCIA by the late 1960s, he was gone. Certainly, the organization had financialtroubles, and Keyhoe was getting older, but it surely appears that NICAP wasmanaged, and then deliberately mismanaged, by the U.S. intelligencecommunity.[294] [index_split_006.html#filepos1321339] The same issues pervaded MUFON from its inception. The organization’s Navyconnection have already been mentioned. But there was also Richard Hall, who hadpreviously worked closely with Keyhoe in NICAP, and who was prominent for yearsin MUFON. Hall had been former Air Force officer, and even as a young man in histwenties had shocked Keyhoe by how much he knew about UFOs. Now, with MUFON,Hall was a leading light, and consistently downplayed the government cover-upangle of UFOs, just as the entire organization did for years and years. A review of MUFON's leadership through the years shows a remarkably highnumber of figures with government and intelligence community connections,scattered throughout the organization. During the 21st century, MUFON developeda brief relationship with the billionaire Robert Bigelow, an important figure inthe U.S. defense and aerospace community. For about a year, Bigelow poured moneyinto MUFON’s investigative capabilities, with the proviso that his own team hadup to date access to all MUFON investigations. The matter ended acrimoniously,with each side claiming the other reneged on its agreement. There remain membersof MUFON who believe the organization gave Bigelow’s group much more access toits files than it should have. By itself, that is not necessarily a disturbing situation, except when oneconsiders that MUFON's cases are almost never publicly reported, other thanbrief summaries that appear temporarily on the public website. Over the years,MUFON has been accused of being an organization in which all data goes in, andvery little comes out, unless it is going to the appropriate intelligencechannels. Whether this is true, or to what extent it is true, is still a matter ofspeculation. Regardless of the answer, MUFON is in need of a public relationsfacelift. Unlike real-life plastic surgery, however, its changes need to be morethan cosmetic. CUFOS fits the same pattern. For years, the organization published anewsletter of good quality. Beyond that, however, its tiny membership preventedit from doing much else. Philosophically, it has taken the most conservative ofpositions regarding the phenomenon without actually debunking it. Yes, says itsleadership, there is indeed a UFO reality of some sort, but has beennon-committal over what it signifies. Nor has the organization ever supportedthe idea of a cover-up. It is among the mainstream media where CUFOS for years has been prominent,all out of proportion to its numbers in the UFO research community. During the1970s and 1980s, it elicited suspicions from observers such as Jacques Valléeand Timothy Good that it had a relationship to the U.S. intelligencecommunity.[295] [index_split_006.html#filepos1321747] Whether these suspicionsare valid today is another question. Yet, looking at the matter from the processof “manufacturing consent,” the phrase and title from Noam Chomsky’s mostclassic work, the role of CUFOS can be seen as one in which it has drawn a linedemarcating the edge of respectable ufology. Beyond such a line lies the fringe. If some or all of these UFO groups were infiltrated by intelligence communityoperatives, it would fit a broader history. The FBI's infamous Cointelproprogram was an infiltration program during the 1960s to destroy progressive andradical organizations promoting social change. It was very effective. We know ofthe CIA's infiltration and influence during the cold war over such nominallyindependent organizations as the Voice of America and the Congress for CulturalFreedom.[296] [index_split_006.html#filepos1322075] Today, infiltration andcontrol has achieved a higher art form still. Intelligence and governmentagencies cannot openly be connected to most organizations, which requires thatrelationships exist behind the scenes. This is true of mainstream media and theacademic community, where there are significant numbers of CIA andintelligence-connected people. Looking at UFO organizations, which research amatter of profound national and international security, the reasonableassumption is that they too have been affected. Along these lines, I recall a private conversation I had with a respected UFOresearcher, as well as a trusted friend, who told me of a conversation he oncehad during the 1990s with an acquaintance who was a CIA employee. Thisacquaintance told him that the CIA regularly attended all major UFO conferences,just to monitor what was going on and who was saying what. Entering the Weird Looking at the situation in the early 1970s, the growth of American UFOorganizations was far from the only interesting development. Without question,researchers slowly began to appreciate just how strange the phenomenon is. The extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) had dominated most thinking on flyingsaucers and UFOs during the 1950 and 1960s. This should not be surprising,considering that this era marked the beginning of the space age, and the factthat many of the objects looked like extremely advanced mechanical objects. Theyalso operated throughout the atmosphere, including the upper atmosphere andspace. In this context, the ETH was logical. However, probably in part from the slapdown by the Condon Committee, therewas a reaction against the ETH. To some people, the theory began to seemsimplistic. Perhaps it was. Certainly, there was an abundance of truly bizarrereports which did not easily lead to a “nuts and bolts” explanation of aliencreatures inside space ships coming from another planet. Much of the influence behind this new perspective came from Jacques Valléeand John Keel. Both argued that UFOs could not possibly be extraterrestrialspacecraft. Through the late 1960s and 1970s, Vallée expressed his dissatisfaction withthe ETH, culminating with his “Five Arguments against the ETH.” Not all of thearguments are especially compelling, but some remain intriguing.[297][index_split_006.html#filepos1322430] In the first place, he argued, there seemed to be too many UFO sightings andclose encounters to explain them as extraterrestrial craft. If they are fromanother planet, there sure are a lot of them flying around. Then there is the problem of the body structure of these so-called “aliens.”If they evolved on another planet, or another part of the universe, why wouldthey look humanoid, with two arms, two legs, and a head with eyes, ears, nose,and mouth? Could human-looking creatures really have evolved elsewhere?Moreover, such biological designs do not appear biologically adapted to spacetravel. Vallée thought of other oddities mitigating against the ETH. The phenomenon,whatever it is, seems to have been recorded throughout human history. If theseother beings are from another planet, they seem to have been here for ages, andprobably live here by now. Moreover, the ability of UFOs, at least on occasions,seemingly to manipulate space and time suggested different and perhaps richeralternatives to mere extraterrestrials. John Keel, who investigated the Mothman case in West Virginia and wrote TheMothman Prophecies, had a similar perspective. He coined the termultraterrestrials. These beings, he suggested, were not living here in ourreality, but in another version of reality, perhaps another dimension. Some ofKeel's thought connected UFOs to what we would call the paranormal, and helinked poltergeists and other paranormal events to many UFO sightings. Thus, hesuggested, not aliens in flying saucers, but intelligences from otherdimensions, were interacting with humanity.[298][index_split_006.html#filepos1322803] By the early 1970s, such alternative ideas as offered by Vallée, Keel, andothers were spreading among researchers. Since then, they have continued anddeepened into a significant school of thought. In general, UFO research wasreinventing itself during the 1970s. At the same time, it was trying toestablish itself on a firm intellectual footing and gain some measure ofrespectability. Psychosocial Explanations Across the Atlantic Ocean, the ETH fell even further from grace. During the1970s and later, many prominent write in the United Kingdom and France supporteda psychosocial or psychocultural hypothesis to explain UFOs. Researchers such asHilary Evans, the editors of Magonia magazine, and many of the contributors toFortean Times magazine argued that the truly interesting UFO reports are bestexplained by psychological or social means. This is not to say that they have believed all sightings and encounters to bein the head. Instead, their position recognizes that human beings have alwayshad encounters with anomalous and strange things, but that these encounters arefiltered through the cultural values and expectations of each person. Accordingto this hypothesis, when one reviews the many strange events and encounters thathave occurred throughout all of human history, it becomes apparent that most arenot about aliens from space, but rather reflect deep-seated thoughts, fears, andbeliefs. Of course, we may still wonder about what types of anomalous events mighthave caused people to react and believe the way they did. What kind of fireballin ancient Egypt, or 17th Century southern Russia, could convince the peoplethat they were encountering an intelligently maneuvering apparition? What kindof anomaly would convince a twenty-five year-old surveyor in the CanadianNorthwest Territories in 1936 that he was seeing “the most perfect configurationof an airship” one could imagine, which then instantly accelerated to the edgeof the horizon? Proponents of the psychosocial perspective claim that they are not the sameas debunkers, because they feel UFOs are still an interesting subject worthy ofserious study, even if it is approached in a skeptical way. Fair enough, onesupposes, and it is certainly true that human psychology is one of several keyareas with which a serious ufologist must be familiar. But to those people who,after careful study of the phenomenon, have concluded that UFOs pose a seriousanomaly in our reality, such theorists may certainly seem very close todebunkers. FOIA and the Crash Retrieval Syndrome Despite the new approaches to ufology that developed during the 1970s, theETH never receded completely. This became especially so by the latter part ofthe decade, when the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) became an importanttool for researchers. During the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, those individuals inthe military and intelligence communities who created classified documents aboutUFOs did not expect that they would ever become public. By the late 1970s,however, after much effort by researchers, some of them did. Not an especiallylarge percentage, but several thousand pages worth. The bounty of FOIA was manifold. First, it reinforced the idea that at leastsome UFOs were reported by military sources as solid, mechanical objects ofunusual design and incredible performance. They were not always ephemeralapparitions, distant lights in the night sky, but material objects that wereup-close-and-personal, sometimes even tracked and pursued by military agencies.Extraterrestrial? Indeed, perhaps so after all. FOIA also made it clear that there really was some sort of 'cover-up' onUFOs. The documents showed beyond any doubt that, at the same time the U.S.military was telling the public that flying saucers and UFOs were eitherimaginary objects or misunderstood natural phenomena, these same agencies werevery concerned about UFOs, and that jets had been scrambled to chase after them. As a result of such revelations, UFO researchers were energized into thinkingthat they might possibly get lucky. Perhaps they might find the one documentthat would unambiguously prove the reality of UFOs and of the cover-up, once andfor all. A document making it crystal-clear that the President of the UnitedStates knows about the extraterrestrial nature of UFOs, or something equallypowerful. At the same time, another prong in the attack on secrecy was developing. Thiswas in the collection of stories that supported the idea that there had beensecret retrievals of crashed UFOs, including the acquisition of dead alienbodies. The most famous of these stories is the crash of a UFO near Roswell, NewMexico, but quite a few accounts surfaced during the late 1970s and after. Mostwere uncorroborated and unsubstantiated claims, sometimes not even from thedirect witness, but his or her spouse if that person were no longer alive.Nevertheless, the cumulative effect was that, by the end of the decade, therewere at least fifty accounts that had been collected, each detailing someincredible aspect of this phenomenon. Like FOIA, the crash retrieval stories were also pursued by some researchersas a possible key toward unlocking the door of secrecy. Foremost among thesewere Leonard Stringfield, William Moore, and Stanton Friedman, although therewere others. Within just a few years, ufology had developed a potentiallydangerous one-two punch. The Intelligence Empire Strikes Back: The Early 1980s For those on the other side of secrecy's wall, concerned about keeping theterrible UFO secret away from the public, the developments of the late 1970swould appear to be problems that required active counter-measures. What followedduring the early 1980s certainly appears to have been exactly that. What happened was that a known U.S. Air Force military intelligencespecialist named Richard Doty began to communicate with certain researchers inthe field, giving deep information that could not be verified and which wassometimes shown to be false. One of Doty’s connections was researcher WilliamMoore, who in 1980 co-authored the first book on Roswell. Clearly, Moore was animportant connection. Throughout the 1980s, Doty (or those connected to him) fedMoore what appeared to be inside information. One item came to be known as theAquarius document, which described a UFO-related briefing given to PresidentJimmy Carter. Another contained classified commentary on a UFO incident, but inwhich the acronym NSA (for National Security Agency) was changed to NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Although it appears that therest of the document might be legitimate, researchers still do not know. Doty also fed information to other researchers at this time, including LindaMoulton Howe, who had recently produced a powerful documentary on cattlemutilations. In 1983, Doty showed her what appeared to be explosive,Presidential-level documents, that confirmed the UFO-extraterrestrial reality,and then some. Although Howe was clearly impressed by them, she did not gopublic until long after the moment had passed. The following year, Doty (or, again, someone connected to him) mailed theinfamous MJ-12 documents to a research associate of Moore. This was JamieShandera, a man with his own involvement in the world of U.S. intelligence. Likethe documents Doty had previously shown Linda Moulton Howe, these describedhighest-level policy in containing and dealing with the UFO issue. For severalyears, Moore hesitated to publish them. Then, in 1987, Doty tired of waiting andarranged for U.K. researcher Timothy Good to get a copy. Now realizing that Goodwas about to publish them in his own book, Moore decided to publicize themfirst. After that, all hell broke lose. Supporters and debunkers lined up forbattle, and indeed have continued to do so to this day, now more than a quarterof a century later. [images/00045.jpg]Cropped page of the MJ-12 documents, which have remained divisive in ufology tothe present day. The result was that what had initially seemed like a straightforwardproposition—getting hold of the right document that would prove UFOs and thecover-up—became much more complicated. For now researchers were dealing withdocuments that looked real but which had been tampered with, or which might becompletely fake, or which might be real. Not only that, but the entire crashretrieval phenomenon had become tied into this, similarly splashed with mud. What was real? What was not? Suddenly, nothing seemed certain any more. The Eve of the Internet and the State of Ufology Such was ufology in the 1980s, all before the birth of the Internet. It was afield that seemed rife with dissension and distrust. Many wondered, whateverhappened to scientific ufology? Whatever happened to the idea of gaining somelevel of consensus over the meaning of this phenomenon, or the attempt to gainsocial respectability? By the late 1980s, such goals seemed like a fond, distantmemory. Yet, looking back on those years, one thing does stand out: an identifiablecommunity of UFO researchers. These were people who were immersed in the field,who researched, who investigated, and who wrote articles and books. They mayhave disagreed with each other on many matters, but they all spoke the samelanguage, as it were. That is, most of them supported the idea of scientificufology, and most of them believed the subject needed more intellectual rigor.Even those who were beginning to believe in a conspiracy of some sort were tameby standards of later years. No one spoke of the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers,or Bohemian Grove. If there was any belief in a conspiracy or cover-up,researchers confined their analysis to the U.S. Government. Such relative collegiality was even in evidence regarding the matter of alienabductions. Budd Hopkins and others had brought the subject to prominence duringthe 1980s. Not everyone agreed that abductions were taking place at all, muchless on the scale that Hopkins was suggesting. Yet, although the debate wasspirited, it remained a reasoned one. But all of this was contained within a very narrow circle; that is, primarilywithin the few printed UFO-related journals of the time. Circulation was neverhigh. The outside world hardly noticed at all. By the late 1980s, all that started to change. The First Bulletin Boards The birth of the Internet did not come at once, but gradually and piecemeal.Yet, a key year in its maturation, perhaps the key year, was 1986. This was whenthe collection of connected newsgroups, known as Usenet, began to expand beyonddiscussions about computers and programming and other matters of geeky interest.In 1986, for the first time, a non-computer-related bulletin board entered thescene: Paranet, which focused on UFOs. Indeed, and perhaps to the surprise ofmany, the UFO phenomenon was one of the first non-technically-oriented subjectsto thrive on the Internet. From the beginning, UFOs were a key part of theInternet. Still, 1986 was a long time before there was a world wide web, before therewas a graphical user interface, before visuals of any type could be displayed.There were bulletin boards, newsgroups, and a new thing called electronic mail,used by very few people. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s, the Internetconsisted essentially of white or green letters on a black screen. Yet even in those early years, it was immediately obvious that this wassomething very, very different than anything that had ever existed before.Comparing it to the invention of Gutenberg's printing press is not anoverstatement. Indeed, it may be an understatement. Like everything else, the UFO field was affected and transformed by theInternet. Previously, anyone wanting to share their thoughts on UFOs with therest of the world typically submitted articles to one of the journals, all ofwhich had editorial policies of some sort. This might reach a thousand readersif the author were fortunate. Certainly, one could research and write a book onthe subject, but realistically this is not something most people would do, thenor today. With Paranet, however, anyone with a computer and an Internet connectioncould find an audience. Believers, skeptics, geniuses, cranks, people with thebest motives, people who were hoaxing, and everyone else came out of thewoodwork. Almost immediately, they created a wild and thriving online community. Out Come the Leaks There is no question that Usenet enabled the explosion of leaks thatfollowed. Three early sources were Bill English, John Lear, and William Cooper.All three surfaced in 1987 and 1988, all three told various stories of allegedlyinside knowledge concerning some aspect of extraterrestrials or the UFOphenomenon. The stories have been compelling to many, but after all these years,none have been substantiated. In essentials, the accounts painted a picture of human-alien collaborationgone horribly awry. One of the main features of the scenario concerned a meetingbetween President Eisenhower and a group of extraterrestrials. This involved anexchange of sorts: technology going to humans while the ETs were permitted apeaceful and unobstructed presence on Earth, as well as permission to take asmall number of humans on occasion for their own purposes, to be brought safelyback without their knowledge. According to Lear, however, his sources told himthat the deal went wrong, and the aliens were now doing whatever they wanted.The human control group was powerless to stop it. Cooper followed up on Lear's claims with even more grandiose and darkstatements, reflecting his own growing megalomania and disconnection fromreality. Essentially, Cooper had a gift for claiming as his own information thatcame from other sources. Perhaps he had the ability to believe his own lies. Togive just one example, in 1988 Lear had sent Cooper a package containing anumber of documents and items, one of which was a poor quality copy of theZapruder film, depicting the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Thevideo showed the driver, William Greer, turning around briefly toward thePresident as he was shot. At that moment, there appeared to be a flash emanatingfrom Greer’s position. In reality, the flash was a reflection of sunlight on thehair of Greer’s supervisor, Roy Kellerman, who sat next to him. But Cooperbecame obsessed by the video. For ever after, he claimed that while in the U.S.Navy during the early 1970s, he had seen Top Secret documents stating that Greerhad been Kennedy’s shooter using a specially prepared gun by the CIA. To thosewho disagreed with him, he typically resorted to shouts and bully tactics. Itwas for reasons like this that veteran UFO researcher Don Ecker referred toCooper as “the most blatant B.S. artist I have ever run into.”[299][index_split_006.html#filepos1323124] It did not take long for serious researchers to spot problems with whatCooper was saying. By then, however, he had already become an iconic figure, astatus entrenched after his death in a shootout with police in October, 2001.Regarding this shootout (lest one think he was targeted for assassination)Cooper had for years been involved in local altercations, always carrying hisgun, and had long been wanted for tax evasion. He had vowed never to be takenalive. Before he was gunned down, he had shot one of the police officers in thehead. One lasting effect of Cooper, however, was an emphasis on the power structurethat existed behind-the-scenes, as it were, and the relationship of that powerstructure to the UFO cover-up. He wrote about the Illuminati, the Bilderbergers,the Jasons, and other groups which he said were instrumental in the cover-up ofthe UFO reality. Some of this information was useful insofar as he acquired itfrom credible sources, while much was just plain wrong.[300][index_split_006.html#filepos1323905] Many researchers have followed up andsimilarly concluded that there is indeed a cover-up on UFOs that exists beyondthe formal reaches of governments, whether American or otherwise. Bob Lazar and Area 51 As the field of ufology exploded during the late 1980s and early 1990s, thefield was overwhelmed with conflict and debate over each new claim thatappeared. Among the most heated of all arguments centered around Robert Lazar,who claimed to have been employed briefly to study the propulsion system of analien craft. Once again, as with the MJ-12 controversy and so much else since,to this day there are those who believe his account while others claim to havedebunked it. Lazar went public at the end of 1989 through a series of interviews with LasVegas journalist George Knapp. These described his experiences working at aplace most Americans had never heard of: a facility known as S-4, at a dry lakebed in Nevada called Papoose Lake. He claimed this was about ten miles south ofGroom Dry Lake, site of another obscure place (at least in 1989). That is, Area51. Today, people have access to tools such as Google Earth to look for evidenceof S-4. If one were to do so, they would essentially see nothing more than a fewnarrow dirt roads leading to and around it from Area 51. Nearby is the Nellisbombing range. Yet, it is true that Google Earth sometimes hides locations thatare sensitive for national security purposes. A number of places around theworld are intentionally blurred, blacked out, or blocked out in some way,including the famous NSA site at Pine Gap, Australia, a mile-square area nearthe Trinity Site in New Mexico, and quite a few others. Regarding S-4, there issimply no easy way to confirm its existence. While Lazar has retained many detractors over the years, others continue tosupport him strongly. It is worth mentioning, too, that even if his claims areuntrue in part or whole, there have been quite a few other Area 51 insiders whohave made similar statements about alien technology being near there, many ofwhom were interviewed by George Knapp under conditions of anonymity. Thus, more than twenty years after Lazar, his claims continue to becontroversial, unconfirmed, and debated. Welcome to the world of ufology. Rumors of Disclosure Around 1990 In retrospect, it should not be surprising that around 1990 or so, there werediscussions and rumors among researchers of an announcement that would revealthe existence and reality of UFOs. First of all, such rumors have circulated among UFO researchers since the1950s. Every decade has seen the rise and fall of anticipation aboutextraterrestrial “Disclosure.” It is hard to know how reliable most of theserumors were, but it does appear that there have been periodic discussions behindthe scenes about the pros and cons of doing so. I discussed this once with aprominent, publicly known scientist with a longtime association to theintelligence community. This man told me that such sorts of discussions occurevery five to ten years at high levels, presumably in government, although thespecifics were not made precisely clear. This individual, along with a colleague of his, also told me there werediscussions within the Bush White House in 1990 as to whether or not to announcethe UFO reality. As the Cold War withered away, so too it seemed one of theoriginal reasons for UFO secrecy. Yet, no announcement came. As it happens, theclaim of an aborted 1990 disclosure was also advanced by ex-U.S. Air ForceCaptain, Robert Collins, in his book, Exempt from Disclosure. Did it reallyhappen? We still do not have enough information yet. The Web and the First Wave of Research Disclosure from a Presidential announcement did not happen in 1990. Butsomething else did begin at around that time, and it rapidly accelerated as thedecade progressed. This was the sharing of information via the ever-expanding,ever-transforming Internet. The bulletin board system of the 1980s explodedduring the early 1990s. By the middle of the decade, the Internet grew wings. AWorld Wide Web was spreading, one with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The basic, revolutionary fact was that people were sharing moreinformation—much, much more information. News reports about UFOs were beingdistributed to a vastly wider and more engaged readership than in the pastbecause people who had an interest in this topic finally had found a way toreach each other, no matter where they lived in their country, or indeed theworld. At this time, there were several UFO-related news gathering services. Amongthese were Michael Lindemann's CNI, which ran for five years and was quitevaluable during the early 1990s. Other useful sources were Filer's Files byretired USAF Major George Filer, UFO Roundup by Joseph Trainor, and quite a fewothers. After 1996 and 1997, when the Web truly exploded, this type ofinformation grew even more. By the late 1990s, the amount of availableinformation was orders of magnitude beyond what had been available a mere decadeearlier, to say nothing of the decade prior to that. As more people gained access to the Internet, they became astonished at whatthey could find. As a way of tracking current events, the Internet quicklybecame essential. Even prior to the Web itself, email lists were becomingcommon, and allowed researchers to follow up on leads much more quickly thancould have happened earlier. Even so, the Internet was not fully mature by the late 1990s. Whileresearching my first UFO book at this time, the Internet was valuable to me, buteven so it was no substitute for printed books and journal articles. Yet, it wasinvaluable for helping to track down sources that would have been daunting tofind otherwise. It was a research tool of great value, a value which onlyincreased with each passing year. The Internet enabled people finally to escapethe heavy-handed censorship of UFO information that had predominated in themainstream media for so many years. 21st Century: Explosion The information highway of the 1990s expanded into a superhighway during thefirst few years of the 21st century. It is easy to forget that the year 2000 wasnot so long ago. Although it feels to us that the modern Internet has been withus forever, it is still so very young. What has happened is an explosion not merely of information but of ways toget it. The development of search engines alone has been revolutionary. Theirnear-omniscience is taken for granted by most people, but they are purely a 21stcentury phenomenon. Through Google, Yahoo, Bing, or other engines, UFO data ofany sort is instantly available, and relevant news can be sent to one’s mailboxevery day. There are an abundance of research-oriented websites. For sightings, at leastin North America, there is the National UFO Reporting Center, which records over5,000 sightings each year. The Black Vault, another valuable resource, is alarge repository of released government files on UFOs and a host of otherrelevant topics. These offer a mere sprinkling of what is out there. Of course, more information also means more mistakes. It also means moredisinformation or, at least, misleading information. The Internet has allowedmillions upon millions of people to contribute to the global conversation onUFOs, but that also means that there are effectively no standards necessary forjoining it. In all places at all times, making unsupported claims is the easiestthing to do in the world. In the world of today, unfortunately, many people donot care about providing valid evidence to support their claims. Indeed, it isobvious that many do not really understand how to go about such a thing. Worsestill are those who use the Internet to create false data and persona, and yetothers who use sensationalism to make a name themselves, and sometimes money. YouTube and Facebook It is startling to remember that YouTube did not exist until 2005. And yet itimmediately became the video showcase of human civilization and culture. For years, UFO researchers assumed that with the proliferation of more andbetter quality video cameras, at some point there would be a breakthrough.Someone would record something that would be considered undeniable proof of thereality of UFOs. Today, hundreds of new UFO videos uploaded each year toYouTube. Some of these videos seem extraordinary, others boring andinconsequential. Generally speaking, however, the quality of video isirrelevant. This is because, as we have discovered, video alone is no longerenough to count as evidence of UFOs. Which brings us to the great irony of the YouTube era. The current flood ofUFO videos, even many of which are apparently excellent in quality, has notbrought the definitive proof researchers had expected. This is because without aproper investigation of a case, without vetting witnesses, and indeed withoutpreparing some sort of professional report, these videos can never be anythingmore than intriguing entertainment or at best fodder for speculation. The factremains that most objects seen in the sky can be explained in conventionalterms, given enough time and energy to do the investigation. Nevertheless, there is no question that YouTube has provided an outlet forsome truly extraordinary videos, many of which I do think are valid captures ofwhat can only be called UFOs. In other words, YouTube is valuable, but it isonly one tool. Without being supplemented by responsible investigation, it willnever be enough for moving this issue forward. Of course, there is more to YouTube than UFO videos. The site is completewith thousands of lectures, interviews, documentaries, and insights fromresearchers worldwide. On that basis alone, it is of inestimable value as aneducational tool. It was not long ago that easy access to such information wassimply not possible for most people. Like YouTube, Facebook is a young institution that has redefined the way thatpeople interact with the world, and especially how they share information. Thebenefits and pitfalls are obvious. A flood of news passes through, much of whicheducates and inspires, much of which confuses and distracts. It spreadslegitimate news as easily as it spreads unfounded rumors from spurious sources.Facebook has become the headquarters of “copy and paste reporting.” There are always people who thrive on drama. In a world that is filled withgenuine conspiracies and subterranean machinations, such people find it easy tolatch onto stories that confirm their darkest fears, even if they lack properattribution or means of verification. For such people, the craving forsensationalism is like a drug. Unfortunately, there are always people willing topromote such stories, sometimes for fame, sometimes for money. So much more information is available. But the need for sober anddispassionate investigation of claims has never left us. Today, it is arguablymore necessary than ever before. The Decline of Professional Journalism Unfortunately, just when more than ever we need professional journalists withbravery and integrity, they have become an endangered species. Free,professional journalists have long been understood as the backbone of afunctioning representational government. Yet, the past generation witnessed thesteady decline of the journalistic profession. Mergers of once-independent newspapers have left people with fewer and fewerindependent voices. In particular, the integration of media conglomerates withother corporate entities, such as the ownership of NBC by NBC Universal, whichis simply a holding company for GE and Comcast. That matters because GE hasbeen, year in and year out, one of the largest defense contractors in the UnitedStates. MSNBC is co-owned by NBC and Microsoft. Such types of arrangements arethe case with all major media. The other very few major owners of media areDisney, News Corporation, Time Warner, Viacom, and CBS. These huge entities ownmost of the dominant voices in American television, radio, newspapers,magazines, motion pictures. They also have a dominant presence throughout muchof the world. Realistically, their interlocking partnerships with each otheressentially make them the same mega-corporation. It would be interesting tolearn how much overlap exists among the dominant shareholders of thesecorporations, although this type of information is proprietary and thereforeoff-limits. At the same time that media mergers have created such bloated giants, genuinejournalism and investigation have been determined to be too expensive. Muchcheaper, it turns out, is spouting mere opinion. Thus, we see everywhere thatopinion is masked as news. The result is the most corporate-friendly brand of journalism ever seen inhistory. We are faced with a mainstream news media that is completely in bedwith powerful corporate and private interests, and is closely connected tonational security interests. Such an outcome is toxic to real journalism, to say nothing of libertyitself, which depends in part upon a free press. All the more difficult, too,for engaged citizens who care about UFOs to find a piece of solid ground uponwhich to stand. It is all the more reason that such citizens must do itthemselves. Whistleblowers, Real and Alleged The world has become wide open. We are near the point where anyone can speakto anyone, anyone can say anything—with the important proviso that they notviolate the ever-expanding definition of what constitutes national security. Ageneration ago, alleged whistleblowers such as Bob Lazar were relatively rare.Now, new claims appear seemingly every week. Project Camelot, managed for yearsby Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan, has interviewed many of these individuals. Someof them interviews are fascinating and provide valuable information. Some haveclaimed to be insiders with sensitive information that has proven difficult orimpossible to prove. Others have been roundly criticized as disinformants. It is not hard to see why we might be drawn to such sources. We realize thatthe mainstream system of news reporting is not merely woefully inadequate, butirremediably unreliable, self-serving, and corrupt. We know, instinctively andfactually, that we are being lied to every day by a structure of power thatwants to control and pacify the great masses of humanity. So, when we hearsomeone who claims to have inside information about the true situation, we wantto listen, and maybe believe. Still, many of these alleged whistleblowers have failed to confirm theirclaims, or even their own credentials. You don’t get to be a whistleblower ifyou can’t reach that first step of verification. Some have been investigated andshown to be frauds. The rest just seem to come and go. They make theirallegations, then they disappear never to be heard from again, like theanonymous Norwegian politician who in 2008 who claimed there were massiveunderground facilities for the global elite to use when “Planet X” arrived notlater than 2012. Mass death would ensue.[301][index_split_006.html#filepos1324435] This is not to single out Project Camelot,because it remains important for private efforts like theirs and others to keepsearching for legitimate information about our world. Such information certainlywon’t fall like ripe fruit from the national security establishment. Yet,unverifiable and even alarmist claims are everywhere. Today, they typicallyarrive as a new Facebook rumor to steal our attention and then move on. They area distraction to genuine research, and students of our world’s unseemlyunderbelly need rigor and caution when dealing with them. Beyond legitimate investigators who are simply out on the fringe and takingchances, there are certain public individuals, connected however loosely to UFOresearch, who make prediction after prediction, often based on unverifiable“inside sources.” Such predictions are never of trivial matters, but of major,globally transformative events. Whether predicting the so-called Project BlueBeam event, the approach of the comets Elenin or ISON, mythical secret wars,destructions of the secret bases operated by the so-called “black hats,” or theincessant claims of imminent Disclosure of UFOs and extraterrestrials by theU.S. President, these so-called researchers have nothing to do with the properstudy of UFOs. They merely pile on to the rumor mill, gaining notoriety andwebsite hits while providing endless distractions from real work. This is unfortunate because undoubtedly there are real, actual people outthere who are trying to be whistleblowers. Such people may well fear that theirsignal will be lost amid the noise that permeates the alternative researchcommunity. Increase of Sightings As if all this extra noise did not pose enough of a challenge, we havesomething else to consider. UFO reports have been on a dramatic increase sincethe 1990s. Here are the numbers from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC):[302][index_split_006.html#filepos1324884]> > > 1990: 277> > > 1995: 1422> > > 2000: 3031> > > 2001: 3477> > > 2002: 3624 2003: 43662004: 46932005: 44462006: 40762007: 4652 2008: 51882009: 48682010: 45422011: 52262012: 77742013: 7086 Perhaps people are genuinely seeing more UFOs than in prior years. After all,we might theorize that the beings responsible for the phenomenon would be moreinterested in us now than previously. But realistically, most of this increaseis due to the ease of reporting. The NUFORC website began accepting live reportsfrom the public during the late 1990s. Before that, people needed to call in byphone, which meant they needed to obtain the phone number somehow, or else theyreached the center via other organizations. As emailing submissions becamestandard, and especially as more and more people became connected to the web,reports skyrocketed. This explains the ten-fold rise of UFO reports during the1990s, from less than 300 per year to 3,000 per year. The growth has continued,spiking sharply in 2003 to well over 4,000 sightings, to more than 5,000 in2008, and over 7,000 in 2012 and 2013! The contrast with earlier decades is stark. During the days of Project BlueBook, the largest number of reports in one year, by far, was during 1952 whenthe Air Force received just over 1,500. That was considered an incredible amountat the time, but would have amounted to roughly two months of sightings during2012. With NUFORC accepting anywhere from 5,000 to perhaps 8,000 sightings during agiven year, we are talking about an average of fifteen to twenty UFOs beingreported to that site each day. Consider, too, NUFORC is devoted nearlyexclusively to North American sightings. Not only this, but NUFORC is not eventhe only major website that records UFO sightings in North America. There is,after all, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), which publishes roughly 6,000 or moresightings per year, in other words, about the same number as NUFORC.Undoubtedly, there is some overlap, although researchers really have no idea howmuch since no one has done the work to find out. But, it would seem conservativeto state there are over 10,000 UFO reports made in North America each year fromthese two websites alone. That might translate to perhaps thirty or more eachday. As messy as the data collection system is in North America, it is vastlybetter than what exists elsewhere. There are outstanding UFO researchers livingin all parts of the world, but much greater organization is needed. At a bareminimum, there need to be civilian-based organizations that can accept UFOreports from the public, and then have some ability to follow-up, at least onsome of the more promising cases. One thing ufology needs to do—certainly not the only thing—is to develop anannual compendium of UFO reports from around the world. The capability nowexists. Imagine how useful it would be if research groups from North America,Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa all collaborated and shared theirdata. Now, well into the 21st century, there is no reason for this not tohappen. Of course, other problems will remain. After all, how can can these thousandsof reports ever receive proper investigations? With what money? What resources? The Need for Proper Investigations With the foregoing in mind, it is easy to appreciate the value of the feworganizations that do any systematic and rational investigation of UFO reports.Of these, MUFON is the most prominent in the western hemisphere, perhaps theworld. If this is so, and with no intended disparagement of MUFON, then globalufology is in a sad state of affairs. MUFON exists on a threadbare budget. It has roughly two thousand members, andperhaps a few hundred investigators. Of these, there are a mere handful of trulydedicated, active investigators who can be relied upon to follow through withsolid investigations, research, analysis, and reporting. After all, they do thison their own money and time. Yet, it must be said, that despite the manyobstacles in their way, MUFON's investigators have made an irreplaceablecontribution to ufology. Without someone to investigate a report, we are leftonly with claims and counter-claims, but no progress in obtaining reliableknowledge. MUFON's greatest assets are its investigators who do the work and strive toadhere to scientific ufology. As long as the organization can retain people likethat, it can have a future. But it has never grown. Since its foundation in the 1960s, MUFON’s membershiphas hovered at around two or three thousand. Considering the immense popularityof the UFO subject around the world, how can this be? A key reason is a historical failure of leadership, and ultimately a lack ofvision and imagination. Looking back at nearly half a century of activity, whathas MUFON really done? The answer is: it has collected reports, investigatedwhat it could, published a small journal for its members, and held annualsymposia. That is about it. Amid all of its data collection, MUFON has consistently failed to provide aclear message to the rest of the world. How much more effective its research anddata collection would have been had it taken the effort to compile and publishsomething like an annual report. The U.S. Air Force did this during itsoperation of Project Blue Book, but of course, what MUFON could do would be somuch better. It could create something along the lines of a twenty to fifty pagereport, prepared by competent writers. It could include a statistical analysisof the annual sightings, along with the number of true unidentifieds for theyear, something researchers have not seen on a large scale since Blue Bookclosed in 1969. Such an annual report might also include brief summaries of thetop ten or twenty reports of the year. MUFON has never attempted even this basic piece of public relations. Byitself, it would go very far to establish it as the “go to” organization in theeyes of the media, and would improve its credibility with the general public,perhaps even the academic and scientific community. I should add here that in2013 I had a conversation with MUFON’s new International Director, Jan Harzan.He told me that this now is indeed a goal of the organization, which surelywould be a positive step. But this longstanding failure is only part of a larger symptom of MUFON’sbasic problem. Because, although it possesses more of a grassroots history thanother American UFO organizations, it has still generally failed to engage orinspire its own members. For years, members have complained about data goinginto MUFON and never coming out. Hand in hand with such complaints have beensuspicions about the national security and intelligence community connectionsthat have always dominated MUFON’s Board of Directors. Certainly, it is a Boardthat selects its own members, allowing minimal input from the rank and filemembership. In other words, MUFON has not demonstrated that it is anything more than aclosed, old-boy network that takes time and resources from its members, butgives little in return to its members or the world. If the organization does notreform, it will only be a matter of time before another organization, one whichresonates with the public, will make MUFON irrelevant. Such a turn of events caneasily happen quickly and unexpectedly, and MUFON will be no more. To prevent such an eventuality, its path is clear: it must institute trulydemocratic change that will allow its members to feel that they have a stake init. Such things are always possible. Whether or not MUFON can actually do thisis less clear, not while its current structure remains in place. More thananything else, it needs a cool, fresh breeze and a great deal of sunshinepouring in. We should sincerely hope this happens, because someone needs to bedoing proper UFO investigations. The Modern Armchair Researcher Although we need responsible organizations to conduct proper investigationsof UFO sightings and create public reports of their activities, ultimately itcomes down to each person doing all he or she can. Unlike during earlier eras, most of our interaction with the UFO topic todaycomes through the Internet. Whether via Facebook, YouTube, or a website, peoplelearn almost everything online. The amount of information can be overwhelming,and is certainly not always true. This means that each person must become his orher own best investigator. What we need, before anything else, is a properphilosophy. We need principles by which we can create order out of chaos. The first principle is a commitment to check facts and sources. Any claim,whether by a well-known researcher or someone previously unknown, needs to bequestioned and investigated. We must be in the habit of asking certain basicquestions. On what basis is the claim being made? What is the evidence broughtforth? Can the evidence be examined independently, whether by other researchersor even by ourselves? Can we determine whether the author has an unnamed agenda? In conducting such research, it is important to find the original source ofthe allegation. There are a number of ways to do this. As an example, we mayconsider the claims around the notorious Project “Blue Beam.” Today, there arecountless websites and YouTube videos discussing this alleged plan. It has manyvariations, but in essentials it revolves around a clandestine group creating a“false flag” scenario (whether as a staged alien invasion, a second coming ofChrist, or some similarly terrifying event) which would then frighten peopleinto submitting to a totalitarian New World Order. Each day, new people areexposed to this claim. Naturally, they wonder if it might be true. The first thing to do is subject it to a web search. A Google entry on “BlueBeam” quickly leads to the site “Rational Wiki,” a well-known skeptical website.There, one finds a description of the origins of the idea: one Serge Monast, adeceased French Quebecois who first discussed it publicly in 1994. We learnfurther that the likely origin of that idea was a 1991 episode of Star Trek: TheNext Generation, which in turn derived from a script written by Gene Roddenberryduring the 1970s. While the tone of Rational Wiki is sarcastic andunprofessional (the site stridently debunks conspiracies and claims of theparanormal), information is provided that one can further examine andverify.[303] [index_split_006.html#filepos1325146] Obviously, relying on one source is not a good idea, but it is a start. Ournext step is to locate the very first instance the phrase “Blue Beam” to appearon the Internet. Since web searches can locate sites going back to the early1990s, they now cover a sizable portion of our recent history. The good news is that such a search is possible via Google’s search engine,by typing in “blue beam” and selecting “Search tools.” A drop down menu appears,and one selection allows for searching by date. Unfortunately, the capabilitydoes not yet exist to obtain all results in complete chronological order, butthe next-best-thing is that one can perform discrete searches, for instance yearby year. We quickly learn that an “Operation Blue Beam” was used by French and Belgianparatroopers in the nation of Zaire in 1991. Clearly, not the Blue Beam we areseeking. Also, unfortunately, the method is not perfect, as a number of apparent“hits” from early years actually lead to sites of later years—the originalwebsite may have been from 1992, but it may also have been updated. Researchersneed to check each link to confirm the actual date of the site. But diligencedoes pay off with Google’s date search feature. Lo and behold! We find that theearliest reference to Project Blue Beam appeared on June 14, 1994, in an issueof a small American journal, Contact: The Phoenix Project. This was a journalwith an idiosyncratic, religious agenda, which discussed many conspiracies, realand alleged. It also seemed to have a great love of the all-caps feature.Incidentally, the publisher of that journal later claimed credit for avertingthe Blue Beam catastrophe by his exposure of the plot.[304][index_split_006.html#filepos1325594] We find that the initial formulation of Blue Beam was a purely evangelicalChristian formulation, which promised a false rapture and many other false“signs” that would cause people to turn away from the true faith and make wayfor the Anti-Christ. Serge Monast predicted Blue Beam for several occasions,most notably the Year 2000. After nothing happened at that time, the ideamorphed increasingly into an ET-invasion scenario. This is the value of date search: it can allow researchers to find, fairlyquickly, the history of an idea or claim over the past several decades. This isan excellent way to see how various themes, memes, tropes, and claims haveentered our society. Very often, when seeing the original instance of a piece ofinformation, a researcher can make a better determination of its validity. Notalways, but often. It is also interesting, up to a certain point, to see howmany websites simply copy and paste their information from each other. Onequickly learns that such behavior is endemic. Another tool that any armchair researcher should know is the reverse-imagesearch. Like the Date Search feature, it is powerful and underutilized. The ideaof reverse image search is simple: a jpeg file is uploaded or dragged into theImage Search bar. Then, through image identification software, all examples ofthat image which exist on the web are displayed. The first company to offer thiswas TinEye, which debuted its search engine in May 2008. Yet, it was notcomprehensive or especially well-known. Matters were different when Googlerolled out its very powerful version of reverse image searching in June 2011. Ina short period of time, reverse image searches have exposed many alleged imagesof UFOs or alien bodies as hoaxes, either from movie stills or other sources. [images/00030.jpg]Using Google reverse image search in 3 steps: a powerful tool. YouTube is another place where UFO researchers spend a lot of their time. Aspreviously discussed, it is important to remember that a video alone does notconstitute sufficient evidence for the reality of a UFO. Yet, some videosundoubtedly are worth follow-up effort. In such cases, probably the first orderof business is simply watching the video carefully and reading the commentsbelow. In all likelihood, someone has already provided a useful insight. But forreal followup, a researcher will want to contact the uploader of the video.Doing this is essential for several reasons. First of all, for genuine videoanalysis to be done, the original, highest-resolution copy must be available,and this can only be obtained from the uploader. Also, however, the uploader maybe able to answer key questions, (assuming he or she recorded the video) or maybe able to discuss the incident, or perhaps produce other witnesses, and ingeneral help find a way for independent researchers to investigate further. Allof this is basic follow-up investigation, and well within the capabilities ofmost researchers and students of UFOs. [images/00007.jpg]Alleged UFOs (circled) over London, 2011. One of many such fake videos to befound on YouTube. It should be added that researchers who spend any time with UFO videos shouldtake the time to study video editing software, such as Adobe After Effects. Oneneed not become an expert. But anyone can learn via some basic web searching andtutorials about techniques and capabilities for spotting video manipulation. Another important policy for serious researchers is to become familiar withwebsites that host active bulletin boards relating to UFOs. It is true thatthere are always a number of people at these sites who are simply trolls andobstructionists. Nevertheless, such sites, such as abovetopsecret.com,alienscientist.com, and many others, usually have contributors with genuineinsights. They are useful because no one is an island. No one alone has the timeor resources to unravel and answer every nagging question they encounter. Othershave frequently done the work before us, and there is no point in letting theirhard work go to waste. Researchers must also remember that skepticism is a good thing. UFOs areelusive. Whatever they represent does not readily reveal itself to us. Mistakenassumptions and false conclusions are common and understandable. It is thereforewise and appropriate to hold our own conclusions at bay until we gain as muchinformation as possible, and at all times we must be willing to change ourminds. For this reason, serious researchers must always seek out skepticalperspectives. Those who believe in the reality of UFOs may disagree withskeptics on many important matters. Indeed, many skeptics turn their positionsinto a religion of sorts, in the process combining a relentless ignorance of thetopic with insufferable arrogance. But skeptics are essential to helping ufologymove forward. First of all, on many specific cases, skepticism is entirely justified.History shows that the large majority of raw UFO reports are explainable inconventional terms. Responsible research must search for ways to debunk UFOcases, not because of an ideology that says such things are impossible, butbecause we must adhere to high standards of evidence before making strongclaims. Pragmatically speaking, it is worth remembering that understanding theskeptical position on a particular case can save a researcher embarrassmentlater on, especially when they discover that a case they have supported foryears turns out to be entirely prosaic. Such things happen, after all. Moreover,when we encounter a good skeptical argument, but are still able to see why itfalls short, we have strengthened our understanding of the case underexamination. Any time we assume we have all the answers, and that the so-calledenemy has nothing to contribute, we become victims of our own limited worldview. In general, researchers and students of UFOs should cultivate a calm attitudeand an unwillingness to become overly stressed when encountering new claims andinformation. Rather than rendering snap judgments, give time for new informationand perspectives to sink in. In an era as volatile as our own, we would do wellto be more prudent in our judgment and statements. So, when the latest and greatest UFO sighting comes your way, take your time.Read through comments and analyses offered by other people, and not merely thosealready inclined to agree with you. Most of all, beware of people who make grandiose claims of any sort. They arenever to be trusted. If you doubt this, go back through history at the manygreat and grand predictions which never passed.[305][index_split_006.html#filepos1326052] Talk is cheap. In such matters, I recallthe wise and true words of my father, a veteran New York City police officer. Healways told me: money talks, bullshit walks. The Philosophical Divide Over the last generation, we have seen several transformations in what we maycall the alternative community. One element is political, in which it has becomeever more radicalized, particularly since September 11, 2001. But, there hasbeen a philosophical shift as well. Lacking a perfect label for it, perhaps wecan simply call it the arrival of New Age thinking. The overall result of thishas been mixed. In the first place, old fashioned materialistic ufology has limitations. Asfar back as the 1960s and 1970s, researchers had been pointing out that the UFOphenomenon is strange, and seemed to be beyond our conventional understanding ofscience. At the same time, contemporary science, especially physics, has openedup new vistas of thought, such as quantum entanglement, non-locality, and otherconcepts that seem in line to some degree at least with some ancient beliefsabout the power of the mind, even mind over matter. In other words, everythingwe encounter in New Age culture. Consider quantum entanglement (which will be discussed at greater length in alater chapter). This is something physicists have noted and discussed since the1930s. Entanglement happens when certain tiny particles, such as photons andelectrons, interact physically, then become separated, but then continue to actas a pair in terms of their position, momentum, spin, polarization and more,even across great distances. How does this happen? In other words, they seem tobe connected or in some sort of communication. Especially odd is that theeffects appear to transcend the speed limit of transmitting information; thatis, faster than light. Small wonder that Einstein once called it “spooky actionat a distance.” There has also been work done on remote viewing, much of which has beenwithin the U.S. intelligence community. Despite what the propaganda has said,remote viewing works. That is, human beings have indeed been able to “see”things remotely, not merely across space but seemingly across time. What doesthis mean regarding the fabric of our reality? How is it possible that someonecan see something on the other side of the world, or something that has not yethappened in our time stream? Doubly so with claims of remote influencing, evenremote killing, as in the real story behind The Men Who Stare at Goats. There are several reasons why this relates to ufology. One is the apparentcapability of these objects to violate our known laws of physics by appearing ordisappearing, accelerating instantly, floating people through walls and ceilingsand so on. Another is the apparent capability of these beings to enter ourminds. We see this again and again in the research. In other words, the mind is important to this field in ways that earliergenerations of researchers did not understand. We need to explore this in waysthat make sense scientifically. Our problem is that we are still at a point where confirming mind to mindcommunication is difficult, if not impossible. Still more problematic are claimsby people—a growing number each year, it seems—to have received telepathiccommunications, or channeled transmissions, from other entities, many of whomare said to be extraterrestrial. It is not that such claims are necessarily false. After all, if we allow forsome level of remote viewing in ourselves, this is something that may well bepart of human nature itself. It should not be ruled out a priori that unusualtypes of communication are impossible. Instead, the problem is that until we find a way to understand channeledcommunications more scientifically, and more importantly to find a way to verifyor disprove them, they cannot be considered valid types of evidence. They may betrue, or not. Yet, unless outsiders can test such claims in some manner, it isan unfair burden placed on others when asking for their belief. As an aside, my own conclusion is that the large majority of claimedchanneled transmissions and telepathic “downloads” are false. Sadly, there is aprevalence among too many to disregard the concepts of science when reviewingsuch claims. During the buildup to the “Great Event” of December 21, 2012, the Internetwas flooded with sites that discussed the coming transformation of humanity,almost always referred to as humanity's ascension or awakening. The attitudeamong many was so strident, so certain, that it was frequently considered anunarguable fact. Logic was absent. One statement from a typical blog expressedthe mindset very well:> If you don’t understand or feel the concept of transformation of self,> ascension, awakening, then, really, what do you know? It means you haven’t> experienced the awakening which, by the way, it is not scientifically> proven... and in that case, you are a rationalist with no faith or contact> with the divine, and the age of rationalism has passed, thank God. I hope you> will get to a point when you will use the reason of the heart and not focus so> exclusively on the physical mind that can only perceive illusion.[306]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1326484] This is a perspective with a long history. It differs not a bit from theperspective of the earliest Christians, and indeed of most of the world'sspiritual traditions. It states that truth must be perceived. It must be felt.That what we call objective reality is an illusion, and not the true reality.This belief usually includes the idea that humanity's power of mind is verygreat, perhaps infinite, and that after we achieve a transformation, orawakening, or ascension, we will become as gods, with power to control our worldthrough the mind. This type of thinking is not part of ufology, as such, in that it is notdirectly concerned with the study of UFOs. Yet, it is in the air, permeating thealternative field to a greater or lesser degree. In many cases, as in the abovestatement, it constitutes a direct refutation of science. Elsewhere, it tries tomerge the science of non-locality with New Age mysticism, nearly all of whichderives from the Theosophy of individuals like Helena Blavatsky, Alice Bailey,and even Aleister Crowley. We would be foolish to reject such attempts out of hand. All new ideas,especially those that have sprung from deep-seated human needs, and which are sowidespread, should be studied for what they can offer. But we should rememberthat all new philosophical developments contain much that is eventuallydiscarded. The best course is to react with deliberation while we incorporate thescience of the mind into ufology. While we do so, channelers and others who makeunverifiable predictions must be held accountable for their claims. Thatincludes seeking out skeptical arguments that debunk their claims, for there isno question that some of these individuals are fakes through and through. Simplybecause it may be possible in theory that a person can “hear” anextraterrestrial in his or her mind does not mean that some other person istelling the truth when they claim to communicate with beings from Andromeda. Orthat they time traveled, or went to Mars, or that on December 21, 2012 (or nowsome future date), you will transform into a crystalline entity without the needto eat food, and that all the nasty problems humanity currently faces will besolved. Only fools discard the tried and true rules of evidence for a pile of magicbeans. Ufology’s Future Whether the current leaders and thinkers in UFO research recognize this ornot, this discipline must remain up-to-date. It must be based on soundscientific principles, but with the ability to embrace fresh ideas and newtechnologies. What is needed is leadership. Not merely from the head of whateverorganizations may exist, but true leaders wherever they may be. Until the secrets are all disclosed, or until these other beings announcethemselves to us, we will remain at the stage of trying to record, understand,and explain this mystery. In the coming years and decades, we will be seeing newtechnologies introduced that will help us to do this. As recently as the dawn ofthe 21st century, few people could have foreseen that cell phones would becapable of sharing so much information, or indeed that they would surpasscomputers as the dominant form of Internet connectivity. Who knows what the nextfew decades will bring. Today, you can search databases of UFO sightings that were not available evenrecently. You can download an app on your smartphone that keeps you informed onnew UFO sightings in your area, or any area. MUFON has such an app, and itcertainly does not perform as intended, but the idea is excellent and eventuallysuch an app will be perfected. Phones will continue to evolve and acquire new capabilities, perhapsdetecting infrared signals or electromagnetic disturbances. The possibilitiesseem endless. It is essential for researchers to remain aware of thesedevelopments and use them. Of course, we need the technology in order to communicate and learn from eachother. The value of YouTube has already been discussed, but beyond this, we facea future of ubiquitous video conferencing and live streaming. Already, thesetechnologies are both starting to make a difference in ufology. They need to bepushed further. Ultimately, however, no matter how far into the future ufology goes, it mustcontinue to rely upon sound investigations and proper reporting of results thatactually reach the public. Scientific ufology, but with modern leadership,political savvy, and a commitment to the people. Ufology: Getting Personal One thing I have learned in my two decades of studying the UFO phenomenon isthat it has the power to captivate someone’s attention and become an obsession.I will never forget my first year of true attention and research into thisfield, and the many nights of lying in my bed, staring at the ceiling, trying toreconfigure my worldview in a way that made sense with the new facts I hadlearned. For myself, the feeling was more akin to an intense intellectualcuriosity than anything else, a “splinter in the mind” (in the words of thecharacter Morpheus from the movie, The Matrix). For some, however, the effectgoes deeper still. I have seen personalities become nearly destabilized by theeffect of having their once-stable worldview shaken or even shattered by thesubject of UFOs. I don’t know of a sure-fire method to prevent this from happening to certainpeople. We are all different. There are some people, who knows why, who seem toroll with this transformation more easily than others. In some cases, however,there are those who become convinced that they have had experiences of some sortwith this phenomenon, including direct contact with these other intelligences.Such people may be correct or not, but there is no question that their newinformation affects them deeply. They become obsessed by this subject in a waythat consumes their lives, sometimes in an unhealthy way. It is a difficultthing for any person to reinvent their basic understanding of the world,especially after they reach a mature age. No one wants to go through thatprocess, because it is an implicit recognition that their many prior years werespent living in a kind of illusory world. Ironically, it is often those with a higher level of formal education whoseem to have a hard time with this. After all, they have spent those yearsconvinced that they were ahead of the game, that they were more knowledgeablethan the average person about how the world works, and invested much of theirself-esteem and identity into that understanding. But it can happen to anyone. All of this is made harder by the fact by their belief that most of theirfriends, family, and colleagues would either not believe them, or might evenridicule them. And so while they go through this difficult transformation, thereare often very few people they can talk to about it. Added to this is another problem. Once someone decides that this is a subjectworth their attention, they usually realize that there is an overabundance ofinformation and literature. It can feel overwhelming, especially if one isstarting not only with a limited knowledge of the subject, but often arelatively limited knowledge of science, history, philosophy, politics,psychology, or any number of other subjects that are certainly helpful innavigating one’s way through this tangled field. But the challenge is harder still when we remember that most people haveother responsibilities in their lives: family, jobs, social obligations and therest. If they work long hours, as many do, they are tired when they come homeand are probably not in the mood to do hours of research, day after day, to helprecreate some semblance of an ordered reality, especially when that new realityis much less congenial and reassuring than what they had once known. Moreover,they probably don’t want to fight the machine, they don’t want to be heroes;they just want a good life. Ufology is not a subject for the faint of heart. Like all great questions ofwhich the human mind is capable—Does the soul exist? Is all of realityexplainable by science? Is there a God? Do all people have inalienable rights?Is it possible for human beings to create a just civilization?—the question, Isthere another advanced intelligence operating covertly on Planet Earth? is onethat demands many qualities. One is patience. Another is persistence. Yetanother is courage. The act of exploring this subject in the depth it deservesexacts a transformation not merely of our previous worldview, which is hardenough. It changes ourselves, deeply and truly. Chapter 10Who Are They? What Do They Want? Perhaps this is the most difficult of all subjects within ufology.Unfortunately for us, it is also the most important. No matter how many facetswe explore of this endlessly fascinating subject, we ultimately arrive at TheQuestion: who or what are we dealing with? It is a question that has engagedevery mind that has ever approached the subject of UFOs, and a definitive answerhas eluded its most brilliant thinkers. The Problem of Human Perception In a subject as cloudy as determining who these beings are, we must be awareof the quality of evidence. In every case, the specifics come down to witnesstestimony. Skeptics rightly point out that, given the fallibility of humanperception and memory, witness testimony by itself is problematic as evidence. Of course, UFO skeptics go further, asserting that anyone who claims toremember an alien abduction is not remembering a real event in any objectivesense. Instead, it is usually asserted, there is some level of confabulationinvolved. That is not to say that the alleged abductee is lying, but that somelevel of faulty memory is at work. Indeed, there are a number of cases wherethis has clearly been so. It is true that a person can remember something thatdid not actually happen, particularly while under hypnotic regression, andespecially when that session is conducted by someone who is leading theirimagination. In the first place, the human mind has the ability to create vividscenarios. In the second place, we all have some ability to fool ourselves, andeveryone has at some point in their life misremembered something important. Evenif alien abductions are real, confabulation is always a possibility. Suppose an alien abduction has taken place. How likely would it be that theabductee had a perfect memory of the event? Management of human memory is real.Intelligence and military agencies have been working on this problem since the1940s. Even the psychiatric profession quite openly has published a great amountof research on human memory management.[307][index_split_006.html#filepos1326750] We have strong evidence that this has beenof importance to the CIA, KGB, and other intelligence agencies.[308][index_split_006.html#filepos1327432] I once interviewed a former U.S. Air Forceintelligence specialist who had what strongly appeared to be a memory erasureprocess upon discharge from her service at Okinawa in 1982. This was done to herby the U.S. military, or some group in the U.S. intelligence system, using acombination of counseling, drugs, and electronic stimulation of the brain (ESB). Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that some people are havingencounters with entities, or an advanced species. Let us further assume thatthese beings may not want the abductees to have a meaningful recollection of theevent. It seems quite possible, even likely, that they would take their ownsteps to thwart that person’s memory. For this reason alone, abduction memoriesshould be accepted with caution. Having said this, it seems unreasonable to adopt an ultra-skeptical positionthat human perception and memory are inherently unreliable. Granted, ourmemories are incomplete and sometimes faulty, but all of us have memories, andmost of our memories are generally accurate. For example, I distinctly recallbeing on a roller coaster ride as a boy one summer, feeling absolutelypetrified. I remember the feeling of desperately wanting to get off, and ofbeing in tears. I remember my mother greeting me when the ride was over, but Idon’t remember the exact year. Was I six or seven years old? Where exactly wasI? What did I do for the rest of that day? These are things I do not remember,but I know I had the experience. To doubt all witness testimony or recollectionssimply because they are held to be inherently unreliable is irrational. It is anattitude not supported by human experience. Therefore, if we accept the validity of witness testimony and recollections,we may well be inclined to believe that these beings are alien in some way oranother, and that they are interested in us. It is helpful at this point to remember that the UFO phenomenon itself restson a more solid foundation than simply witness recollection. It also includesrecorded instrumentation, military documents, and more. This is importantbecause such sightings and encounters clearly beg the question of who or what isbehind the phenomenon. When we encounter something that is more advanced thananything that is supposed to exist, along with claims of some people to haveencountered advanced non-human intelligences, then we are at least justified inmaking some provisional or hypothetical conclusions. All of which means that the thoughts that follow in this chapter are morespeculative than most other aspects of the UFO phenomenon. They do not alwayspossess the certainty one would like. Such is life. Sometimes, all we can do isto make the best hypothesis we can at the time, and move on. So. Who. Are. They? After his book, Communion, was published in 1987, Whitley Strieber receivednearly 140,000 letters from people around the world over the next seven years,all claiming to have had alien encounters.[309][index_split_006.html#filepos1327814] Aside from the staggering number of letters and claims, several things standout. In the first place, most of the writers reported experiencing a lifetime ofstrange encounters and experiences, many of which involved other family members.In addition, a large portion of these people reported experiencing the kind ofabduction scenario that has become so widely recognized, in which small graybeings took them aboard a UFO and subjected them to intrusive medicalprocedures. Even more interesting, however, is that a larger number did not describe suchan abduction experience. Instead, they described encounters with other types ofbeings: insect-like beings, reptoids, and several different human types such asAsian-Orientals, Nordics, and robed beings in the manner of Greek gods. Therewere even descriptions of beings of pure light. A large majority, roughly eighty percent, described having a positiveexperience in one way or another. But it seemed obvious that most of theseinteractions were at a very high level of strangeness. These letters made itclear that encounters with these non-human beings was a complex phenomenon, andbeings themselves seemed to be highly complex. Of course, it certainly would have been nice had someone taken a reliablephotograph of any of these beings. Such elusiveness continues to make this topicso difficult. Yet the accounts keep coming. What do we make of these varied beings? Do they represent different groups?If so, what might their own relationships be among each other? Do they cooperatewith one another, or do they compete? There is yet another type of being that many people claim to haveencountered. These are entities said to be channeled by certain individuals, orsomehow reached telepathically. Here, we are dealing with experiences that wouldappear to have nothing to do with UFOs or ufology. Except for one thing: many ofthese communications are alleged to originate from advanced beings fromelsewhere in the universe. As a result, this has become a large part of the UFOcommunity, if we can call it that. These messages can be appealing to people,but that is a separate matter from whether or not they come fromextraterrestrials. Regarding that point, It should be obvious that channeledcommunications are not valid evidence unless they can provide information thatis clearly unknown to the channeler and can be verified independently. We willreturn to this idea. First, let us look at the other types of alien beings people claim toencounter. The Grays The Grays became ubiquitous in popular culture for a simple reason: they wereeasily the most commonly described entity among people who spoke to UFOresearchers. They seemed to be everywhere. Moreover, it does not make sense tosuggest they are a screen memory for some sort of covert human activity. In thefirst place, the memories of these beings are often submerged within a person’smemory for a long time. Secondly, when such memories are recovered, the actionsof these beings, their movements, sounds, and behaviors scream not human! Thisis not a case of human abductors wearing alien masks. Variations of the Grays have appeared in reports for many decades. True, thedescriptions of extraterrestrials from the 1950s and 1960s describe beingsrather different from the typical Gray. Even so, such descriptions, from Europeand South America, as well as some of the earliest American abduction cases ofthe 1960s, portray beings with basic similarities: very short in height and(often) large, roundish heads. Even today, however, multiple types of Gray are reported. Not all witnessrecollections describe them as having solid black eyes. Some accounts describelarge, almond-shaped eyes, but with vertical slits for pupils, giving a cat-likeor reptile-like effect. Moreover, some Grays are nearly as tall as a human male,while others are two or three feet tall. Some are extremely thin while othersmore stoutly built. There are a number of other variations, as well. Despite the variations, there are enough consistent accounts that we can tryto give a picture of the Grays. If anything stands out, it is that they areconducting a widespread and secret abduction program. They take their targetedpeople usually when they are easiest to take, either at home, usually in themiddle of the night, or sometimes while driving. Secretiveness is key for them.It is absolutely essential for them to maintain cover over their program. Their capabilities are extremely formidable, far beyond our own. They caninduce physical paralysis or unconsciousness in their target with ease. They cancompletely control one’s physical movements, or even float a person throughsolid barriers. They use highly advanced technologies such as brilliant wands orother exotic equipment to examine individuals and monitor their bodies. They areable to insert and remove tiny implants, whether these be in the sinus cavity,behind the eye, or even in the brain. They collect human sperm, eggs, andfetuses regularly. Two capabilities are of paramount importance. One is their apparent masteryover our space-time reality. Floating people through walls is one manifestationof that ability. Invisibility is another. But most significant (at least in therecollections of many abductees) is their knowledge of a person’s life path.That is, of their future. In the example of abductee Betty Andreasson Luca, oneof the most detailed and well-known cases, we get this sense very strongly, thatthese beings exist beyond our localized experience of time. Not only do theyknow our future, but they can influence it to some extent. Their mental capabilities are equally important. Throughout abductionresearch, this stands out. These beings have extraordinary intelligence and areintensely telepathic—something worth long consideration. They communicate byentering one’s mind, a capability that ought to warrant great caution on ourpart. For anyone who can enter your thoughts can most assuredly influence them.Indeed, this is undoubtedly how they induce screen memories of their encounters,making proper recall so much more difficult. Then there the matter of memory control and erasure. It does happen thatpeople may, over time, recover some of their memories. That is because noteveryone is the same. Some people’s memories are able to bleed through, as itwere, more readily than others. But the fact remains that most of the memoriesof these experiences have been blocked and tampered with. In other words, thefirst line of defense for the Grays is to block one’s memory; the second line ofdefense is to tamper with the recollection itself. They seem to do this by inducing a fear-based command in people for themnever to think about the event, much less discuss it. I have interviewed severalof these people. Most have had an overpowering feeling that they were neversupposed to discuss their experience. When they finally did so, usually aftermany years had elapsed, they experienced severe anxiety. Other researchers havegotten similar results. These beings demand absolute secrecy. But what are they hiding from us? Everything points to the likelihood that these Grays are involved in along-term program, one involving a much longer trajectory than typical humanplans and programs. This appears to have been going on for several generations,perhaps longer. Clearly, they are interested in human sexuality andreproduction. Many female abductees have reported being taken back to a craft tobe shown hybrid-type babies that were supposed to be their offspring. This wouldpoint to a breeding program for the creation of human-alien hybrids. Such a thesis has been discussed for some time by now. But although it hasbecome something of a cultural cliché, it has become one for a reason: there aremany witness recollections that point to this conclusion. So, if the Grays are creating a human-alien hybrid species, is this with aview to have such beings integrate into our own society? Or even to replace us?David Jacobs, who has looked at this possibility perhaps more than anyone else,thinks yes, that they seek to replace us in one form or another. With respects to Dr. Jacobs, this scenario strikes me as implausible. Overthe years, there have been a few, sporadic, claims of encounters with hybridbeings. Every one of them points to the need of these beings for seclusion fromhuman society. One instructive account is in the book, Raechel’s Eyes. Raechel,an apparent hybrid, seemed to have tried to go so far as to take universityclasses and even have a roommate. Needless to say, she did not fit in, and alsodid not last long in the system.[310] [index_split_006.html#filepos1328111] Assuming a breeding program is in fact happening, we should be cautious indeveloping conclusions on its purpose. It could be that it is simply to allowfuture generations of Grays or aliens to live on Earth more comfortably in somemanner, not necessarily to integrate. Or, simply for them to acquire somethingof value in human DNA and continue to live in a separate world of their own. In any case, there is more than breeding going on. The Grays seem to bemonitoring us actively. The implants, for example, point to a monitoringprogram, and it appears that many abductees are monitored throughout theirlives. One of the key messages people report from the Grays is that they areconcerned over humanity’s destruction and poisoning of Earth’s naturalenvironment. Several abductees have reported that they are stationed here, andhave been testing our water, soil, vegetation, and animal life for quite sometime. If it is also true, as some evidence suggests, that the Grays have alsotaken animals from around the world, it could be to track changes toreproductive systems and therefore to the Earth’s environment. The Grays oftentell abductees what they are doing is necessary and important, even for thebetterment or preservation of mankind or life on Earth. In particular, a numberof abductees have reported the Grays are concerned about nuclear technology andweapons. Indeed, the message is that they are watching out for us."},{"pageContent":" This is reasonable enough. If we humans arrived at another world and saw themost advanced species there in the process of destroying that planet’secosystem, we too might be concerned. Still, we are not in a position to know if the Grays are truthful. There isnothing to stop them from lying to us. Is it impossible to think that humanswould lie to natives of another planet in order to gain their trust for our ownulterior purposes, whatever those might be? Such a scenario was portrayed inJames Cameron’s movie, Avatar. The idea could be to convince the inhabitantsthat their planet is in danger and the newcomers want to help. The human racecould not possibly be the first marks, the first suckers, in the history of theuniverse. We may ask, are the Grays evil? Putting aside the question of what wouldconstitute interstellar evil, we suppose they might be, but this is probably thewrong way to look at the matter. If they are here to help humanity, then at best they are doing their job withgreat subtlety, since there is no clear evidence that they have done anythingsignificant in that regard. Maybe they cannot. Humanity may be beyond theircontrol. Of course, if they really wanted to shake us up and help us change ourways, one supposes they could make a formal appearance. So they either will notor cannot. That is a bit distressing, since at this point we are technologicallyoutclassed by these creatures. [images/00055.jpg]Common depictions of Gray aliens. In reviewing the research and claims about these beings, one seldom hearsmuch speculation about what their psychology, personalities, and socialrelations might be like. Obviously, we can only guess about these things, andyet judging by the alleged interactions, they seem cold-blooded by ourstandards. Abductees generally report that these beings do not express emotions,although a few felt hostility coming from them, and a few have also reportedfeelings of benevolence. On the more grisly side, it has happened more than oncethat abductees have linked Grays to animal mutilations. For this, Linda MoultonHowe’s Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume 1 provides a good deal ofinformation. As several individuals recalled, these creatures cold-bloodedlyremoved blood and organs from cattle while those animals were still alive.[311][index_split_006.html#filepos1328433] In such instances, we might see the Grays as acting toward other life formsjust as humanity has done throughout its history. In reality, these beings arestill much more humane than we are. Any doubters need only consider our beef andpoultry industries, for starters. Still, it is unsettling that the Grays do not treat humanity as equals. Weare very much the Junior partner in this relationship. They deal with us ontheir terms. They do to us what they want to do. It is interesting, also, to consider the likelihood that they are the productof genetic engineering, and may well have strong components of artificial (or atleast artificially designed) intelligence. We ourselves are on the cusp ofredesigning our own genetic code, and of developing what is known as strongartificial intelligence (AI). That is, AI that may become self-aware. Fromthere, it is an easy matter of having that AI interacting in some way with ourown brains, perhaps through the implantation of nano chips, or perhaps someother way. In other words, a century from now, human beings may look and actvery differently than we do today. A typical human IQ might be 300 or 500 ormore, for all we can tell. All of that difference would be due to genetic andtechnological enhancements. Perhaps we will not journey down that road. But we might. It could be thatthe Grays were designed for a specific purpose. After all, their enormous headsand spindly bodies are unlikely to have evolved naturally. A brain so largewould require too much of the body’s resources, too much nutrition, all at theexpense of other bodily functions. Yet, one could design such a creature. With abrain so formidable, there would be no need for a powerful body. Humans are notas powerful as lions or elephants, but we can control them. With access tohigher thinking and technology, physical strength is irrelevant. It is possible that the Grays were designed specifically to interact here onEarth. After all, a truly extraterrestrial race would be unsuited to interactwith Earth’s environment. There would be problems with everything here, from thesolar radiation, to the strength of gravity, to the microscopic organisms andmore. To remain here, an advanced race from elsewhere would at least considermodifying themselves genetically. One supposes they could simply walk around inprotective suits, like we do when we are away from Earth’s protectiveenvironment, but if they want a long-term presence, then modifying themselvesseems most logical. And what would make more sense then to extract native DNAand adapt it for their purposes? Perhaps this is the reason why many of the so-called aliens that have beenreported are humanoid, reptoid, and insectoid. We have humans here, we havereptiles, we have insects.[312] [index_split_006.html#filepos1328752] Perhapsthe Grays are partly related to one or more of Earth’s native species. Therefore, when we speak of alien-human hybrids, it is equally valid tosuppose that the aliens themselves are already hybrids. Not long ago, scientistsroutinely dismissed talk of genetic manipulation on such a scale. We have come along way, however, in the last ten years, with much more to learn in the comingdecades. Even if the Grays were genetically designed to function on Earth, theyclearly have not reached the point where they can walk around easily. Or perhapsthey have, but simply need secrecy. Either way, it would seem that they need asecure environment in which to work and live. Maybe their solution is a vesselin upper orbit, or perhaps farther away, parked on the far side of the Moon.Perhaps, too, they have created bases here on Earth, deep underground. Weourselves have the technology for this, including the ability to go deep beneaththe ocean floor.[313] [index_split_006.html#filepos1329234] In essentials, allone needs is oxygen and energy. The oxygen can be extracted from the water,while the energy can be geothermal, or even a small nuclear generator. Certainlynot impossible at all. Why could not the Grays be able to live and work here on Earth withoutinterruption or annoyance? What would prevent them from going deep undergroundwithout our knowledge, especially if they did so in prior generations, longbefore we developed our current technologies? There have certainly been noshortage of sightings of UFOs going into and coming out of large bodies ofwater.[314] [index_split_006.html#filepos1329669] These last few points are applicable to any alien creature, not simply theGrays. Let us now discuss certain beings that often get overlooked, perhapsbecause they simply do not seem that exotic. These are beings that lookperfectly human, except that they are something different from perfectly human. Human-Looking Aliens There are several distinct types of human-looking beings involved in theUFO/ET/abduction phenomenon. Some appear to be involved in the abduction process. Budd Hopkins collectedseveral odd cases like this, which he eventually included in his finalabduction-related book, Sight Unseen.[315] [index_split_006.html#filepos1330269]Over the years, people approached him with cases so strange that for a long timehe did not know what to do with them. They involved encounters withordinary-looking people, but who seemed somehow to work as “helpers” of somesort during abductions. He had one case, for instance, of family members whorecalled a very strange long-term house guest from years before. This wassomeone with very odd behaviors, no known means of support, and, when they beganto reflect upon the situation, apparent connections to abduction experiencesthey recalled. In other cases, as well, there seemed to be human helpers orfacilitators to an alien abduction experience. These individuals all seemed tolack the basic social skills one would acquire from living in normal humansociety. It would seem that they were raised by other means. There are also stories of odd humans of a different sort, who may be workingon a different agenda. I will relate a story I was given by a woman I met at a conference in 2010.She and her husband seemed perfectly ordinary. The woman was in her late 50s,friendly, and seemed to be a stable individual. She related a very strange eventthat happened to her when she was an early teen during the mid-1960s. She livedin a small town in Western Pennsylvania, and was attending church with hermother. Although in such a small town, most of the church attendees werefamiliar to each other, she now noticed two new people in the row directly infront of her. Not only had she never seen them before, but they were clearly andobviously different from everyone else. To start, both of them were physicallyvery beautiful. Both had blond hair, both looked to be in their twenties, andboth were wearing extremely beautiful blue suits. To the witness, a young teengirl who was quite aware of clothing and fashion, the fabric of their clothingwas unlike anything she had ever seen: incredibly fine, perfectly put together,and vastly beyond the quality of anyone else’s clothing. Throughout the service, she was obsessed by the couple, and could notunderstand why no one else seemed to observe them. She noticed that they werenot familiar with when to stand, sit, kneel, or sing—the activities during atypical Roman Catholic mass. What was truly disconcerting, though, was that she heard them telepathically.They never looked back to her, they never seemed to speak, but somehow, she saidto me, she heard them in her mind. They seemed to be discussing whether or notthey were fitting in. They appeared to believe they were successful, when theyoung witness heard the female think to the male, “she can hear us.” For therest of the mass, the frightened and fascinated teenager heard no other thoughtscoming from them. When the service ended, the two strangers very abruptly andefficiently left, somehow getting out ahead of the rest of the crowd. The young girl decided to pursue them. She bolted out, pressing through thecrowd. She heard her mother calling after her, but she kept going. Out of thechurch, she saw the couple walking very quickly past the parking lot, toward agrassy hill. Then they went behind the hill and were momentarily lost to view.She hurried up after them. When she got to the top of the hill, she saw themagain. By now, they were in a clearing and walking fast toward a wooded area. The intrepid young witness began to race down after them. But then she sawanother figure. There, at the edge of the woods, stood an unusually tall figuredressed in a black suit, wearing a black hat. He reminded her of the character“Lurch,” from the 1960s television show, The Addams Family. His appearance wasfrightening to her, and she stopped dead in her tracks. Glued to her spot, shesaw the two blond people approach the tall person and scurry behind him into thewoods. The tall man then turned and followed them in. Although there was no UFO sighting in this story, it is clearly of interestto ufology. What kinds of people were these two blond individuals, and who wasthe very tall person? One supposes they could have been part of a study groupusing psychics to test how well they could read thoughts in a public setting.Perhaps they were even Russian spies, although this seems like a stretch.Everything about them seemed not to fit in. They were not like anybody else: notin their behavior, not in their physical appearance, and not in their mentalcapabilities. This is similar to another account I was given by a retired U.S. Air ForceColonel, a man with a Ph.D., and who worked in sensitive classified programsfrom the 1970s through the 1990s. This man also had a strong interest in UFOsand extraterrestrials and, in the presence of his wife, told me of an encounterthe two of them (plus a friend who was psychically gifted) had with twoindividuals at a Las Vegas casino. The three were walking through an upper levelarea when the psychic grabbed the Colonel’s arm. They all stopped. As the Colonel related the story, all three saw a strikingly beautifulblonde-haired woman. Of course, Las Vegas has many beautiful men and women, butsomehow this woman seemed different. The psychic was convinced that this womanwas not a normal human being. When the psychic and the Colonel’s wife took anearby escalator down to the next level, the Colonel remained behind, watchingthe woman. Then he heard her in his mind: “Don’t bother with me, you have nobusiness here.” That, in essentials, was the message from her. The force of thisstatement hit him hard. Just then, the woman’s male companion, also blond, approached her. Together,they walked toward the escalator, and for this they needed to walk by theColonel. He was determined to stop them. His idea was to say something thatwould start a conversation. Instead, they walked right by him. He followed. Down the escalator they all went—the couple in front, and theColonel right behind. While they descended, he stared at the backs of theirheads. Like the teen girl who sat in a Pennsylvania church in the 1960s, theColonel could “hear” their thoughts. From what he could remember, theconversation was essentially a statement that “he has no need to know about us,he will not know.” Looking down, he saw his wife and their friend watching themfrom behind a slot machine (his wife laughed when he recounted this part,confirming how nervous she had been). When they reached the floor level, thetelepathic blond couple simply walked away. None of the three pursued them. There are many more of such accounts. Ingo Swann, the famous remote viewer,had a frightening encounter with an extraordinarily beautiful woman in a LosAngeles supermarket during the 1970s. He became convinced him that she wasintensely telepathic and not human, at least not like the rest of us. At thattime, he encountered two mysterious “agents” whom he had met previously, and whowere observing the scene. Shortly afterward, he was warned by their boss thatthis woman was not human and was very dangerous.[316][index_split_006.html#filepos1330597] If we are concerned about alien-human hybrids infiltrating our society, asthe first generation of abduction researchers (particularly Hopkins and Jacobs)have claimed, what do we make of stories like this? Because it would seem thatthese beings have already infiltrated, and they look much more normal than thewispy haired, delicate hybrids that one often hears about. Based on such accounts, it seems that these beings have a strong ability toread our minds. They know when we are listening to them. In addition, thesestories hint at something else about us: that we ourselves have a telepathicfaculty that can activate at certain times, perhaps in their presence, or atother moments as well. Other questions arise. Are they exactly like us biologically? It would seemlogical to think that they came from Earth. If so, how did they become sodifferent? Is it wrong to think of them as aliens? Should we simply see them ashuman beings who, at some point in the past, reached a faster track ofdevelopment, leaving the rest of us behind? Is this the answer to the entire UFOmystery: an ancient breakaway civilization? And are memories of alleged Graysand other alien beings simply screen memories themselves? Then again, if that istrue, why do they need to conceal themselves from us? What do they have to fear? One possibility is that they use human society, or somehow seek to manage it,or perhaps benefit from it in some way. Of course, all this is speculation. Weare in a subject that generates ever more questions, and not enough answers. In addition to stories like the preceding, there have been claims by somepeople to have encountered benevolent human-looking extraterrestrials. Thesecome to us primarily via so-called contactees, that is, people who have claimedrepeated contacts with extraterrestrial beings. Typically, we are told that suchbeings have used that person to deliver their message to mankind. Such stories ought to elicit an instinctual skepticism. Previously, Iaddressed my skepticism concerning the the claims of George Adamski. Yet, thereare many other such claims. None should be dismissed a priori, and all are (atleast in theory) worthy of investigation. Unquestionably, most of the claims areoutlandish, and one must wonder why the beings would select some of these peopleto spread their message. Most of the so-called contactees over the years haveseemed entirely ordinary, lacking any social leverage or literary skill. Yet,for all we know, there could be something unusual about them, somethingsignificant. The key feature of the most intriguing of these types of cases is thecombination of outlandish claims and strong evident sincerity. In this regard,the “Friendship Case” from Italy is typical. Until recently, the story was keptquiet, known only to a few Italian researchers. When one of the main contacteesinvolved in the meetings died, some of the others decided to talk. The meetings were said to have taken place over many decades, starting in1956, and to have continued through the 1980s. It involved several men who hadbeen contacted—quite physically, not via channeling—by a group ofextraterrestrials. These beings were human looking, although some were extremelylarge (nine to ten feet tall), while others were only three feet tall or so. On the face of it, it sounds utterly unbelievable. But the witnesses allseemed intelligent, cultured, and sincere. A few were highly regarded in theircommunity. There is a collection of testimonials from them, and alleged videosand photographs. The beings themselves claimed to have come from planetselsewhere in our galaxy and beyond. There were only a small number of themliving on Earth, in bases under the ground and sea, some of which were said tobe along the Adriatic coast. In the words of the witnesses, “the Friends are our elder brothers. They arehuman. Indeed, in comparison it’s we terrestrials who are less than human.” Thisis the reason given why they generally would not show themselves. In the manyalleged meetings, the “Friends” gave a distinct message of Good versus Evil,stating that they have love and goodwill for mankind.[317][index_split_006.html#filepos1330913] There is one other fascinating tidbit that came out of the Friendship case. Adocumentary about it briefly showed a letter written by the great Frenchphilosopher Voltaire to the Count of St. Germain on 6 June 1761. This had beenshown to one of the Italian contactees as an example of a possibleextraterrestrial contact in the 18th century. The letter is authentic, and(translated in English) reads:> I reply, sir, to your letter you sent me in April, in which you reveal> frightening secrets, among which the most terrible for an old man like me, the> hour of my death. Thank you, Germain; your long journey through time will be> illuminated by the friendship I have for you, until the day your revelations> will come true in the middle of the twentieth century. The talking pictures> are a gift to the time I have left to live, your mechanized flying machine> could one day bring you back to me. Farewell, my friend. Voltaire. The documentary offers the possibility that Germain was in contact withextraterrestrials. Without doubt, he is one of the most mysterious figures inworld history. Voltaire once said that Germain was “a man who knows everythingand who never dies.” Germain was a brilliant European courtier and diplomat andnever directly answered questions about his origins. He also never seemed to ageand would often tell others that he was several centuries old.[318][index_split_006.html#filepos1331338] As the commentator Doug Webber pointedout, Germain is considered to be the possible author of an esoteric French bookentitled La Très Sainte Trinosophie (The Most Holy Trinosophia), described as an“allegorical initiation, detailing many kabbalistic, alchemical and masonicmysteries.”[319] [index_split_006.html#filepos1331789] However, there arepassages in this book that seem as though they were written by a contactee fromthe 1950s, including this passage:> Scarcely had I risen to the surface of the earth, when my unseen guide led me> still more swiftly. The velocity with which we sped through space can be> compared with naught but itself. In an instant I had lost sight of the plains> below. I noticed with astonishment that I had emerged from the bowels of the> earth far from the country about Naples. A desert and some triangular masses> were the only objects I could see.[320] [index_split_006.html#filepos1332259] Perhaps St. Germain was just a very clever trickster. If so, he held the mostbrilliant minds of Europe under his sway. We may well wonder, was he somehow inpossession of esoteric knowledge that itself came from others who have livedhere in this planet for a very long time?[321][index_split_006.html#filepos1332816] Regarding St. Germain, as with the Friendship case, we must be guided by thequality of evidence, and clearly neither story can be offered as proof of humancontact with extraterrestrials. Yet, there are so many other such stories.Moreover, if it there are human-looking but highly extraordinary beingsoccasionally interacting with us, then why not the Friendship case, or someothers? There is yet another variant of human-looking “aliens,” if we can call themthat. They are sometimes another type of “Nordic” or “Blonde” being who appearalmost like angels. One such appeared to the abductee Betty Andreasson, whosestories were described at length by the researcher Raymond Fowler. In oneinstance, Betty was abducted by Gray-like entities, then taken to an exotic baseapparently off the planet. There were small beings similar to Grays, but therewere also golden robed, shining beings, who were entirely human-looking.[322][index_split_006.html#filepos1333101] Such descriptions occur frequently enough, although they are complicated bythe fact that many of these encounters are not connected with actual UFOsightings. They are simply claims of contact. Still, if we are consideringpossible aliens or extraterrestrials, must we ignore them just because they arenot part of a UFO sighting? That seems arbitrary and silly. But caution is always necessary. Many of these encounters are dreamlike, oreven dreams. That does not mean they are not necessarily real. After all, whensomeone has unusually vivid dreams with profound messages from robed, shiningbeings, one might well conclude they are worth a consideration. Nevertheless,there is an element of the surreal to some of these encounters. This must giveour rational minds pause. Ultimately, the power of our conclusions must berelated in some manner to the strength of our evidence. Other Types of Beings People have reported other types of beings, including those resemblinginsects and reptiles. The reptoids, in particular, have become famous via DavidIcke and his assertion that some members of the human power elite are actuallyreptilian shape-shifters. Whether or not one believes that the extreme claims that the British RoyalFamily and others are secretly shape-shifting reptoids who drink human blood, anumber of abductees have reported seeing reptilian captors. Some have allegedsexual assault, even rape, by these beings. There is a belief among some peoplethat these entities live off human fears and other emotions, something likepsychic vampires, and meanwhile helping to keep the population in mentalslavery. Whether such a claim is true or not is impossible to prove and arguablypointless to try. But are there reptilians? Yes, if we accept the substantial number ofabductees who claim to recall them. I will add that one of my colleagues, aseasoned UFO investigator, told me of an interview this person conducted with asenior retired U.S. Defense official. The official discussed his professionalknowledge of three major types of extraterrestrials living on Earth. Accordingto him, all three types (the Grays, the Nordic-Humans, and the Reptoids) werebeing actively monitored by the black budget military. While this is justanother story, it resonates with me because it comes from a source I know andrespect. I take it as a possibility. This is even a greater alleged assortment of beings than what has beendiscussed here. Undoubtedly, they cannot all be true, especially whenconsidering that human memory itself can be managed and manipulated. What somepeople report as a specific alien type, or as variations of a particular type,may well be a screen memory. It seems safe to say, however, that all of these beings possess capabilitieswe lack, whether these be technological, mental, or by control over the veryspacetime fabric itself. We may ask, if even we cannot answer, what is the most likely explanationthat accounts for all of these beings? All we can do for now is speculate. But,clearly, humanity is on the fast track, wherever it is leading. For millennia,we existed with limited technology. Then, overnight, we shot into space. Anyintelligence with the ability to monitor us can see that we are transformingourselves in a fundamental way. Right now, we are probably putting on the bestshow in this portion of the universe. Will we complete our transformation into whatever it is we are becoming? Orwill we crash and burn? Do they have an opinion one way or the other? Do theyhave conflicting opinions? Getting probable answers to any of these questions is daunting enough.Dealing with it in strictly scientific terms seems impossible at present.Researchers of UFOs, abductions, and contact are in a quandary because none ofthe current evidence is acceptable to the world of science. None of the evidenceoffered can be studied independently. Everything mentioned in this chapterderives strictly from testimony and claims from people. Certainly, many of thesepeople seem perfectly normal, and many sound persuasive. Moreover, if we allowthat there is a UFO reality of some sort, their claims have some logic. But thatis not the same as proof. No matter how strongly we may believe that one or moreof these types of beings are here, we would do well to remind ourselves of thepersnickety little fact that no claims of contact have been provenscientifically. Someone’s experience may count as proof to that person, butpersonal experiences clearly cannot count as proof to other people. The foregoing applies even more to the following class of allegedextraterrestrial beings: those said to be channeled or somehow in mental orspiritual communication with certain people who claim to speak for them. Channeled Beings The first thing to acknowledge about channeling is that it has not receivedscientific corroboration or support. Even among its supporters, few if any areso bold as to assert that it has strong, genuine, scientific evidence to supportit. And yet, if we submit for a moment to examining the subject in anon-scientific, purely anecdotal manner, there have been certain instances inwhich, at least to some reasonable people, there may be something to it. At thispoint, many skeptics undoubtedly would consign this position to the woo camp,but there just seem to be too many individuals who are sincere about channeling.Whatever they are doing, it is not hoaxing. They are tapping into something,whether an actual entity or a deep part of their subconscious mind. A number ofchannelers have described their feelings while they channeled, and theycertainly believe they were connecting with another entity. Is it outrageous to consider that human consciousness has certaincapabilities to transcend what we perceive as our ordinary spacetime reality?Although the scientific support may be thin, it is not absent, as the modernhistory of remote viewing demonstrates.[323][index_split_006.html#filepos1333574] In addition, as the next chapter shows,there may be a valid scientific structure to allow for it. If this is so, whynot channeling? Nevertheless, it is always good policy to start from a position of skepticismwhen it comes to channelers, especially those who claim to have been in contactwith extraterrestrials. After all, channelers have been with us forever, butonly in the last few generations have they claimed to have any communicationsfrom extraterrestrials. Surely, this seems like a cultural phenomenon. Moreover, the track record of channelers fails to inspire confidence.Believing the claims of all of their contradictory and often mutually exclusivepredictions would leave one extremely confused, to say the least. The memory ofthe failed 2012 Ascension predictions by many channelers and psychics also lefta bad taste. Finally, insights or wisdom provided by a channeler is one thing;concluding therefore that they must be accurate when claiming it comes from anextraterrestrial being is quite another. New Age Aliens Channeling extraterrestrials goes right to the beginning of the modern UFOphenomenon. As early as 1952, a contactee named George Van Tassell claimed to bein telepathic communication with extraterrestrials. He made no paranormalclaims, but stated that they used advanced technology to connect with naturalhuman abilities. The name of the being who contacted him, he said, was namedAshtar. Ashtar’s earliest messages focused on the dangers from nuclear weapons. Theyalso described an extraterrestrial “government” that monitored Earth and wantedto improve life for humanity. This was the origin of the idea of Ashtar Command Soon, Ashtar Command was being channeled by others. The messages did notalways agree, and rivalries developed. Many predictions followed, oftencentering on the imminent arrival of an Ashtar-led armada to guide and protectmankind. During the 1970s, a person known as Tuella began channeling Ashtar Command.Rather than emphasize technology or politics, she focused on inner spiritualdevelopment and achieving “higher dimensions.” This, of course, coincided withthe beginnings of the modern New Age movement. Other Ashtar channelers continuedto emphasize apocalyptic themes, even stating that Ashtar Command’s ships wouldsoon arrive to help people evacuate the planet. One such channeler predictedthis would happen in 1994. The Internet gave Ashtar Command a new life. It appears that no matter howmany failed predictions exist in one’s track record, there are always people whowill find a way to believe the next one. Today, after more than half a centuryof existence, Ashtar Command (now known as Ashtar Galactic Command) seems towork as a kind of committee that keeps control over its messages. Apocalypsesare definitely out.[324] [index_split_006.html#filepos1334399] But Ashtar Command is just one small part of the modern channeling of allegedextraterrestrials, which exploded into ufology during the 1980s. BarbaraMarciniak, for example, began channeling the Pleiadians at that time and gainedan influence that is difficult to overstate.[325][index_split_006.html#filepos1334977] Her sessions provided a virtually completestatement of modern New Age philosophy. She was not the first channeler to givesuch messages, but she was the first popular channeler who explicitlycommunicated with extraterrestrials and incorporated such a philosophy. Earlierchannelers, such as J. Z. Knight, the channeler of Ramtha, essentially offeredthe same ideas, but Ramtha is Lemurian, not extraterrestrial. And what is that message? In the case of the Pleiadians, they speak toMarciniak from the future. They claim to be one of many extraterrestrial lifeforms interacting with Earth, not all of which are benevolent. They claim thatEarth will experience a major event, beginning in 2012, during which the battlefor dominion of our world will take place. Indeed, the original prediction wasnot for 2012. When it was in made in the early 1990s, it was set for the year2000. Now that the 2012 prediction seems to have failed, too, perhaps a new datewill be set. Or, perhaps it has happened on schedule, since most of us cannot perceivethis battle, which is said to occur in the “fourth and fifth” dimensions, andmost of humanity perceives only three dimensions. According to Marciniak’ssources, this is because 300,000 years ago, in an earlier struggle for Earth,human DNA was disassembled by malevolent beings from twelve strands to a doublehelix structure. These beings wanted to keep humanity ignorant so as to feedfrom our fear, anger, and doubt. The fundamental message is that Reptilians arereally in charge of this planet and keep humanity for their own sustenance. In this context, the Pleiadian message via Marciniak is to remind humanity ofits divine origins, to trigger its DNA reconstruction, to help peoplere-assimilate “light” into their bodies, and raise their “frequency.” All ofthis will enable them to travel in higher dimensions and survive the comingupheaval. This is the core of what has been called the Ascension process. It has also become the foundation of the New Age belief system insofar as itis connected to UFO studies. But it is more likely the message, and not thecosmology, that has attracted most adherents. The message, in essentials, is onethat has been channeled for a long time, including in the Seth books by JaneRoberts, and even before: that each person creates his or her own reality bytheir thoughts and intentions. You create your reality by your thoughts. Somepeople take this notion further than others. Ramtha, for instance, saysliterally that “you are God,” and that consciousness and energy create thenature of reality. This is a philosophy that has a great attraction to many people, althoughmost of us might draw the line at the presumption (and narcissism) of callingourselves God. Just as questionable is the idea that one literally creates one’sown reality. The contention is that there is no actual reality separate fromone’s thoughts. Everyone can agree that our thoughts are critical in the successor failure of our life’s endeavors, and many even acknowledge that one’sthoughts can affect the body’s health and healing processes. Yet, this isdifferent from stating that thoughts literally create reality. Taken to anextreme, it would mean that if you don’t think it, it’s not happening.Particularly if you are convinced you are God. There are more obviously attractive features to the philosophy, particularlywhen it coincides with the existentialist idea that there are no excuses inlife. Most of us can appreciate that each of us is ultimately responsible forcreating our “world.” Ditto a spirituality that emphasizes having the properintention in all matters, and promoting “Christ consciousness.” But that is another topic altogether, and beyond the scope of this book. Ourquestion is not whether or not someone likes the philosophy. Rather, we want toknow how likely it is that extraterrestrial beings actually are being channeled? My personal conclusion is, not very. The statements that come to uspurporting to be scientific have not found corroboration, or have been plainlydisproven. And most of the statements, it has to be said, show little to noappreciation of science. One example of many is that the Earth was going to come into full contactwith a so-called Photon Band in 2012. When that happened, we were told, theplanet would be covered with purifying energy. Those who had cleansed andrestored their Lightbodies would be ready. Those who had neither integrated normade amends would apparently perish. The Earth would experience darkness, andthen eternal light. A new Earth would come into being. Aside from the fact that 2012 came and went with nothing of the sort, thereis no evidence for the existence of a Photon Band. A claim that it wasdiscovered by satellites in 1981 is baseless. Nor is there logic to thestatement that Earth can pass through it, since believers state that itsurrounds the Pleiades—a very long distance away, aside from the fact that Earthis moving away from the Pleiades, not toward it. Despite being devoid of logicor evidence, ideas such as this one have been stated as unarguable facts.[326][index_split_006.html#filepos1335284] There is a great deal of this type of thinking. It is certainly notscientific. Most of it is nearly impossible to test. How does one test the ideathat humans have twelve etheric strands of DNA? Of course, channelers are invited to make predictions that are meaningful andcorrect. If they were to do this, they might begin convincing more people thatthey are truly tapping into something. Providing some genuine confirmableinformation and scientific insights would be preferred, perhaps a properexplanation for gravity, or a detailed (and verifiable) information about secretpolitical or financial activities. Yet, it may be premature to dismiss all alleged communications of this type.As discussed earlier, there is reason to believe the beings involved with UFOphenomena are telepathic. There have also been a select number of historicalchannelers (such as Edgar Cayce) and several remote viewers of more recent yearswho appeared to have a remarkable record. With each passing year, physics demonstrates the reality of non-locality,sending to oblivion our conventional notions of time and space, and suggestingthat consciousness is a key part of the structure of our reality. Does that meanit is the underlying aspect of all existence, as some people claim? The world’sleading quantum physicists and neuroscientists do not seem to be saying this.But it does appear that consciousness matters in a way not fully appreciated bycurrent science. Conceding this, may we not theorize that some extraterrestrials might speakthrough selected human beings? There will be more to say about this in the next chapter. The bottom lineabout channelers, however, is that they cannot be considered valid sources ofinformation regarding extraterrestrials. One may choose to believe them andappreciate the messages. But there is no genuine evidence that any channelersare actually communicating with extraterrestrial entities. That said, strangerthings have happened, so we may keep the door open. A Word on Crop Circles The relationship of crop circles to the UFO phenomenon is not alwaysstraightforward, but I believe there is a relationship. There have been somecredible claims of people seeing balls of light in connection with these, butthat is rare. And there are no proven, credible sightings of actual UFOs inconnection to the formation of these amazing patterns. The real connection is in the fact that these formations appear to beunexplained, judging from our contemporary technology. There are indeed circlehoaxers. In fact, they often consider themselves to be artists and many of themdo excellent work. It is not true to claim, as some do, that all so-calledhoaxed circles are easy to identify. Some of them are very well done, and areeasily found on YouTube. Overnight, such circle makers can make well-done,complex patterns.[327] [index_split_006.html#filepos1335667] But some of these formations are so immense and complex as to defy reason.And after all these decades, none of the perpetrators have been caught in theact of making any of the truly extraordinary formations. Moreover, severaloddities have been recorded. Some formations, for example, have had stalks thatwere pushed down without having been broken, bent sometimes six or more inchesabove the ground, clearly indicating they were not pressed down with a woodenplank. While the known circle artists all use planks, it is clear that at leastsome of the formations were not done this way. All with a complexity that istruly astonishing. Laboratory studies have indicated that the nodes of some of the stalks wereblasted out on one side. It is not known for sure how this happened, but theeffect has been replicated by highly localized microwave heating. This causesthe water inside to vaporize and be expelled. The stalk then flops over to oneside. If something like this caused the formations, then we are clearly talkingabout a highly sophisticated agency behind the phenomenon.[328][index_split_006.html#filepos1336027][images/00024.jpg]Normal stalk nodes (l) compared with blown nodes (c, r) The patterns of the formations themselves have been studied endlessly. Asidefrom being supremely beautiful, many seem to be messages in one form or another,often with cosmological implications. None seem ominous or evil. If one receivesany sense or feeling from them, it is benevolence. If were to be the case that these formations are created by anextraterrestrial or non-human intelligence, we may conclude that at least one ofthe groups here might in fact care about us and wish to help us. Getting to the Bottom Line If there is something regarding the UFO phenomenon about which we need toexercise caution, it is over who or what we are dealing with. It is not thatnothing is going on. Quite the opposite: it is clearly the center of thephenomenon, something of critical importance. For that reason, caution is mostimportant. And caution reminds us that the evidence of contact is not strongscientifically. Yet, if we approach this phenomenon with as much common sense aspossible, we can see that there is too much smoke to ignore the likelihood offire. Too many people have had too many experiences, so many of them traumatic,so many that have caused their hearts to race upon recall, so many others ofdeeply positive significance. Something important is happening, somethingprofound, something secret. Whoever these beings are, we are not dealing with them on equal terms. How wecan get to a position of equality or parity may not be something we can easilylearn. It may not be possible. But there is every reason to believe that they are well aware of our path.Just one hundred and fifty years ago, our society was dominated by horse powerand wooden carts. In the blink of a cosmic eye, we have created a world that,even to our recent ancestors, is unimaginable. Global communications,connectivity, information immediately available wherever we go, with morerevolutions on the way: nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, 3-D printing,quantum computing, genetic manipulation, and more. If they have ever observed us, must now understand that we are on the vergeof entering their world. The recent buildup toward the failed Ascension has underscored our inabilityto predict the future with any precision, and has certainly emphasized theshortcomings, to say the least, of channeled information. Nevertheless, it willno doubt be true that a century from now, if there are humans looking back upontheir history, they are likely to see our current era as a singularlytransformative one. Our society, our civilization, and indeed our species isundergoing the most rapid and fundamental change of all time. Intuitively, werealize this, but our daily routines cause us to forget. And it is not literallyovernight. Today is like yesterday, this year only slightly different from thelast. But then we step back just enough, and we see the incredible blur of changethat has taken place. Our world today is fundamentally different from the worldof fifty years ago, even thirty years ago. Despite the adventures and strugglesof people who lived in earlier eras, they never experienced the kind ofdramatic, fundamental change that we now see. Moreover, this change is happeningwithout the impetus of a major global war. It is happening because our societyappears to have reached a stage of permanent revolution. It is a revolution thataffects everything: our science and technology, our politics, our economics, oursocial customs, our intellectual endeavors, and indeed our consciousness.Everything is changing. Will we join a galactic community, if there is one? Will we instead reach apoint where we understand that such a community is dominated by interstellareconomic hitmen, bent on little more than exploitation of our own and perhapsother species of life, much as humanity behaves toward other life forms on ourplanet? Perhaps we will need more time to find out. When we do, we will probably havea bit more information to refer to when we decide with whom or what we aredealing. Chapter 11Weird Science: Propulsion, Energy,Spacetime, and Consciousness The UFO phenomenon represents science far in advance of what we currentlyhave and know. The deeper we explore, the more radical, the more profound, thatscience becomes. For many years, students of UFOs have wondered whether theseobjects, if that is even what they are, are explainable within our currentunderstanding of physics. The Radical Science of UFOs Take propulsion technology, for starters. What is it, after all, that canallow a craft to loiter indefinitely, accelerate instantly, make right angleturns, and do the many incredible things UFOs have been observed to do? And todo these things silently? But this is only one area in which UFOs pose a scientific challenge. There isthe related but distinct issue of energy. After all, these objects certainly donot seem to run on gasoline or jet fuel. Do they have something better? Even questions like these, important though they are, are pedestrian comparedwith other questions we might raise. So many encounters with UFOs seem toindicate that the beings, whether they be extraterrestrial or otherwise, possesssome sort of mastery over spacetime, itself. Over and over in the literature, weencounter the so-called Oz Factor. These are moments of high strangeness inconnection to UFOs and the beings that control them. Objects may appear ordisappear suddenly; sometimes witnesses will have the sense, not only of missingtime, but of time distortion. Does the UFO phenomenon represent a breakthroughin our understanding of spacetime? Another spacetime related question concernshow did they get here? If any of these UFOs derive from civilizations elsewherein the universe, then it is quite possible they have learned to distortspacetime in order to reach us, even if they come from another dimension ofreality itself, whatever that might even mean. Finally, we might ask about consciousness itself. There are cases of peoplereporting telepathic communication with these other beings within a wide varietyof contexts. This has happened not simply during recollections of abductions, inwhich telepathic communication seem to be the norm, but also in connection withsightings of the objects themselves, whether they look like actual craft ororbs. More than once, a person has reported waking in the middle of the nightwith an urge to look outside their bedroom window, only to see an orange orb.What is going on there? We also find, time and again, that UFO witnesses react to their experience inways that seem inexplicable to them afterwards. Sometimes they react to theirencounter with an uncharacteristic sense of calm, or sometimes with hystericalpanic. Perhaps that is due to a deep psychological process, but it might be thatthese beings have an advanced understanding of the human mind, enabling themsome level of control. That is, somehow to get inside our heads. But the importance of consciousness does not end there. There is someanecdotal evidence indicating that meditation can trigger more encounters. Is itpossible that they become more interested in us when we refine and elevate ourown thought processes? Does that make us more interesting to them? Or does thatallow us to reach them somehow, or reach their reality, wherever that is? This is a question that can lead us to explore a fundamental philosophicalissue, one that has existed for thousands of years. Essentially, the mattercomes down to the materialist versus the non-materialist outlook. Is there adimension of reality that is not easily amenable to our traditional scientificmethods of measurement? Moreover, does human consciousness, or consciousness ingeneral, have the ability to affect reality? These are two separate questions,but clearly they bear a relationship to each other. To what extent do thoughtscreate or affect what we perceive as material reality? Is such an idea nonsense,or is there something to it? What is the science that supports it? I broachedthis subject in the previous chapter, and would like to explore it further inthis one. In general, a proper understanding of UFOs and everything related to thempromises to bring humanity into a new series of scientific paradigms. But weshould remind ourselves that science, properly done, requires the scientificmethod. It has worked exceptionally well for the past five centuries, and wewould be fools to discard it. It involves testing, testing, and more testing.But even more than this, the test data itself must be open and available forothers to comprehend and repeat. Repeatability is key. So is open availability to the data. It is one thing to conduct an experimentand state that such and such an effect has occurred. It is quite another todescribe the protocols, equations, parameters, and conditions of that experimentin such a way that someone else can follow the instructions and duplicate theresult. This is the foundation of peer review: independent, qualified peoplemust be able to check the work. Within the UFO literature, we often hear the word “pseudoscience” bandiedabout. Pseudoscience is not simply a derogatory term directed against subjectsthat professional scientists disdain. It has certainly become a slur oftenenough, but what we call pseudoscience can accurately be described as conjectureonly, without any ties to scientific experimentation, experimental physics, ormathematics. Fundamentally, pseudoscience represents a claim without thescientific method supporting it. In addition to pseudoscience, there is fringe science, something differentyet again. We can best understand fringe science as hypotheses that are looselyconnected to proven mathematics, experimental physics, or some other form ofscientific experimentation, but which have not yet been submitted for peerreview. This does not mean that something currently considered pseudoscience orfringe science is necessarily false. Of course, it might be false, and oftenenough, it is. But it might also be that the phenomenon under study has so fareluded our attempts to subject it to a classical scientific analysis. Scientifically speaking, then, this is the best reason to remain open-mindedabout subjects that are currently considered fringe science or evenpseudoscience. Sometimes, we simply have to wait for our science to catch upwith a phenomenon. This does not invalidate science as a tool, nor thephenomenon itself as worthy of study. Science is not the bad guy here, andneither are UFOs. Propulsion Paul Hill was a senior NASA scientist during the 1950s and 1960s. He wasProfessor of Aeronautics and was an original member of the National AdvisoryCommittee of Aeronautics (NACA) in 1939. In other words, Paul Hill was involvedin America’s aerospace program right from its birth. He had an impressive careerand received many awards. Paul Hill was also a UFO witness. His experience convinced him that thephenomenon was real. Over the years, despite NASA’s formal position thatdismissed UFOs, Hill became known within NASA as their resident expert on thesubject. As a result, many UFO reports ended up on his desk—informally, notofficially. During the 1960s, Hill worked quietly on a book. He completed it in themid-1970s, after he had retired, and it remained unpublished until 1995, fiveyears after his death. His book, Unconventional Flying Objects: A ScientificStudy, is still considered today to be the single best scientific treatment ofUFOs.[329] [index_split_006.html#filepos1336387] As Hill put it, his goal was to show that “UFOs obey, not defy, the laws ofphysics.” When we think about the behavior of many reported UFOs, this may notbe readily apparent. Our currently accepted physics is founded on the conservation of energy andmomentum. And yet, UFOs appear to accelerate without ejecting any materialbehind them. Both Newton's law of gravity and Einstein’s theory of GeneralRelativity require the existence of “negative mass” (or negative energy) forsomething like antigravity to be possible. This has been a major hurdle to thestudy of UFOs by many physicists.[330] [index_split_006.html#filepos1336688] Hill wondered about this, as well as other observed features of UFOs: thelack of a sonic boom despite reaching supersonic speeds, their incredibleaccelerations, presumably without killing their occupants, and much more. Heconcluded that although these types of motions are not consistent withaerodynamics, they are consistent with some form of repulsive force-fieldpropulsion. In other words, UFOs make sense if they are using some sort of“antigravity,” just as we produce magnetism with electric currents. He addedthat the occasional changes in color noticed by some witnesses make sense if weassume that one side effect of this force would be a plasma field. This would becaused by ionization of the surrounding air, which in turn could alter theapparent color of the craft. Hill studied cases in which UFOs appeared to demonstrate this force field.These included instances in which a person or a vehicle was affected, treebranches moved apart or broken, roof tiles knocked out, ground or waterdisturbed, and so on. He concluded that these interactions pointed to arepulsive force field surrounding the craft, and definitely not propulsioninvolving jets, nor pure electric or magnetic effects, nor radiation (althoughradiation was in evidence sometimes as a secondary effect). This force field is gravitational-like, and in fact is gravity-canceling. Oneresult of this is that living beings inside it can cope with the incredibleaccelerations of hundreds of g-forces. That is because, as reviewer Dr. HaroldPuthoff pointed out, by manipulating the acceleration-type force field, even atsupersonic speeds, occupants would be in a “constant-pressure, compression-freezone,” and their craft would be surrounded by a flow of air that is subsonic. Inother words, not supersonic, meaning no sonic boom. A nice bonus would be thatrain, moisture, dust, insects, or other low velocity objects would followstreamlined paths around the craft, rather than hit it. Another benefit is that the surface of the craft would not heat excessively,which one would expect from ordinary aircraft moving at extremely high speeds.The space shuttle and other high-tech aircraft, for instance, requiresophisticated heat shielding to allow them safely to re-enter Earth’satmosphere. Not so, when the craft can benefit from a force field. Essentially,the airflow approaches the craft and then moves away, depositing no energy inthe process. Puthoff concluded that Hill:> . . . assembled as good a case as can be made on the basis of presently> available data that the observation of some ‘unconventional flying objects’ is> compatible with the presence of engineered platforms weighing in at something> around 30 tons, which are capable of 100-g accelerations and 9000-mph speeds> in the atmosphere. More important for the technical reader, added Puthoff, was Hill's supportingargumentation that “these platforms, although exhibiting the application ofphysics and engineering principles clearly beyond our present-day capabilities,do not appear to defy these principles in any fundamental way.”[331][index_split_006.html#filepos1337001] Hill did not explain how to generate such a repulsive, gravity-cancelingforce. Of course, he can hardly be faulted for this. Within the open scientificliterature, no one else has figured it out, either. Antigravity remains a HolyGrail. For this reason, some UFO skeptics have dismissed Hill’s work. Supportersrespond that his work shows that UFOs do not involve half a dozen or moreinexplicable phenomena. Instead, there is essentially one inexplicablephenomenon. Surely, this is no reason to discard his work. After all, thephysics of a typical cell phone would have baffled any genius of the 19thcentury. Electrogravitics Paul Hill showed, within reason, that the creation of a gravity-cancelingfield, or force field of some sort, goes a long way to explain the otherwiseinexplicable performance capabilities of UFOs. This has led researchers into thefield of electrogravitics. Some of the pioneering work in this field was done bynone other than Nikola Tesla. Other important figures include Thomas TownsendBrown, Paul Biefeld, Paul LaViolette, Thomas Valone, and Yevgeny Podkletnov. Within the world of officially established conclusions and truth, theprevailing assessment is that electrogravitics does not generate a significanteffect.[332] [index_split_006.html#filepos1337607] However, it seems that a good case can be made for electrogravitics. Tesla’s connection to the subject has captured a great deal of attention andremains a puzzle. This is not surprising when we consider not only hisprodigious genius, but the fact that many of his papers were confiscated by U.S.government officials at his death in 1943. While some were released in 1952,many others have disappeared.[333] [index_split_006.html#filepos1338024] Thereis more than enough room enough to wonder what classified research was carriedout based on them. Especially during his later years, Tesla made several scientifically radicalremarks about matter and energy. He was roundly criticized for this, but theyare fascinating nevertheless. In 1930, for instance, he had this to say:> . . . all perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, of a tenuity> beyond conception and filling all space—the Akasha or luminiferous ether,> which is acted upon by the life-giving Prana or creative force, calling into> existence, in never ending cycles, all things and phenomena. . . . Can Man> control this grandest, most awe-inspiring of all processes in nature?[334]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1338505] Among some UFO and non-mainstream researchers, Tesla’s work implies a form offree energy and beyond, including the ability to “precipitate matter from theether” and even create life “in infinite forms.”[335][index_split_006.html#filepos1338798] Nothing in the published papers of physicsappears to support this claim, and it would certainly be the basis of ascientific revolution if it is. However, we may grant that within the world ofclassified scientific research, it may be another story. It is also sometimes asserted that Tesla pioneered ideas relative toelectrogravitics. What is definitely known is that work in this area began nolater than the early 1920's. Dr. Paul Biefeld, a physicist and acquaintance ofAlbert Einstein, discovered that a highly charged capacitor possesses an oddtendency to move in the direction of its positive pole. Biefeld assigned hisstudent, Thomas Townsend Brown, to research the phenomenon. Brown was able todocument what appeared to be a gravity-reducing effect, which became known asthe Biefeld-Brown Effect. It is the foundation of electrogravitics. Fundamentally, electrogravitics uses an electric field to charge or polarizean object that has a specially-constructed shape—typically a disc-shaped objectworks best. When such a charge is applied to the edge of a surface of an objector craft, the result is a propulsive effect. In other words, the disc moves.According to an important article in 1956 from the aviation publication,Interavia, by an anonymous author who spent two years researching the matter,Brown demonstrated this effect on discs charged with roughly 150,000 volts. Theywere tethered and reportedly flew “with results so impressive as to be highlyclassified. Variations of this work done under a vacuum have produced muchgreater efficiencies that can only be described as startling.”[336][index_split_006.html#filepos1339155] There are certain known, conventional, possibilities that could cause apropulsive effect. One was that of ion wind. Brown, however, ruled that out,since he conducted some of these tests in a vacuum, where such an effect isimpossible. There is another effect, known as electrostatic levitation, thatcould conceivably cause motion to the disc, but this, too, seems to be differentfrom what Brown achieved. Electrostatic levitation is a real phenomenon undercertain conditions, although it has never been shown to levitate an object in astable manner. Conceivably, one might be able to design a feedback controlsystem that constantly changes the electric fields to hold an object inposition, perhaps an equivalent of fly-by-wire in modern aircraft. There is noindication, however, that it can achieve the kind of force or acceleration thatBrown obtained in his tethered-disc experiments. He seemed to be on to somethingentirely different. The Biefeld-Brown effect appears to involve a different kindof physics altogether. Consider that some of these experiments were done in a vacuum, theapplication to space travel is evident. It would indicate that electrograviticscould be used as a means of propulsion for spacecraft as well as aircraft. This work by Brown, and apparently others, seeped out to the public in 1956,when Interavia and a few other publications printed stories about imminentbreakthroughs in antigravity. But then, nothing. The stories ended almost asquickly as they began. One possible scenario is that the research went black.Could it be that a few advances were made since that time within the classifiedworld? [images/00015.jpg]T. Townsend Brown with a disc from his electrogravitics experiments. Some public discussion of electrogravitics has continued. In 1991, the U.S.Air Force published a report on a study of electrogravitics concluding that,although there did seem to be some anomalous forces produced viaelectrogravitics, it was not very much, and not significant enough forpropulsion. The report did say, “these may warrant further consideration in thefuture.”[337] [index_split_006.html#filepos1339478] Such a conclusion might makesomeone wonder if quiet research has continued since 1991. More recently, Bernard Haisch, Harold Puthoff, and several other physicistshave demonstrated connections between the electromagnetic zero-point energyfield and inertia. They have speculated about possible further connections withgravity.[338] [index_split_006.html#filepos1339859] The American physicist Ning Li also provided theoretical support foranomalous gravitational effects from a superconducting spinning disc in a strongmagnetic field. In other words, gravity-weakening effects. According to herresearch, rotating ions create a gravitomagnetic field perpendicular to theirspin axis. If a large number of ions can be aligned, a strong gravitomagneticfield can be achieved, which in turn produces a strong repulsive force. Thismight be done by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure in ahigh-temperature superconducting disc.[339][index_split_006.html#filepos1340356] The engineer Yevgeny Podkletnov has reportedly done experiments demonstratingsomething like this, with rotating superconductors in a magnetic field. Heclaimed to have achieved some gravity reduction effect, although a number oftechnical reasons some physicists question whether the results can be taken atface value.[340] [index_split_006.html#filepos1341005] Probably the most detailed arguments for electrogravitics come from Dr. PaulLaViolette and Dr. Thomas Valone, both of whom have written extensively aboutfield propulsion (i.e. antigravity) technologies and the cover-up of theirreality. Both argue that there are advanced aerospace technologies that cancontrol gravity and would obviously revolutionize air travel and energyproduction. They discuss different field propulsion devices with thrust-to-powerratios thousands of times greater than any jet engine. They argue that NASA hasbeen involved in a cover-up to block these advanced technologies from publicknowledge and use, although of course such technologies remain under militarydevelopment.[341] [index_split_006.html#filepos1341534] Obviously, if this technology is real, it would revolutionize transportationtechnologies, merely for starters. It could also expose deeply classified andsensitive programs. As early as 1993, LaViolette argued that the B-2 AdvancedTechnology Bomber—the stealth bomber—used electrogravitics to provide someamount of gravity control.[342] [index_split_006.html#filepos1342257] It is interesting that, despite the fact that electrogravitics has not beendebunked, and even enjoys some mainstream scientific support, it has received solittle formal research funding. Perhaps we should not be surprised. Clearly, itis revolutionary in every way. If it is being developed within a classifiedsetting, all the more reason to suppress it publicly. Yet, the question arises:would it be possible to suppress public funding of it on an international scale?On a purely scientific basis, why would it receive so little institutionalsupport worldwide? Two reasonable answers come to mind. First, there may be theperception that there are no short-term or medium-term prospects for financialsuccess. Second, that it is being suppressed by major powers in the areas ofnational security and energy. Energy Speaking of energy, if UFOs are producing such intense magnetic fields, areable to perform with such incredible capabilities, have physical effects on theenvironment around them (including sources of power such as the engine of a caror the power grid of an entire community), then they must be using a tremendousamount of energy. What is their source of power? There is no consensus on this, other than it is likely to be far better thanhigh-octane gasoline. However, a few ideas have been proposed. One is thatgravity is “somehow” converted to usable energy, but how precisely is not clear.Another is that UFOs utilize remote transmission of power, that is, a wirelessenergy transfer. But, from where? Probably the one most within current capabilities (although still notofficially attained), would be through clean nuclear fusion. This is a definiteHoly Grail in energy generation. Nuclear power plants employ fission, which tears atoms apart, releasingenergy and radioactive by-products. Fusion is different. It occurs inside everystar, and has been replicated by humankind in the form of the hydrogen bomb. Anuclear fusion reactor would duplicate this process, but in a controlled way. Itinvolves fusing together two “heavy” hydrogen atoms, known as deuterium andtritium, to produce helium, which is inert and harmless, without radioactivewaste, along with vast amounts of energy. Actually, vast does not begin to capture the magnitude of this energy. Theamount of energy would be well beyond anything achievable through nuclearfission, which is itself a tremendous source of power. After all, fission powersnuclear submarines and aircraft carriers for years at at time. It powers largecities with ease. But fusion is far beyond this, beyond anything humancivilization has yet harnessed. Surely, the amount of power in a controlledfusion reaction would easily suffice for any electrogravitic flying saucer. Orany large fleet of them. Researchers are working on controlled nuclear fusion, and many people believeit can be achieved. Physicist Michio Kaku has predicted a fusion breakthrough byaround the year 2030, or perhaps 2040.[343][index_split_006.html#filepos1342715] A nuclear solution may be the answer to the question of “what powers flyingsaucers?” It is curious, incidentally, that Bob Lazar, who claimed in 1990 tohave worked at the S-4 Facility in Groom Lake, near Area 51, stated that theatomic Element 115 served as a nuclear fuel. This element reportedly provided anenergy source that can produce antigravity effects under proton bombardment,along with antimatter for energy production. As Lazar put it, as the intensestrong nuclear force field of Element 115's nucleus was properly amplified, thegravitational effect would distort the surrounding spacetime continuum. Ineffect, this would greatly shorten the distance and travel time to a charteddestination. Essentially, Lazar was saying this would bend the spacetime fabricitself.[344] [index_split_006.html#filepos1343088] Aside from fusion, another possibility that has received attention as abreakthrough source of energy is the proposed utilization of ambient energy,most commonly referred to as Zero Point Energy, or ZPE. It is referred to as “zero point” because it is energy that exists at zerodegrees Kelvin, otherwise known as absolute zero. Even at that temperature, thecoldest possible in the universe, a state lacking all thermal energy, nothingcan be frozen so solidly that its molecules become absolutely still, because theatoms of the molecules would still be in motion. One experiment conducted byscientists involved cooling helium to within one degree of absolute zero. Evenat that temperature, helium’s molecules retained enough kinetic energy to keepit in a liquid state instead of freezing solid. Apparently, only ZPE couldaccount for the energy that prevented the helium from freezing.[345][index_split_006.html#filepos1343414] Therefore, if one were to pump all matter and all heat energy out of acontainer, as one approaches absolute zero, all that would be left in thecontainer would be a vacuum and zero point energy. In other words, some sourceof energy exists all the time. It is like a sea of energy that exists everywhere. It is all around us, andis in the emptiness of space. Some claim that the energy density of ZPE exceedsthat of nuclear energy, but there is no consensus. In this context, ufologistand nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman makes a salient point:> I have often been fascinated by the simple fact that when one goes from the> ‘huge’ atom to the 10,000-times smaller nucleus, one goes up in energy per> particle by millions of times. So what will happen when we are able to dig> into the quarks that make up neutrons and protons? Will a huge new source of> energy be found?

We know that matter-antimatter annihilation is an efficient process,> even if we don’t know how to store antimatter.[346]> [index_split_006.html#filepos1343728] A point well worth consideration as we get down to the smallest fabric ofexistence. The real question is, can we get ZPE to do useful work for us? Part of thisdepends on whether there truly is a great amount of energy to be extracted, andwhether a device can be built to do it. It does appear possible in theory toobtain heat and energy out of the vacuum. This could mean free energy devicesthat are carbon-free and use no fuel. Dr. Thomas Valone, who once worked at theU.S. patent office, described losing his job because he advocated for preciselythese types of suppressed systems. What is lacking is a proven ZPE device. Some people have made vigorous ZPEclaims, such as Colonel Tom Bearden. However, Bearden has been persuasivelycritiqued and rejected for bad mathematics and even delusions.[347][index_split_006.html#filepos1343959] There are others, too, who have claimedsuccess in creating a ZPE device, or other types of “free energy” devices whichmay or may not be related to the energy systems of UFOs. John Searl of the U.K.is one such inventor. For all we know, one or more of these devices may indeedwork. The problem is that none as yet have been shown conclusively to work.Moreover, all lack peer reviewed analysis and study. Again, as with electrogravitics, we need to understand why this is so. Is itbecause the science is just not strong enough? Is it because of the bureaucracyof the world of science and academia, combined with a terror of sticking one’sneck out? Or it is related to the lack of government funding because this is aclassified subject and the real work is done in secrecy? One thing is evident. Whatever the source of energy behind the UFOphenomenon, it is a revolutionary step beyond what human civilization iscurrently utilizing. Spacetime Our common sense is Newtonian, our universe is not. Like the physics of IsaacNewton, our common sense is logical, comforting, and much simpler than theactual fabric of reality. Particularly as it is understood by theoreticalphysicists today, reality is far more complex. In Newton’s formulation of reality, time and space continue indefinitely.Neither has a beginning, nor end. Both are constant. If the clock says 2:45 p.m.somewhere on Earth, and it is 2:45 p.m. somewhere on a rock circling AlphaCentauri four light-years away, then in one hour it will be exactly 3:45 p.m. inboth places, and essentially everywhere else. This is because in a Newtonianworld, nothing affects the passage of time. It moves at a constant rateeverywhere. What goes for time also goes for space. It continues on and oninfinitely. Time and space, moreover, are entirely distinct and separate,fundamentally unrelated to each other. This, at least, is what Newtonian physicsand our common sense both tell us. However, starting with Einstein, we began to understand space and time not asseparate from each other, but as an interwoven fabric—the spacetime fabric. Webegan to understand gravity as something that curves space, and time assomething that is affected by gravity, just as it is affected by the motion ofobjects that move through space. In other words, time is relative. It does notpass at the same rate everywhere. We also now understand that our universe has an origin, not only in time, butin space. In other words, what we call the Big Bang was not merely some bigexplosion in space. It was, rather, the creation of space and the creation oftime. As difficult as it is for our minds to visualize and truly grasp thisconcept, not only was there no time prior to the Big Bang, but there was nospace in which the universe could exist prior to that moment. How is such athing possible? Such is one of the many mysteries of modern theoretical physics. It is not that the UFO phenomenon leads us necessarily to grapple with someof the leading issues of physics and cosmology. Rather, those leading issueshelp to inform ufology, just as they inform many other areas of intellectualendeavor. However, it is also true that ufology does eventually bump into someof these questions. After all, UFOs constitute a truly puzzling mystery on somany levels. Should it surprise us that, at some point, there would be aconnection to leading edge physics? Perhaps at several points? Miguel Alcubierre Consider faster than light (FTL) travel, for instance. Everyone who has everheard of E=mc2 knows that it is impossible to exceed the speed of light. Howmany times have astronomers and physicists discussed the virtual impossibilityof interstellar travel, all due to the, shall we say, astronomical distancesinvolved? To travel even from a relatively near star of fifty light yearsdistance (which in the grand scheme of things is essentially next door) wouldtake fifty years at the speed of light. With such an obstacle in place, how canbeings from anywhere else even know about us, much less get here? The electronicsignals from the beginning of our Age of Television would only now be reachingplaces of that distance. Anyone farther away will have to wait much longerstill. In the opinion of many physicists, to expect any other beings to reach usis a fantasy. Except for those, of course, who have been thinking along the fringes, andwho seem to have made some progress. Miguel Alcubierre, a physicist at the University of Wales, described aspace-travel scenario that seems rather like Star Trek. With Alcubierre’s warpdrive, one could in theory reach other places in the universe as easily as wedrive to the nearest city. Longer journeys perhaps might feel like drivingacross the country.[348] [index_split_006.html#filepos1344515] According to Einstein, spacetime twists, changes, and essentially distortsunder the influence of concentrations of energy. Alcubierre suggested that itmight be possible to use this phenomenon to travel from one star to another,faster than the speed of light. This could be done by creating a disturbance inspacetime so that the region directly in front is contracted, while the regiondirectly behind is expanded. This distortion of spacetime would therefore propelthe object forward, something like a surfer riding a wave. At first glance, this seems to violate Einstein's special theory ofrelativity, which says that no object can exceed the speed of light. Alcubierre,however, showed that his warp drive does not violate it. Instead, the light alsotravels within spacetime and is carried along, just like the spaceship. Relativeto the spaceship, the light beam is still traveling at the speed of light.Moreover, the spaceship is not moving at the speed of light relative to itsimmediate vicinity. Instead, it is moving along with the warping of spacetimearound it. As it turns out, this is compatible with Bob Lazar’s description ofhow spacecraft travel, which Lazar discussed prior to Alcubierre’s theory. To those of us on Earth watching a spacecraft accelerate away as Alcubierrehypothesized, it would seem incredibly fast. However, to those inside the craft,it would seem normal. An important feature to Alcubierre’s theory is that thewarp drive would not cause time dilation. In other words, one could travel tothe Andromeda Galaxy, two million light years away, be back in time for supper.The reason is because the traveller would not be traveling at or near the speedof light through spacetime. Rather, spacetime itself would have warped for thetraveler. The idea of warp drive is eminently attractive, and the mathematics appear tobe sound. Is there anything stopping us from achieving it? Not surprisingly, yes. The key is something Alcubierre called exotic matter.This would power the warp drive. It possesses negative energy density, whereasnormal matter (which is everything that makes up our world and universe), haspositive energy density. Two pieces of matter with the same energy density areattracted to each other by gravity. Two positives are attracted, and twonegatives are attracted. Positive and negative energy matter, however, arerepelled by gravity. Exotic matter is not fantasy, at least probably not. In 1948, the Dutchphysicist Hendrik Casimir predicted that the effects of negative energydensities are observable. He reasoned that if negative energy densities existed,two closely spaced parallel conducting plates in a vacuum would be attracted toone another. This phenomenon, now called the Casimir effect, was measured in1958, and is usually taken to be a confirmation that negative energy densitiesare possible.[349] [index_split_006.html#filepos1345254] At least in theory, then, warp drive is possible. Of course, that does notprove it is feasible, even for a more advanced species, but it is probablyfoolish to discount the possibility. At least it does not seem to violate thelaws of physics. Clearly, certain technical details must be resolved beforeaerospace firms start building starships. The first order of business would beto learn how to produce such exotic matter. That may take awhile. Dimensions and Strings Let us proceed further now, and ask a question or two about the fundamentalstructure of the universe, or, more accurately, of the multiverse and multipledimensions. That, and string theory. At first glance, one might think string theory has nothing to do with thisidea of extra dimensions. But as some physicists argue, they are closelyrelated. String theory, or superstring theory, tries to answer the question of whatconstitute the fundamental, indivisible building blocks that make up ouruniverse. There are, of course, atoms, which contain electrons, neutrons, andprotons. Inside neutrons and protons are even smaller particles, much smaller,known as quarks. Within conventional physics, that is essentially it. But stringtheory suggests that deep inside any of these particles, there is somethingelse. According to string theorist Brian Greene, that something else is “a dancingfilament of energy, a vibrating string,” that vibrates in different patterns,producing different particles that make up the world around us.[350][index_split_006.html#filepos1345801] The universe, as string theoryconceptualizes it, is built up of an enormous number of tiny filaments ofvibrating energy, vibrating at different frequencies. Different frequenciesproduce different particles. There are several Holy Grails in our world; string theory offers one of them.In this case, it is a Grand Unified Theory of Physics. String theory states thatmatter (electrons and quarks) and radiation (photons and gravitons) derive fromone entity, and that these all exist within the rubric of vibrating strings.This is what is meant by a unified theory.[351][index_split_006.html#filepos1346402] As there always is with anything, there is a catch. String theorists such asGreene, Michio Kaku, and others point out that the mathematics of string theorydo not work in a universe that has just three dimensions of space. Nor does itwork in a universe of four, five, or six dimensions. They assert, however, thatit does work in a universe with ten dimensions of space and one dimension oftime. That is, eleven dimensions. Kaku suggests we think not of a universe, but a multiverse filled withbubbles. The skin of each bubble represents an entire universe. Thus, he says,we are on the skin of a bubble, like flies on flypaper. Ours is an expandingthree-dimensional bubble. Sometimes, these bubbles may bump into each other, orsometimes split into two or more bubbles. In string theory, he argues, there canbe bubbles of different dimensions, but never more than eleven. Each of thebubbles—universes—floats in a much larger area, which is the hyperspace. Eachbubble also vibrates and, as Kaku poetically puts it, creates music. This cosmicmusic resonates throughout eleven dimensions in hyperspace. It is a goodcandidate, he suggests, for the mind of God that Einstein wrote about. String theory and multidimensional theory do not make predictions aboutcivilizations existing in those other dimensions. They see these dimensions astiny and curled up inside themselves somehow in a way that, frankly, most of usstrain to understand. An interesting aspect to string theory is that it does seem possible,mathematically, to make a case for it. Perhaps strong enough that it conceivablyattains the level of scientific proof. As Brian Greene described it, there arein modern physics roughly twenty different numbers that describe our universe.Such numbers include the mass of particles such as electrons and quarks, thestrength of gravity, the strength of the electromagnetic force, and others. Theyhave been measured to great precision, and they must have the values they do,otherwise the universe would not exist. Greene’s image was of twenty dials of acomplex machine: turning any one of those dials would cause the universe tovanish. [images/00016.jpg]Levels of magnification (From the Wikipedia page on String Theory): (1)Macroscopic level: Matter; (2) Molecular level; (3) Atomic level: Protons,neutrons, and electrons; (4) Subatomic level: Electron; (5) Subatomic level:Quarks; (6) String level. But there is one thing no one knows, which is why each of these numberspossess their particular value. String theorists reason, however, that since themanner in which the strings vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extradimensions, if they knew exactly what the extra dimensions looked like, theyshould be able to calculate the allowed vibrational patterns. Therefore, theyshould be able to calculate those twenty numbers. If their results agree withthe actual values of those numbers, this could be the first fundamentalexplanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is. There are a few reasons why this matters from a ufological perspective. Most fundamentally, it is clear that there are deep mysteries about certainaspects of UFOs, certain things about the phenomenon that simply do not makesense. At the same time, our most advanced physicists still lack a grand unifiedtheory of physics: a single, unified set of equations from which all of realitycan make sense. If it turns out that string theory provides that foundation, wemay eventually be able to make better sense of the UFO phenomenon in ways thatcurrently elude us scientifically. There is another reason string theory and theoretical physics in generalmatters to the study of UFOs. For while string theorists tend to discount theidea of alien civilizations existing in other dimensions of reality, to saynothing of other universes, serious UFO researchers are usually not willing todo so. Surely, it is much easier for such researchers to offer such an opinion,since deep knowledge of physics (to say nothing of string theory) iscomparatively rare. It is always easy for newcomers to jump in and make crazystatements. Nevertheless, we may permit our innocence to express itself here, ifonly to come down on the side of wonder and possibility, and ultimately a beliefthat, given enough time and knowledge, we may indeed be able to find a way tocross boundaries that currently seem impenetrable. Time Trying to understand the nature of time is one of those issues that can keepyou pondering for days, weeks, years, and lifetimes. As with space, time isn’t exactly what our brains and common sense tell us.Newton wrote of it as an arrow that goes in one direction only: forward. Butgravity affects time, so that in fact time moves more slowly at the Earth’ssurface than in the upper atmosphere. The difference is nothing that a humanbeing could ever notice, but experiments with atomic clocks have proven it to betrue. The effect is pronounced at the singularity of a black hole, a place wheregravity exerts such a power that time actually stops. Speed also affects time. We know that the faster one travels, especially whenapproaching the speed of light, the more time slows down. Hence the phenomenonknown as time dilation, in which a person inside a spaceship traveling at 99.999percent of the speed of light will age only one year in transit while 223 yearswould pass back home on Earth. This is not an illusion, but an actual effect oftime dilation. Time does not move at the same rate throughout the universe. According to Einstein’s E=mc2, faster than light speeds are impossible.Nevertheless, if you were to exceed the speed of light, then in theory you mightbe going back in time. Perhaps surprisingly, there is no law of physicspreventing time travel. And by time travel, I do mean travel into the past. [images/00017.jpg]A standard depiction of spacetime curvature in relation to gravity. The mathematician Kurt Gödel was the first person, in 1949, to find asolution to Einstein’s equations that allowed for time travel.[352][index_split_006.html#filepos1346928] If the universe rotates, and you were togo around the universe, you would come back before you left. Einstein admittedthis seemed possible, but was unconcerned, since he knew the universe did notrotate, but expanded. “Since then,” said Michio Kaku, “physicists andmathematicians have discovered hundreds of other types of solutions ofEinstein’s equations which allow for time travel.” One such way is to have a wormhole. As the universe can bend and contort, itcan also in theory fold up on itself, something like taking a sheet of paper andfolding it. If you were to draw two dots on the paper and fold the paper untilthe dots met, it would be like the idea of a wormhole. Recall that if we couldfold space in such a manner, we would not merely be bending space, but bendingspacetime. Therefore, according to a number of physicists, it may be possibleusing wormholes to travel back in time.[353][index_split_006.html#filepos1347265] Physicist and cosmologist Paul Davies believes so. “If a wormhole could existand could be traversable,” he stated, “then it would provide a means of goingback in time. So it all hinges on whether stable wormholes are a reality or ifthere’s some aspect of physics … [that] might intercede and prevent the wormholefrom forming. That’s an open question.”[354][index_split_006.html#filepos1347732] Not surprisingly, there is a catch. According to Davies, “Using Einstein’sequations you can show that the energy needed to bend space and time into apretzel is comparable to an exploding star. A black hole.” Obviously, we currently lack the capability to harness this much energy. Butis it possible that our future civilization, or another civilization somewhereelse, will have, or does have, such a capability? Of course, even though no known law of physics prevents time travel, it maybe impossible all the same. Actually going back in time would not only involvegoing back to a specific time and place, which is daunting enough. But in fact,truly to go back to a specific moment in time means going back to a particularmoment in spacetime. Think of it this way. This moment you are currentlyexperiencing—if you could extract one precise, incredibly specific moment—is notsimply a moment in which you are sitting in your chair, in your room, orwherever you happen to be, it is a moment in which the Earth is in a particularposition relative to the Sun, galaxy, and universe; in which the Earth, Sun,planets, galaxies, particles, and packets of energy everywhere are in a preciserelationship with each other throughout all of existence. In fact, that isprobably the best definition of a “moment” imaginable: the relative position ofall particles to all other particles in all of existence, since that is alwayschanging. Therefore, when we talk about time travel into the past, we are not merelytalking about going back to some place on Earth to meet your grandfather orobserve the dinosaurs. We are talking about rewinding the entire universe—allthe particles, all of everything.[355] [index_split_006.html#filepos1348220] One possible loophole to this problem might be the existence of multiple orparallel worlds. This would eliminate the paradoxes that bother all thephysicists. (e.g. If you go back in time and kill your grandfather, you can’t beborn, which means you can’t go back in time to kill your grandfather.) Perhapsmultiple universes is a way out, except that there is no physical theory thatactually predicts this. As far as anyone can tell, such an idea has only existedin the realm of science fiction. Such conundrums might be circumvented by referring to universes of greaterdimensions. Because we live in a three-dimensional reality (plus the dimensionof Time), it means that we perceive time as forever moving ahead in a straightline. Perhaps, however, to a fourth-dimensional being, time might not seem likethat. Instead, time might seem like a sphere. Both perspectives are correct fromtheir points of reference. A fourth-dimensional being could traverse this timecontinuum simply by going from point A to point B, because such a being canperceive that dimension. The third-dimensional being cannot perceive thatdimension.[356] [index_split_006.html#filepos1348594] Interesting, but again we might ask how this is relevant to ufology? One reason is that it helps us to explore one of the fundamental questions weface: who are these “others” and where do they come from? Is it possible thatvisitors in UFOs are traveling from the future? This is a claim, a theme, a memethat has gained a fair amount of attention. Personally, I remain doubtful thattime travel is part of the answer to the UFO mystery. However, as long asleading physicists and mathematicians keep the possibility of time travel alive,closing that door is probably unwise. Entanglement, Consciousness, and the “Others” Our science gets stranger still. There is the matter of quantum entanglement,which Einstein never liked, but could not debunk (he called it “spooky action ata distance\"). We will also explore to what extent consciousness itself is a keyto understanding the presence of “other beings” here in our reality. Beyondthat, we can inquire whether our thoughts manifest, activate, or otherwisecreate the “physical” world around us. Among other things, this includescommunicating with extraterrestrials, interdimensionals, or whatever thesebeings are. First, entanglement. This is a real thing, and remains difficult forphysicists to understand. Rather than try to explain it, most simply observe andmeasure the effect. Kaku, who so often explains complex ideas in physics withsuch ease, described entanglement in one of his many YouTube videos. Visualizetwo electrons, he said, which are very close together and vibrating in unison.If, however, you separate them, it can happen that there is something like aninvisible umbilical cord that continues to connect them, such that if you“wiggle” one particle, its partner is aware of this. Something is connectingthem, even at a distance. Now, separate these particles by the spacial dimensionof a galaxy, one hundred thousand light years. Even at this incredible distance,if you “wiggle” that electron from one end of the galaxy, the electron at theother end of the galaxy is instantly aware of the fact that its twin iswiggling. The communication is therefore much, much faster than the speed oflight, which is supposed to be impossible. This effect has been measured, not at the distance of a galaxy of course, butacross hundreds of miles. The calculations are said to be solid. One wonders whether entanglement could be used to send messages that arefaster than the speed of light. In Kaku's judgement, probably not. What isactually traveling from one electron to the other, he argued, is randominformation. “It’s not morse code,” he said. “You can’t send a love letterinstantly from one part of the universe to another part of the universe fasterthan the speed of light.” In this view, while Einstein was wrong about nothingbeing able to exceed the speed of light, “no usable information” can exceedit.[357] [index_split_006.html#filepos1348985] Living with Uncertainty In 1931, Kurt Gödel developed a fascinating set of mathematical theoremsabout logic which he called his “incompleteness theorums.” Recall that atheorem, unlike a theory, is proven to be true. Gödel’s theorems state that any given set of logical rules, except for themost simple, will always contain statements that are undecidable. They canneither be proven nor disproven. This is because any logical system with eventhe slightest complexity will inevitably become self-referential. This suggests that no grand mathematical system can ever prove or disproveall statements. All logical systems will have statements that cannot be provenor disproven; therefore, all logical systems must be “incomplete.” It alsoimplies that physics will never be able to develop a theory of everything, sinceno set of rules can explain every possible event or outcome. More relevant for the study of UFOs, it also indicates that logically,“proof” is a weaker concept than “true.” In other words, there will always bethings that, despite being true, cannot be proven to be true. That is not onlyunsettling to scientists, it is frustrating to UFO researchers. There may very well be things our minds can never know. One of Gödel’sincompleteness theorems states that no system can prove its own consistency.Thus, no sane mind can prove its own sanity. Also, since that same law statesthat any system able to prove its consistency to itself must be inconsistent,any mind that believes it can prove its own sanity is, therefore, insane.[358][index_split_006.html#filepos1349361] We may never get to a point in our understanding, and specifically in ourscience, where we can prove everything that is true. Some things may be true,but may forever be unable to prove. Perhaps this may give us a fresh perspectiveto the idea of taking certain matters on faith. Consciousness The questions about consciousness are many. One that has been raised earlierin this book is whether or not people have the ability, by the power of mind, tocommunicate with entities from elsewhere. More generally, we wonder, what arethe limits of the powers of the mind? What are the limits of consciousness? Canconsciousness create reality, as some have claimed? To this last question, there are at least two meanings, and two answers. In the first meaning, the answer is yes. Right now, there are roughly twomillion bits of sensory data trying to make their way into your mind.Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, your mind can only process about 40,000bits of incoming data per second. This means that your mind is constantlysorting data into two categories: what matters and what does not. Only twopercent of the data reaches your consciousness. Clearly, the data that you select creates your reality. Or, perhaps moreaccurately, how you perceive reality. It follows that you have an ability todecide what matters, and what does not, at least to a greater or lesser extent.The things you tell yourself about yourself, and the things you tell yourselfabout others, such things matter a great deal. They shape your mental world,your personality, and your future perceptions. It is like creating roadways inyour mind, and in fact this is literally true in the sense that you traincertain neurons and pathways in your mind. Certain connections become powerful,other connections weaken, all due to the habits of your thinking. You can, atany moment, choose to create pathways in your mind. In that sense, you canchoose to create yourself however you desire. To the second meaning of the question, “do our thoughts create reality,” weare asking whether our thoughts shape external reality, to the extent that thereare things external to our mind and our bodies. To that, I have to say yes andno. Whether more yes than no is something I personally have not yet decided. Butthat our thoughts can shape external reality is one of those annoying,persistent possibilities that fly in the face of materialistic scientificthinking. One of the most famous experiments in physics is the double slit experiment.If you shoot photons at a wall, blocked by a barrier with a single verticalslit, the result is a spray pattern in which the electrons hit the wall, butnevertheless in a definite vertical arrangement.[359][index_split_006.html#filepos1350197] The photons, in other words, behave justas particles would be expected to behave. When you create a second vertical slit for them to pass through, so that youhave two vertical slits side-by-side, the resulting pattern on the wall behindshows an interference pattern. In this instance, the photons behave more like awave than particles. More accurately, they travel as waves, but are detected asparticles. When you fire one photon at a time, things become more strange. When they gothrough a single slit, the result is still a particle pattern. When they gothrough one at a time through the double slits, the result is still a wavepattern, even though there appears to be no way they could be interfering witheach other. This holds true even if you shoot one photon at a time through oneslit, then one photon at a time through the other. The result is still a wavepattern. Is it possible that the photons pass through both slits at once? To detectwhich slit the individual photons pass through, detection devices can beinstalled at each slit. Each photon can then be observed to go through eitherone slit or the other, but never both. So far, so good. However, when they dothis, the resulting pattern is a uniform distribution with no interference. Thephotons are now behaving as particles. How it appears is that the act of observation has caused the photons to losetheir wave nature and act as ordinary particles. But matters get stranger still. The great physicist, John Wheeler, onceproposed something called the delayed choice experiment, which has since beenreplicated. Incredibly, it confirms that the thought of the observer not onlydetermines the result of how the light behaves, but even does so retroactively. Imagine a configuration in which two telescopes are positioned behind thedetection screen, each telescope aimed precisely at one of the slits. After theindividual photon passes through one of the slits, the detection screen can beremoved very quickly to reveal the telescopes, allowing the photon to passthrough one of the telescopes. The scientist decides whether or not to removethe screen. When the screen remains in place, the result is a standard interferencepattern, with the photons acting as waves. However, if the experimenter choosesto remove the screen, the distribution of the photons is an exact particledistribution, with no interference pattern whatsoever. It appears solely uponthe choice of the experimenter as to whether the photons act as waves orparticles. This choice happens after the photons have passed through the slits.The experimenter's choice in the present has somehow affected the behavior ofthe photon in the past.[360] [index_split_006.html#filepos1350609] Entanglement Based on the double slit experiment, there would seem to be a scientificfoundation to the idea that consciousness, or mind, has some sort ofrelationship to light, and perhaps even to time. If we also accept that there issuch a thing as telepathy, or some form of mind-to-mind communication such asclairvoyance or remote viewing, we may wonder if there is something that can tiethem all together. Ultimately, are there any scientifically promising conceptsof psi phenomena? There are indeed. One that is especially promising comes from physicist DeanRadin, a member of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, founded by Apollo astronautEdgar Mitchell. Radin's book, Entangled Minds, suggests that what we call psiphenomena is in fact a result of quantum entanglement of the mind.[361][index_split_006.html#filepos1351117] While physicists accept entanglement, they generally see it as a delicaterelationship among individual particles, or at most a few atoms. Kaku, forinstance, does not believe quantum entanglement can achieve telepathy. Hediscusses the problem of decoherence. That is, while the particles (electrons)are in phase, they are ‘coherent.’ This is quantum entanglement. However, eachperson is comprised of trillions upon trillions of atoms. Thus, to get two mindsto vibrate in unison “would be impossible. The world’s record for making objectsentangled is only just a few atoms. Imagine trying to entangle two mindstogether.” If you want to read someone's mind, he suggests, you would be betteroff taking MRI and EEG scans of the brain, then decipher them via computers,what is known as radio-enhanced telepathy.[362][index_split_006.html#filepos1351440] Yet, Radin suggests that entanglement is a widespread fact of reality, andalso the best explanation for why people experience what we call paranormalevents, except that they are not paranormal. They are entirely normal. There are several implications of this thesis. First, everything in theuniverse is ultimately energy, and energy is influenced by mind. Second, quantumphysicists suggest that electrons, or events, are potential, rather than actualphysical entities. Indeed, all of existence may be fundamentally an unlimitedquantum field of energy, a sea of infinite possibilities waiting to happen.Thus, there are various potentials, essentially until somebody looks. It is asthough we force the universe to make a determination about which potential isgoing to be actualized. Third, consciousness collapses the wave function intoactual particles that exist in space and time. Another way to put it would be tosay that consciousness experiences energy as matter. Things only appear asmatter when they are being observed. Ultimately, the observer is not separate from the observation; theexperimenter is not separate from the experiment. The observer plays a part increating the reality that is being observed. The Heisenberg UncertaintyPrinciple of consciousness states that no pure measurement is possible withoutcreation. Physicists who deal in quantum mechanics state: “You cannot(objectively) observe something without changing it in the process.”[363][index_split_006.html#filepos1351856] Such ideas have circulated in one way or another in scientific circles formuch of the twentieth century, but great ideas sometimes take time to make theirimpact fully felt. Our physics remains in the midst of an intellectualrevolution. This revolution is not complete, but the implications lookincreasingly clear that humankind is in a new stage of scientific understanding.Classical physics—the physics of locality and causation within an unchangingplaying arena of space, with time that shoots in one direction like an arrow—nolonger fully applies. Evidence of data from phenomena such as remote viewing or other types of psiphenomena indicate that something is going on that classical physics does notexplain. Radin’s concept of entanglement, or some variation thereof, may providean explanation of this. Consciousness seems to be a key. Yet, as biologist Rupert Sheldrake pointed out, “we don’t know howconsciousness works, or what it does. This is one of the things which in scienceis called ‘the hard problem,’ because there is no known reason why we should beconscious at all, or exactly how the mind works.” His suggestion is that “ourminds are field-like, that they are not confined to the inside of the head, thatthey spread out into the environment around us. And because our minds areextended beyond our brains, they can have effects at a distance.”[364][index_split_006.html#filepos1352153] Perhaps this is it: consciousness is a force of nature. If this is so, itmight explain the claim that we sometimes encounter, that the occupants of aliencraft are themselves part of the propulsion and control systems. Perhaps itcould explain the radical movements of the craft, as well. Of course, that isalien consciousness. Will we ever find out if human consciousness is up to thattask? Connecting to Ufology For ufology to accept the idea of mental connections between us and them, westill need to be careful. Claims continue to require evidence. We can listen toclaims, but we are fools if we discard the scientific method in examining them.Nevertheless, it seems evident that consciousness does matter within ufology.Claims of mind-to-mind contact abound. Since contemporary science does notappear to rule out that such things are impossible, we might feel confident thatreal progress can be made in the coming years. This can be said of all the scientific subjects we have looked at in thischapter. For years, observed UFO phenomena have seemed to present sheerimpossibilities to many scientists. Naturally, this has been one of the majorstumbling blocks preventing its wider public acceptance. Reported observationsof craft that zigzag, or instantly accelerate, or of people being floatedthrough solid walls, stagger our common sense. It is a common sense that stillrelies largely on a slightly souped-up version of 19th century scientificmaterialism. If the particulars of UFO reports were to seem as impossible today as theydid in prior generations, then we might be justified in dismissing many of theobservations as misidentification, confabulation, or some other kind of mistake.Instead, as the years go by, it appears that science is catching up to thephenomenon. Slowly but surely, we are finding our way toward making scientificsense of this greatest of mysteries. It is as if the UFO phenomenon were teaching us something very important, notmerely about the nature of the cosmos, but about ourselves. Chapter 12Into the Future, Into Ourselves Given the nature of UFO secrecy, we might ask if it will ever end? After all,this is a situation that has been going on since the 1940s, a full humanlifetime. Despite the constant activity recorded by people year after year,there has been no official disclosure of the UFO reality. It is obvious thatthose in possession of this great secret, whether human or non-human, have nointention of revealing it. For that reason, there are a number of commentatorswho conclude that Disclosure will never occur. This, however, is a mistakenconclusion, caused by too narrow a viewpoint. We must remind ourselves that the secret keepers are not the only factor inthe grand equation. There are three great factors. There are the human elites,who in all likelihood are the primary caretakers of the secrecy program. Inaddition to them, of course, there are the other beings—the Others, as I havesometimes called them. They, too, have declined to reveal themselves openly,even after all these years, and perhaps even centuries and millennia. We mighttherefore conclude, very logically, that they too will never willingly announcethemselves to us. Of course, we should allow for the possibility that they mayyet decide to end the secrecy at some point. The likelihood seems small, but itis possible at least in theory. The dynamic part of the secrecy equation, however, is us, the people of theworld. Human civilization is currently undergoing its most dramatictransformation in history. It is sometimes easy for us to forget just howastonishing our journey is. Humanity's Trajectory We have never been where we are now. For hundreds of thousands of years,human beings have lived and walked on Planet Earth, and the hominids prior to usfor millions more. Yet, our recorded history, since the invention of writing,goes back a mere 6,000 years. Even if we accept the idea of a great, lost,ancient human civilization—call it the Atlantis theory—that would have been onlyten to twelve thousand years ago, according to most scholars who have studiedthe matter. This is still not long ago in the grand scheme of things. During allof that time and before, for thousands upon thousands of years we have been,technologically, at the simplest levels. Only within the last five to tenthousand years did we even get to the level of animals pulling wooden carts. Then, just a few centuries ago, we discovered science. Francis Bacon,Galileo, René Descartes, Isaac Newton, and the rest. They introduced acompletely new way of thinking and began the process of transforming all of us.Even so, it wasn’t until roughly one hundred and fifty years ago that humanityreally began to develop its science and technology in earnest. Advancedmetallurgy, petroleum, instant communications in the form of telegraph andtelephone, the automobile, the electric light bulb, radio, flight, thedevelopment of atomic weapons, computers, the Internet, handheld devices, andeverything else that is now part of our world today. No one could have foreseenthis journey, neither the transformation itself, nor the speed with which it hasoccurred. The Internet has existed for roughly twenty years, in which time ithas completely changed our world, and in ways that nobody predicted even duringthe early 1990s. As if anyone needs to be reminded: smart phones, YouTube, andFacebook, all of which are ubiquitous and integral elements in the daily livesof billions of people, did not make their appearance until the first decade ofthe 21st century. We are not done with this journey. There is a future, and it will offer manysurprises. Those who are inclined to skepticism about UFOs, who think the ideajust too strange to believe, might want to study current developments in a fewof our own technologies. Experts in artificial intelligence, for example, manyof whom are quite mainstream, make predictions for the next twenty to fortyyears that boggle the mind. They are talking about computers of the near futurethat will be able to converse with you easily and fluently, with an intelligencethat appears to match or exceed human intelligence. They won’t need sleep orcoffee, they will simply go. Futurist Ray Kurzweil sees a future in whichmachines achieve a “godlike” level of intelligence.[365][index_split_006.html#filepos1352595] Then factor in likely advances in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and perhapsquantum computing, all of which portend radical changes in the next generation.With mastery and manipulation of the human genome, what if scientists canenhance human brains via genetics or some combination of genetics andnanotechnology, that supplements the work of neurons? What if basic humanintelligence can be radically enhanced, and even possess the ability wirelesslyto interface with the web? This is only the beginning. Developments in 3-D printing may be morerevolutionary in the near term. This will bring the information revolution ofthe web and peer-to-peer transfers directly to the manufacturing process,enabling creative people around the world to design radically new products thatcan be downloaded and “printed” (e.g. manufactured) in one's home. More on thislater in this chapter. Within the blink of a cosmic eye, we are not simply elevating ourselves to anew type of society, nor even a new civilization, but possibly a new species ofhumanity itself. This is not like the transformation that medieval Europe wentthrough during the Renaissance. It’s more like the difference between homosapiens neanderthalis and homo sapiens sapiens. There is the real possibilitythat human beings even a mere century from now will live in a society so vastlydifferent, with mental tools so far beyond what we currently have, that they maylook at our society as having little to offer them in terms of the problems andrealities that they will be facing. There is the obvious danger that such a technological utopia becomes adystopian nightmare. One way would be through ever greater surveillance andcontrol over the Internet, already everywhere. Surveillance may not always equalrepression, but it does intimidate people, which has the same effect.Censorship, however does equal repression, and is also widespread. The Egyptiangovernment famously closed off its internet during the Arab Spring of 2011,China has its Great Firewall, and many nations have censorship embedded in thefabric of their web. In 2012, privacy groups initiated lawsuits against the U.S.Department of Homeland Security over its plans for an “Internet Kill Switch,” alegal wrangle that has continued as of this writing.[366][index_split_006.html#filepos1352931] Possibly a greater threat than this, however, are the distractions anddumbing down of our culture. For instance, new developments in gaming, will soonbe virtual reality immersion. Why bother trying to solve real-world problems (oreven learning about them) when you can become a virtual James Bond or date yourfavorite movie star in a near-real-life immersive setting? The western worldlong ago mastered the art of public relations in the service of politicalconformity and corporate profits. Clearly, the lessons of the past will beapplied to our brave new world. The result may well be a zombie world of peopledrugged up on pharmaceuticals, ingesting processed and unhealthy GMO foods,uneducated in the history of their society, and living in an illusory worlddesigned to distract and deflect. In other words, what modern America and muchof the world already looks like, only more so, with people detached from theirtrue selves, spinning out fantasies and simply running out the clock. Granted,alarmists have made such claims for years about the impact of magazines, comicbooks, radio dramas and more. However, we might remind ourselves that some ofthose criticisms were probably valid. More to the point, the power of ourcurrent system of distractions is much greater than anything human culture hasexperienced before. In such a world, there could even be a danger of specific classes and evensubspecies of humanity being developed. There could be, quite literally, a“master race” with greater strength and intelligence, and with longer lifespans,presiding over a world of human drones, kept suitably stupid for a life ofservice and distraction. We already have clear and distinct classes of humanity;what is to prevent such a nightmare from entering our very biology? If such a future comes to fruition, perhaps it will be possible to keep theend of UFO secrecy at bay for a much longer time. Perhaps. But for how long? Acentury? Two centuries? At some point, even in such an awful future, the secrecyprogram would merely be an exercise in staving off the inevitable. Even underthe worst circumstances, the end of secrecy will come. Besides, the situation is unlikely to deteriorate quite that rapidly before,say, 2035 or so, roughly twenty years from this writing. The relevance of allthis for Disclosure is that because we are changing so rapidly, it seems verylikely that we will develop the capability, openly and finally, to prove thematter of UFO reality to ourselves without need for official governmentacknowledgment. Once we get to that point, once this reality is rapidly andwidely understood, governments around the world will have no choice but toacknowledge the obvious.[367] [index_split_006.html#filepos1353375] What Can Cause Disclosure? Regarding possible triggers that may force Disclosure, a few candidates cometo mind. One is a mass sighting. Of course, there have been mass sightings of UFOs inthe past, and none have made that breakthrough. Yet, it may still happen. It isonly a matter of time until multiple witnesses record a mass UFO event, eachwith their own camera, from multiple simultaneous angles. The quality ofphotography and videography for smartphones is now very good. One wonders whatother capabilities these devices will soon have, to say nothing of surveillancecameras, police dashboard cameras, and other recording devices that are fillingour world. Perhaps we will gain a widespread ability to capture infrared ornight vision, or the ability to capture other types of signals, such aselectromagnetic? The possibilities are there and will grow. It is obvious that, along with better detection and recording techniques,comes better ability to create fake videos for YouTube. However, the situationis in a constant state of flux. Although video fakery has become sophisticated,faking an infrared signal may not be as easy to do, at least for a little while.The fundamental reality is that, with everyone becoming a potential videographerat any given moment, the potential for a mass, recorded sighting becomes greaterand greater. Indeed, this is already happening, although there has yet to bethat “perfect” sighting which gains worldwide attention, and develops enoughmomentum to force an admission that all of this is real. But it would be foolishto rule it out, and it may come soon. At any rate, it seems like aninevitability. Another possibility that can force Disclosure would be a Wikileaks type ofevent. Like advanced smart phones, Wikileaks did not exist at the turn of thecentury because the global technological infrastructure was not ready for it.But now it is, and now it’s here. Consider the radical releases of informationthat Wikileaks, groups like Anonymous, and individuals like Bradley Manning,Edward Snowden, and others have been responsible for in the first decade of the21st century. The release of thousands of classified pages from the U.S. as wellas other countries around the world, all sensitive, all detailing secret (andoften illegal) activities that those parties wanted to keep hidden indefinitely.All of these releases were, strictly speaking, illegal of course, but that doesnot stop them from happening. The leaks are here, and the Wikileaks phenomenonis part of our world, part of our lives. It will not go away. How long will itbe until explosive UFO-related material is released? Such data is probablyavailable somewhere, ready to see the light of day. Indeed, in late 2010,Wikileaks leader Julian Assange hinted as much, but nothing substantial has yetbeen released. Certainly, the release of sensitive UFO information, whether legal or not,could be a major problem to contain for those managing the secret. Could it beenough to force an admission of the reality of the UFO phenomenon? I believe so. The universality of personal recording devices (such as smartphones) andWikileaks are merely two aspects of the changes going on in our world today.They are symptoms and results of deeper changes that cannot be stopped. We arechanging dramatically and rapidly. We cannot possibly think that in anotherdecade, we will not have gone through more changes. What will another twentyyears bring? Another century? Like the old song says, “Something's Gotta Give.” What Happens After Disclosure? Let us assume that something forces the hand of the U.S. President or anotherworld leader. A major sighting, a major leak; something. He or she, after abuildup of several weeks of speculation following the event, finally holds apress conference and makes that bombshell understatement: “I have been advisedby the National Security Council and heads of our intelligence community thatthere is a reality to some of the UFO phenomenon, in that some UFOs are realphysical anomalous craft, not manufactured by any known civilization on Earth.” Or words to that effect. It is the kind of statement that many proponents ofUFO Disclosure would like to hear. The real question, however, is what next? Imight think that any President would want to say, “Well, that’s all for now,I’ll be taking a vacation for a few months. See you all later.” Unfortunatelyfor the President, people will be asking a few follow-up questions. Such as who are these beings? What is their agenda? Do we have anything tofear? These will be very difficult to answer. There is every reason to believe thateven the leaders of the black budget/breakaway society, those groups that havebeen studying this for years, may be outmatched by what they are dealing with.They probably have their own questions and even fears. And what if they do know what they are dealing with? Although it is probablyimpossible to know the full intentions of non-human visitors (or permanentresidents), it is entirely possible, judging from the data we do have, that someof them care little for humanity. What if an “alien agenda” has been determinedwithin the intelligence community, and this agenda includes an eventualreplacement of humanity by some sort of hybrid species? This is what abductionresearcher David Jacobs has argued. And even if that is not true, does anyPresident honestly believe he or she can contain rampant speculation along theselines? Panic is an easy outcome to foresee. Even if the intentions of these other beings are said to be neutral orpositive, there will clearly be tremendous suspicion by large swaths ofhumanity. An alien presence of any sort will not be an easy sell. There willalready be a sizable number of people predisposed to interpreting such beings asnothing less than demonic. Short of dragging one of these beings to a podium andsubjecting it to hours and days and weeks of questions by an insatiable public,it is unlikely that any “Disclosure” will satisfy the public regarding alienmotivations. That is only the beginning of the problems. There is a basic politicalquestion that people will ask, one with profound implications: How have you managed to keep this secret all these years? For years and years, we have been told that UFOs are mundane objects ornatural effects, that ETs or aliens are definitely not here on Earth, notinteracting with us in any way, that UFO believers may be well-meaning but havebeen mistaken about all of that. Such has been the mindset embedded within allof our major institutions. It is a given within our educational institutions,from primary schools, through universities and postdoctoral levels. It pervadesour major news organizations, in which an open belief in UFOs is a definitethird rail for one’s career. (As one example, I learned from a personal sourceconnected to America's National Public Radio that it is an explicit policy neverto give the UFO topic a serious tone in any of its broadcasts. This policy iscertainly the case in all major American media.) It pervades our scientificestablishment, for sure, and also our political system. Political careers havebeen destroyed, or at least severely undermined, by the UFO taint. Such was thecase with Presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich in 2008, after it became knownthat, many years before, he had seen a UFO. Never mind the fact that twowitnesses who had been there with him also confirmed the sighting. All of these institutions and others have treated the UFO topic as nothingmore than a joke, something suitable for immature minds. But can it really bethat professors, scientists, politicians, and media executives throughoutAmerica have uniformly dismissed this phenomenon without any influence from oreven cooperation from the U.S. intelligence community? The answer is no. Even the most modest amount of research into the subjecthas demonstrated a strong intelligence community influence over all of thoseinstitutions. In other words, when Disclosure comes, people will clearly see that thenational security apparatus has created a global culture that has suffocated thetruth. Researchers will begin to investigate, in a serious way, just how theserelationships have undermined the credibility of all of those institutions, aswell as our apprehension of truth. There will be a major cultural andinstitutional housecleaning. But it will not stop there. Citizens will want to know specifics about thestructure of secrecy itself. They will want to know how much the U.S. Presidentshave known. Have they been in the loop all these years, or out of it? Who hasbeen running the UFO cover-up? If the answer is anything along the lines of my own research, it will showthat the cover-up long ago shifted away from formal Presidential authority intointernational and private hands. It is not that the U.S. President isirrelevant, but that the presidency serves as the public face of the power elitethat stands behind. Most people have come to understand that this is the caseregarding power in general, and it is more than likely the case regarding UFOsecrecy. In other words, the moment of Disclosure will trigger an intellectualrevolution worldwide, and will cause us to reexamine the true structure of poweron Planet Earth. Disclosure will be a moment in which the world sees andacknowledges that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all. The lies will not stop, however. Instead, we will participate in a great newbattle. For the necessity of a Presidential announcement does not mean that theCIA, and the other intelligence groups that have managed this secret for years,will simply walk away from the table. There has been a concerted effort spanningan entire human lifetime to control this topic. A great deal has been investedin it, and mere Disclosure will not alter that. The real issue in the immediatepost-Disclosure world will be: who controls the spin to the story? What willDisclosure mean? Once the UFO reality becomes a topic for public discussion, a great dividewill open. People around the world will demand answers while governments parseout information as sparingly as possible. As always, spin doctors will try tomanage the situation according to national security policy, but this timeindependent UFO researchers may get a public hearing that they had never beforereceived. If the official spokespersons make misleading or false statements, itwill be easier, post-Disclosure, for independent researchers to point this out.That is because this time, the world will be more likely to listen. There willalso be many more independent journalists investigating this topic. How all thatwill turn out only time will tell, but the government/intelligence/corporatespin machine will certainly be working overtime to maintain control. It will beup to the people to make enough noise to force admissions from their politicalleaders. Energy If there were a true free market in our world, we would have broken thepetroleum paradigm long ago. Instead, there have been three main obstacles to asource of clean, free energy. First has been the fact that so many patentsrelating to revolutionary technology have been classified and kept within theblack budget world, in effect holding our future hostage. Second, and closelyrelated to the first, has been the lack of institutional support to fund theresearch. The effect of these first two obstacles has lead to a third:skepticism that such a thing is even possible. But once it is widely understoodthat there is a solution, then we have overcome obstacle number three. That willprobably be enough to do the job. Following Disclosure, energy will be a central issue. As discussedpreviously, people will immediately understand that, whatever the source ofenergy UFOs are using, it surpasses petroleum. Whether quickly or not, asolution will be found. Meanwhile, uncertainties will be rampant relating topetroleum futures, and the global financial markets will roil. Fortunes will bewon and lost. A post-petroleum energy paradigm will be discovered. Perhaps it will berevealed through inquiries into the black budget world, which may well have madegreat strides into the matter. Leak after leak has emerged from that world, allindicating deep interest and research into these types of problems. If the storyof the so-called Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV) is true (and I believe it is),then at least some answers to revolutionary energy and propulsion have beenknown for several decades. How long will it take after Disclosure beforesomething along these lines is openly acknowledged? Moreover, when it is, whathappens to the valuation of the trillions of dollars worth of petroleum andnatural gas reserves around the world? What happens to stability in the MiddleEast, and everywhere else? Looking to the black budget world (or the aliens, or any other source) foranswers, however, will probably not be necessary. New answers will be found, iffor no other reason than the realization that they are possible. In alllikelihood, it will not take long for scientists, many of whom will workindependently, to devise solutions themselves. Whether by one way or another, the petroleum industry (along with naturalgas, coal, solar, wind, and nuclear fission power) will become obsolescent. Assume that the energy solution to UFOs involves some form of energy that wewould consider free and clean. This would be the ideal solution, something thatcould truly usher in a new era for humanity. It would allow us to solve many ofthe problems we have created: something as basic as toxic remediation, forexample. Other than political will and commitment, the biggest obstaclecurrently preventing a cleanup of the global environment is, oddly enough, alack of energy. Scientists have developed a startling array of microbes andbacteria that can neutralize various types of toxic contamination, but economicsand energy considerations inhibit implementing these on a wide scale. Free andclean energy solutions ought to overcome such limitations. Ditto regardingcleanup of our polluted oceans, or desalination of water, or a host of otherpressing needs for the sustainable support of human, animal, and plant life onEarth. Clean and cheap energy would also trigger explosive economic growth.Throughout history there has been a remarkable correlation between the cost ofenergy and the rate of economic growth. The more abundant the source of energy,the cheaper it is, and the healthier the economy. When sources of energy becomescarce, they become expensive, and the economy slows down. In the second decadeof the 21st century, the global economy has failed to keep energy costs lowenough to ensure widespread and equitable growth. A new source of energy,something implicit within the UFO phenomenon, would assure significant economicgrowth for a long time to come. No oil, hence no oil wars. No energy pollution, hence a real possibility toenable the global environment to heal. Cheap energy, hence less human sufferingand fewer reasons to go to war. These are very significant outcomes to beconsidered as a result of Disclosure. But there is more still. Ultimately, cheap energy will transform human society itself, just as cheappetroleum did during the 19th century. But this new source of energy may be moreabundant than petroleum. Will it be possible, post-Disclosure, for people to owntheir personal flying saucers? On the face of it, it seems a fantastic question.But is it really so outrageous? If such technology ever became widespread, itwould enable a new mobility that, all by itself, would transform society. Notonly would someone be able to zip off to any part of the world nearly instantly,but they might, in theory, be able to leave Earth’s atmosphere. The Moon orbeyond ... why not? There are yet more considerations. With clean and abundant energy, it wouldbecome practical to develop a device that could generate oxygen easily andcheaply on planetary surfaces that have water, whether in liquid or frozen form.We now know there are several places in our solar system that have water, andwhere there is water, there is oxygen. Where there is oxygen, people can live.Indeed, with enough energy, people can manipulate their environment to theirheart's content and find a way to live. It all comes down to sufficientavailability of energy. The above is a mere scratching of the surface, but already it is evident thatDisclosure would quickly revolutionize human society. Consider how rapidly ourdigital revolution has been, and how dramatically it has transformed our worldwithin a mere twenty years. Disclosure would be more dramatic still. There are other sides to free energy. First, we can assume that the so-calledpowers that be may not be especially happy with such a mass democratization ofenergy. If everyone has enough energy, then everyone becomes more difficult tomanage. From the point of view of those interests at the top of the humanpyramid, this is a problem. We can assume they will undertake whatever measurespossible to prevent this from happening. But the real question will be, can theysucceed? This is something no one can know at present, but my own feeling isthat any attempt to stop history from moving forward will inevitably fail. There is another problem to be considered regarding free energy, no matterhow clean it may be. Clean energy may not result in climate change or othertypes of environmental degradation. It may not be toxic to the environment theway that wood, coal, oil, and even natural gas have been. Yet, it is helpful toremember that a large portion of our global environmental crisis is not so muchrelated to pollution as it is simply with the destruction of the natural habitatby human beings. As of this writing, there are more than seven billion people onEarth, swarming about the planet like so many locusts, devouring everything inour wake. We cannot help ourselves. More real estate development, more sprawl,less room for other creatures. This seems to be our way, but has only become asignificant problem in the last few centuries, especially once humanity’spopulation began its steep incline into the billions. Free energy may wellaccelerate that process. It may enable humanity to devour the planet's resourceseven faster, to depopulate the ocean's fishes, and to push out all other speciesof life that happen to be in the way of our expansion. There is, of course, the problem of weaponry that may be developed from suchsources of incredible energy. Any technology that can heat one's homeindefinitely can likely be adapted to create a dangerous weapon, perhapssomething that could evaporate a nation or an ocean. Unless by some miracle weall immediately become the better angels of our nature, it is frightening toconsider that some of the sociopaths among us would have access to suchtechnology. Perhaps you trust yourself with it, but can you trust all of yourneighbors? Or everyone who lives in your city? Or your nation? Or the world? Inthe words of Spiderman’s Uncle Ben, “with great power comes greatresponsibility.” Whether humanity finds a way to handle its great new power will be another ofthe critically important themes in our post-Disclosure world. More on thisshortly. A Cultural Revolution We live in a world that is bound together by a web of interwoven lies. As theyears pass, more people understand this. They see that our political andeconomic infrastructure rests upon grotesque exploitation of the great masses ofpeople around the world for the benefit of an infinitesimally small group. TheOccupy Movement gave them a name: The One Percent, although the true percentageis much smaller than that. Thus, the Emperor is wearing no clothes, and a fewpeople are seeing this. It is entirely possible that Disclosure will force usopenly to confront this inequality. For Disclosure will usher in a cultural revolution not seen since the 1960s.Except that a post-Disclosure cultural revolution will be deeper, morewidespread, and more threatening to the established structure of power.Millions, and possibly billions, of young people will emotionally opt out of asystem and ideology that, for as long as they have lived, has been been based onlies. Along the way, they will question and expose many other officiallysanctioned lies. Conspiracies and claims of cover-up will be unearthed yetagain, this time with much more force. Not merely 9/11, but the false pretensesunderlying all of America's recent wars, the growth of the global police andcitizen espionage complex, the meaning of chemtrails, the existence of enormoussecret underground bases and tunnel complexes, and even the global banking andprivate debt-based system that has created worldwide financial enslavement. Andonward. It is impossible to know where such a line of questioning will end, and whatamount of political change will come as a result of such questions andrevelations. But we will see a widespread, massive disaffection by much ofhumanity from the previous dominant ideology. And there will be, inevitably, acoherent political critique that encompasses total opposition to the establishedsystem, and which will be implemented on a global scale. Someone will give it aname, but for now I call it simply: The Opposition. It will go far beyond occupying Wall Street. The Opposition will havefactions, some of which will be peaceful, some of which may not be. Some mayseek to occupy Area 51, or Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, or the FederalReserve building, or the next meeting of the Bilderberg Group. It will employsophisticated hacking and leaks to disrupt the operations of those select fewwho have been manipulating human destiny. This will be enhanced or exacerbated by many people identifying explicitlywith these other beings, whatever they may be. Like all revolutions, it willbeat with the heart of libertarian anarchy. After all, all people fundamentallywant the freedom, privacy, and dignity that is the birthright of every humansoul. And like all revolutions, certain leaders will emerge who will symbolizethe movement, others who will guide it behind the scenes, others still who willseek to co-opt and betray it, or else steer it into what they feel are saferpathways. No revolution ever delivers all of its promises. The DisclosureRevolution will succeed or fail based on the courage, foresight, and humanity ofthose leading it, and the passion of those pushing up from below. The new era will see new types of utopian ideas arise, as well as a newmillennialism. In other words, new ideas on how to create paradise on Earth, aswell as those that predict the end of the world. Some of this will be enhancedby a more widespread use of hallucinogenic drugs, something that is alreadygrowing within the alternative community. Use of DMT through ayahuasca and otherdrugs is believed by many of its practitioners to enable them to open the doorsof perception and experience other dimensions of reality, including the beingsthat are responsible for the UFO phenomenon.[368][index_split_006.html#filepos1353828] Such is the belief held by many, andwhatever its truth value, we can be sure many people will accept it. As was thecase during the 1960s, there will be a great cultural divide separating theconservatives on one end from those who decide to turn on, tune in, and dropout. Our attitudes toward spirituality and science likewise will be affected. WhenI researched A.D. After Disclosure with Bryce Zabel, one of our conclusionsregarding religion was that, at least in the near-term, religions might farereasonably well. Although many pundits, mostly religious skeptics, typicallypredict the collapse of organized religion in the event of Disclosure, Bryce andI disagreed. First of all, there are a wide range of religions on this planet.Many of the Eastern religions, such as Buddhism or Hinduism, are well adapted todeal with an extraterrestrial or interdimensional reality. Mormonism, whichteaches a plurality of worlds, is also well-positioned. But even the threeDesert Sky God religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—are unlikely tocollapse in the event of Disclosure. At least not right away. In Islam, for instance, belief in extraterrestrial life is not against itscreed. Allah is said to have created many worlds. Nor is it a problem to believein interdimensional spirits, since Islam has a number of references to the Jinn,what non-Muslims have often called genies. Judaism has little to say aboutbelief in other worlds, and (excepting special, esoteric threads such asQabalistic study) cosmology is not a major aspect of contemporary Judaic belief.An ET presence is unlikely to damage Judaic beliefs. Christianity is a bit different, and there are obvious, identifiable riftswithin it. The Roman Catholic church, on the one hand, has for the past fewdecades gone out of its way to promote the idea of extraterrestrial life. Quitea few statements have issued from the Vatican supporting the notion of anabundance of life in the universe as part of God’s great plan. On the otherhand, many evangelical Christians will interpret any alleged extraterrestrialpresence as demonic. Several passages from the New Testament have been used tosupport this position. New Age beliefs are different still. Most self-described New Agers areinclined to look at these other beings in a positive light, as humanity'sbenefactors and even space brothers. Since the 1970s, such beliefs have spreadthroughout the world, and certainly into the UFO subculture. There is no bridge long enough to join this viewpoint with that of theevangelicals. The rift is irreconcilable and only two things can resolve it. Oneis an overwhelming amount of new information that will satisfy people to form anopinion. The other is time: time for new generations to arise, with newperspectives that cannot now even be predicted. People can change, but deepchanges that affect entire societies can come only from new generations. Although the world's major religions aren’t likely to collapse in the shortterm, they do face dangers in the short and long term. The immediate dangerwould come if there is a credible claim that the great religious leaders ofhistory were extraterrestrial. Or, if it becomes widely believed that humanityitself was the creation of extraterrestrials, and that the aliens themselveswere the gods of ancient times. In essence, the idea that Jesus, Moses, Buddha,Mohammed, Zeus, or any other spiritual icon of the past was an extraterrestrial.One hears this line of speculation so much these days that it is a major subtextof the UFO belief set. Of course that does not make it true, and it seemsunlikely that the truth on this matter could ever be known. Yet, if such claimsare made convincingly, and enough people believe them, it would certainly causesome sort of transformation, or even great damage, to those religions. Mostlikely, though, devout adherents of these faiths will consider any deviations tobe lies. No matter what happens, there will be major fissures among religiousbeliefs in the post-Disclosure world. Regardless of the short-term effects, the long term changes affectingreligion and spirituality will be very great. If Lady Fortune smiles onhumanity, then our spirituality will develop into something more than thecartoon variety of children’s stories and moral imperatives that make up most ofthe major religions today. Future generations, raised with the open knowledge ofa nonhuman presence on Planet Earth, and throughout the universe, will not besatisfied with such simple stories. They will need something more relevant.Christianity, Islam, and Judaism will either have to adapt to this new reality,or they will be replaced. The old storybook versions of these religions couldeasily feel irrelevant to future generations. One hopes that a future spirituality will focus on how to live ethical lives,perhaps with a focus on prayer and meditation, just as some people believe andpractice today. Whether the new spirituality will be a continuation of new agebeliefs or develop into something different altogether, only time will tell. Inall likelihood, the non-physical and nonlocal realities of the UFO phenomenonwill reinforce the idea among some people that meditation, Christ consciousness,pineal gland activation and more can help them achieve higher “frequencies,” orbecome proper “light vessels” for their spiritual journey, or achieve DNAactivation or Ascension. These phrases basically mean nothing to scientists, butthey mean a lot to those who believe in them. This, too, will signify a growingsplit in belief and worldview between New Age spirituality and science. Or willit? Science and the Scientists The disclosure of a nonhuman presence behind the UFO phenomenon willdiscredit many scientists. After all, not only have they been skeptical aboutUFOs, most have been openly hostile to the idea. But science is different fromscientists, and Disclosure will usher in new breakthroughs in both thought andtechnology. Genetics, for starters. Assuming we gain access to alien physiology andgenetics, we will gain greater insights into ways of improving human health,increasing mental capacity, understanding what controls cellular and organregeneration, and extending the human lifespan. Ditto with other areas ofbiotechnology. Will we learn of effective vaccines or cures for any of the majordiseases in our world today? It is entirely possible. Indeed, Dr. Robert Woodhas recently argued, based on the leaked and controversial Majestic Documents,that a good portion of the science of biowarfare has derived from a secret studyof alien biology and viruses.[369] [index_split_006.html#filepos1354168]Whatever the truth on this matter, black world advances in biotechnology areprobably substantial, and there will probably be greater pressure applied onthat black world to share what it knows. I have already touched upon the future transportation revolution in the formof new energy and electrogravitics. But consider the possibilities of developinga true understanding of gravity. It might enable our scientists to develop aunified theory of everything, tying gravity together with electromagnetism, andthe strong and weak forces inside the atom. The implications of such adevelopment might be difficult to predict in the near-term, but more likely thannot would have dramatic long-term results. Perhaps the most profound effect may be in how we understand the human mind.Not simply pertaining to human cognition and memory, although these arefascinating and clearly related to the subject. After all, we will want to knowhow human memory is affected during the abduction process. But more challengingwould be questions of consciousness. Our science is already exploring whether ornot consciousness exists independently of the body, although this is decidedlyfringe at present. But the acknowledgement of an intelligent non-human presencewould throw this investigation into high gear. Current research into abductions and other forms of contact hint not onlythat space and time have somehow been mastered by these other beings, but thatthe mind is a critical element in their relationship to us. In this case, byconsciousness we mean something that is nonlocal, something like psi phenomena.A series of well-funded scientific studies of the telepathic elements ofcontact, for instance, could be valuable additions to our knowledge of the mindand of the fabric of our reality. It would also allow science possibly to catchup with what many psychics and intuitives already believe, and even provide auseful framework to help us understand why psi phenomena occurs. Belief in psi is not just a woo woo belief, but supported by research intoremote viewing, and goes back through all human religions via the power ofprayer and meditation. Ultimately, we want to know if consciousness is more thanjust our brain chemistry, and whether or not we have a spirit or soul. Some might argue that a study of UFO data does not necessarily warrant thatbelief. I think, however, there is a case to be made that it does. If so, thenhuman consciousness studies will become more widespread, and many newdiscoveries will await us. Such sciences, anything from remote viewing to out ofbody travel and space-time manipulation, are probably being explored now withinthe black budget world and breakaway civilization. Computing and Technology We have had a global internet for just over twenty years, during which timeit has completely changed our world. Whether or not there is a disclosure aboutUFOs, it will continue to do so. I discussed this earlier. Among computing experts, certain trends are agiven. First, the moment will come when artificial intelligence will match andthen surpass human intelligence. This event, dubbed the Singularity, ispredicted to occur anywhere between 2030 and 2080, although some predictions aresooner than 2030, and a few are later than 2080.[370][index_split_006.html#filepos1354474] Second, nanotechnology will develop to a point in which nanochips andnanobots will enter the human body to kill diseases, enhance health, improveintelligence, and even make us interactive with the web. Humans may well becomecybernetic to some degree, and the human mind may go wireless, so to speak. Third, advanced computing will support biotechnology and gene therapy,enabling people and other living creatures to be customized to a degree that wasnever before possible. Whereas we can expect important knowledge on this to comefrom disclosure by the black budget world, especially via access to its work inalien biology and physiology, there can be little doubt that advances incomputing will be more significant still. The positive side of this is that it might mean enhancing certain positivetraits for all people, including health, intelligence, and longevity. But it canalso mean customizing different types of people for different capabilities andtasks. It’s all possible, and there is certainly no reason to assume that futuregovernments or private groups will act according to our rules of fairness,justice, or decency. A fourth outcome from future computing is a real chance that quantumcomputing will become practical and widespread. If so, this will revolutionizecomputing in ways that are nearly impossible to imagine. All we can say for sureis that quantum computing would be orders of magnitude more powerful than ourmost advanced computing today. One possibility would be a single quantumcomputer, or a restricted number of them, controlling our world in the interestof a small few. A quantum computer, for instance, could easily control an armyof nano-drones that could be the ultimate surveillance and police force, aperfect totalitarian nightmare. But widespread quantum computing might also workin favor of greater freedom for people. There is yet another development in our digital age that is primed to changethe world: 3-D printing. Bringing the ability to recreate three-dimensionalproducts, layer by layer, into the homes of people from downloaded CAD designs,this technology will revolutionize manufacturing. So far, most applications of3-D printing are extruded polymers of either simple items like coffee cups,novelty items, or small objects of art that would be too complex for most humanartists. Soon, however, it will involve multiple types of materials, includingmetals for printed circuit boards and even biological material. Major hospitalsare already talking about future capabilities of 3-D printing a replacementheart. All of this is exciting, but the key outcome of future 3-D printing is thatit will allow brilliant minds from around the world to upload their designs ofall kinds of products to the web, making them available to download by everyoneelse. Consider the bottleneck caused by an inability of inventors from gettingtheir revolutionary creations to the market because of legal or corporateobstructions. Soon, it will be easy for anyone to download a CAD drawing ofengines that run on water, or some other incredible variation of energyharvesting devices, and test it out after printing it at home. No doubt many ofthe so-called free energy (or “over unity\") devices of the past were falsestarts, but the new market will enable a free flow of ideas that can beinstantly tested by the rest of the world. 3-D printing will help to bring atrue free market to the world, and that can be a factor in undermining thehierarchical system of control, a system which is reinforced by the narrowrestrictions of our global manufacturing infrastructure, based as it is onprofit and intellectual property rights. Whether these things are “good” or“bad” is irrelevant. In effect, The Pirate Bay will come to the world of manufacturing, and theresult will be an explosion of ideas and innovation. By 2020, this explosionwill be well underway, and there will be a serious struggle by the establishedpowers to contain it. But controlling 3-D printing, just like controlling otherelements of the web, will be like fighting the mythical Hydra. Cut off one head,and two others will appear. These five developments and many others make it is clear that we are primedto leap into the world of these other beings, with or without UFO Disclosure. Weare not simply advancing in the way that humanity has done in the past. We areseeing a transformation not merely of our civilization, but of our species.Imagining our world a century from now is probably beyond even the mostvisionary thinker of today. After all, none from a century ago captured morethan the barest smattering of our own world today. Regarding computers and Disclosure, the real question is, how will these twothings affect each other? Disclosure promises to accelerate our progress incomputing science and would almost certainly bring us closer to the Singularityand everything associated with it. Of course, it could very well be that thebreakneck speed of our developments in computing will bring us to Disclosure.After all, if computing intelligence does begin to surpass human intelligence,as AI experts predict, it is not hard to imagine a rapid Disclosure as aresult–which will in turn accelerate future computing. Either way, we are in fora dizzying future. Geopolitics Before we start nanochipping ourselves, or achieving IQs of 500, or becomingruled by a totalitarian quantum computer, let us reflect on political challengesthat will be posed by Disclosure, not merely within the United States butworldwide. Clearly, the United States will be strongly affected by Disclosure, and manyof the most dramatic developments will take place there. The reason is simplythat the cover-up has been more closely connected to the United States than anyof the other major nations, excepting perhaps Russia and China. The UnitedStates intelligence community straddles the globe, with close relationships tothe intelligence communities of most other nations. It is at the heart of theUFO cover-up. There will be pressure on the U.S. President to shine the light of truth intothe black budget/breakaway civilization connected with the cover up. It won't belong for people to realize that the President has also been out of the loop. We have no way of knowing how things will turn out. Conceivably, however,there will be a moment of decision by the President. Will Disclosure simply bethe pretext to create an openly totalitarian, fascist state? Today, we seecreeping fascism everywhere we look. It may happen that Disclosure leadsdirectly to a suffocating oppression in which dissent is equated with terrorism,and citizens are monitored 24/7 by every means necessary to ensure theircompliance.[images/00051.jpg]The White House will be a key player in the politics following Disclosure, butby no means the only important one. This trend is all-too-evident today and will continue unless it is foughtsquarely by the people of the world. That is, people marching in the streets,demanding positive change, and accepting nothing else. The power of an energizedand angry people is formidable, especially when they are reminded that freedomis never granted, but taken. Only action by great masses will prevent thecomplete loss of our freedoms and privacy, and so far there has not been enoughpublic action. But Disclosure will be a shock to the system, and it may be enough to awakenand energize people. It is certainly likely to spark a general confrontation. Itcan bring us fascism, or something approaching freedom."},{"pageContent":" There will be other practical matters of consideration. Internationalcooperation, for one thing. For instance, what if Disclosure results in somesort of open presence by these other beings? Might it not be possible, afterall? What if that presence is perceived as hostile to some degree? Whatever ourdesires may be regarding these other beings, we would be fools to discounthostilities entirely. And, for sure, we can count on those people who managenational security for their various countries to be thinking along the samelines. Obviously, if there is a military confrontation, things would not lookhopeful for humanity. If we have learned anything about the history of UFOconfrontations, it is that the militaries of the world are outclassed. Thetechnology controlled by these entities has been able to disable fighter jetsand nuclear installations. Their craft can easily outmaneuver our own. As far aswe can tell, they simply do what they want. Of course, they do appear to havecrashed every now and then, and they are probably greatly outnumbered by us.Even so, humanity would not want to fight against such technologies as possessedby these other beings. [images/00042.jpg]Disclosure is likely to spark protest movements greater than Occupy or the ArabSpring. Some people have expressed concern about a false flag operation in which analien invasion is faked by use of high-tech holographic displays, black budgettechnology, and a massive dose of global propaganda. The reason would be tofrighten people into volunteering away their rights to a global police statethat presumably would protect them from the alien menace. The operation has evensupposedly been given a name: Project Blue Beam. While such an outcome is notimpossible, it seems improbable, given the incredible logistical hurdles. A false flag operation is something in which one agency (usually a governmentor military group) secretly undertakes some act of terrorism, which it thenblames on another party, usually in order to justify a war or some otherrepressive measure. False Flag operations happen, as do actions by provocateurs(which is something similar but generally smaller scale). In our era, both ofthese happen a great deal and are nearly never openly acknowledged. After all,the global intelligence community operates with so little government oversight,so little analysis from major media outlets, and has so much money to work with,it effectively has near carte blanche in many, if not most, of its operations.The connection between intelligence agencies and narcotrafficking has beendemonstrated many times, with no effect in our broader public discourse. Dittothe myriad behind-the-scenes political coups orchestrated by CIA and othergroups, and the connections to financial corruption. The same applies toassassinations, from the 1960s-era hits against JFK, MLK, and RFK to thecountless mysterious deaths of political leaders, scientists, journalists, andwhistleblowers in our own time. Then, of course, we have the events of September 11, 2001, the hinge uponwhich our entire era turns. It is likely that certain details of that day willforever be covered in fog, but enough information has surfaced to show anyreasonable mind that, at the very least, the official version of events asstated by the U.S. government are laughably, tragically, and obviously wrong.Whether elements of the U.S. and global intelligence agency willfully allowed9/11 to occur, or actively made it happen, can be argued elsewhere. But that9/11 (followed immediately by the Anthrax Attack, in which the use of weaponizedanthrax from Fort Detrick, home of U.S. biological warfare, was initially blamedon foreign terrorists) was some kind of inside job is an argument that will onlycontinue to gain ground as the years pass. Rightfully so. It shows that elementsof the U.S. intelligence community have gone to great lengths to commitatrocities in order to promote a specific political agenda, and will likely doso again in the future. Nevertheless, there are real problems with a false flag operation like BlueBeam. As I mentioned earlier in this book, the originator of the idea, SergeMonast, was essentially a religious zealot with no evidence of any connection toinsiders at NASA or elsewhere, as he claimed. Moreover, he appears to havegotten his idea from an episode of the television show, Star Trek: The NextGeneration. His death in 1996, preceded by obvious poor physical health, madehim into an instant, if peripheral, martyr.[371] But it is the logistics of a Blue Beam operation that truly boggle the mind.The alien invasion scenario alone is a tall order. Presumably this would be donewith a fleet of black triangles, although getting them to blanket the worldseems a stretch. And even if they did, how to convince a world of scientists whoare not merely skeptical of UFOs, but completely hostile to the idea, that theseare actual alien spacecraft, seems doomed to failure. Current proponents of BlueBeam offer nothing in the way of actual research to show how such an operationcould possibly succeed, other than through vague references of terrifying theworld population. Besides, it is clearly unnecessary to use a false alieninvasion to implement a global police state. It is happening by degrees, via arange of disinformation and smaller false flags that are doing the job perfectlywell. The alien threat card will be played only if it must be played. That is, inthe event of a forced, genuine, disclosure of some sort. It is certainlypossible that there will be pressures to emphasize the Threat of the Other,simply in order to gain acquiescence among the people. Whether that will be thedominant motif or not is something that nobody knows at present. From myperspective, it is a policy that appears to be fraught with danger. One thing is definitely clear about Disclosure: there will be a need forglobal cooperation. After all, this is a matter that affects everybody, notsimply one nation. There are issues that will need to be handledinternationally. This is because Disclosure will accelerate our already tightglobal integration and raise the stakes considerably. Any new source of energythat will surpass petroleum can conceivably be used for destructive purposes,and there will be a genuine need for a measure of global regulation or controlover it. Clearly there will be legitimate concerns about this, but thealternative could be the obliteration of large regions of the Earth due toirresponsible use of new dangerous technologies. There will be a need for a global response, if not to the threat, then to thechallenge posed by these Others. The philosopher and genius Goethe once wrote,“Divide and conquer, a good motto. Unite and lead, a better one.” Globalizationis something that many people support, and many others oppose. But it is a fact,and has been developing inexorably for five hundred years, ever since Columbusset foot upon the New World. Since then, and indeed even prior, the separatecivilizations on Earth have become increasingly intertwined through trade,financial relationships, merging of cultures, communications, andtransportation. Within the last few generations we have moved into a world wherenearly anyone can have a video conversation with nearly anyone else, any placein the world. It is a world in which news and information travel at the speed oflight globally. International transactions of trillions of dollars every daytraverse the globe, and it has become plainly obvious that the age of the nationstate will soon be a thing of the past. Regarding globalization, then, the question is not whether people shouldoppose or allow it. Rather, what form will it take? The question is entwinedwith the question of a post-Disclosure society: will globalization look likefreedom or fascism? It can go either way. The moment of Disclosure will present the political leaders of our world withan opportunity. That opportunity will be to take the path of light, notdarkness. A path promoting freedom and truth, not one of oppression and lies.This is not to say that such a wonderful outcome will happen. We must not lapseinto naïve utopianism. But Disclosure, and the months and years following it,will present humanity with a challenge not merely of how to deal with theseother beings, whatever they are, and whatever their agenda happens to be. Itwill present us with a challenge of how to live with each other, how to graduateto the next phase of our existence. Will we do so in a spirit of globalcooperation and freedom, moving truly into our adulthood as a species? Or willthe dark road be taken, one of manipulation and oppression on a scale evengreater than that of today? These are choices, real choices that will presentthemselves to all thinking people after Disclosure. The Future In the course of my investigations, I encountered what I feel is a credibleaccount concerning a senior U.S. Air Force officer who had held a high-levelcommand position at NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain facility some time ago. It sohappened that I was friends with a relation of this man. Through various hintsand indirect references to family and relations, this senior officer seemed toknow a great deal about UFOs. On one occasion, I was told, he let his guarddown. He was in a small fishing boat with the older brother of my friend, whenthe young man raised the topic of UFOs. The officer looked very seriously athim. His only words in reply were: “they are eons and eons beyond us.” This conversation happened some decades ago, and humanity’s rapidtechnological development might now reduce eons to mere centuries. Still, thestory resonates with me, simply because I know the source, as well as a fewthings about the career of this officer. Consider what eons and eons might mean.After Disclosure, these other beings are still likely to be so far ahead of usthat open contact between us and them, open communication of any sort, mightwell remain inconceivable. The irony of Disclosure could well be that we will continue to have manyunanswered questions about exactly who and what we are dealing with. We willhave gotten to a point where we can prove to ourselves openly as a society thatthey are here, yes. But that is different from being able to grab hold of a liveone for open study. Fighting the black budget world would probably offer themost hope on this matter, but it may well take an extended struggle to make thathappen, perhaps many years. It is also quite possible that whatever bodies arebeing held make up only a small piece of the grand puzzle of what constitutesthese Others. Very likely, the real action after Disclosure will be dealing withissues internal to our own society. It may well be that at least some of these beings have established aresidence on our world. There is certainly reason to believe, gained fromcountless insider leaks and claims, that there is communication of some sortbetween them and the black budget community. There are also claims, and goodreason to consider, that some of them have insinuated themselves into oursociety, perhaps even our power structure. Why would that be so illogical? Onthe contrary, it would seem to be entirely logical. They would know thathumanity is on the fast track, and that when we get to the point where we mightprove to be a genuine annoyance, all the more reason for them to have their ownpeople on the inside. In the post-Disclosure world, this question will be raisedmore than once. There will be no easy way around it. Disclosure of the UFO reality will force our civilization to resolve manylongstanding challenges and problems. Looking at only a few of these, it is easyto see why secrecy on this matter has been paramount for so long. Uncovering itwill be the most revolutionary act in human history. The Long View Looking further ahead into the future, we can discern some contours of thatdistant shore. It will be a world with an open recognition of the presence ofother, alien intelligences here on Earth, interacting with this planet andhumanity. That will be out in the open. Whether they will be out in the open isanother matter altogether. But its open acknowledgement will be a great spur toour intellectual development. The dominant technologies a century from now willbe difficult, perhaps impossible, for us to recognize today. Computing power andartificial intelligence will be orders of magnitude greater. Human beings themselves are likely to be different in many ways. Placing avalue judgement on this is probably pointless. For better or worse, we are onthe cusp of a great change. We will see changes not merely to our technologicalinfrastructure, but probably to our own species via gene therapy and other formsof biotech. The basic intelligence of at least a portion of humanity (the verywell-to-do) is likely to increase greatly. Envisioning the future in such aworld is difficult. In all likelihood, we will still have families, loverelationships, and a physical need for food, sleep, and sex. On that basis, wemay assume that humans a century from now will share basic traits with us. Yet,how much do we have in common today with a medieval peasant or a paleolithichunter-gatherer? Certain things, yes, but we also inhabit a vastly differentmental universe. It seems likely that our great-great grandchildren, at leastsome of them, will be that far ahead of us. Any Disclosure of an ET/UFO reality will accelerate humanity’s development inthat direction. Ultimately, nothing will stop that development, Disclosure orno. It seems likely, too, that the further and further we move into this bizarrefuture, the less dramatic and revolutionary UFO Disclosure is likely to be. Ifit were to happen in, say, 2015, it would bring dramatic upheavals of the kind Ihave been describing. If it were to happen in 2025, the changes would still bedramatic, but probably less so. By 2050 or 2060, Disclosure will probably beminimally dramatic and disruptive. This is because human society is alreadygoing through tremendous, rapid change. Can it be that there will be no official, government-sanctioned Disclosure?Personally, I think the truth will surface, come what may. Our own path as asociety will open that door, regardless of what the political powers have to sayabout it. That acknowledgement, whenever it comes, whether now or fifty yearsfrom now, will still come as a shock. There is a statement from an American Zen practitioner named Adyashanti.“Enlightenment is a destructive process,” he wrote. “It’s not about becomingbetter or happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of truth. It’s seeingthrough the façade of pretense. It’s the eradication of everything we imaginedto be true.”[372] I like this statement and believe it is relevant here. To assume that thetruth will make us happy is something that children might believe, but we knowbetter. It is said that the truth will set us free, and the stripping away ofillusions can do that. Freedom, however, is difficult. It is not for the timidor weak. Whether any of us desire the kinds of change we are seeing in ourworld, it is happening nonetheless. Our world will continue to become verydifferent from the world of our grandparents. Indeed, it is already radicallydifferent from that of our own childhood. We had better get used to constantchange. Humanity’s Destiny For thousands of years, people have muddled their way through long periods ofsuffering and small-minded thinking. Occasionally, we made great, suddenstrides, followed by long periods of suffering and more small-minded thinking.Yet, there was always something special about us, something undoubtedly thatother observant beings noticed. Looking at all the other life forms on PlanetEarth, how could they not? Here was a species that, primitive though we were,had potential. The question they have probably been asking ever since is: whatkind of potential? Potential in a wonderful, fulfilling sense? Or in athreatening, dangerous sense? Throughout our time on this world, most people have focused their lives onbasic survival needs—understandable given the conditions they were born into.Nevertheless, in all times and places, there have always been a few people whoshone light into the darkness, who offered a glimpse of our true potential, andhope for what we may become. It is worth asking whether or not, in the next century and beyond, the humanrace will make strides toward achieving such a vision. For no matter who andwhat the other beings are who inhabit other parts of this galaxy, universe, andmultiverse, it remains true that whenever we do encounter them, it will be withthe consciousness we bring to the event. We must ask ourselves, what will thatbe? Ultimately, all of us must live within ourselves, within our mind andthoughts. We are born alone, and alone do we shed our mortal coils. The journeywe must make on this ride we call life must be made by each of us, in our ownway. All of which is to say that if we are ever to achieve a relationship of anysort with beings from elsewhere, we will certainly need to raise our mentalactivity to a degree much higher than we have today. The beings that appear tobe here on Earth, interacting with us as they do, have the ability to reachinside our minds in some way. They are telepathic, they are extremelyintelligent, they know things far beyond the limits of our small-minded reality.In other words, most of us are not ready for them. Looking at our society today, at our shallow and toxic mass culture, thegross inadequacy of our formal education institutions, the childish discourse ofour politics and culture, I see no major trends that are moving us toward a truehigher consciousness on a mass scale. But Disclosure could be the shock thatawakens us. After Disclosure, we will see great numbers of people take stock oftheir lives. They will ask themselves why they have wasted so much of theirlives on pointless, petty pursuits. They will set about to make real changes. Inother words, Disclosure offers an opportunity for humanity to take charge of itsdestiny. That remains the hope. Whereas the final reality may be different, we shouldalways allow ourselves something good to strive for. Emerson understood that “weaim above the mark to hit the mark.” The advent of UFO secrecy has twisted anddistorted human civilization far away from its natural course. The ending ofthat secrecy will not guarantee us a perfect result. We may not fix all of ourmany inequities and problems. But we may at least take the chance to hit nearerthe mark. Conclusion When assessing the full range of the UFO subject, one is struck by arichness, depth, and profundity that is nothing short of astonishing. Whether weexamine it as detectives, philosophers, historians, political analysts,psychologists, intelligence experts, aviation geeks, biologists. astronomers,physicists, cynics, or utopians, we find that the subject simply gets deeper anddeeper the further along we go. Two decades ago, I thought I would be able tosatisfy my curiosity and “figure things out” after two or three months ofchecking into it. The next thing I knew, I was pulled in to the most fascinatingsubject I have ever encountered in my life. Fascinating, but also frustrating. The field can attract unseemly characters.Some of these are troubled souls, whether from a genuinely anomalous experienceor simply the random hauntings of their mind. Others are attention-seekers.Still others are self-appointed referees whose mission appears to be to stand atthe sidelines and criticize every researcher who doesn’t subscribe to a certainpet theory or fit an idealized vision of what a researcher should be. Yet othersare narcissists claiming some amazing gift (meeting with Andromedans, channelingPleiadians, traveling through time, being a genius, being a super soldier, beingan astral ambassador, being chosen by black budget insiders to reveal the truth,ad infinitum) who are essentially trying to establish themselves at the head oftheir own church. It takes a strong stomach to deal with them. More to the point, however, is the bare fact that so many of our questionscannot be answered easily, or at all. It is due to the inherent difficulty ofthe topic combined with the obfuscation surrounding it. In other words, thesubject of UFOs by itself is hard, and the secrecy doesn’t help any. However, the rewards are plentiful, at least if you put in the effort and askthe right questions. There are a number of subjects in this world that are likecrowbars—they help us to pry open the barriers of deception and illusion thatencase our minds and our lives. Ufology is an excellent one. By delving into itsmyriad aspects, we open ourselves up to a new understanding of nearly everyaspect of our world. It causes us to ask the obvious existential question: arewe alone in the universe? It’s an important question, but barely scratches thesurface of what lies below. As I have tried to show in this book, a proper studyof ufology opens up vistas of thought in our politics, science, culture,technology, and more. It forces us to reconsider many of the truisms thatunderlie our worldview. That is exciting and unsettling. Small wonder that ithas always been such a pariah of a topic, despite its deadly seriousness. Of course, you might reasonably ask, what is the reward in having yourworldview shattered? Why endanger your job and community standing? The answerdepends on what kind of person you are. Some people are happy with the truthsthey grew up with. They don’t want to be heroes or solve the problems of theirworld. They want a simple life with a home, job, and family. Others are driven to dig deeper. They are not satisfied with simplisticanswers to important questions, and they believe they have a right to know more.For such people with a deep-seated need for truth, nothing else can satisfythem. Even if they haven’t yet realized it, they feel it in their bones. Theyknow by instinct, if not always through books, the great dictum of Socrates:“the unexamined life is not worth living.” Over the years, such people learn that truth is never simple, and neverreveals herself without a struggle. They also discover that learning importanttruths separates them from most of their friends and family. Eventually, theyunderstand this is the price of leadership, and if they are lucky, they growinto their new persona and role. They become leaders who inspire others to findtheir own paths. That is what a study of ufology can do for you. It may not answer everyquestion you have, and there will always be unexplored mysteries about it. Butthat is part of its beauty. The late UFO skeptic, Philip J. Klass, used to talkof the “UFO curse.” The curse was that every UFO believer would go to theirgrave just as mystified about UFOs as they are today. Typical of Klass, thestatement betrays a complete misunderstanding of the importance of UFOs. Asidefrom being factually wrong (researchers have learned a great deal about UFOs inthe past many decades), his implication is that studying the greatest mystery ofour time offers nothing of value. Such an attitude is shortsighted and foolish. As we move forward into the 21st century, we may well find that answerscontinue to elude us, even after a possible Disclosure event. Most likely, therewill be things about the nature of reality that will forever be beyond us. Thisis no reason for despair. We are fortunate indeed who have the opportunity toembark into the seas of the Great Unknown. If given the chance, why shouldn’t wemake that journey? About the Author Richard Dolan has researched UFOs and related phenomena since the early1990s. He is the author of the historical series, UFOs and the National SecurityState (volumes one and two), as well as an analysis of the future, A.D. AfterDisclosure: When the Government Finally Reveals the Truth About Alien Contact. He has appeared widely on radio and television, including Coast-to-Coast AM,CNN, The History Channel, SyFy, BBC, and elsewhere. Since 2012, Richard hashosted “The Richard Dolan Show,” airing on KGRA Radio. In his writings and interviews, Richard has analyzed the destruction of ourpolitical liberties as a result of the UFO cover-up, the possible nature of thenon-humans themselves, what their presence means for our civilization, why hebelieves the cover-up will end within our lifetime, and what is likely to happenafter that. With the completion of UFOs for the 21st Century Mind, Richard plans tocomplete the third volume of UFOs and the National Security State, which willtake the history of the UFO reality and cover-up to the present day. In earlier years, Richard had been a Rhodes Scholar finalist, earned aBachelor’s and Master’s degree in History, and received a Certificate inPolitical Theory at Oxford University.

[index_split_000.html#filepos74319] It is worth mentioning that MUFON’sinvestigations have typically been restricted by lack of resources (such asmoney), which are needed to do the job well. At a minimum, gas money alone forinvestigators can become an issue, at least over time, considering thatdistances to a sighting location may be more than one hundred miles from wherethe investigator lives. In the context of current gas prices and typicalautomotive gas mileage, that can easily exceed $30, not considering any otherfactors. But of course, there are usually other factors which compound theproblem. There is usually a need for equipment of some sort or another, whetherthese be relatively inexpensive camcorders to conduct interviews, instruments toread electromagnetic signatures or radiation, cameras for night vision orinfrared, and more. And let us not forget time. While most investigators do notget paid for their work, their time is not free. People always have other thingsthey can do with their lives, and the fact that they do not get paid to conductinvestigations inevitably means that there are fewer investigations than therecould be otherwise. Investigating a UFO report is seldom easy, and usually takestime. And time is money. 3.
