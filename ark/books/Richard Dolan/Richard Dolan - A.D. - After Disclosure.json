Howelse to explain the astounding level of insight and staggering detail this bookoffers on what is supposedly a hypothetical situation? If you ask me, A.D. AfterDisclosure is all part of the government’s campaign to prepare us for theinevitable. But even if I’m wrong, these guys have done a masterful jobimagining the unimaginable.”—Brent V. Friedman, writer/producer; co-creator of Dark Skies“Micro-organisms on the moon, biological bacteria on meteorites, structures onMars, and the recovery of mortal beings at Roswell have all paved the acceptancethat we are not alone in the universe. And not since the Brooking InstituteStudy of the ramifications of contact with a higher intelligence off the earthhas anyone demonstrated with such comprehensiveness just what type of a worldsociety would wake up to on such a fateful day. Not until Dolan and Zabel. Thecontemporary research they have accumulated in this book should serve as aprimer for present and future generations. Not only to soften the blow, but alsoto provide us with hope. Hope, that even though much that we have faithfullyaccepted as reality, forever changed, will still usher in a time when we canpeer at our neighbors up in the stars, and not just over the next-door fence.”—Donald R. Schmitt, coauthor of Witness to Roswell“As a physician, researcher, and creative writer, I stand on the shoulders ofothers to see and climb the next mountain. A.D. After Disclosure is a brilliant,enjoyable primer that holds a feast of ideas that will make any audience thinkand wonder. This work offers a place to stand where others may take up thechallenge and travel to places none of us could conceive. Richard and Bryce haveperformed a great service both to our culture and that of the ‘Others.’”—Dr. Jeffrey Galpin, infectious disease specialist, molecular biologist, AIDSResearcher“The governed can hardly give their consent when the truth is withheld fromthem. If insiders who claim to represent us have hard proof that we are notalone and they don’t share it with the people, then the blowback predicted byZabel and Dolan in A.D. After Disclosure will be a mighty wind, indeed.”—Lars Larson, host of nationally syndicated The Lars Larson Show“This is an important book dealing with vital issues which are rarelyconsidered. In my opinion, Disclosure is inevitable. Preparation for that momentshould be an integral part of every thinking person’s worldview. The authorsshould be commended. They have done us a service.”—Coleman Luck, writer/executive producer; author of Angel Fall“If Disclosure happens in my life, this is how I imagine it would occur. RichardDolan and Bryce Zabel have left no stone unturned in capturing, in intricatedetail, every aspect and every nuance of the events, the complexities andramifications that would inevitably unfold with Disclosure.

Among them all, two friends stand out.One of them is Vince White. Through the years, Vince has described his vision ofa post-disclosure world, of its inevitability, of the dramatic changes it willbring in its wake. I don’t know of anyone who has thought this through with asmuch detail, or as much courage.The other is Stephen Bassett. Anyone who has met Stephen knows the energy andfocus he brings to the issue of Disclosure. Along the way he has made manyadmirers, and a few critics, too, who feel that “disclosure” and “exopolitics”are wrong-headed and premature in a world that will not even acknowledge thereality of UFOs themselves. Most of these criticisms are misguided, in my view.Future generations will remember Stephen as one of the key figures who helped tobring the world to an open acceptance of the truth: that “Others” are here onEarth, observing and interacting with humanity.Other people have helped with their conversation and insights. Among them I wishto acknowledge Thomas Darling, PhD, Edgar Mitchell, ScD, Jim Marrs (whograciously wrote the Foreword to this book), and two of my U.K. friends: NickPope and Anthony Beckett. To these and the many others—most of whom know whothey are—I offer my lasting thanks.Finally, I would like to thank the support and patience of my family: Karyn,Michael, and Elaine. Through the thick and through the thin, they have beenthere to support me.From BryceMy journey of consciousness-raising began with my mother, Lucile Zabel, who gota copy of The Interrupted Journey when I was a kid and couldn’t put it down.Finding friends who will discuss UFOs without prejudice or ridicule is notalways easy and, in particular, I note the many hours I’ve spent with my “twoDons,” Don Most and Don Clark. My other open-minded friends through the yearshave included David Chatfield, Roger Clark, Eric Close, Manny Coto, Matt Gross,Stephen Harding, Rob Kirk, John Landgraf, Stan Lee, Coleman Luck, BradMarkowitz, Bob Nowotny, Jim Parriott, Dave Ransil, Jeff Sagansky, Fred Saxon,Larry Sheflo, Adam Sigel, Peter Telep, Tracy Torme, Jeff Wachtel, Megan Ward,Rich Whitley, and Alan Zabel. Along with my gifted coauthor Richard Dolan, theresearchers who have taught me the most are Steven Bassett, Stanton Friedman,George Knapp, Kathleen Marden, Nick Pope, Alejandro Rojas, Donald Schmitt, LeeSpiegel, and Whitley Strieber. And the people who helped make this specific bookpossible include Cherish Alexander, Todd Masters, Alex Asher Sears, Nancy Tokos,and John White.My Dark Skies co-creator Brent V. Friedman will be one of my very first callswhen Disclosure happens. Also, David E. Kelly, who hired me to work on L.A. Law,because he thought a script I wrote about alien abductions felt real to him.Thanks also go to my father, Harvey Zabel, who taught high school Americanhistory and, shortly before he died, finally talked about his Army buddy’sexperience at Roswell, knowing that it would mean all the textbooks from whichhe had taught would be re-written. And to my children—Jared, Lauren, andJonathan—whose own children will read those new books in school.Finally, to my wife, Jackie, who abducted my heart and always believes in me."},{"pageContent":"Contents> Foreword [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_005.html#filepos13734] by Jim Marrs> Preface [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_006.html#filepos18898] by Stephen Bassett> Introduction [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_007.html#filepos23198]> Chapter 1: Day One: The Day Everything Changes> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_008.html#filepos36965]> Chapter 2: Breakaway: How Secrets Created a World Within a World> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_009.html#filepos93371]> Chapter 3: Endgame: When the Impossible Becomes the Inevitable> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_010.html#filepos175058]> Chapter 4: Threat Analysis: Who Goes There and What Do They Want?> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_011.html#filepos255385]> Chapter 5: Blowback: Collateral Damage and Unintended Consequences> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_012.html#filepos347292]> Chapter 6: The (New) Age of Aquarius: Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_013.html#filepos439178]> Chapter 7: Paradigm Shift: Our New Place in the Universe> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_014.html#filepos502883]> Chapter 8: Exopolitics Rising: Moving From First Contact to Informed Contact> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_015.html#filepos587746]> Chapter 9: Open Letters: Inside/Outside> [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_016.html#filepos667492]> Notes [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos692445]> Index [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_018.html#filepos740016]> About the Author [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_019.html#filepos779891]"},{"pageContent":"Foreword by Jim MarrsHow do you—meaning you reading these words—deal with the idea of UnidentifiedFlying Objects?Do you simply ignore the issue, like the majority of your fellow citizens? Doyou disdain any serious discussion of the topic because it may cause discomfortto your cherished beliefs and worldview? Or, like a small minority, do youconsider with an open mind the possibility that life may exist outside of ourconventional three-dimensional material reality? Or perhaps you wait impatientlyfor a meeting with “our space brothers,” as does an even smaller minority?Regardless of your viewpoint, we—all humans on Earth—are in for a realawakening…and probably sooner rather than later.For some, this awakening to the reality of visitation by “Others,” thedesignation used by the authors of this book, will be a confirmation oflong-held beliefs. For many more it will be a shattering of their worldview,leaving them in psychological shock and confusion…and most probably more than alittle angry with the “experts” who have lied and dissembled for so long.After all, haven’t our authority figures—military officers, prominentscientists, mass media pundits—for many years told us that UFOs simply do notexist? Haven’t the people who said such things are real been denigrated aspublicity seekers and nuts wearing aluminum hats? Haven’t all UFO sightings beenexplained as mere illusions, secret government test craft, or misinterpretednatural phenomena? And haven’t we all been schooled and conditioned to respectand trust our authorities?In the case of UFOs, such trust and respect has been misplaced.Since the 1940s or earlier, the Freedom of Information Act lawsuits haveproduced a mountain of documentary evidence that instituted a program of denialand ridicule within the highest levels of our military and government regardingUFOs. The message was, “You didn’t see anything and if you persist in saying youdid, then you probably need mental health care.”And it worked admirably.Until most recently, the prospect of derision and ridicule coupled with apatriotic impulse to assist the government in hiding secrets resulted inthousands of citizens keeping mum about their personal experiences with UFOs.This resulted in a distorted view of our world and events and created adysfunctional and hypocritical society.After all, no matter how smart you are, if you are operating from incomplete orerroneous information, you will never have a correct understanding of any issue.Those who dismiss the idea of non-human intelligent life and UFOs will neverbegin to truly comprehend the full picture of our world, as they have discardeda large piece of the puzzle.But such denial and secrecy has begun to crack in recent years with the adventof the personal camcorder and the camera-bearing cell phone. Prior to thistechnology, only occasionally did a person obtain a photograph of a UFO, andeven then it was just a blurry spot of light in the dark sky, hardly satisfyingproof to anyone.But today, not a day goes by that someone, somewhere in the world does not get areasonably clear picture of something unusual in the air. Naturally, this doesnot impinge on those whose worldview is either locked into denial or supportingsome hidden agenda.Although a good many photos are creations of Photoshop, a hubcap soaring overthe backyard, or a shot of Venus on a clear night, enough are unexplainable toconvince any thoughtful person that something is happening in the skies above.The reality of UFO visitation becomes even more obvious when these photos andgovernment documents are placed into context with physical evidence such asradar contacts, the innumerable personal accounts of sightings, and physicalabduction.So, to the open-minded, the controversy is settled—UFOs exist. Although itremains unclear whether they represent travelers from another solar or starsystem, another dimension, or another time line, they most certainly representyet another part of our reality. And the sooner the human race comes to dealwith this fact, the better.The question now becomes, “Who occupies UFOs and why are they here?” And evenmore importantly, “What are we going to do about this new reality?”It is this question that is addressed in this book and one that deserves seriousconsideration because, sooner or later, we will all have to answer this forourselves.Jim MarrsFt. Worth, Texas"},{"pageContent":"Preface by Stephen BassettDisclosure, the formal acknowledgment by the world’s governments of anextraterrestrial presence engaging the human race, is inevitable. So was thisbook.To my knowledge it is the first work to specifically and comprehensively addressthe concept of “big D” Disclosure from an exopolitical perspective, which is tosay it attempts to bring the concept into focus for the mass of people who mayhave no inkling of what is headed their way.If The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a how-to book about what to do whenthe world ends, this is a how-to book on what to do when a new world begins.To this purpose Richard Dolan and Bryce Zabel are well suited. Richard is agrounded historian whose developing trilogy, UFOs and the National SecurityState, is building a chronological backbone to the history of the UFO/ET issuefrom 1947 onward. Bryce has written and produced for television, and thusunderstands how to communicate to the larger audience beyond the realms ofresearch and academia.Given that most parents generally have nine months to prepare for the birth of anew human being, it is somewhat unnerving that human beings will be lucky ifthey have 90 seconds to prepare for the birth of a new reality. This is becausethe United States government has no intention of providing a user manual orearly warning concerning Disclosure—the most profound event in human history.One evening you are eating Chinese take-out in front of the television. Fiveminutes later you are in a new paradigm, the world has changed in a billion waysand you haven’t even finished the kung pao chicken.The truth embargo (what some call the UFO cover-up) is in its seventh decade.According to Richard and Bryce, it will end soon. Pay close attention; you needto know that. All of the old paradigm assertions: “You don’t have a need toknow,” “You can’t handle the truth,” and “don’t ask, don’t tell,” will gettossed out the window. A little preparation will help ensure you don’t jump outthe window with them.Many thousands of books will be written on the subject of Disclosure before thesun cools, expands, and swallows up the solar system. You’ll want to read themall, but A.D. After Disclosure is a very good beginning.But permit me to suggest that there is one group of people who desperately needto read this book ASAP. They are the elected members of Congress, the commandingofficers in the military, the managers of the intelligence agencies, and mostassuredly the President of the United States.You see, there is an implicit irony in this book that may escape your notice.One of the key assumptions of A.D. After Disclosure is that governments will beforced to reveal the truth regarding an extraterrestrial presence by a dramaticevent that forces their hand. This is strategically unwise. The sight of membersof Congress being chased down the halls of their office buildings by packs ofscreaming reporters with cameras and pens clicking away will not inspireconfidence in that August body, which recently hit an all time low.Should they bother to read this book, it is quite possible they might see thewisdom of actually doing their job and effectuating a proactive, orderlyDisclosure event that gets the job done without unnecessary, self-destructivemelodrama.If this happens the government would feel good about itself, the people would bemore assured, and even the extraterrestrials might take comfort in the raredisplay of maturity on the part of human institutions.So do yourself and your nation a favor and send a copy to your electedrepresentatives. I’m sure they’ll thank you for it in a nicely worded formletter.Stephen BassettWashington, D.C."},{"pageContent":"IntroductionThousands of books, all debating whether UFOs are real or just figments of ourimaginations, have been published.This book is not one of them.More than six decades into this quiet revolution, we can now see the outlines ofa reality that has been sneaking up on us, one step at a time.The issue that was hushed up by one generation, then turned into an object ofderision by another, now demands to be heard straight in ours.Since the first major wave of UFO sightings in 1947, the number of people whobelieve that UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin has steadily risen. Today, amajority of Americans, as well as other global citizens, believe this is so, andat least five percent claim to have seen a UFO.The evidence that something strange has been happening is voluminous andconvincing. All you have to do is look for it. Through the years, determinedresearchers have forced the release of classified reports prepared by the U.S.government and other nations. These accounts tell a story of contact through theeyes of thousands of professional witnesses, such as law enforcement, militarypilots, and even astronauts. Most people now reject the theory that allsightings can be explained away as weather balloons, swamp gas flares, balllighting, or mass hallucination. Instead, they have settled on one conclusion:Some UFOs appear to be intelligently controlled physical craft of some kind fromsome place that is not here.Accepting that as our starting point makes our book different.A.D. After Disclosure is the first project to focus on what might happen afteran announcement that UFOs are real.Even if you are skeptical about UFOs, or (if you believe in them) doubt that thesecrecy will end any time soon, this book should still engage you. Consider it afascinating “What if?”What if UFO secrecy were to end? How would that change our world?No secret can last forever. Our society is changing so fast, so completely, thatwe will be unrecognizable a mere century from now. In such a world, withintelligent computers, advanced quantum computing, and nearly unforeseeabledevelopments in global communication, can we really believe that a secret suchas the presence of an alien intelligence on Earth can continue to remain hiddenand undisclosed? At what point between now and then do we cross the threshold ofknowing the truth about UFOs, and having an open acknowledgment of them in ourworld? It might be as soon as next week, or as long as several more generations,but it won’t be forever. It will happen. The wall of official denial that hasbeen in place for more than half a century is now crumbling.And yet, an acknowledgment that “UFOs are real and some of them are not us” willnot end the debate. It will only lead to more questions, and mark a new phase ofthe mystery.Will Disclosure lead to social panic? Undermine religion? Destroy the stockmarket? Or will it lead to revolutionary new technologies, extended life spans,and world peace?If alien civilizations have sent their own explorers across the universe tovisit us, who are they? What do they want? And why would some of our people keepthe news of their arrival from the rest of us? What will unmasking a truth ofthis magnitude do to our reality, our way of life, our culture, our society?Could it be that these beings are not “visitors” from another part of ouruniverse, but full-time residents of our world already? Are even strangerphysics involved, such as dimensions or time travel? Any such revelation will bea game-changer of monumental proportions. Unlike 9/11 when we said everythingchanged, in this case it really will. Full Disclosure could usher in an age ofhuman unity or one of greater global conflict. It could lead to paradise orhell.Those are the questions that have kept us up at nights; because we wantedanswers, we have written this book. Both of us feel that our previous researchhas led us inexorably to this project. We may now be believers in UFO reality,but we did not start out that way. We followed the facts where they led.Richard Dolan has a graduate degree in history from the University of Rochester,where he studied U.S. Cold War strategy, Soviet history, and internationaldiplomacy. He was writing a book about U.S. national security policy during theearly Cold War when he became fixated on the issue of UFOs. His research evolvedinto UFOs and the National Security State, a multi-volume historical study ofthe attitudes and policies toward UFOs by the military and intelligencecommunity, and the fascinating development of citizen movements to end UFOsecrecy.Bryce Zabel grew up near McMinnville, Oregon, just a few miles from the spotwhere two of the most famous UFO photographs in history were taken. Even so, asa TV network correspondent and investigative reporter, he started as a skeptic.Yet, he found his mind opening when his research for several high-profile filmand TV projects suggested to him that UFOs were not science fiction, but sciencefact. He created the NBC TV series, Dark Skies, wrote the SyFy Channel’s firstoriginal film Official Denial, and worked with Steven Spielberg on Taken.Throughout both our careers, we have each sifted through the evidence, listenedto the believers and deniers and, frankly, done the homework that investigativejournalists and university scholars should have done, but which few have tried.And while the work has been rewarding, it has never been easy, and has oftenbeen troubling.A detached review of the proven evidence, much of which is freely available inonce-classified documents released through the Freedom of Information Act, tellsus that militaries from around the world have been plagued by UFOs. There is noother way to characterize these events. Time after time, sensitive andrestricted air space has been the scene of violations by objects tracked onradar and seen visually by base personnel. Attempts to intercept have often beenmade, typically ending in failure. The documents describe these unknown objectsas performing maneuvers that would have destroyed our best fighter aircraft.UFOs could hover indefinitely, and then accelerate instantaneously. Witnessesoften described them as roundish or disk-shaped, giving rise to the term flyingsaucer.To read one or two such reports, we might well be inclined to dismiss them asmistakes: unknown natural phenomena, equipment malfunctions, or some other errorin perception. But hundreds of such reports have come down to us. Their tone isserious. Higher level military and intelligence personnel discussed them andwere left perplexed and sometimes distressed.The general scenario is clear. Advanced technology has been traversing theEarth. Regardless of who it belongs to, it is technology that is not supposed toexist—and yet it does. Moreover, those individuals in strategic positions ofpower were able to create and maintain a system of secrecy designed to keep therest of the world in the dark.Was it right to keep this secret from the people since the 1940s? To laugh atpeople who saw what they saw, to make them feel small and ridiculous forspeaking out? To transform the most important information of our time intofodder for stand-up comedy?No, it was not. Perhaps, after the truth is known, there will be efforts tobring some of these secret-keepers to justice. More likely, however, many peoplewill shrug their shoulders and reflect that they might have done the same thinghad they been confronted with the problem of UFOs. They will also find, as wehave in the course of our research, that the problem of UFOs has seldom beenclear, and never simple.And yet, whatever the reasons for keeping us in the dark, we deserve to hear thefull story now. We deserve to make our own plans. The truth may be wonderful, orit may be disturbing, but whatever it is, people have the capacity, and moreimportantly the right, to learn it and act upon it.In any case, we as a society will learn it. The structure of secrecy, when itfalls apart in the months or years ahead, could disappear with astonishingspeed. One day it will be there and the next it will not.Those who have held this secret for so long need to understand that the river oftime cannot stop, and that truth cannot indefinitely be denied. The day iscoming when they will be forced to come clean, and it is best for them, as wellas for humanity, that they do this sooner rather than later. We will need allthe wisdom, foresight, and time possible to make a smooth transition to the newreality, After Disclosure, or A.D.To the group of beings we have come to call the “Others”—whoever and whateverthey are—we want to remind them that, whatever their attitude about the humanrace, our scientific trajectory may soon enable us to leap into their world. Itmay well be that, at some point in the future, they will be forced to answer tous for past transgressions, or we may be thanking them for past servicesrendered. Either way, the human race is poised to advance to the next level ofcivilization.If there is a final thought to the journey of A.D. After Disclosure, it is acouple words of advice: no fear. That means: Do not be afraid to express yourviews regarding the reality of other intelligences interacting with humanity,for the truth is that more people believe this than you realize. Do not fear thesecret-keepers, for they are people, too, who have generally done what they haveout of the belief that it was best. Also, do not fear their power, as they arenot infallible, and time is against them. You have your own resources to marshalthe truth. Do not fear the Others, either, no matter what that truth may be.Whether they are angels, demons, good, bad, or indifferent to our fate, do notfear them. You lived well enough up until now, and you will survive well enoughafter the Great Change. Above all, believe in humankind, in our ability to faceunexpected challenges, in the strength and wisdom that reside within us, waitingfor the moment to manifest.Although the nature of this book is speculative we have worked hard to keep suchspeculations informed and supported by solid research. You will notice, however,that some of the sources we refer to are listed as “confidential,” rather thanby name. Although we wish this were not so, there are many people who have beentouched by this cover-up who do not feel comfortable speaking openly, eitherbecause of past oaths of secrecy, fear of personal jeopardy, or ridicule. Wewant our readers to know that, through our professional training in the fieldsof history and investigative journalism, we have applied standards ofcredibility to such comments. Only those individuals who cross a threshold ofreliability have been included. Hopefully, the day is not so far away when allpeople can speak openly on this subject.Because we are seeking, in a sense, to paint a picture of how we believe thefuture will look, we have added a series of vignettes, and have placed thembetween the chapters of this book. These fictional depictions are meant toconvey some of the ideas we are expressing, and we hope that they help thereader form a concrete idea as to how Disclosure might affect our world. Betterstill would be to help the reader form his or her own ideas more clearly.A final observation about this unique study: After assessing the probabletransformations that will affect our society and ourselves following Disclosure,we have gained a deeper appreciation for why UFO secrecy has been maintained forso long. In that sense, even if Disclosure were never to happen, or at leastnever to happen as we think it will, we feel this book is of value bydemonstrating the multifaceted, revolutionary nature of the UFO phenomenon. Youmay not agree with all of our examples, scenarios, or conclusions, but wewelcome the debate.We are, however, confident that the truth will come out. We are not alone. Andthe Others are not light years away, some kind of cosmic penpals chatting byradio telescope. They are here, now.The day will come when humanity reviews its history and divides it betweeneverything before the truth was spoken out loud and everything A.D., or AfterDisclosure. Soon enough, we will all be living in the brave new world of lifeafter contact.Richard M. DolanRochester, New YorkBryce ZabelLos Angeles, California"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1Day One: The Day Everything Changes> > However long the night,> > the dawn will break.—African ProverbWhite House correspondents are in an uproar. A few hours earlier, the presssecretary told them that the president would appear in the late afternoon tomake a “major announcement” on a topic of “global importance.” This broughthowls of protest concerning the lateness of it all, a bit of unfortunate timingthat guaranteed missed deadlines and high-stress “live” shots.Even while jammed into their windowless, cramped cubicles and spartan offices inthe basement of the West Wing, these elite journalists from around the world hadknown for days that something was going on upstairs. They had reported about thelate-night comings-and-goings around other power centers of Washington, D.C.,but no reporter broke a story about what it meant. Instead, they tried to drawout the truth from each other without revealing any of their own suspicions.Now, in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, the anxiety is palpable. Each ofthe lucky occupants of the 49 assigned seats claimed their space early to avoidpoaching. Meanwhile, the rest of the room is packed, with nearly as manyreporters standing on the sidelines. This is not the first time they have beentold of an inconvenient forthcoming announcement, but no one can remember onecoming this late on a Friday. The reporter for the Associated Press, now seatedfront-row center, scribbles potential first questions. He stops, however, whenthe correspondent for National Public Radio, seated in the row immediatelybehind, wonders half-jokingly to no one in particular if it matters that thestock market just closed.The news reaches them that the president is on the way. The informal bettingpool, run by the photographers, is closed to new wagers. The short odds now tilttoward military action against a terrorist training camp, followed by a radicalnew trade deal with China. The acknowledgment of a classified U.S. defensetechnology remains a long-shot that could pay off nicely. And while no one hasplaced a bet on it, a few wonder if this has something to do with thatinexplicable “event” from last week. Clearly, there has to be a rationalexplanation for it, but what if….The president enters. With him are key members of the U.S. Congress, theSecretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. This assembly of power seems to favor the militaryangle. Then someone notices that the Secretary of Commerce is also,inexplicably, standing with the group.The Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America checks his watch andsteps up to the familiar podium.“After consultation with key members of our defense and intelligence community,”the president begins, “including the officials accompanying me here at thispodium, it has been made clear to me that there is persuasive evidence that theEarth has been, and is currently being, interacted with by one or moreintelligent non-human species.”He pauses and surveys the room, allowing time for his statement to settle intothe minds of those listening.Within a single minute, the world has changed.The president preaches calm, although deep inside he is a bit panicked, too. Hehas only last week learned the details of this reality himself. He explains thatrecent highly visible sightings of UFOs, including a mass sighting that had beenwell-documented, caused him to demand a full investigation into what the UnitedStates government knew on the subject.[images/00011.jpg]Witnessing A.D.1: The world changes instantly and forever. Presidential NewsConference, East Room. Photo courtesy of The Associated Press/Susan Walsh.“Despite the issues that disclosure of this fact now obviously raises, I dobelieve that the people of the United States, and the people of Earth, have aright to know,” the president continues. “Because of the need for calm debate, Ihave taken the precautionary move of making the National Guard available to anystate governor who feels that its use is necessary to maintain public safety.Additionally, to protect our nation’s economic security, through my executiveauthority, I am closing the nation’s banks for a period of one week, andordering the closure of the stock market until further notice.”From here, the press conference becomes decidedly more challenging. Underquestioning, the president promises an on-going, “transparent” review of allclassified files dealing with the UFO phenomenon and the ET presence. This willbe supervised by members of Senate and House intelligence committees. He evenannounces the formation of an Office of Contact Affairs. Meanwhile, foreignleaders worldwide have begun to make similar announcements, part of acoordinated effort at Disclosure that rolls across the time zones of the Earth.Even the Pope will speak to thousands from his balcony at the Vatican Sunday atnoon.The president does not take all the heat alone. This is why he has brought theSecretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Defense to answer some of the pointedquestions in the news conference that will follow. That news conference will bethe most eventful one that the world has ever seen, creating more headlines,spinning off more “live” shots, and generating more demand for follow-up thananything we have ever seen before, or ever will.[images/00012.jpg]This Disclosure scenario only serves purposes of illustration. It is possiblethat the lifting of the veil will not originate in the United States, or eveninvolve its elected leader. It could even come courtesy of insiders within thesecrecy group itself who force the issue into the open and take the world bysurprise. There are many roads that can be taken on the journey to truth.Whatever specific actions precede the announcement, however, the first 24 hourswill be like none that have ever existed before. The world has never experienceda planetary event of this magnitude. Not even the existential shock of theKennedy assassination, the dark impact of 9/11, or the reverent awe of the Moonlanding.The day will become the “Where Were You?” moment for all people who live throughit. For the rest of their lives, they will talk about what they were doing whenthey first heard the news. History will have a new dividing line, one thatheralds the first day of a new world, the end of an old one.Originally, the term A.D. came from the Latin phrase Anno Domini, and referredto the time after the birth of Christ in the Gregorian calendar. It will stillcontinue as the unofficial global standard and as the basis of scholarly dating.Now the phrase “A.D.” will be appropriated by the world culture as the referencefor the time After Disclosure. There will be surprising global acceptance ofthis re-interpretation, given that more than two-thirds of the world isn’t evenChristian. Even B.C. will come to stand for something else: Before Confirmation.The younger generation will embrace the change most enthusiastically. This newreference point will be more relevant to their lives. It can be easily textedand still carry full meaning. Two keystrokes and a number, no spaces. AD1.First ReactionsThe first second After Disclosure—when someone in authority acknowledges thatintelligent non-human life is a fact—you will know instantly that the world haschanged completely and forever.The first minute After Disclosure, you will be concerned for the safety of yourfriends and family, but the reassurances will make you feel better for themoment.The first hour After Disclosure will be full of cell phone calls, e-mails, andtexts to those same people, as we all collectively watch television and surf theInternet, hungry for new information.The first 24 hours After Disclosure will see the serious questions start. Peoplewill wonder how this could have happened, and ask what it really means.At the very beginning, as the citizens of the world play catch-up to thisbreaking story, their questions will fall into five main categories:> 1. Intelligent Non-Humans. How long have these beings been here? Where do they> come from? What do they look like? Do they walk among us now? Is there more> than one type?> 2. Their Agenda. How much do we know about their activities? Are these beings> benign in intent, or malevolent? Have we had meetings with them? Are we in> communication with them now?> 3. Safety. Has our military been chasing after UFOs, as some have claimed?> Have we lost aircraft as a result? Is it true that UFOs have been interested> in our nuclear weapons sites? Will we now share technical data with other> nations in order to create a military system capable of defending against> potentially hostile beings?> 4. Secrecy. Why was this information kept from the public for so long? How was> that even accomplished? Are we going to learn the full story now, or just some> of it?> 5. Disclosure. Going forward, how will we even know if what is being said is> the truth? Will all classified records be released, or only some? Will amnesty> be granted so those involved in the cover-up can speak freely?Unfortunately, there will not be complete and honest answers to some of thesequestions for years, if ever.On the first day, however, everyone in the world will be asking everyone elsethese questions and more. The jolt from these initial conversations will beunprecedented because it will be an experience shared by billions.Our curious minds will not be at a loss for words. Thirsting for clarity, wewill plug them into search engines in record numbers. When we cannot find theright word or phrase, we will invent new ones.In Other WordsBecause we live in a wired world, there will be a sudden creation of new terms,and fresh definitions of old words and phrases. Along with the embrace of A.D.for After Disclosure, the new nomenclature will gain traction because it conveysa shorthand concept that spreads virally. Here, we propose a start-up glossaryof ways that words might change in order to convey new ideas. We will use themin this book to do just that.Day OneAmong the ongoing redefinitions in the new world will be “Day One,” instantlyappropriated to refer to this tumultuous first day. This designation isless-hysterical than 9/11, and more forward-looking. “9/11” invokes emergencycalls and sudden terror, but Day One solidifies the obvious: no matter whatcomes next, whatever came before is over. Day One is when the calendars startagain in our instantaneous reboot of consciousness.DisclosureAt the same time, the word disclosure will be changed. As a lower-case word, itwill carry all the usual meanings. But there will be a new meaning for Big “D”disclosure. That “Disclosure” will be used, as it is used in this book, to referto the overall process of acknowledging humanity’s contact with otherintelligent beings. It covers all aspects, all the moving pieces, all thecomplexity, of the event’s impact. You can disclose a fact about UFOs, butDisclosure is the event and the process. It encompasses all that happens when wesay, “We are not alone.”The OthersThe biggest re-definition will be how we come to refer to the “intelligentnon-humans” that have been in contact with us. It is possible that whenDisclosure comes, these beings may be referred to by the name that they callthemselves, or it may be a name used by the intelligence groups that havemonitored them. For this book, we will call them “The Others.”The other common terms have too much baggage. Most are too specific, and manycould be wrong. Terms such as extraterrestrial, ET, EBE, or Eben (the last twofor “extraterrestrial biological entity”) commonly invoke outer space. Callingthem visitors sounds like the reptoids from the television series V. Besides, itmay turn out that they are not visiting at all. The word aliens has a certainaccuracy, in that these beings are probably alien to humanity in key ways. Butthen again, maybe not. The word is also emotionally charged—it predisposes us tosee them as enemies, and even has been politicized by current immigrationdebates.What we do know about them is that they are not us. This means, by definition,that they are Others.The Breakaway GroupIn the 1950s, retired Marine Corps Major Donald Keyhoe called the secret-keepersthe “Silence Group.” If certain documents leaked in the 1980s are to bebelieved, the group had the name of Majestic-12 or MJ-12. These days there is nodirect evidence that name is still in use. “The Breakaway Group” is our name forthem. We believe they are still at work today, having become a quasi-private,quasi-public group. To a large extent, these people have their own rules, theirown secrecy protocols, their own technology. As the following pages willsuggest, they have probably developed their own society, separate from the onethat spawned it, yet still interacting with it. The existence of The “BreakawayGroup” is nearly as important a secret as that of the non-human intelligencesthemselves.Ground Zero“Ground Zero” once referred to a nuclear blast contact point. Then, following9/11, it referred to the hole where the World Trade Center once stood. If thecover-up begins to unravel with a mass sighting, the term will be re-defined yetagain as the location where the slide toward Disclosure gained traction. Forexample, let us assume for illustration purposes that a mass sighting occurs inMontreal, Canada. If that is the event that begins the final disintegration ofthe secret, the city will be referred to as Ground Zero—even though, as pedantswill point out, the event never took place on the ground, but in the sky above.Trigger EventSomething will start the process toward Disclosure. As we already suggested, itcould be an undeniable mass sighting of a UFO. But it might also be a compellingrevelation from Wikileaks or some other citizen-based group that hacks intoclassified records. It may be the appearance of physical evidence discovered inthe attic of a Roswell witness. Or perhaps a deathbed confession by anex-president or prominent general who sees a chance for immortality by speakingthe truth. It could be a foreign government, such as China, Russia, or Brazil,acting unilaterally. It could also be the Others themselves, although they haveapparently declined every previous opportunity throughout the years to announcethemselves. But whatever the trigger event is, it will be a tipping point thatshifts the momentum from secrecy to openness.AvalancheAfter the trigger event comes the avalanche. They often start slowly, thengather momentum. Finally, they become unstoppable. In the rapid downhill fall ofUFO secrecy, one event leads to another, then to another. Finally, theircumulative weight makes the process unstoppable and overwhelming. An avalanchecan bury the past, which can be a good thing, but it also has great potentialfor destruction.Shock and Awe“Shock and Awe” will no longer refer to the 2003 aerial bombing blitz ofBaghdad. After Disclosure, it will convey the intense emotional impact peoplefeel at first hearing the news. In the first month A.D., among youth, it will bethe answer to “How are you?” The answer is a simple, “Shock and awe, dude, shockand awe.”Nomenclature aside, it may feel to many that the announcement of the Others cameout of nowhere. The truth, however, is that it will have been visible on thehorizon for days, weeks, or even months before.The Gathering StormThe most gripping and contentious issue in ufology today is this singular issueof Disclosure. Across the Internet, especially on podcasts focusing on theparanormal, perhaps the most common question asked of guests is, “When?” Thishas many levels and complexities, but there is an answer.In their wildest dreams, the secret-keepers could never have thought the secretwould last this long. Now that it has, however, they do not intend to change thestatus quo unless they must.Disclosure waits until it can wait no longer. And then it happens.After generations of silence and denial, the Breakaway Group will not changecourse voluntarily. Although a contingency plan of slow gradual revelation mayexist (as some speculate in the form of mass media indoctrination), there is noevidence it will be voluntarily deployed. Only something unexpected andoverwhelming will force the secret-keepers to make some sort of publicacknowledgment. This could be 20 years from now, or it could be tomorrow. Thosewho believe the secret will last forever, however, will find that human societywill be the thing that surprises them. It is our collective selves that willprove to be the great agent of change, the unstoppable force that ultimatelyends the secret. As we will argue, it is most likely to happen within the nextgeneration or sooner.Whatever and whenever the trigger event happens to be, it will be followed by aperiod of a week to 10 days where calls for answers grow louder fromincreasingly authoritative voices. The events leading from the trigger event toDay One will not be random. Instead, they will follow an undeniable logic.Behind the scenes, several key players, probably including the U.S. presidentand other world leaders, will receive their first authentic, but limited,briefing on the topic. They will be told that, after seven decades of study,UFOs are perceived as a threat, though not necessarily an imminent one. If theyrepresented an imminent physical attack, there would probably have been a morenoticeable military mobilization than what has occurred, and of a different typeand scale. On the other hand, if there was no threat whatsoever, the systemwould have had no need to maintain the secrecy apparatus.This will unleash a tsunami of classified e-mail, encrypted texts, videoconferences, secure calls, and ever-growing anticipation. The world media willbe hysterical with speculation and will even receive a few tips about UFOs. Yet,media outlets will be too timid and compromised to publish them, even thoughthey will know something big is about to happen. Even in the event of aspectacular mass sighting, there will be those who expect a prosaic explanation,possibly the announcement that we have built our own flying saucers, or that theobject seen in the skies was a military-developed hologram. Others will not beso sure this time.[images/00015.jpg]Facing the facts in the air. Previously ignored accounts of unknown craft becomekey evidence overnight. Vancouver, B.C., October 8th, 1981. Photo courtesy ofHannah McRoberts.During this shadow period, world capitals will be in a state of excitement andanxiety, as officials consult each other formally and through back-channels. Inthe United States, preparatory meetings will take place to coordinate across thethree branches of government, as well as the military and intelligencecommunities. All of this will be aimed at synchronizing, containing, andmanaging. The major agencies and institutions will need guidelines in order toprovide a unified message. This will create leaks that will be firmly andcategorically denied until they are confirmed and it happens.The announcement will not come from any sense of patriotism or altruism. Thedecision to change the world, to let the world change, will simply be a matterof damage control. It is only at the point where the thing that has alwaysseemed impossible—Disclosure—will now become inevitable.Full (Radical) DisclosureWhen the leadership of the Breakaway Group makes a decision to disclose, theymust decide what to say. This is a complex secret, full of nuance, with thepotential to rend the fabric of the status quo. They will have several optionsin deciding what to tell, how to tell it, and how truthful—or deceptive—theywill be.The government might disclose as much as it can as fast as it can. Although itwould take weeks or months to fill in the full mosaic of contact, the idea is tolet it all hang out from the finest moments of joining the brotherhood of theuniverse to the darkest hours of feeling under threat by malevolent forces.This is a risky throw of the dice. Some argue for it and even romanticize it,knowing that they will never have to make the decision. All voices on theinside, however, are apt to look at this option with fear and dread.What they would have to consider is a scenario in which the governmentimmediately dumps massive amounts of evidence, hoping that this one single meaculpa allows its leaders to put the controversy behind them. This involves therelease of an avalanche of supporting evidence—DVDs, decrypted files, or securedownload sites full of video and photos (including corpses and wreckage)—andwould involve the posting of tens of thousands of pages of documents to theInternet. The next edition of the New York Times would perhaps read alarminglylike many previous issues of the National Enquirer.By releasing it all at once, much like President Nixon did when he released allof the Watergate tape transcripts at the same time, the hope would be that therewill be so much to process that the public reaction would initially be enormous,and then die down. Nixon, however, provides his own cautionary tale. Rather thanreleasing the actual tapes and forcing the reporters and the Supreme Courtclerks to sift through them, he released redacted transcripts. People, fed upwith his lying, rejected that. Nor will they accept a Disclosure that isstripped of its full content. If the idea coming from the Breakaway Group is todeliver the so-called UFO truth Full Monty style then they will have to do justthat.The technical obstacles alone would be overwhelming. First, simply assemblingthe films, videos, and photos would increase the likelihood that they would leakprematurely and create a War of the Worlds-type panic. More important, postingeverything to the Internet would be impossible without a proper declassificationreview, unless the government wanted to offer the conspiracy theorists a firstopportunity to interpret them.There is another reason why full Disclosure may be an unattractive option. Itmay well be that, during the period leading to the great announcement, thepresident is briefed by intelligence experts who describe truly disturbingelements of the UFO phenomenon. After all, we can presume that the otherintelligences here on Earth are very likely to be more advanced than we are. Andthe fact that they, too, have been rather secretive about their presence may notbode well. Simply because they are demonstrably smart does not mean that theirintentions are “good” from the limited point of view of the humans that happento inhabit Earth.Partial (Controlled) DisclosureA partial, or limited, Disclosure confirms the basic fact that “we are notalone,” and tries to manage the tidal wave of questions and accusations on acase-by-case basis. Essentially, this is a stall for time. One motivation forthis strategy comes from the top: to conceal crimes that have been committedwhile preserving the secret. Also, the secret-keepers can reassure themselvesthat they are giving the public a chance to absorb this new information in acalm manner, preventing a panic and societal implosion.Even so, simply announcing that “they’re here” will break like a tidal wave overthe public’s consciousness. The “go slow” approach would be an attempt bygovernments to appear forthcoming, but also evaluating the evidence in adeliberate, responsible manner.This will still be a death by a thousand cuts. Here, the information is dribbledout piecemeal; much of it is protected and released unwillingly. It is not apleasant strategy, yet it will be the favored one. It is the only way for thoseerstwhile secret-keepers (now forced to be secret-givers) to try to maintainsome semblance of control over the situation. This has been their obsession anda mission for a long time, and will not cease because of a forced announcement.They, and their representatives, will still face a set of difficult questionswhere “no comment” will not satisfy.It is not just that all of the information released at once would be unsettling.It is that any part of all of the information will be unsettling and potentiallyexplosive. For instance, how might Disclosure affect the financial markets,given that there will be technologies from UFOs that may be introduced? Howmight these same technologies affect international relations? What if the Othershave substantial underground bases here on Earth—does one come out and just sayso? What if some of them look like us—would it be a good idea to mention this?How does one talk about abductions? What if there had been some measure ofcollaboration between them and certain intelligence groups? How bad might publicpanic be?Because of these concerns, even if there is a mass sighting those in charge ofmaintaining the secret may only confirm the existence of one species, possiblythe common “Grays,” providing the information that they are from Zeti-Reticuli,if that is the case (and assuming this information is known), or naming wherethey do come from, if it is not. This will be a significant bombshell, ofcourse. Yet, it would only be a very limited disclosure if the truth turns outto be that there are dozens of other species observing us from other worlds,dimensions, or times.This means that the “big picture” spills out first, while the media—asleep atthe switch all these years—tries to repair its damaged reputation by leaping onthe story. It will usher in a true battle royale over what we “need to know.”Even though the public will eventually answer that question with a definitiveeverything, that will come later, as the days turn to weeks, then to months,then to years.False (Deceptive) DisclosureNothing is a certainty in the world of trillion-dollar secrets, securityclassifications that are levels above the president, and lies and deceptiongoing back for more than half a century. It is possible to imagine a situationwhere the true holders of the secret know they have to say something importantin order to appease a demanding population. They would then offer up a form ofDisclosure that is only a bigger lie.In the event of a widely recorded mass sighting, for instance, the strategywould be to admit that, yes, something unusual was flying in the sky, and wasactually classified human military technology. In other words, they confirm thatthe hardware exists, but insist it is entirely human. They then fall back onnational security, and refuse to answer any more questions.It is elegant in its simplicity. By acknowledging the truth of the sighting, thegreatest act of debunking is primed. It is also, if practiced by a superpowerlike the United States, Russia, or China, a dodge against a potential enemy,saying in effect that “my weapons are so impressive you thought they had to beextraterrestrial.”Whatever country uses that strategy has turned its competitors into reluctantco-conspirators. Other nations may well choose not to challenge such a statementpublicly, as this would force them into the position of claiming that UFOs arereal. This form of False Disclosure, then, is a double-down. It allows onecountry to bluff the rest of the world, co-opt its enemies, and maintain thestatus quo for another few years at minimum.As attractive as this might seem, it is a risky course that would probablybackfire. At some point, it would be necessary to demonstrate the technology toaviation and aerospace experts. The public could be skeptical of such a claim,and credibility could become a serious issue.Another form of False Disclosure would be to admit that whatever the sightingevent was, it was certainly unusual, and that the government is just as curiousas its citizens. In this scenario, a president or other foreign leader would tryto put him- or herself and the country on the side of the people, and wouldprobably create a commission to deliver a report on UFOs within a certain periodof time. This is stonewalling of the highest order, of course. Yet, while thecommission is busy at its business of determining what is behind the UFOphenomenon, the government, the Breakaway Group, and other secret-keepers havemore time to assess the damage and determine their next step.Yet another form of False Disclosure would be something that has been widelydiscussed on countless Internet blogs and social network sites: announcing thata hostile ET race threatens humanity. This would be a type of “false flag”operation, in which a secret agency carries out an operation to make it appearthat other groups or entities are responsible. False Flag operations haveoccurred at various times throughout the history of warfare, but also in modernhistory as covert operations designed to confuse and manipulate the public, themost notorious example being the Reichstag Fire of 1933, an event carried out bythe Nazis but blamed on Communists, and which served as the foundation forHitler’s dictatorship.It has been claimed that an alien false flag invasion has been planned for manyyears under the code name “Blue Beam.” The idea would be to fake an ET invasionthrough advanced holography and other technologies, and then terrorize thepublic into acquiescing to the creation of a global police state. Could thishappen?Nothing can be ruled out in the 21st century, when people are manipulated andpacified daily via an entertainment complex that often works hand-in-glove withthe state apparatuses around the world. Also, there are technologies availableto covert groups that now exceed the wildest imaginations of prior generations.We must say, why not, indeed?However, claims require evidence, and here Blue Beam has always fallen short.So, too, in the logic of its implementation. The logistics alone would be aplanner’s worst nightmare. Moreover, does faking an alien invasion mean therereally are no aliens? Many Blue Beam proponents appear to believe this. If,however, Others of some sort are here, then the perpetrators of a Blue Beamevent would seem to be taking a huge risk, assuming that the Others go alongwith everything without a hitch. Perhaps there would be reason to think so, andperhaps there could be collaboration between the human elites and “them” to makeit happen. But the problem is that there is no evidence to support any of thisconjecture. It’s easy to make claims, but much harder to make a case.Considering all factors involved, it is more likely that the decisionmakersbehind Disclosure would rather play matters down. Bold lies always bring greatdanger, but this particular bold lie would be a powder keg beyond all others.But if Blue Beam lacks evidence and logic, it remains possible that Disclosurecould be used as an attempt to spread fear of the Others and enforce docilityamong the public. At all events, we must assume that those people who havemanaged the secret all these years will not simply walk away from the tableafter Disclosure.Spin CityDay One starts with confirmation. No matter what form Disclosure takes, thepublic will be subjected to what military public relations experts call“information shaping.” From the perspective of any government, this will benecessary. Any chief executive forced to discuss this with the world will be ina tough position, especially if there is any bad news to report.National leaders will do everything possible to control public discourse as itunfolds. Whether or not they succeed will be of great significance. Mostcertainly, the leaders of the key UFO secrecy nations will have a general planthat was previously worked out in preparation to Disclosure.These leaders will need to decide how frightened they want the world to be. Acertain amount of fear is useful to someone who is out front on a major issue.Fear causes people to look for leadership to calm the social order. Too muchfear, however, can devolve into something that cannot be controlled.If hostile intent of any kind is hinted at or acknowledged, the world will looktoward the United States, the most powerful military power, for reassurance. Inthat case, the talking points of the U.S. president will be as follows:> [images/00012.jpg] “To the extent that the Earth is under threat, we have the> capability to respond. Our military has a plan and significant capabilities to> implement it, if necessary.”> [images/00012.jpg] “World leaders are in constant communication on this issue.> All nations have individual plans of action that are being coordinated with> all the global powers, aimed at providing security to the citizens of the> world.”If hostile intent is not assumed, the decision may be to minimize as much aspossible, even making it seem as though it was all known already. This “Sowhat’s the big deal?” thinking will be front and center among many who havedenied the reality for years, people who now suddenly must get with the program.Strong deniers will shrug and say they never doubted the existence of aliens,just that they were here.The logic we hear will be simple. The universe is a very, very big place—as manyas 200 billion galaxies, each one containing billions of stars with a fairamount of those stars supporting planets. Some of them should have spawnedintelligent life. Said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, “The most importantscientific revolutions all include, as their only common feature, thedethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previousconvictions about our centrality in the cosmos.”It is even possible that governments will downplay the UFO phenomenon bycontinuing a strategy employed by the CIA since the 1990s that states many ofthe UFO reports throughout the years were of classified aircraft. This strategywould have the double advantage of minimizing what the Others may have at theirdisposal, while maximizing what “we” may have. It is conceivable that in theunveiling, the only UFO produced by the government will be pictures from a crashand fragments and pieces. The photo-op will go instead to some newlyde-classified and deadly hardware, possibly made by the United States.All this will be possible because government and major media on Day One willstill be working hand-in-glove, still finding mutual self-interest in proppingeach other up.But governments will fail to manage public discourse on the Internet. This iswhere the real divide will take place, where the difficult questions will beasked immediately. Starting on Day One, a popular movement will spring to life,seeking to force more rapid disclosures and more meaningful information fromgovernments and secret cabals.For this reason, any attempt at deception (as opposed to mere withholding of thetruth) by governments on the nature of UFOs and the Others will carry greatrisks. Researchers from around the world, who have spent years investigating thereality of this topic, are unlikely to allow government lies to stand unopposed.And this time, people will be listening to those researchers.The ultimate question concerns the Others themselves. This will be especiallydifficult for governments, as there are some people in the world who alreadyhave answers about them. They do not need to speculate about “the possiblenature of aliens.” They have seen them and, whether classified or not, some ofthese ideas and experiences will be shared with the world.This allows us to make another assumption. If the powers-that-be decideDisclosure must happen, they will know that they must “show us the aliens.” Thismeans that all those UFO photos that people thought were Photoshopped (manywere) or too unclear and out-of-focus (the saucer would not hold still) will bereplaced by “the good stuff.” Let us define that as, at the least, a photo thatis crystal clear and could not possibly be anything other than what it ispurported to be: a craft from another planet, another dimension, or anotherreality altogether. The proof might be gun camera footage from an Air Force jet,or photos taken from the recovery of a crashed saucer.Still, given the quality of modern cinematic special effects, film and photoswill not suffice. At some point, people will need to see wreckage, bodies, orsomething else that is tangible and clearly authentic. The idea of taking acollection of reporters from top media outlets to a secret location where theycan see for themselves, record photos and videos for their audiences andreaders, and go on a tour, should not be ruled out.Even then, for some people this will not be enough. There will be those who seeany government admission of cover-up as just another cover-up in itself. Theywill think that something else, something even bigger and more nefarious is inthe wind if the government has to blame it on aliens. Given a lifetime of liesand secrecy by their government, such an attitude is understandable.A Moment in TimeDespite the uniqueness of this moment, much of what will follow is reasonablyclear, based on past experience. We can even take an educated guess as to theday of the week it will happen and the time of day it will be scheduled.The president will probably shut down the stock market and close the banks, justas President Franklin D. Roosevelt did during the Great Depression. Also,remember, that the media will be unleashed on this story as it has never been onanything before. This means that, unless the Motherships actually do show uphovering above the world’s cities, Day One will start on a Friday, probablybetween 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST.The reason is that the stock market will have already closed, and the banks inevery town will be shutting down. Everyone will have a full weekend to considerthe news and its implications before they panic and try to pull their money outof their savings accounts or sell all their stocks. It also avoids media imagesof an empty New York Stock Exchange and citizens protesting outside banks.This need coincides with a separate desire to keep the media off-balance andmore-or-less compliant. The ideal time for most briefings is early in the dayEastern Standard Time, so that the establishment reporters can file theirstories for the evening news. On this day, however, the insiders will not wantthem to have all day to work the story. They will instead want the weekend toobserve how the story is being received, in order to adjust their plansaccordingly when Monday arrives. There will be plenty to observe, because everynetwork will pre-empt its programming for this story, and every cable newsoutlet will throw all their resources into it.If Disclosure does happen on a Friday, expect journalists to travel under agovernment escort to a previously secret location such as Nevada’s Area 51, orU.S. Air Force Headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base over the weekend.Some of the first day’s tremors are public; some are concealed. Many workers aresent home from the office. “Essential” personnel, however, are on-the-job in abig way.The media trots out experts, charts, and polls. It wags fingers at thegovernment. Public employees scramble for answers, just like everyone else. Itis like a Richter 13 magnitude earthquake, and no one is escaping collateraldamage. The military pivots to DEFCON 2 (just short of imminent nuclear war),science turns upside down, religion scrambles to dress up old sermons for newrealities, and corporate leaders text each other about profit potentials andrisks. And this is on Day One. The world is just getting started.The shock of this news will not exist in a vacuum. It will instead be multipliedby the feeling that the truth has been withheld, and the people who are briefingeveryone are the same people who have either behaved stupidly or just plainlied. There will eventually be blowback on a huge scale. Yet on Day One, thefeeling of having been lied to for generations will not have had time to formcompletely. The first 24 hours will be about understanding that the news is realand adapting to this knowledge in the most basic way possible.Most people, including the self-described “skeptics,” have refused to readanything about UFOs. They have avoided thinking about the subject in any wayother than as story fodder for science fiction films. They will be the mostshocked; their belief spectrum will shift radically, all at once. Others lessdogmatic, or especially those who have taken some time to acquaint themselves ofthe facts as they can be known, will have less distance to travel.Preparation to hear and accept this news may be more important than you think.You can do the world a great deal of good if you are one of a critical mass ofpeople who can react with calm rationality on Day One. This early considerationof what is coming is important because, as historians routinely advise us,whenever contact between two civilizations occurs, it is the less-advanced one(at least technologically) that collapses. There are many analogoussituations—Cortez and the Aztecs, Pizarro and the Incas. Indeed, in the filmApocalypto, the arrival of the Spaniards at the Yucatan in 1502 is portrayed asthe fulfillment of an Oracle’s prophecy that these strangers would come to“scratch out the Earth. Scratch you out. And end your world.”Consider the shock those civilizations may have felt. Now consider how ourovercrowded, technologically sophisticated world, in which news travelsinstantaneously and news cycles are measured in hours, will shape and distortour perceptions of threat. Consider, too, how it will affect our collective,societal self-esteem. Collapse in ancient times may have taken decades. For us,it could be instantaneous.If there is one silver lining to this fear for the collapse of civilization, itis that a threat from the Others might serve to drive humanity together. InApocalypto, for example, the two killers from the dominant native culture stopthe pursuit of their intended victim, and instead gaze with him at the arrivalof Europeans wading ashore from their huge, unfathomable sailing ships. May thisperhaps be a metaphor for our contemporary national strivings and hatreds thatseemed so important the minute before Disclosure, now transformed intouncomprehending awe at the ships and visitors who have come here for unknownreasons?In the days and weeks after Day One, there will be a second wave of revelations,a second wave of events. They will affect every aspect of our world. Althoughthe financial industry stands down, for instance, the military will stand up.There will be a worldwide military alert, and questions will arise as to humancapabilities of meeting a potential ET threat. Martial law will also be declaredat various places around the world. Looting will be widespread, even if it isnothing more than an instinctive reaction from panic. The media will still jumpinto the fray 24/7, ignoring its own culpability in the cover-up. For thoseworking in the news business, this will be the biggest shot of adrenaline ever.Reporters the world over will be working the story for months, if not years.Headlines will read, “We Are Not Alone,” “World Leaders Say UFOs Real,” “AliensHere Now.” Cellphone towers and Internet relays will be stretched beyond theircapabilities. People everywhere will pray, and the world’s religions will notall agree on what we are dealing with. This will be a matter of great potentialstrife. Almost certainly, some shrewd minister, priest, rabbi, imam, or someother religious leader will exploit this change with a new message, creating anew faith.Us and ThemThe overriding factor in this equation—the great unknown—will be the Others.Everyone will want to know three things immediately:> 1. Who are they?> 2. What do they want?> 3. Are we safe?Much depends on the answers to these questions, especially whether these beingsare friendly or hostile. But maybe they are neither. Or perhaps there aremultiple types of them.There is another question worth asking. It may not be asked immediately, but itought to be: What will the Others do when they realize we all know about theirexistence?They have had a free ride here in our world for years, perhaps eons. They haveinvaded our military airspace, abducted our citizens, and even crashed in ourdeserts—all while the public was assured they did not exist.If we all learn this at once, will they react to our knowledge? Those who havebeen studying this issue and asking these questions for years might have ananswer. Still, whatever agenda the Others have it is probable that secrecy was apart of it, and that Disclosure will complicate matters for us and them.Looking back at his brother’s assassination, Senator Robert Kennedy livedthrough the kind of sea change of perspective we will be experiencing. “I foundout something I never knew,” said RFK. “I found out that my world was not thereal world.” If political assassination could generate that kind of reactionfrom a hardened politico like Kennedy, imagine what a revelation of non-humanintelligences being here, now, can do to society.[images/00016.jpg][images/00018.jpg]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The White HouseOffice of the Press SecretaryFor ImmediateRelease         May14, 2021--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Remarks by The President on the Reality of Extraterrestrial LifeFriday, 5/14/214:15 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT:Thank you, everybody.I’ll be making a brief announcement, followed by a statement from the Secretaryof Defense, and the Secretary of Commerce. After all of us have spoken, we’lltake your questions.In cities across the world—a total of 103 countries, I believe—the same basicannouncement is being made, some simultaneously, others later, depending on thetime zone.After consultation with key members of our defense and intelligence community,it has been made clear to me that there is persuasive evidence that Earth iscurrently interacting with one or more intelligent non-human species.Despite the issues that disclosure of this fact now obviously raises, I dobelieve that the people of the United States and the people of Earth, have aright to know. In my consultations with our allies and with other countriesaround the world, a consensus was reached that, while some of us might havepreferred to have more time, events have overtaken us, and we can wait nolonger.I want to emphasize two things immediately: First, there is virtually noevidence at this time that we are under attack. In fact, the opposite seems tobe true. To say that we are under some kind of observation seems more accurate.The Secretary of Defense will speak in a moment and he can address directly thesteps that are being taken as we speak to secure the nation—and the world.Second, I am—through a separate Executive Order—creating an Office of ContactAffairs, which will be staffed and funded as a part of our Department ofHomeland Security. It has been given the mandate of reporting directly to meabout the scope of this current visitation. I have, concurrently, directed theAttorney General to begin her own investigation into the nature and content ofapparent secrecy with which some of these facts have long been held.Because of the need for calm debate, I have taken the precautionary move ofmaking the National Guard available to any state governor who feels that it isneeded to keep the public order. Additionally, to protect our nation’s economicsecurity, through my executive authority, I am closing the nation’s banks for aperiod of one week, and ordering the closure of the stock market until furthernotice.Now, before I provide the details on this, let me speak directly to our nation’schildren and young people. It is quite clear that the facts I have confirmedtoday are disturbing. Like your parents, I’m sure you have many, many questionsand that some of you are scared. Throughout the weekend, we will be addressingas many of those questions as possible. But I want you to know that you aresafe. Your homes are safe. Our nation is safe. We are entering a new era, thatmuch is clear, but we do so with strength and confidence and an abiding beliefthat humanity has much to give to other life-forms that may exist in the vastuniverse we live in, and that we also can learn much from these visitors.To the media, the press secretary assures me that you will find full informationpackets and hard drives with a selection of photos, videos, and reports that Ihave unclassified through presidential order. The Attorney General will begin athorough review of other material, in consultation with Congress and the chairsof the House and Senate Intelligence committees, as to what can be released inthe future and in what time frame. I ask for your patience. The process will bedifficult, yet today we begin it together.So thank you all very much. The Secretary of Defense will speak now.END4:21 P.M. EDT"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Breakaway: How Secrets Created a World Within a World> > Secrecy is the first essential in affairs of the State.—Cardinal De RichelieuIn 1960, the U.S. government tasked the Brookings Institute with analyzing theimplications of the fledgling U.S. space program. The report, completed inDecember 1960, included an examination of the possibility that the space programmight find evidence of intelligent alien life, such as artifacts on the moon orMars.The implications were taken seriously by the authors who feared socialdisintegration if humanity came in contact with an extraterrestrial life form.“Anthropological files contain many examples of societies sure of their place inthe universe,” stated the Brookings Institute writers, “which have disintegratedwhen they had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies…espousingdifferent ideas and different life ways.”1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos692581] The authors suggested thatif the U.S. space program found evidence of alien life or technology, it mightbe advisable to withhold this information from the public.The Brookings Report reinforced a longstanding U.S. government policy. No lessan authority than the former Director of Central Intelligence, Admiral RoscoeHillenkoetter admitted to a cover-up in a letter to the New York Times in 1960,shortly before publication of the report. “Behind the scenes, high-ranking AirForce officers are soberly concerned about UFOs,” said Hillenkoetter. “Butthrough official secrecy and ridicule, citizens are led to believe the unknownflying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced itspersonnel.”2 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos692936]The World of 1947In an ideal world, something as reality-shattering as the presence of anotherintelligent civilization interacting with our own would prompt the politicalsystem to act in a coherent manner. In such a world, governments everywherewould speak for the people, work on their behalf, and answer to them. But wehave to live in the real world.Despite the provocative nature of the phenomenon (or, more likely, because ofit), the political structure of the United States immediately began debunkingit. Other governments of the world followed suit. That policy has now evolvedinto the most successful cover-up of all time. Despite the continuous sightings,books, and statements by prominent public figures, it remains in place.It is not hard to see why the world’s top power brokers would want to concealthe reality of something as monumental as UFOs.The world of 1947 was in the midst of tremendous change. Fresh from the mostdestructive war of all time, millions of people in Europe, Africa, and Asia werehomeless refugees. Millions more were rebuilding their nations from piles ofrubble, and many others were on the brink of starvation. A new weapon ofterrifying power had recently been unleashed on the world, and the United Stateswas now engaged in a struggle with the Soviet Union for world dominance.President Harry S Truman signed the National Security Act, all at once creatingthe CIA, the National Security Council, an independent Air Force, and theDepartment of Defense.At the same time, the problem of UFOs with extraordinary capabilities forced itsway into the public consciousness. Reports of unusual, unknown aerial phenomena(“foo fighters”) had been made by military pilots during the war. Then, in 1946,so-called “ghost rockets” were reported over Europe. In 1947, Americans beganseeing them. By late June, they had a name: “flying saucers.”Then, in early July, if scores of witnesses are to be believed, one of theseobjects crashed near America’s only nuclear base in Roswell, New Mexico.3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos693135] Soon after, the newsreached the desk of President Truman. On that very desk sat a draft copy of theNational Security Act Truman was about to sign. On it was also the famous signthat said, “The Buck Stops Here.”[images/00019.jpg]Creating the cover-up. Roswell witnesses testify strongly that the weatherballoon was a staged lie. Major Jesse Marcel said a spacecraft and bodies werefound.Photo courtesy of The Fort Worth Star Telegram, photograph collection, specialcollections. The University of Texas at Arlington Library, Arlington, Texas.Truman’s instinct might have supported a public announcement that intelligentbeings from elsewhere were here on Earth. Yet, there can be little doubt that,following his briefing from the military, he discounted such an action. Afterall, the United States was unwilling to share its atomic technology with theSoviets, or even with the United Nations—a major political issue at the time.Telling the world about something as advanced as alien technology? Not in 1947.Frankie RoweConsider the story of Frankie Rowe, one of many people connected to the Roswellevent. A woman with impeccable credibility and decency, she spoke to the authorsin 2010. In 1947, Frankie was 12 years old when her father, the town firecaptain, led the first team to a wreckage site. He came home that night talkingabout bodies and saucers. The next day, the police officer who accompanied thefirefighters showed up at the station where Frankie was recovering from tonsilsurgery. He showed them a piece of the craft he had taken. Frankie played withit for 15 minutes and described it, as so many other witnesses have, as “memorymetal.” It could not be burned, broken, or torn. It would unfold instantly intocomplete flatness.She also described how, the following day, a military policeman from the basecame to her house. In front of her mother, he told Frankie never to speak ofwhat “didn’t happen.” If she did, she and her parents might end up in theJapanese internment camp south of town, or in a desert grave where “nobody willever find your bones.”4 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos693363]Something happened at Roswell that was so extreme, so strange, and so importantthat a man in uniform made a house call to threaten a 12-year-old with death.A Nuclear “What If?”Skeptics of Roswell as a UFO story say it would be impossible to hide somethingas significant as the crash of an alien craft. History says otherwise.The Manhattan Project, in which the United States secretly developed and testedthe atomic bomb, was the godfather of modern government secrecy. The project wasso extraordinary, so revolutionary, that secrecy was paramount. Yet, it was soexpensive and so vast that developing an appropriate structure of secrecy was nomean task.“Compartmentation” became widely practiced. Each person involved in the projectknew only what he or she “needed to know.” Very few had all the information,fewer still were in a position to tell anything to the public. Within Congress,just a handful of men had any idea.The secrecy was so well executed that when, on July 16, 1945, at exactly 5:30a.m., the United States detonated the world’s first atomic bomb in White Sands,New Mexico, no one else knew about it. The explosion was seen from 100 milesaway, and many citizens contacted local police about it. Several days later, anews story stated that an ammunition dump had exploded.It was one of the most momentous events in the history of science, and not aword of it was breathed to the rest of the world.Now, consider a hypothetical scenario in which Japan might have surrenderedbefore the atomic bomb had been used against its cities. Would President Trumanhave told the world of the incredible new weapon the United States haddeveloped? Probably not. After all, once you inform the world of what you have,your allies would want you to share your research and your enemies would try tosteal it.If the United States had decided that the world must never know that an atomicbomb had ever been used, how long could the secret have been kept? If all theparticipants had been forced to a lifetime of secrecy, if all rumors were met byofficial denial, if the press and academic world became allies to squash rumors,and the cover story about an ammo dump explosion was supported by allegedwitnesses, what would be left? Only the rumors themselves, forever unconfirmed,leaving widespread suspicion but little more.There might be deathbed confessions from old soldiers, leaked documentsdismissed as forgeries, desperate researchers trying to prove the existence ofsomething like the “Manhattan Project,” and TV reporters chasing the story ofthe “White Sands Myth” in the desert.Following the recovery of exotic technology at Roswell (technology not from ourcivilization), logic would dictate that the president organize an elite team,charging them with getting to the bottom of the matter. The responsibilitieswould be manifold: analyzing the technology and duplicating it if possible,forecasting the level of public panic in the wake of Disclosure, determining thelevel of vulnerability to industrial or financial interests, managing media andacademia, ensuring secrecy from hostile nations, and certainly learningeverything possible about these other beings.The group’s existence would have to be kept secret, even from Congress. For oncethe rest of the world learned of America’s possession of such awesometechnology, they would jealously demand to be a part of its harvest.The available evidence points exactly to this turn of events. During themid-1980s, a seven-page document surfaced mysteriously—almost certainly leakedfrom within the U.S. intelligence community—which purported to be a briefingmemo prepared in 1952 for President-elect Dwight Eisenhower. It described therecovery of crashed UFOs and alien bodies, and referred to “Majestic-12” or“MJ-12” as the group responsible for managing the secret.Ufologists have argued over the authenticity of this document, as well as manysimilar documents subsequently leaked. Yet, following the event at Roswell,Truman would have been negligent had he not authorized some kind of group torespond.5 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos693565]The documents list the names of the alleged members of MJ-12. They included: thedirector of the CIA, a man who helped organize the Manhattan Project, the headof the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field, the Air Force Chief of Staff, theChairman of the National Research Council, the head of MIT’s engineeringdepartment and leading aircraft designer, the Executive Secretary of the newNational Security Council, the Director of the Harvard College Observatory, thehead of the CIA’s Psychological Strategy Board, the base commander of the AtomicEnergy Commission installation at Sandia Base, and the Secretary of the JointResearch and Development Board. All of them together would be the group onewould want to examine the reality of flying saucers, to examine what happened atRoswell, except for one person: Harvard astronomer Dr. Donald Menzel. While itmay seem reasonable to include an astronomer on a team to study presumedextraterrestrials, Menzel’s inclusion baffled UFO researchers. During the 1950sand 1960s, he was the world’s leading debunker of UFOs. For years, he maintainedthat UFOs were simply misidentifications of prosaic phenomena: stars, clouds,airplanes, balloons, etc.6 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos693822]This was surely true for some sightings of odd lights in the sky—people arefallible, after all. But many of Menzel’s so-called explanations of UFOphenomena were threadbare, even embarrassing. Yet, as a leading astronomer ofhis time, his presence in the debate prevented many other academicians fromentering the field.Menzel’s inclusion in the documents was odd. Were the forgers making a joke? Hisname raised doubts. The MJ-12 papers were volatile enough, and such doubtsfurther undermined them. Then came the story’s twist.UFO researcher Stanton Friedman—that dogged, inveterate burrower in governmentarchives, that meticulously detail man—discovered that Donald Menzel had led adouble life. Not even Menzel’s wife had known about it. It turned out thatMenzel had been a prominent, classified consultant for the U.S. intelligencecommunity.Not just any part of the intelligence community, but the CIA and thecode-making, code-breaking National Security Agency (NSA). This was when no oneknew the NSA existed, despite its probably being the most powerful of the U.S.intelligence agencies. The spooks cared little about Menzel’s knowledge of thestars; they were more interested in another of his talents, for Menzel justhappened to be a world-class cryptographer, an expert in codes and ciphers. In a1960 letter to President-elect John F. Kennedy, he mentioned his Navy Top SecretUltra Security Clearance, and his association with this activity for almost 30years. He told Kennedy that he probably had “the longest continuous record ofassociation of any person in the country.”7[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos694309]When considering that it just might come in handy to have a smart fellow whoknows how to crack difficult communications, Menzel’s inclusion makes a greatdeal of sense. His stature as a Harvard astronomer was a bonus, enabling him toslap would-be academic conspiracy theorists firmly into their place.If the MJ-12 documents really were faked, it would seem that whoever createdthem knew of Menzel’s intelligence activities and background. That would havebeen very rarified information. Or perhaps, as Friedman believed, the documentswere real after all.The term Majestic has been used occasionally in this book to describe the groupcharged with managing the many problems posed by these Others. This may be itsactual name, or it may not. Either way, it is logical and reasonable thatPresident Truman—not wanting to pass the buck—created it from the most trustedmembers of the U.S. military, political, and scientific establishment.Once that decision was made and the group formed, a machinery was created andset in motion. Machinery that was so complex, so labyrinthian, and so powerful,that it became alive.Choke PointsThreats and intimidation, such as those made on Frankie Rowe and others, are notthe only ways to keep a secret. Management of the press is also critical.By the early 1950s, the CIA had developed relationships with most major mediaexecutives in the United States. This does not mean something so crass as CIAagents telling executives what to print or broadcast. Rather, it means that someexecutives voluntarily killed stories that would damage perceived Americaninterests. Sometimes, when necessary, the CIA would be consulted. Sometimesstronger medicine was prescribed, like planting disinformation or even storiesthat were flatly untrue.Even a partial list of the participating organizations is breathtaking: the NewYork Times, the Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor, the New YorkHerald-Tribune, the Saturday Evening Post, the Miami Herald, Hearst Newspapers,Scripps-Howard Newspapers, and Time-Life. Major news wire services, such asReuters, the Associated Press, and United Press International, also cooperated.So, too, did television and radio broadcast concerns such as CBS News, theMutual Broadcasting System, and others. In addition to these, the CIA owned manynewspapers and publishing houses overseas.Some of this information came out during the 1970s, when the CIA admitted tohaving paid relationships with more than 400 mainstream American journalists.8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos694467] Consider the possibilitiesavailable to any person or group covertly employing 400 journalists. Althoughthe CIA claimed it ended such relationships, it tacitly acknowledged the need tocultivate them in cases of national security. More recently, one inside militarysource told the authors that CIA influence among freelance journalists today is“pervasive.” Former CIA Chief William Colby, a cold man who made his mark duringthe murderous Project Phoenix, who rose to the top of the Agency during the1970s, and whose life ended in a boating “accident” on the Potomac in 1995, oncetold a confident that every major media was covered by the long reach of theCIA.But the CIA sought to manage more than the media. It also gained influence overthe world of the intellectuals by funding all political flavors: those on theright, in order to promote American global interests; and those on the left, towean socialist-leaning Americans away from Communism and toward an acceptance of“the American way.”9 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos694932] Thisalso happened in the world of academia, which several studies have amplyexposed.10 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos695163]The CIA’s management of information is deft. Naturally, one cannot control alljournalists, professors, and independent researchers. However, one can createchokepoints of information guarded by leading figures. If some maverickpublishes something dangerous, the appropriate CIA proxy at the Los AngelesTimes or Harvard University makes sure to attack it, and if necessary ridiculeit. It is always the nail that sticks out that gets hammered.More typically, unwelcome stories were blocked from going national. Throughoutthe 20th century, the wire services, collaborating with the CIA, simplyneglected to carry them. Today, in the 21st century, this happens to be one areain which there is potential to turn the tables. Now, local stories can be spreadfar and wide via the Web. In the future, this may prove to be a problem for thesecret-keepers.So far, however, a preponderance of power remains on the other side of thefence. In fact, the revolving doors connecting academia, journalism, and thenational security community are openly acknowledged. An abundance ofintellectuals actively court the national security world. Why not, when theconnections, prestige, and paychecks are so compelling?As it happens, most UFO debunkers have been connected with the national securitycommunity. In this regard, Donald Menzel has already been discussed, but duringthe 1960s, a successor to Menzel was in the wings: Philip J. Klass.11[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos695686] Klass was no scientist likeMenzel, but he was the Senior Avionics editor for the prestigious defensepublication, Aviation Week and Space Technology. For more than three decades,Klass used any and all means to throw cold water over the idea of UFOs. Someexplanations were astronomical, even to describe large objects that were trackedon radar. Some he quickly labeled as hoaxes, such as a 1964 landing casewitnessed by a terrified police officer, in which ground traces werephotographed and studied. Other explanations were more creative, such as “balllightning” to describe an enormous structured craft hovering at treetop level.When these failed to impress, Klass plied the trade of the propagandist, oftenvia ridicule, invective, and furious letter-writing campaigns to smearreputations.Throughout his career, Klass was under widespread suspicion—not proven as ofthis writing—of being an intelligence community asset. That he lived in theWashington, D.C. area, had consistent and exceptional access to the mainstreamU.S. media, and worked within the defense community made such suspicionunderstandable.People such as Menzel, Klass, and their successors have been important as vocal,media-savvy debunkers who seem independent, but are actually tied to the defenseand intelligence community. Their work sets the tone for the mainstream media,which generally follows along happily.Denial and Ridicule in Service to the StateToday, most professors and journalists—who have nothing to do with the nationalsecurity state—have internalized the sanctioned opinions. They have learned todiscuss UFOs the way a weary parent chastises a child for reading too many comicbooks. These things are not real. If you speak about them too much or tooopenly, people may think there is something wrong with you.That is one reason why the cover-up has stood for so long. Had we followed ourown glasnost policy from the beginning, the UFO argument would be over. Peoplewould have discussed this problem in the editorial pages, on the nightly news,and over hot dogs at their children’s ball games. They would have concluded thatsomething was there. Except that the architects of the cover-up stumbled uponthe twin concepts that enabled them to hide the truth from the people they weresworn to protect. Two pillars, each one lending strength to the other in serviceof the common goal.[images/00022.jpg]Denying the witnesses. People who saw “flying saucers” were often marginalizedand ridiculed. One of the two famous McMinnville Photos from May 1950, stronglybelieved to be authentic. Photo by Paul Trent.Denial and RidiculeOfficial denial works. When a general or leading scientist explains there is nofire, that the smoke is an illusion, our natural instinct is to believe—despitewhat the crazy neighbor thinks, sometimes despite the evidence from our owneyes. We want to believe our authority figures.Ridicule gives denial its power. When official statements are made, language isof the utmost importance. It is easier to smirk at a “flying saucer” than an“unidentified flying object” or “unknown aerial phenomenon.” It is easier todismiss alien intelligence when it is characterized as “little green men”instead of “extraterrestrial biological entities.” Alien agendas can bedismissed when boiled down to science-fiction scenarios in which the occupantsland on the White House lawn and declare “take me to your leader.” Even theapparent widespread abduction of innocents has become the subject of ridicule oncomedy shows. Even today, questions about the subject are often presentedsimplistically, often with a derisive sneer: “Do you believe in flying saucerspiloted by little green men?” Imagine saying yes to that question.No one wants their reputation smeared. Such false and misleading framings of thequestion quickly convinced the world’s academic and journalistic institutions torun far and fast from the UFO subject. Indeed, in this dance of disinformation,it is sometimes hard to tell whether these institutions lead or follow. Cravingpublic acceptance of their knowledge and authority, very few scientists,professors, or journalists can afford to show interest in the topic. As aresult, the secret keeps itself, with only occasional government intervention.We live in a world in which more than half of us believe that UFOs are realvehicles not of this Earth. Yet, official denial and ridicule continue to rulethe day. This may be the greatest cognitive dissonance that any society has evermaintained about something so important.On November 7, 2006, for 15 minutes during the afternoon rush hour at Chicago’sO’Hare airport, a disc-shaped object hovered silently near the United Airlinesterminal, then cut a sharp circular pattern in the cloud bank while zooming off.A pilot announced the sighting over radio for all grounded planes; a United taximechanic moving a Boeing 777 heard the radio chatter and looked up; pilotswaiting to take off leaned out their windows and saw the object. There was abuzz inside the airport among United Airlines personnel. One management employeereceived a radio call about the hovering object, and ran outside to see it. Hethen called the United operations center, made sure the FAA was contacted, anddrove out on the concourse to speak directly with witnesses.12[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos696098]United Airlines took statements from the witnesses and instructed them not todiscuss the matter further. But one did, and the account soon reached ChicagoTribune reporter John Hilkovitch. Soon, the O’Hare UFO story became the mostwidely read news item in the history of the Tribune’s website.The FAA and United Airlines initially denied any knowledge of the incident. Thatis, until it became obvious that they knew all about it. Investigating the casewas not easy. Journalist Leslie Kean found that most of the witnesses chose toremain anonymous, citing fears of job security. When a recording was finallyreleased of a supervisor’s call to the air traffic control tower, Kean listened.She heard the tower operator and a second man laughing at the witness on theother end. The operator asked the witness if she had been celebrating theholidays early. Such an attitude forced the witness to waste valuable time,stating to another operator in a later call, “I’m not high and I’m notdrinking.”The devastating effectiveness of denial and ridicule cannot be overstated. Afteryears and generations, their effects have fully pervaded our culture. They haveenabled intellectual bullies to roam free, to intimidate people who know whatthey have seen, and keep the truth covered.Yet, there has always been a fight to end UFO secrecy. During each decadefollowing the Second World War, there have been attempts to unlock the door.Each time, however, there were counter-measures that minimized any gains ordefeated the attempt altogether.In 1953, a classified CIA study known as the Robertson Panel recommended thatthe intelligence community tightly control UFO-related information reaching thepublic. This meant not only monitoring the newly formed civilian-based UFOresearch groups, but using its relationships with media giants (such as WaltDisney Corporation) to debunk UFOs.Direct evidence has been found to show that, more than a decade later, thePanel’s directives were still being followed through. A 1966 letter by formerPanel member Thornton Page addressed to the former Secretary, Frederick C.Durant, stated that Page had helped organize a recent “CBS TV show around theRobertson Panel conclusions.” This was a reference to the CBS television showUFOs: Friend, Foe, or Fantasy? narrated by Walter Cronkite, which had taken astridently debunking tone toward UFOs.13[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos696310]The debunking tactic worked up to a point, but never completely. One reason wassimply because the UFO operators, whoever they were, did not seem to get thememo that they did not exist. UFO reports within the United States spiked upwardduring the mid-1960s, even receiving Congressional attention. Something had tobe done.In late 1966, the U.S. Air Force commissioned the University of Colorado toconduct an independent, scientific study of the phenomenon. This became known asthe Condon Committee, after the project leader, Dr. Edward U. Condon. From thebeginning, the project was plagued by dissension. It wasn’t because Condon wasan arch-skeptic on the matter, but that his attitude toward investigating UFOswas anything but scientific. His statements were limited to jokes and obviouscrackpot cases. Even skeptics who had taken the time to look into the matterknew there was much more than this.It became evident to some members that the project was rigged. Condon evenadmitted as much privately to Dr. David Saunders, one of the project scientists.If he were to receive information confirming UFOs as extraterrestrial, Condonsaid, he would withhold it from the public and take it personally to thepresident.What drove project scientists to mutiny, however, was the discovery of a hiddenmemo written by Condon’s number-two man, Robert Low. “The trick would be todescribe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objectivestudy,” wrote Low, “but to the scientific community would present the image of agroup of nonbelievers trying their best to be objective but having an almostzero expectation of finding a saucer.”14[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos696514]When the project scientists discovered this memo, they complained en masse toCondon. He then summarily fired them. Incidentally, Robert Low had been a combatintelligence officer during the Second World War. He also appears to have been aCIA operative who performed clandestine missions for the Agency during the late1940s. The pervasive relationship between the CIA and academia appears to haveplayed an important role in this project.15[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos696736]By the time the Condon Report was completed in late 1968, it had been cobbledtogether by a replacement team of scientists. Despite Condon’s and Low’sskeptical lead, the report failed to explain roughly 30 percent of its cases.Condon was barely interested, however. His conclusion, which is all themainstream press cared about, stated that UFOs were of “no probative value.” Inother words, further study of them was unlikely to lead to greater scientificknowledge. He recommended that the Air Force close Project Blue Book, itsofficial investigative project regarding UFOs.Now that the Condon Report had dismissed UFOs, there was ample scientificjustification for ignoring the topic altogether, and ample reason for politicaland military authorities to deny any interest in it.But the struggle against UFO secrecy did not end. During the 1970s and 1980s,thousands of pages of government documents relating to UFOs were released viathe Freedom of Information Act. Many of these documents proved that thephenomenon was being monitored by military agencies, and that they were veryconcerned. Some of these documents were embarrassing to agencies which had longdenied that they had anything to do with UFOs. Once again, it seemed as thoughthat secrecy surrounding UFOs was in danger.Then came the Roswell story, adding fuel to the fire. The story had been buriedfor more than three decades. But it was rediscovered during the late 1970s, andbrought a new dimension to the idea of a government cover-up. After all, if analien craft had been recovered by military authorities, this takes the cover-upto new levels. It would mean that the government could not merely be accused ofincompetence in investigating the mystery of UFOs (which many had argued).Because now it would be in possession of alien technology and probably evenbodies. For a few years, the momentum seemed to favor those seeking to end UFOsecrecy. The Great Wall appeared to be cracking.By the early 1980s, however, two things stopped this momentum. One was a 1982Presidential Executive Order signed by President Ronald Reagan. No longer werefederal agencies obligated to provide fast and affordable searches forcitizens—a serious blow to the Freedom of Information Act. The process becameslow and expensive. Certain agencies, such as North American Air Defense(NORAD), were exempted from FOIA. The NSA and CIA also became all-but-imperviousto UFO-related requests.The other development was the influence of military-intelligence elements withinthe UFO research field. In 1983, and again in late 1984, Air Force intelligenceofficers operating out of Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico,quietly leaked documents to researchers that described the recovery of crashedUFOs and alien bodies. This included the MJ-12 documents. Whatever the actualtruth contained within them, researchers have been distracted by the debate overtheir authenticity. Are they genuine? A hoax? Some incarnation of both?16[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos696980]But then came another attack against secrecy, one that remains important to thisday. That is the development of the Internet from around 1990 onward. As late asthe 1980s, very few people foresaw the dramatic changes that would soon come.From the beginning, the UFO subject was a prominent part of the Internet. Manyresearchers found their voice by speaking to thousands—and then millions—ofpeople via cyberspace.Taking its lead from the Internet, television programming soon offered moresophisticated portrayals of UFOs. Several shows during the 1990s, most notablySightings, The X-Files, and Dark Skies suggested a darker, grittier side to thestory than had been offered in previous television fare. In the process, UFOsand gray aliens entered popular culture. Although watching fictionalized storiesis not a cover-up ending activity by itself, it does expand the dialogue aboutthe topic and promotes a desire for the facts. The more that people discussthis, the more they realize that UFOs may actually be real.Of course, pop culture immersion is a double-edged sword. Public awareness maybe raised, but so is the threat of contamination. For instance, the very successof The X-Files in one sense worked against public acceptance of the UFO-ETreality. It became typical to dismiss UFO believers for watching too manyepisodes of Mulder and Scully. To this day, mocking news stories about UFOs leadwith the ubiquitous X-Files musical theme.There is a wide rift between popular belief and “official truth” on this matter.Major media corporations, which have drastically consolidated in recent decades,still control most newspapers, radio, and television. In these venues, withoccasional exceptions, UFOs continue to be ignored or ridiculed.But the Web is another matter. For the most part, it continues to serve as atrue voice of the people. It contains a massive trove of UFO information. Someof it is unreliable or just plain wrong, but some of it is excellent andsophisticated. The battle over UFO secrecy, and over information in general, isnow on the Web, where major media continues its efforts to increase its share oftraffic, and governments continue their efforts to restrict websites in theinterest of “national security” or “public safety.”Such has been a short history of the struggle against UFO secrecy. Whether ornot that secrecy was originally justified is a matter of debate. The answer canonly come from what is known about the UFO reality and the intentions of theOthers. Still, it is reasonable to concede the initial necessity. However,secrecy eventually became policy, buried deeper and deeper, boxes within boxeswithin boxes.During the 1950s and 1960s, Ohio State University astronomer J. Allen Hynekserved as the lead scientific consultant to the Air Force’s Project Blue Book.Hynek was a team player, publicly debunking many cases for his employer, even atthe cost of his personal reputation. In 1966, he speculated that UFO sightingsin the state of Michigan might only be marsh gas caused by decaying vegetablematter in the swampy areas. In other words, “swamp gas.” In his later years,Hynek took a more favorable public attitude toward the UFO mystery, and duringthe 1970s and 1980s was widely held to be the “Dean” of ufologists. Still, hemaintained close relationships with the U.S. Air Force throughout his life.Hynek died of brain cancer in April 1986. The year before, wracked by thephysical pain of the disease that was destroying him, he had a tumor removedfrom his brain. In the recovery room as the anesthesia began to wear off, histhoughts were elsewhere, his pain more emotional than physical. In a frailvoice, he was overheard by his wife Mimi asking a question that had nagged athim for decades. “Why can’t they tell me?” he asked. “Even now?”By the time Hynek passed away, the “they” that would not level with him were nolonger exclusively within the United States, nor were they all taking ordersfrom a military chain-of-command. In the same way that the UFO phenomenon isworldwide, the concealment of this explosive information had moved beyond theU.S. governmental structure.Let us now examine this element of the cover-up, widening our sweep while goingdeeper at the same time.An International Cover-UpThrough the years, and with increasing speed, other nations have made publicstatements about UFOs and released their own data. The nations of France, theUnited Kingdom, Belgium, Norway, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, and many others,have either made important statements about UFOs, or released sightinginformation that is available for anyone to examine.Britain, France, Brazil, Sweden, and New Zealand, for instance, have releasedthousands of pages of UFO reports. Even if some of these were for purelybureaucratic reasons (for example, to relieve government agencies from theburden of answering individual requests from citizens), there is no questionthat their data will be studied by many researchers for some time.There is also the fact that key leaders of several nations have made statementsabout baffling UFO cases. This has happened in Belgium, Mexico, Brazil, Canada,Russia, Spain, Japan, Zimbabwe, South Africa, the United States, and elsewhere.Each time, however, the spokesperson has stopped short of admitting that UFOsrepresent something truly alien (unless giving a private opinion, which hashappened many times).Some official statements have come close, though. Case in point: the 1999 FrenchCOMETA Report. This was a government-sponsored study of UFO data that made thestartling admission that UFOs strongly appeared to belong to an alienintelligence. Yet, the report was not considered an official statement of theFrench government, and became an orphan. It generated no public policies. Nomajor political figure followed up.17[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos697315]So, yes, there have been “disclosures” of varying types. But these are notDisclosure.When we zoom out from merely a U.S. perspective to a global one, we can see thatan international UFO phenomenon needs a coordinated international cover-up. Itmay seem difficult enough to control and manage this story within a singlecountry, but it feels impossible to do so on a global level. Yet, this is whathas happened.A good analogy of how this international cooperation might work can be seen inthe program known as Echelon. Echelon is a global intelligence operationinvolving, at the least, the National Security Agency (NSA) of the UnitedStates, in cooperation with the NSA-equivalents of the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia, and New Zealand. Only Australia has admitted its participation, andAmerica’s NSA refuses even to answer inquiries from Congress about itsactivities.The program involves a comprehensive electronic sweeping and sharing ofinformation among its members. This includes all forms of electroniccommunication, most notably e-mails, text messages, and telephone voicecommunications. Anyone, anywhere, can be monitored by Echelon.Echelon’s significance in relation to the UFO cover-up is two-fold: it appearsto be independent of national laws, and the American NSA holds the rank of firstamong equals.In the same way that the Manhattan Project clarifies how Roswell could be sweptunder the rug, Echelon helps us understand how Majestic can operate successfullyand maintain anonymity, even while controlling a global team of secret-keepers.In both cases, there is precedent from similar projects that have managed topull off their own missions.Paint It BlackThe secrecy of the UFO reality has been matched only by the money that has goneinto it. The decades-worth of moves and countermoves with an otherworldlyintelligence have cost a great deal of money just to build the infrastructureand coordinate manpower.Asking Congress to fund such a program is not an option. By its nature, theUFO/ET issue created an “end run” around the traditional American constitutionalgovernance, for even elected representatives could not be trusted to maintainsecrecy over such an awesome reality. As the secret-keepers saw it, fundingneeded to be covert, and even included such illegal non-governmental sources asdrugs and guns. Think of such publicly known scandals as the Iran-Contra scandalof the 1980s, then multiply.Still, public tax dollars also pay for such activities. The funds come from theblack budget—that is, classified federal spending, much of which is hidden fromCongress. The black budget has evolved throughout the years into a system ofSpecial Access Programs (SAP). From these have grown “unacknowledged” and“waived” SAPs. Publicly, these “do not exist”—except that they do. Better knownas deep black programs, a 1997 U.S. Senate report described them as “sosensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting requirements to theCongress.” Persons involved in them were ordered to deny that their programexisted, even to superior officers. Saying “no comment” was not good enough.Physical security for the program normally included “elaborate and expensivecover, concealment, deception, and operational security plans.”18[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos697763] Such is a glimpse of thecomplex, compartmented, Byzantine system of Pentagon spending and secrecy.We are talking about huge amounts of unaccounted-for money. During the last twodecades, several Congressional inquiries have noted that many billions ofdollars have gone missing from the federal system; some have even put the figureinto the trillions of dollars. In 1994, a law was passed requiring the federalgovernment to account for its money in a business-like way. As a result, severalreports described the loss of gargantuan sums of money. The most perplexing ofthese claims came from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on July 16, 2001,when he spoke to the House Appropriations Committee regarding the Pentagon’sFiscal Year 2002 budget and stated, “The financial systems of the department areso snarled up that we can’t account for some $2.6 trillion in transactions thatexist, if that’s believable.”19[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos697989]The amount of $2.6 trillion seems incomprehensible, especially when the Pentagonhad an annual budget of about one-eighth that amount. Lest one believe this wasa simple mistake, members of Congress discussed the amount, and the Pentagon’saccounting office later amended it to $2.3 trillion. The number was clearlyoffered as legitimate. Secretary Rumsfeld could make such a statement because itwas part of the fiscal mess he inherited from the Clinton administration. Itshould be noted, incidentally, that the amount of $2.3 trillion reflectedaccounting discrepancies, not necessarily “missing money.” In later months, agood portion of the discrepancy is said to have been resolved. Even after that,however, many hundreds of billions of dollars were apparently gone.20[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos698543]How is it possible to lose track of so much money? How long had this problembeen developing? Although answers are not forthcoming, others have occasionallyasked.One person was aviation journalist Bill Sweetman. In one of the few publicinvestigations of Special Access Programs, Sweetman estimated there were roughly150 SAPs within the Pentagon at the close of 1999, many of them unacknowledged.They often had independent systems of classification, with total controlexercised by the program manager. Most interesting, he concluded that most SAPswere dominated not by Defense personnel, but private contractors. He had no ideahow these programs were funded.21[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos699359]The sprawling secrecy apparatus was discussed again in 2010 by Washington Postjournalists Dana Priest and William Arkin. After a two-year investigation, theyconcluded that America’s classified world “has become so large, so unwieldy andso secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people itemploys, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do thesame work.”22 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos699667]This structure applies to UFO secrecy. Considering the obvious importance of theUFO phenomenon and the need for a secret infrastructure to deal with it, adetached analyst can assume that there are several UFO-related black budgetprograms, and that some of the lost money has gone into funding them.Follow the WreckageThe U.S. has a history of government agencies existing in secret for longperiods. The National Security Agency was founded in 1952, its existence hiddenfrom all but a handful of Congressmen and Senators until the mid-1960s. Eventoday, little is known about the actual activities of the NSA. More secretivestill is the National Reconnaissance Office, ostensibly charged with monitoringAmerica’s network of spy satellites. Founded in 1960, the NRO remainedcompletely secret from the American public for 30 years.Secrecy develops its own raison d’etre. For it breeds not only power, butprivate gain, and it appears that much of the UFO secret went private. Considerthe scenario of a crashed disc recovery, like the Roswell incident. An exoticobject goes down, the U.S. military arrives on the scene, keeps the civiliansaway, collects all material and bodies, sanitizes the area, and transportseverything to relevant facilities, whether these be at Wright-Patterson AirForce Base, Los Alamos National Laboratories, or Nevada’s Area 51.Once the bodies and materials have been transported, then what? Clearly, theywould need to be studied. While the branches of the U.S. military employ manybrilliant minds, the fact remains: if the military wanted unfamiliar orextraterrestrial technology studied and replicated, then private contractorswould be the answer. That is where most of the talent works and cutting-edgeknowledge exists. When something needs to be built, one turns to GeneralElectric, Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, SAIC, E-Systems, Hughes,Raytheon, Bell Laboratories, Bechtel, and other companies that could incorporateexotic technologies into new weapons and applications.Through time, this would require giving up some amount of “ownership” of thetechnologies to the corporations. This is not such a bad option for themilitary. In the first place, generals and admirals know that once they retire,their best financial outlook will come from employment with some defensecontractor. Privatizing the UFO secret also helps with secrecy. It means thatall the secrets concerning UFOs and related technologies become not merelyclassified but proprietary. As such, they become even more impervious to publicscrutiny. Responsible military and government officials could now say in allhonesty that there are no known U.S. agencies charged with managing the UFOsituation. Plausible deniability is critical.Several sources from the covert world support the argument that control over theUFO secret has gravitated to the private world. One well-placed individual, withupper level connections to the CIA, told the authors that early in the 1980s, ifnot before, “the [UFO] program was transmogrified and became private, just asmany, many other projects become private.” Another source, equally well placed,said that enormous sums had been spent on a deep black program to studyextraterrestrial technology, providing the interesting fact that security forthe program was seven to eight times more expensive than the science. The sourceheld a strong opinion that private contractors had taken the lead role in thesecrecy structure. Two other insiders with high-quality credentials also arrivedat this judgment.23 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos700106]In this vein, the story of Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson is revealing. Duringthe late 1990s, Wilson was Chief of Intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,a position known as J-2. In 1997, UFO researcher Dr. Steven Greer and Apollo 14astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell obtained an audience with Wilson. The two expressedtheir concern about the “rogue” nature of certain Special Access Programsconnected to the study of alien technology; that is, their concern regardingthese programs were dominated not by government personnel, but by privatecontractors, possibly as runaway programs beyond formal government control.According to statements later made by Greer and Mitchell, as well as anothercorroborated source, Wilson did look into the matter.24[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos700267] After two months, Wilsonfound that the claims were true. When he was finally able to meet with arepresentative of the SAP (not the program manager but its attorney), theAdmiral was told that he lacked a need to know about it. Indeed, the only reasonhe was even granted a meeting was to determine how he learned about the program.But saying that the UFO secret has been privatized is not completely right,either. We are talking about a quasi-public, quasi-private matter, like parentswith joint custody of a child. Indeed, the U.S. military and intelligencecommunity serves as the ideal shield behind which this private-public entityoperates. The team-up makes the entire organization more impervious to publicrequests for information. And the continuing connection to the black budgetfeeds it with intelligence and resources that exist because of America’s globalmilitary footprint.Through time, however, the U.S. government lost a great deal of control over thesecret, and even lost track of what it knew. A cloak of confusion descended overthis important and life-altering matter.When outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower warned the nation in 1961 of thegrowing influence of “the military-industrial complex,” he might well have hadthe UFO situation in mind. He certainly saw the future.Presidents and UFOsThere is much evidence that past U.S. presidents have been interested in UFOs,and there is some that they failed to learn all they wanted to know.Given that Truman did know and probably formed Majestic, and that Eisenhowerprobably received a briefing upon entering office, it appears that these twopresidents had some level of knowledge and control over the issue.There are rumors about President John F. Kennedy, of how he told Marilyn Monroe,and of how his own intentions toward Disclosure ultimately may have gotten himkilled. President Lyndon Johnson is thought to have been disinterested and tohave passed the responsibility off to Vice President Hubert Humphrey. PresidentRichard Nixon is widely perceived to have had knowledge, and there is a storythat in February 1973, he took his close friend, the comedian Jackie Gleason, ona wild ride in Florida, showing him alien bodies at Homestead Air Force Base.25[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos700428]Long before he was a U.S. president, Gerald Ford was a powerful U.S.Congressman. In 1966, when UFO sightings in his Michigan district had peaked, hecalled for a Congressional investigation. “In the firm belief that the Americanpublic deserves a better explanation than that was thus far given by the AirForce, I strongly recommend that there be a committee investigation of the UFOphenomenon,” said the future president, adding, “I think we owe it to the peopleto establish credibility regarding UFOs, and to produce the greatest possibleenlightenment on the subject.” The result was the Condon Report, that masterfulmanipulation initiated by the U.S. Air Force, which debunked the phenomenon. Aspresident, Ford had nothing to say about UFOs, though in retirement he repliedto an inquiry from a UFO researcher. “During my public career in Congress, asvice president, and president, I made various requests for any information onUFOs. The official authorities always denied the UFO allegations. As a result, Ihave no information that may be helpful to you.”26[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos700731]Jimmy Carter saw a UFO when he was governor of Georgia and promised to open thefiles when he became president. “If I become president, I’ll make every piece ofinformation this country has about UFO sightings available to the public andscientists,” said the candidate. “I am convinced that UFOs exist because I haveseen one.” He tried for a year to get NASA to accept UFO reports, but gave up.This much is part of the public record.The actress Shirley MacLaine, who was close friends with several U.S.presidents, stated in a 1995 appearance on the Larry King Show that, “[PresidentJimmy Carter] told me many times…that it was true, that there were crafts, thathe believed there were occupants.”27[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos701104]There is also a story told to the authors by a high-level intelligence officialabout a UFO briefing President Carter received in June 1977. It was unknown tothe source what specifics were discussed, only that when the president was seenin his office, he was sobbing, with his head in his hands, deeply upset.28[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos701571] If it is true, then Cartergot the briefing he wanted, but did not like what he heard. Moreover, he wasinfluenced never to mention the subject again.Ronald Reagan not only saw a UFO while Governor of California, but had his pilotchase after it. He told several people, including members of the press, until herealized the story would undermine his credibility. At that point, he backpeddled. Years later, as president, he mused more openly. On several occasionsduring his presidency, Reagan discussed the scenario of how an alien invasionwould unite humanity. Addressing the United Nations on September 21, 1987, hestated, “I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanishif we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.29[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos701727]Reagan is also alleged to have told filmmaker Steven Spielberg at the E.T.: TheExtra-Terrestrial White House screening, “You know, there aren’t six people inthis room who know how true this really is.”30[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos702025]George H.W. Bush, a man with longtime connections to the world of intelligence,and who had directed the CIA for a year under President Ford, is believed tohave known much about UFOs. While campaigning for president in 1988, he wascornered by a UFO researcher named Charles Huffer, to whom he said, “I knowsome. I know a fair amount.” As president, Bush was tight-lipped about thesubject, although there are sources who allege that there were high leveldiscussions on a possible UFO Disclosure in 1990, which was canceled followingthe abortive coup in the Soviet Union that summer.31[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos702190]Shortly after he became President, Bill Clinton instructed his friend WebsterHubbell, whom he had named Associate Attorney General, to investigate and reportback to him on two things. “First,” asked Clinton, “who killed JFK? Second, areUFOs real?” According to Hubbell, he found no answers, although it must be saidthat Hubbell’s tenure in office was brief, and he did not seem to have searchedvery diligently.32 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos702357]One source of the authors, a man who has worked extensively within the nationalsecurity establishment for many years, met with Bill Clinton at a socialgathering during the late 1990s. After a few moments of one-on-one time with thepresident, the man delicately raised the topic of UFOs. Clinton’s only commentwas, “There’s a lot there, and I wish I could do something about it.”George W. Bush built an administration which prided itself on secrecy, but it isquite possible that he was never fully briefed on this subject. At least, thisis according to a senior intelligence official speaking on the condition ofanonymity to the authors. It is, however, a reasonable speculation that his vicepresident, Dick Cheney, did have the clearance. Early in the Bushadministration, the vice president appeared as a guest on the Diane Rehm PBSradio program. Grant Cameron, a Canadian UFO researcher specializing inpresidential policy, was lucky to be the first caller. Cameron asked Cheneywhether he had ever been briefed about UFOs while in the government. Cheneyreplied, “Well, if I had been briefed on it, I’m sure it was probably classifiedand I couldn’t talk about it.”33[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos702549]President Barack Obama has avoided discussing the topic in public, at least notin a way to give it any credibility. When asked about the subject during the2008 presidential campaign—having just seen his rival Congressman DennisKucinich savaged for admitting to his own UFO sighting—Obama deflected withhumor: “I don’t know, and I don’t presume to know. What I know is there is lifehere on Earth, and that we’re not attending to life here on Earth. We’re nottaking care of kids….we’re not taking care of senior citizens…. As presidentthose are the people I will be attending to first. [audience laughter] There maybe some other folks on the way…. [more laughter].”Some individuals made well-publicized claims that Obama would be the “DisclosurePresident.” Specific predictions (forever the bane of the alternative researchcommunity) were offered repeatedly for such Disclosure announcements, which ofcourse never occurred. The predictions were based on alleged inside sources thatclearly existed only in the realm of fantasy. If any further evidence wererequired to throw cold water on the notion of Obama as the Disclosure President,the White House statement of November 4, 2011 more, than suffices. This was inresponse to the “Disclosure Petition” organized by Stephen Bassett’sorganization, Paradigm Research Group, asking the Obama Administration toacknowledge an extraterrestrial presence on Earth. The reply was only grantedbecause more than 17,000 signatures were attached to the petition. Yet, alow-level functionary drafted the reply that there is no credible UFO evidence,nor any to suggest a cover-up.34[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos703063] Whether or not Obama wasever briefed is not certain, although unverified sources told the authors thathe had been briefed on the basics of the situation, but has no authority overthe program.Despite the importance of the subject, it is not clear that all U.S. presidentsare briefed on it. Knowing details of black budget programs has become aliability. Moreover, presidents are transitory players on the national and worldstage. They come and go. From the perspective of lifelong program managers, theycannot be trusted to deal with the issue in a secure manner during their term,nor after they leave office.Who Is Really in Charge?If the UFO secret is real, someone or some group is in charge and doing anacceptable job at keeping it quiet.During the 1950s, American sociologist C. Wright Mills described a “power elite”in the United States comprised of corporate, military, and government elements.It was a radical analysis at the time. But Mills was onto something. Today, wecan see that corporations—or more accurately, transnational corporations—havegained a dominant role in this relationship.Right or wrong, globalization is the reality of today’s world. By the late1980s, it created new opportunities for corporate visionaries, primarily byaccess to cheap labor. The goal became to create an international legalstructure to facilitate this process. There have been many facets of thistransformation. One was the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), others included strengthening the International Monetary Fund (IMF),World Trade Organization (WTO), and World Bank, all of which promoteprivatization of natural resources and have often been accused of underminingnational laws regarding health, food safety, and the environment.It was a silent revolution. Until the 2011 “Occupy Wall Street” demonstrationsin Manhattan, followed by similar “Occupy” demonstrations elsewhere, thequestion of who is in charge had not been up for much public discussion. Yet, anew global structure of power has been created that heavily influences, evendominates, nation states. Old-fashioned national sovereignty has become a quaintrelic, like an old portrait of a forgotten family member, fading to yellow in aworn-out frame.It is natural that these same private interests would eventually take charge ofthe UFO secret as well, albeit through the auspices of the U.S. government andmilitary. The money is certainly there with which to do it.35[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos703255]Worlds Within WorldsBy now, the classified world has moved far beyond the reach of the public world,and far beyond in its power and capabilities. This has great implications forUFO secrecy.Consider the story of a former NSA scientist who spoke with the authors.According to this individual, the NSA was operating computers during themid-1960s with a processing clockspeed of roughly 650 megahertz (MHZ).36[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos703846] To put that in perspective,it took 35 years for personal computers in the consumer market to reach thatspeed. Indeed, in 1965 there were no personal computers at all. Immediately, thenear-fatal Apollo 13 mission in 1971 comes to mind, with its reliance onslide-rulers by mission specialists to guide the damaged NASA spacecraft back toEarth. When presented with this image, the NSA scientist shrugged and statedthat secret computational capabilities were too important to share with NASA.So, in computing, the National Security Agency was an amazing 35 years ahead ofthe rest of the world. This leads one to wonder not only what its computationalcapabilities are today, but what might be the capabilities of an organizationcharged with managing the UFO secret (in which the NSA is almost certainlyinvolved). With a head start in studying exotic properties from materialsobtained, say, at Roswell in 1947, is it not likely that some scientist wouldhave a Eureka! moment at some point? Perhaps he might not be able to duplicateall the features of the object under study, but could important improvements bedeveloped toward such things as better integrated circuits, high tensile fibers,laser technology, and fiber optics? Naturally, such claims have been made—anddenied—for years. But there is a logic to them.Here is where it becomes interesting. For sure, there would be a great profitmotive at work. One would assume that there would be spin-off productsintroduced at great commercial value as a useful money-making venture. Idealground-floor business opportunities.But what if some of the innovations derived from such exotic technologies wereso advanced, so radical, that their very existence was deemed to be toosensitive to share with the rest of the world? What if, for instance, a truebreakthrough was made with propulsion technology, and the black-world scientistsproduced some form of field propulsion—in other words, anti-gravity? Or biotechbreakthroughs such as super-longevity? Such developments would transform theworld (which we will return to).If the clandestine world did invent a “flying saucer” of sorts, as an example,something that operated on principles of gravity-negation, why would the U.S.military refrain from using it during warfare? Surely, such a technology wouldbe of immense value in fighting the wars that have severely strained the U.S.economy, to say nothing of the immense damage caused to Iraq, Afghanistan,Libya, and elsewhere during the past decade as a result of military actions.Would it not be logical, sane, and even humane to employ such technology to endwarfare in a region that is being destroyed by it?Cynics would state that the prospect of never-ending warfare is desirable tocertain groups that influence U.S. policy. True, but there is another reason toconsider. Within the history of U.S. military technology, we have examples ofthe military withholding the use of its best weapons because their existence wasclassified.One of the better-known examples of this was the U.S. air strike against Libyain 1986. The raid employed F-111 fighter aircraft. Left out of the mission,however, was the F-117A Nighthawk, better known as the stealth fighter. It hadbeen operational since 1983, but was still classified in 1986. In a form oflogic both perverse and rational, the F-117A was so radically advanced thatkeeping it secret was more important than using it for this military mission. Asit turned out, the strike on Libya failed to achieve its main objective, whichwas the elimination of Libyan leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi. The stealth fighterwas reserved for a more important military engagement, which turned out to bethe U.S. invasion of Panama in late 1989.By applying this logic to the world of reverse-engineered UFO technology, onemight see how something even more exotic than the stealth fighter would bereserved for missions considered more important than mere geopoliticalstruggles. If, as may very well be the case, some form of flying saucer was“made in the U.S.A.,” what possible missions would it have?The answer is obvious: to deal with the beings responsible for the UFOphenomenon in the first place. Whether these beings are extraterrestrial,long-term transplants, home-grown, interdimensional, time travelers, orsomething even more fantastic, the technology used to develop man-made UFOs mustbe used specifically to deal with them. We will expand on this theme in Chapter4 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_011.html#filepos255385].And so, the years turned into decades, the world entered the 21st century, theU.S. military structure became dominated by private contractors, and the worldbecame a global village. Meanwhile, the secret-keepers of the UFO mystery becamemore fully international, and also became private to a large degree.Given the mixture of a treasure chest of government money, private connections,and an extraterrestrial secret, the likelihood exists that six decades laterthere is a clandestine group that possesses:> [images/00012.jpg] Technology that is vastly superior to that of the> “mainstream” world.> [images/00012.jpg] The ability to explore areas of our world and surroundings> presently unavailable to the rest of us.> [images/00012.jpg] Possible interactions or encounters with the Others who are> here in our reality.> [images/00012.jpg] Scientific and cosmological understandings that give them> greater insights into the nature of our world.> [images/00012.jpg] A significant “built-off-the-grid” infrastructure,> partially underground, that affords them a high degree of secrecy and> independence of action.This might well qualify them as a separate civilization—one that has broken awayfrom our own, in effect, a breakaway civilization. Still interacting with ourown, its members probably move back and forth between the official reality ofwhat we are supposed to believe, and the other reality which encompasses newtruths and challenges.When Disclosure finally comes in the future, it will reveal the existence of agroup that has pulled the strings on the UFO secret for years. It probably has aname, one that we are unaware of now, that will be exposed and become infamous.In this book, we refer to the leadership council and those men and women whoanswer to it as the Breakaway Group. Bolstered by tremendous co-opted assetsworldwide, they have gained independence from the established political andmilitary authorities. For it is likely that this Breakaway Group answers not somuch to the president of the United States as it does to private,internationally based individuals and groups. These have been the quiet leaksfrom the classified world which have reached both of the authors for years, andwhich have reached many other researchers of this topic.With the Breakaway Group in mind, one might be tempted to dismiss our formalgovernment as mere window dressing. That would be a mistake. The Breakaway Groupis able to exist in part because it draws from established, powerfulinstitutions of government, finance, and military authority. Nationalisticgovernments exist, and they are powerful, even if they are infiltrated andco-opted by the Breakaway Group and individuals who serve it. In fact, most ofthe people who work in these existing institutions have no knowledge of theirown manipulation.The point is that, despite their co-option, the world’s institutions still havea life of their own. In an A.D. world, they will still be engaged in the debate,held accountable for actions taken by their members, and will still be reactiveto their constituencies—sometimes with and sometimes without the direction ofthe Breakaway Group.Let us hope that those people in the Breakaway Group who are dealing with thepresence of the Others are doing so in a way that is responsible to humanity asa whole. For now, we have no way of knowing whether this is so, and no way ofholding them accountable to the people.Disclosure presents the opportunity for a structural change in how the worlddoes its business. The Breakaway Group fears the public blowback and loss ofpower from such an act of honesty, however, so they will maintain the secret aslong as possible. They will do this because once their existence is intuited,then acknowledged, and then scrutinized, their longstanding role aspuppet-masters may be coming to an end.Yet even the power-brokers of the Breakaway Group cannot control everything.Although they will never disclose of their own choice, circumstances are inplace that could force a decision, no matter how closed to the idea they mightbe today.A secret once thought necessary to save the world has taken a quiet toll on manylives. Now, in order to save the world, that secret must be dragged into thelight of day. Ready or not, here it comes.[images/00023.jpg]AIR FORCE VETERANS’ PETITION ON BEHALF OF CAPTAIN THOMAS MANTELL[images/00025.jpg]To: The President of the United StatesFrom: Veterans Supporting Recognition of Pilots Lost During ET ContactDate: July 1, 2023The following is a petition posthumously to award Air Force pilot Captain ThomasMantell the Congressional Medal of Honor for valor displayed in the line of dutywhile protecting his country on January 7, 1948.Thomas Mantell died on that day more than 70 years ago while attempting tointercept an unknown flying object. This object was reported to be large andround and descended over Kentucky, where it was seen by the commanding officerand others at Godman AFB, by state police, and various citizens. CaptainMantell, a veteran pilot, was scrambled to intercept, along with two otherfighter planes.Mantell climbed his jet aircraft to more than 22,000 feet, leaving the other twopilots behind, and apparently blacked out and crashed to his death.At the time, the Air Force gave the official explanation that Captain Mantellhad inadvertently chased the planet Venus. Although the planet was visible inthe sky, it was 5pm and the sun had not set. It is unlikely that Venus couldhave been that bright at that time so as to fool Mantell and the otherwitnesses. Three years later, the Navy disclosed that a secret, high altitudephotographic reconnaissance Skyhook balloon had been nearby at the time, andthat became the official explanation.But in 1985, the transcript of Captain Mantell’s transmission to Godman AFB wasdeclassified. His last words were: “It appears to be a metallicobject…tremendous in size…directly ahead and slightly above…I am trying to closefor a better look.”Even astronomer and Project Blue Book consultant J. Allen Hynek conceded longafter he blamed Mantell’s death on the planet Venus, “Sometimes, I stretched toofar.”Given the disclosure of the reality of an alien presence on Earth dating back toat least the 1940s, we, the undersigned, believe that Mantell’s last wordsshould be taken literally and that his honor be restored by awarding him hisposthumous Congressional Medal of Honor.Sincerely,Undersigned"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3Endgame: When the Impossible Becomes the Inevitable> > You may fool all the people some of the time;> > you can even fool some of the people all the time;> > but you can’t fool all of the people all the time.—Abraham LincolnChange can happen with breathtaking speed. Consider the fall of Communism. Formore than 70 years, the Soviet Union stood as a seemingly implacable enemy toAmerica and its allies, an enemy that defined the lives not only of its owncitizens, but those who lived in the “free world.” Then, like flashes oflightning, the Berlin Wall was down, the Soviet Republics were independent, andall of Eastern Europe was holding free elections. No one saw it coming.Complete change happened again on September 11, 2001. As that fateful day began,the world was as preoccupied and complacent as ever; by nightfall people went tobed frightened and focused.However, sometimes the change we expect keeps us waiting like a date that nevershows up. Disclosure of the UFO reality is like that. It is a truth obvious,clear, and absent from our public discourse.Indeed, UFO Disclosure comprises a neat paradox: it is impossible andinevitable.Twelve Angry InsidersFor years, the insiders managing UFO secrecy understood the problem.Disclosure is impossible. Secrecy is the immovable object. The powers-that-behave no incentive for revealing the truth about UFOs, so dramatic itstransformative power would be, so threatening to established interests. Surely,too, the years of official silence and cover-up might make people powerless toeffect change.Disclosure is inevitable. Truth is the irresistible force. Something this largecannot be held back forever. It is easier to stop a tsunami from reaching theshore.Let us imagine a situation that sparks a crisis, a “trigger” to action. It couldbe an event in which many credible witnesses record what appears to be a genuineUFO. It might be the unauthorized leak of sensitive data. It might be a surprisedetailed statement by a prominent figure about the UFO cover-up—something thatallows for fact-checking and verification. The event that triggers Disclosurewill probably involve multiple factors that will turn into an avalanche oftruth, rushing over everything in its path.As we have said, the decision to disclose the UFO reality will probably not bemade on Capitol Hill or even in the West Wing. The power center of thissecret—the Breakaway Group—will meet, maybe virtually, but probably in person.Although it may not be called Majestic-12, this UFO “Control Group” or “SilenceGroup” will come together and hash it out.The first thing on the agenda will be a review of the event itself—the eventthat is pushing Disclosure beyond its normal habitat of radio shows likeCoast-to-Coast AM and Discovery Channel specials. In this future turn of events,the growing momentum toward Disclosure will be discussed on the front pages andcovers of newspapers and magazines, and become the lead story on networknewscasts.The discussion begins. One of the Majestic members will argue that, as bleak asit looks, the group has weathered previous storms like this one. The Phoenixlights in 1997 came close. Someone else will mention the sighting overStephenville, Texas, in 2008, and the near-panic they felt as a result. Anothermember will note ruefully that, ever since Roswell, they have skated near theedge.They take an informal, anonymous straw poll, just to gain a sense of where theyare. Imagine their surprise when, after counting the votes, they find they aredeadlocked, six votes to disclose and six votes to stonewall. Every timeDisclosure came up in the past, the idea had been defeated soundly.Wishful Thinking?Since the beginning of the UFO cover-up, interested observers have expected animminent disclosure. In some of the earliest flying saucer books, U.S. MarineCorps Major (ret.) Donald Keyhoe predicted that the “Silence Group” could notkeep the lid on much longer. As far back as 1950, in his book The Flying SaucersAre Real, he wrote “the official explanation may be imminent.”[images/00027.jpg]Opening the floodgates. Six decades of secret contact means a massive amount ofsuppressed evidence. Image by Mastersfx.The feeling that Disclosure is imminent surfaces every few years, like Ahab’sWhite Whale. It appeared again during the mid-1960s, when there were so manyAmerican UFO reports that even Congress wondered what was going on. Then again,during the late 1970s, when the Freedom of Information Act provided a new weaponagainst secrecy, some activists thought it just might be possible to pry the lidopen. Even after the weakening of FOIA in the 1980s, researchers periodicallybelieved that leaks from sympathetic insiders would turn the tables.Some believe that Disclosure has been happening slowly over the years, via apolicy of public acclimation to the UFO reality. To some, it is an article offaith. Indeed, Keyhoe himself believed this. “If we were fully prepared,educated to this tremendous adventure,” he wrote, “it might come off withouttrouble.”1 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos704077]But if there is a public acclimation program in place, how would it beundertaken, and how would the public be prepared without causing panic?Lights, Camera…Disclosure!Some UFO researchers believe that the entertainment industry is part of theeffort to acclimate the public to accept the concept of alien life. Hollywood,it has been argued, has collaborated with the intelligence community to releasedisinformation, and at other times leak a few details to prepare people foreventual contact with non-human life.Certainly several 1950s movies look like CIA-sponsored attempts to deal withRoswell. Researcher Bruce Rux cited 1951’s The Thing from Another World,considered to be the first realistic flying saucer movie, which reflectedcertain elements of the crash and recovery at Roswell four years earlier. Thefilm’s maker, RKO, was up to its eyeballs in intelligence assets. It was ownedby billionaire defense contractor and test pilot Howard Hughes, plus it was asubsidiary of Time-Life, which was owned by CIA-connected Henry Luce. The moviealso captured the essence of the Top Secret government study, Project Twinkle,which was then classified.2 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos704262]Some of the other movies of the era look suggestive, also. Several key industryplayers had connections to military intelligence and later the CIA. Edmund H.North, the screenwriter of the 1951 UFO film, The Day the Earth Stood Still, hadworked in the Army Signal Corps during the Second World War. It would seem thatthe secret-keepers wanted to float some trial balloons before the public, andthat Hollywood producers were happy to oblige.If so, their message seems unclear. Although The Day the Earth Stood Stilldemonstrated alien tough-love, many other movies from this period wereinvasion-oriented. They included Earth Versus the Flying Saucers, Invasion ofthe Body Snatchers, and The War of the Worlds. Were these also examples of CIAinfluence? And were they the result of official policy, or some unauthorizedleak?If there is continued intelligence community influence amid the out-pouring ofET-related movies today, it is even harder to know what the message is.Consider the career of Steven Spielberg. When he developed Close Encounters ofthe Third Kind in 1977, some wondered if he was part of a government acclimationprogram. Spielberg has always denied this, saying that he simply believes inextraterrestrial life and knows a good story when he sees one. Although such adenial is to be expected, Spielberg’s choices in this genre support hisposition. His films have hardly been limited to a monochromatic meme aboutcontact, something one might expect if he were receiving inside information. Hisearly films, such as Close Encounters and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, bothportrayed the Others as benevolent scientists. His later treatments, however,showed no such optimism. Taken, his epic television series, depicted abductionsas the core UFO secret, The War of the Worlds presented Martian predators wipingout humanity, and his television series Falling Skies features the resistanceagainst an alien invasion of Earth. Spielberg has also been behind such diverseprojects as Men in Black, portraying Earth as a cosmic way-station, thehistorical fantasy Cowboys and Aliens, and Transformers, with its roboticthreat. The easiest explanation for this extraordinary diversity of treatment isthat Steven Spielberg, like other people, reads the literature.The same can be said for the rest of Hollywood. During the 1990s, TV series suchas The X-Files (“The Truth Is Out There”) and the historical conspiracy DarkSkies (“History Is a Lie”) portrayed the government as involved in a UFOcover-up and willing to go to almost any lengths, often extra-legal, to maintainthe secret. Both were subject to much speculation, usually either as a means toprepare the population, or else to provide disinformation.Yet, why would the covert elite authorize dramatic content highlighting theirown lies and deceit? If anything, Hollywood’s natural method of operation maywork in opposition to Disclosure. Its product is of such uneven quality, itsmessages so diverse, that any citizen hungering for its truth will receive onlyconfusion.If the Breakaway Group indeed had been using Hollywood as a means either toprepare the public for the eventual truth, or else to obfuscate and bury thetruth still deeper, the moment of Disclosure will have caught them off guard, asit will have caught everyone else.Points and Counter-PointsLet us imagine that the Breakaway Group has decided to break its deadlock byallowing one member from each side argue their respective positions.First up is the member who supports the status quo. His argument will boil downto three fundamental points.First, the public’s right-to-know is not an absolute, especially during wartime.Moreover, he adds, there is evidence that at least some of the Others arehostile, given the abduction and mutilation phenomena. National securityconcerns dictate that they maintain control as long as possible in order toreverse engineer hardware and develop defensive capabilities.Second, Disclosure will not stop with a simple acknowledgment of the presence ofthe Others. The world will be unable to grasp the complexity of this collectionof disparate intelligent life-forms. And the Others themselves (or some of them)may have a negative reaction that we will have brought on ourselves. Becausethey have not made their presence clear, why should we go first?Third, the results of telling the truth are unpredictable. The economy of theworld is based on the status quo. Disclosure will cause it to falter and maycreate another Great Depression. With national unity weakened and governmentsundermined by years of lies, they will not be able to mount an effectiveresponse.Public panic, he adds, is a real danger. It’s not impossible that 1938 canhappen all over again, he says gravely, only worse this time.This refers, of course, to that iconic moment in American history when, onHalloween night, radio listeners who changed stations during the popular Chaseand Sanborn Hour to avoid the singing of Nelson Eddy got the surprise of theirlives. They heard a frightened eyewitness in Grover’s Mill, New Jersey, statingthat large tube-like spacecraft were on the ground. People were riveted, theycalled their friends, and the audience grew. As it did, listeners were informedthat the human race was under attack by Martians. The aliens were massacringAmerican troops and marching in New York City, as other spacecraft were landingacross the United States.These terrified listeners had tuned in to Orson Welles’s Mercury Theatre of theAir. They were listening not to a news broadcast, but a radio play—an adaptationof The War of the Worlds, the book authored by H.G. Wells four decades earlier.Orson Welles told the drama as a news story based on breaking events because hewanted it to be realistic. It certainly was. But many people never heard thedisclaimer that the broadcast was a play. People heard the names of real placesand government officials and assumed the broadcast was “real.” In the streets,people were seen packing their prized possessions into their cars and speedingout to the countryside. Some became hysterical and others simply prayed andwaited to die.3 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos704529]The speaker might well add that panic was repeated several times. When The Warof the Worlds was rebroadcast in Chile in 1944, it caused riots. Five yearslater, it happened in Ecuador. As late as 1988, citizens of Portugal panicked.It is also possible he will add the comments of Winston Churchill, if adeclassified report from the British Ministry of Defence files can be believed.The story came from a scientist who said his grandfather was one of Churchill’sbodyguards during the Second World War. It had been passed down to his motherand then to him.According to the scientist, his grandfather was present during a meeting betweenChurchill and General Dwight Eisenhower when they discussed an intriguing UFOincident. This involved a Royal Air Force reconnaissance plane returning from amission that was approaching the eastern English coastline when it wasintercepted by a strange metallic object that matched the aircraft’s course andspeed for some time. Then it accelerated away and disappeared. Churchill appearsto have been more concerned about the social repercussions than the militaryimplications of such a device. He said the report should be immediatelyclassified because it would “create mass panic amongst the general populationand destroy one’s belief in the Church.”4[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos704922]No doubt some of the secrecy insiders know whether this story is true or not. Ifit is, it may be invoked to bolster their position.It takes two sides to make an argument, however. One member supportingDisclosure now stands.Facing his debate opponent, he states firmly, “First of all, the hype over theWells radio broadcast has been overblown for years.” Most people who listened indid not panic, and those who did lived in a much less sophisticated time.Besides, that broadcast was about an attack, accompanied by death rays anddestruction. If there is any attack going on today, it’s a silent one, andpublic reactions will be much more modulated.5[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos705294]Secondly, he continues, despite what you claim, the public does have a right toknow, no matter what the truth is, at least with the passage of sufficient timeand on issues that are large enough. We are talking about a planetary issue thathas to be dealt with by bringing in the talents and experience of the entirepopulation, not just an elite few.Moreover, he continues, the initial reason for the cover-up has long passed. TheCold War is over. We’ve had enough time to assess and prepare the public. Weknow a great deal about who the Others are and what they want. And the signspoint to the likelihood that the public will be able to assimilate thisinformation and deal with it.Finally, the world has too many problems to ignore this any longer. We canfinally unleash the technology that has been developed in secret throughout thepast seven decades for the betterment of humankind. Why not?Just before taking his seat, he recalls a statement made by the famous Swisspsychologist Dr. Carl Jung. During the 1950s, Jung had made a thorough study ofUFOs. Despite being portrayed by skeptics as dismissing UFOs as psychological inorigin, Jung believed there was something important to the phenomenon. A quicksearch on his tablet retrieved the quote he was thinking of:[images/00029.jpg]> What astonishes me most is that the American Air Force, despite all the> information in its possession and its so-called fear of creating panic, seems> to work systematically to do that very thing since it has never yet published> an authentic and certain account of the facts…this is the most unpsychological> and stupid policy one could invent. It is self-evident that the public ought> to be told the truth, because ultimately it will, nevertheless, come to> light.6 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos705654][images/00029.jpg]> “It will nevertheless come to light,” the pro-Disclosure advocate repeats and> takes his seat.The question on the minds of everyone at the table on this fateful day iswhether or not this is the moment when Jung can say “I told you so.”What It Will TakeWhat will it take to create a condition where all the secret keepers can do issimply to get it over with?Considering that seven decades of secrecy have given them no incentive forchanging the status quo, the answer can only be something so public and soundeniable that the decision has been taken out of their hands. Ex-officioDisclosure must be in progress, based on some event that is causing theexponential growth in the numbers of people who understand that UFOs are real.Under those conditions, the Breakaway Group’s only real choice will be to managethe revelation the best they can.That is the moment when the impossible act of Disclosure becomes inevitable. Notbecause the men and women managing the secret have decided to release it, butbecause they will have seen their own credibility plummet until their onlyoption is change. When that becomes the sole alternative, we will finally haveDisclosure, and a not a minute sooner.There are several avenues by which the truth will be placed so boldly in frontof us that we will have to pay attention. We have considered them carefully,talked to other researchers, and even consulted our potential readers throughprivate polling. Taking it all into consideration, we believe the road toDisclosure could begin with one of the following triggers which have been rankedfrom least likely to most likely. They are:> [images/00012.jpg] Photographic evidence.> [images/00012.jpg] Investigative journalism.> [images/00012.jpg] Whistleblowers and leaks.> [images/00012.jpg] Public confessions.> [images/00012.jpg] Physical evidence.> [images/00012.jpg] Foreign declassifications and public statements.> [images/00012.jpg] Political instability.> [images/00012.jpg] A heavily-documented mass sighting.> [images/00012.jpg] Finally, in a class of its own, a decision taken by the> Others themselves.Photographic EvidenceWithout a doubt, some UFO photographs have received detailed analysis fromscientific teams and passed the test of authenticity. Two of the earliest weretaken by an Oregon farmer named Paul Trent in May 1950. Trent and his wife, bothshy people, never tried to capitalize on their extraordinary images. Localfriends, however, realized their importance, and the photographs were soonfeatured in Life magazine. Nearly two decades later, they were analyzed by theUniversity of Colorado’s UFO study. Even though the Committee’s leader, EdwardCondon, had been predisposed to debunk all UFOs, the Trent photographs passedmuster with the staff specialists. In 1968, the Condon Report concluded that“all factors investigated…appear to be consistent with the assertion that anextraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disc-shaped, tens of meters indiameter, and evidently artificial, flew within the sight of two witnesses.7[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos705814]Although the report acknowledged the possibility of some sort of hoax, it arguedthat a photometric analysis of the negatives made this very unlikely. In otherwords, there was no evidence of a string supporting the discs photographed—theonly realistic hoax method. Subsequent computer enhancements of the imagesreinforced this claim. The object was not a model, but in the air.8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos706031]Yet, there have always been vocal skeptics who argue that no photograph is evergood enough. To those who have taken the time to study the history of UFOphotographs, this brings no small amount of frustration. There are many trulyexcellent images that have received in-depth analysis. In any rational courtroomor laboratory, these would be considered images of genuine UFOs. Yet the factremains that any photograph, no matter how compelling, is open to the charge ofhaving been enhanced or faked, no matter how remote the likelihood often seems.Therefore, neither the Trent photos, nor any of the other good photos takenthroughout the years, have forced an open acknowledgment of the reality of UFOs.The irony is that even though cameras are better and more common than everbefore, any digital image today is liable to be seen as “Photoshopped,” even ifit is not. An element of doubt has irrevocably entered the realm of photographicanalysis. Today, there are an incredible number of seemingly outstanding UFOphotographs, but they are ignored en masse by most journalists and scientists,as if they do not exist. In our own reader poll at the A.D. website(AfterDisclosure.com [http://AfterDisclosure.com]), still photos ranked as thesingle least-likely event to initiate Disclosure.Even so, cameras do have an important role to play, and in all likelihood it isone that will increase in the coming years. The tremendous proliferation ofdigital cameras means that multiple photographs of the same object are much morepossible than during prior decades. Even in the digital age, this is likely toconstitute compelling evidence.But video—not .jpeg files—is where it’s at. We have now entered an era in whichhigh-definition video is just starting to become widespread on people’s cellularphones. Getting a series of outstanding videos in this manner is only a matterof time. In other words, we are talking about a mass sighting being captured onmultiple portable devices. For as long at the Others continue to fly about inour skies, it is only a matter of time.Investigative JournalismRegarding UFOs, the Woodwards and Bernsteins have been missing in action. Noserious American journalistic organization has devoted even a small portion ofthe resources to this subject as had been devoted previously to the Watergatescandal, to say nothing of such weighty matters as the Monica Lewinsky scandal,the O.J. Simpson trial, and the death of Michael Jackson.It is possible that journalism will rise from its slumber and lead an effort forDisclosure. Perhaps in one of the many universes postulated to exist by somephysicists, this has already happened. In ours, such an outcome appearsunlikely. It must be said, however, that there is always a chance that anenterprising journalist can make headway on this issue, albeit only with greatand persistent effort.Such an outcome was achieved by the American journalist Leslie Kean in 2010 withher book, UFOs “On the Record”: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials TalkAbout What They Know. Kean had written balanced articles on UFOs for suchnewspapers as the Boston Herald and San Francisco Examiner. After years ofinvestigation and interviews with prominent government individuals, shepublished a sober, no-frills study demonstrating that these people took UFOsseriously, and that they had ample reason to do so. Her book garnered far moreattention than most previous researchers had done, in large part because of thecare with which she organized her data and thesis. Yet, despite briefly makingthe New York Times Best-sellers list, her work received mixed reactions from themainstream, and it does not appear to have created a significant breakthroughtoward opening up the discussion on Disclosure.9[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos706401]Journalists like Kean are the exception, not the rule. As discussed in Chapter 2[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_009.html#filepos93371], the media has had alongstanding close relationship with government through mutual need, as well asthrough financial relationships with secret government agencies like the CIA.Realistically, journalists do not even need to be offered money; working for theCIA and other Defense agencies is a major career-enhancer. And there is theobvious fact that the journalists of the establishment media have mostly decidedthat it is safer to ridicule the subject than to look into it.Indeed, when it comes to UFOs, most journalists blithely dispose of theinvestigative standards in which they were trained—with none of therepercussions they would normally expect from their peers and supervisors.In August 2010, for example, a British presenter for the BBC, Evan Davis,revisited the Rendlesham Forest case from 1980. He openly stated that “nothingcould persuade” him that alien UFOs are real, and that “no evidence” would evermake him change his mind.10 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos706545]This was rather brazen statement coming from a professional journalist,considering that they are expected to maintain at least the pretense of detachedsuspension of judgment. The extent of Davis’s investigation involved a strollthrough the forest at night, 30 years after the event, with two known debunkers.They concluded that the many U.S. military witnesses—soldiers who were trustedwith handling nuclear weapons—were so daft that they mistook a lighthouse andpolice car flashers for a landed UFO. Davis spoke to no witnesses, read nobooks, and closed the case the day he opened it.American journalist David Corn demonstrated the same level of ignorance. Notingthat the world has exploded with photographic and video equipment, he asked“Where are all the UFO photos?” As mentioned a moment ago, there have been anumber of exceptional images of UFOs taken throughout the decades. Any basic webor YouTube search would show so many recent ones that it is beyond thecapabilities of any single person to analyze. While not confirmed by universityscientists—who normally would not be caught dead trying—many of them, taken withever-improving video resolution on cellphones and high-quality consumer videocameras, show activities in the sky that appear to defy our conventionalrealities. At the very least, they demand attention and analysis.11[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos706922]Across the landscape, news has given way to opinion. It is easier to offer viewsthan news. Investigative journalism requires time and money. Important storiesrequire weeks, months, sometimes even years of research. Such a luxury is atodds with today’s 24/7 news environment. The digital media revolution has onlymade things harder for established institutions such as Newsweek or the New YorkTimes.Even though journalism, that once proud and now moribund profession, willprobably not initiate Disclosure, it may be saved by it. For, as a news event,the revelation of ET-reality is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only is theannouncement sensational, it only grows bigger the more it is covered.At some point, each reporter, each investigator must make a choice. Remainwithin the safe confines of the familiar, or leap into the unknown. Each leapmust be taken alone, into the darkness of a new paradigm. To an accomplishedjournalist, who guards his or her public reputation above all else, nothing ismore terrifying.And yet, in the final weeks before Disclosure, a few journalists will catch on.A few may take that leap. Then once the story breaks, it will burn white hot foryears. In that first decade A.D., there will be more news to cover and more totalk about than anyone ever thought possible.Whistleblowers and LeaksImagine a D.C.-based journalist who has been spoon-fed stories for years bypress releases, whose idea of digging is to surf the Internet. She has coveredbeltway politics from sex scandals, to Congressional mud-fights over healthcareand immigration, to Supreme Court nominations. One night, though, she meets asource in a bar. Something big is going on, she is told. UFOs. She agrees tomeet someone, an inside source, the next day.That night the reporter will start with a Google search. Because this is a topicshe has never taken seriously, her search will be both revelatory andoverwhelming. She will learn that while “real” journalists like herself werebusy covering “important” stories, thousands of UFO sightings were beingreported in alternative media sources every year, and hundreds of photographsand videos were being taken from around the world. Taken individually, theevidence could be dismissed fairly easily. Yet, she might wonder uneasily aboutthe existence of such a large body of evidence.If she does her job well, she will also learn that UFOs appear to pose nationalsecurity problems. She would learn of the air space violations, the attemptedinterceptions, the absurd denials by the government. She might just find herworld on the verge of being turned upside down.At this point, her mind might recoil. Reporters are born and bred to beskeptics, sometimes arrogant ones. She thinks, if UFOs were real, I would haveknown about them. After all, she is a smart journalist who went to a goodcollege. If these vehicles are flying in our skies, she reasons, it could neverhave been covered for so long.Having taken the bait, she meets the inside source, her Deep Throat. She isgiven classified documents. These make it clear to her that UFOs are actualphysical craft, and that the government has known for a long time. Suddenly, thestory becomes very real. If she can convince an editor to start covering thestory aggressively, she might have the distinction of being the reporter whopushed the Disclosure story forward. She might win her place in the historybooks.So there is hope that the mainstream journalistic world can redeem itself. Yet,a more likely way of starting the fire is the emerging phenomenon of WikiLeaks,the organization that encourages submissions of classified or otherwise hiddendocuments by allowing the sources who leak them to remain anonymous. In July2010, WikiLeaks released the Afghan War Diary, more than 90,000 documents aboutthe war in Afghanistan. In October, the organization released about 400,000documents relating to the Iraq War. The Pentagon called it “the largest leak ofclassified documents in its history.” Then, just a month later, on November 28,WikiLeaks released the U.S. State Department diplomatic cables, which itdescribed as seven times the size of the Iraq War Logs.Just a decade earlier, these leaks of classified information were not possible,because there was no global technological infrastructure in place to enable it.But times have changed, and they will continue to do so.It is not hard to imagine that key UFO-related documents could come into thepossession of WikiLeaks. Indeed, WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange stated thatsome of the “yet-to-be-published” parts of the State Department cables includereferences to UFOs.12 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos707314]A few days later, Assange’s lawyer, Mark Stephens, told the BBC that WikiLeakshad information that it considered to be a “thermo-nuclear device,” which itwould release if the organization needed to defend itself. Could this be areference to the reality and seriousness of the UFO phenomenon? As of thiswriting, the “device” has not been released.Even if WikiLeaks were to release incriminating UFO data, obstacles toDisclosure would still remain. First, the WikiLeaks managers would have to notcensor the material. Then, even if the documents were published, we could expectthe usual sources to attack them as fabrications. We need only look to the 1980sand the MJ-12 documents to see how such a scenario might play out. Still, it isundeniable that action by WikiLeaks, or a similar type of organization, can playa major role in crashing the walls of secrecy.Public Statement or Deathbed ConfessionIt might seem reasonable that a statement from an informed and presumablyreliable source, especially from within the U.S. national security community,might be enough to spark the debate that ignites Disclosure. But such commentshave happened before with little impact.As previously noted, the former Director of the CIA, Admiral RoscoeHillenkoetter, stated in an open letter to Congress in 1960 that high-rankingAir Force officers were “soberly concerned” about UFOs, but that the policy ofsecrecy and ridicule made citizens believe UFOs were “nonsense.”Whether Hillenkoetter was floating a trial balloon for Disclosure at the behestof Majestic, or had broken from them, or was simply speaking as a privatecitizen—press follow-up was non-existent.There have been several statements during the first decade of the 21st centuryby Apollo 14 astronaut, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, about his knowledge of a UFOcover-up. Mitchell was the sixth man to walk on the moon, so his statementsmight be considered worthy of some journalistic gravitas. Mitchell’s mostexplosive claim has been that two associates of his—individuals of highestnational security clearances and of unimpeachable character—described first-handknowledge of the deeply secret programs to study ET technology and bodies. Healso spoke about Roswell as a true case of the crash of an extraterrestrialvehicle.13 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos707561]The Roswell case has largely been cracked by virtue of the men and women whowere there in 1947 who have talked to researchers before their deaths. Roswellresearcher Donald Schmitt described his task as “racing the undertaker.” Onespectacular end-of-life confession came from Lieutenant Walter Haut, who was thePublic Information Officer of the Roswell Army Air Field in 1947. Haut hadwritten the initial press release about the recovery of a “flying disc.” Shortlybefore his death in 2005, Haut signed a sealed affidavit, which was opened afterhe died. In a matter-of-fact tone, Haut stated that he saw samples of theRoswell wreckage, which “was unlike any material I had or have ever seen in mylife.” He added that he saw several bodies under a canvas tarpaulin. “I amconvinced,” he concluded, “that what I personally observed was some type ofcraft and its crew from outer space.”14[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos707913]These statements by Hillenkoetter, Mitchell, and Haut all failed to make a dent.They did not generate any journalistic or scientific response, nor even spark apublic outcry for more facts.In addition, there have been several impressive statements made by prominentfigures around the world, none of which achieved a true media breakthrough orforced open a public discussion on UFOs.During the 1950s, the Commanding General of the French Air Forces, Lionel M.Chassin, wrote: “We can therefore say categorically that mysterious objects haveindeed appeared and continue to appear in the sky that surrounds us. Whatintelligence is it that guides these objects?…Human intelligence?Perhaps…nonhuman intelligence? Why not?”15[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos708060]The British Admiral, Lord Peter Hill-Norton, who was Chief of the Defence Staffof the United Kingdom, also openly discussed the UFO reality. “There is aserious possibility,” he said, “that we are being visited by people from outerspace. It behooves us to find out who they are, where they come from, and whatthey want.”16 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos708289]The French Minister of Defense, Robert Galley, stated during a 1974 radiointerview that, “if your listeners could see for themselves the mass of reportscoming in from airborne gendarmerie, from the mobile gendarmerie, and from thegendarmerie charged with the job of conducting investigations…then they wouldsee that it is all pretty disturbing.”17[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos708583]The Spanish General, Carlos Castro Cavero, told a journalist in 1976 that “thenations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of theUFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.”18[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos708887]Japanese General Akira Hirano, Chief of Staff of Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force,stated in 1977 that “we frequently see unidentified objects in the skies. We arequietly investigating them.”19[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos709234]Former Canadian Minister of National Defence Paul Hellyer made severalstatements in the mid-2000s, including “UFOs are as real as the airplanes thatfly over your head,” he said, adding, “The United States military are preparingweapons which could be used against the aliens, and they could get us into anintergalactic war without us ever having any warning.”20[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos709454]In a television interview from May 2010, president of Kalmykia, KirsanIlyumzhinov, the only Buddhist Republic in Europe, claimed that he had beentaken aboard an extraterrestrial craft 10 years earlier. The abduction occurred,he said, in a Moscow apartment while on official business. Benevolent alienbeings took him on a craft to another star system. Ilyumzhinov, incidentally,was also elected President of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in 1995, aposition he retains as of this writing.21[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos709656]Any time a head of state, anywhere in the world, makes a claim like this, onemight think that people would take notice. Ilyumzhinov’s statement, however,received a modest amount of coverage and then was quickly disabled. BBC Newsspoke about his “reputation as an eccentric character.” This, apparently, wasbecause he had spent millions of his own dollars to promote chess within hisrepublic. A great deal of speculation followed: Was Ilyumzhinov pulling apublicity stunt? Was he delusional in some way? No mainstream journalist everasked whether his claims might be true. Ilyumzhinov, after all, was anintelligent and serious man. By making the claim he did, he was exposing himselfto certain ridicule. The story quickly died.Clearly, it will take a very big name making specific statements to tip thepublic to the breaking point; someone such as Colin Powell, a former U.S.Secretary of State and a man who had been the head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs ofStaff. Imagine a deathbed confession from Powell, or perhaps a signed affidavitfrom him to be read at his funeral. Such an event would trigger a massive publicoutcry, and would even shake the media into action. Other names that couldqualify as trigger events if they spoke out at the end of their lives includeformer Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush Sr. (who was also CIADirector), and National Security Advisors Henry Kissinger and ZbigniewBrzezinski.They could certainly start a discussion. However, even their last-minutestatements might not end it. None of them would be immune to counter-attacks. Hesuffered mental deterioration toward the end of his life, it might be claimed.Or, he had a personal ax to grind.Ultimately, these individuals are precisely among those who would be mostimplicated in the cover-up. None of them are likely to lead the charge, or theywould have done so already. If one of these prominent individuals speaks outpublicly, it will probably be after Disclosure has begun.Physical EvidenceJust because these strange visitors have not seen fit to meet our block-busterfilm fantasy of contact and hover above the Earth’s major cities demanding oursurrender, they may still, accidentally or on-purpose, leave us something withwhich we can do business. Indeed, this happened at Roswell and subsequent crashsites.Clearly, if we could get a civilian lab to study such wreckage, it could provethe existence of the outsiders. For example, researchers Donald Schmitt, ThomasCarey, William Doleman, and others conducted an archeological dig at the Roswellcrash site to search for wreckage that the Army may have missed in its cleanupfrom 1947. In particular, they hoped to find a piece of the so-called “memorymetal” that several witnesses described. They did not. Yet, perhaps a piece ofhardware continues to hide in the attic of some soldier, something that will notbe found until his grandchildren clear it out after his funeral.It may also be that a new crash occurs. If so, might somebody besides thegovernment gets there first? Or, perhaps a government other than one of the mainco-conspirators in the cover-up takes possession of an object, sends materialsto multiple labs for analysis, and alerts the media. Given the dominant reach ofthe U.S. military and intelligence community, this is a long-shot. Moreover,based on what happened at Roswell where authentic wreckage was swapped out for aweather balloon, the possibility of fraud and illegal activity to preventmaterials from being adequately analyzed is a strong likelihood.There is an entire sub-section of UFO research that focuses on physical traces,not necessarily of crashes, but of landings where either heat or radiation hasmodified the Earth’s surface. Indeed, thousands of ground trace cases have beenstudied throughout the years. Many are compelling evidence of unusual phenomena;a handful are of outstanding evidentiary value that something anomalousoccurred. Yet, they have not broken through into mainstream discussion.We have not yet given much attention to alleged alien abductions, but to theextent that some portion of it is true, there are disturbing claims of implantsbeing inserted into the bodies of the abductees. So far, the lab results on someof these are tantalizing but inconclusive. Some appear to be conclusive but notsubstantiated by multiple labs. That may not always remain the case.Global Discussion and DeclassificationMight some country other than the United States decide to end UFO secrecy?Several other nations have released their official UFO files; little politicalforward-motion has come of them. The 1999 release of the French COMETA Report, asophisticated analysis of many French UFO cases, received precious littlemainstream comment. It was the same with the various releases of documents bythe United Kingdom, although David Cameron, who became U.K. Prime Minister in2010, did promise that he would aggressively release more files. Yet, expectingthe U.K. to trump the U.S. on UFO Disclosure is fantasy. Some of the U.K. filesare intriguing, but most are little more than “raw reports” called in bycitizens, which received little to no investigation. They will not be weapons inthe battle for Disclosure.Other nations offer more interesting possibilities. Brazilian officials haveoccasionally made fascinating statements about the reality of UFOs. In 2010,they cleared the way to study and release UFO reports, including militaryencounters. In 2009, the Russian Navy announced it would declassify some of itsunderwater encounters. Both Russia and Brazil have a history of extraordinarymilitary encounters with UFOs; if either of those nations announced that UFOsexisted, the landscape would shift.The greatest challenge to secrecy might come from a country that has practiceddeep secrecy for its entire history—China. During the 1990s, just before itstransformation into a full-fledged global power, China was still willing tofollow the lead of the U.S. on this issue, at least according to C.B. ScottJones, who for years was a special liaison for Rhode Island Senator ClaibornePell. Jones shared Pell’s interest in matters pertaining to UFOs andextraterrestrials. During the early 1990s, Jones was in China on Pell’s behalf,and had occasion to talk to certain Chinese officials with some knowledge of theUFO issue. Impressed by the quiet, sophisticated study they had taken, he askedwhy they did not publicize some of their findings. Their answer startled him:“We are waiting for the United States to take the lead.”22[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos709898] Whether this will continueto be the case for China is one of the world’s great unfolding dramas.But the UFO secret is too important for the United States to abdicate on. Ifsome other nation decided to reveal it, it would be seen as a hostile act. Notonly by the United States, but also the secret-keepers who work behind thescenes of governments and nations (that is, Majestic or the Breakaway Group). Infact, it would be a hostile act, most likely made in order to seize theinitiative and move into a position of authority during the comingtransformation. Such a decision would have to be carried out in the most extremesecrecy, lest the wrong people learn in advance. One could envision quietassassinations taking place if things go wrong and the NSA and its allies learnof the plan.It would also be conceivable that, if all else failed to stop the renegadegovernment from disclosing, the United States might decide to jump ahead on thematter, if only to retain the initiative and its position of primacy amongnations. Such a scenario would be worthy of a page-turning spy novel, and itmight happen.Mass SightingThe event that forces Disclosure could be a mass sighting, one that is recordedindependently on radar and videotape by officials, journalists, and the public.Perhaps, too, it prompts a visible military response that cannot be denied.Through the years, some UFO sightings have combined some of these elements.These include events over Norway (1980s), New York’s Hudson Valley (also 1980s),the Florida town of Gulf Breeze (late 1980s and early 1990s), Belgium(1989–1990), Moscow (1990), Mexico City (for years, starting in 1991), Phoenix(1997), and Stephenville, Texas (2008). They posed a challenge to the forces ofsecrecy. Some of these produced fascinating video evidence, and received atleast some press coverage. In several of the American cases, there werebehind-the-scenes pressures to prevent mass panic. Frequently, the FederalAviation Administration (FAA) was on-the-spot, charged with stonewalling publicinquiries with absurd explanations that were intended to prevent further pressinquiry.The non-American cases were comparatively easier to deal with. The Soviet Unionin 1990 had a media apparatus that could hardly compare with its Americancounterpart. Mexico’s and Belgium’s media systems were certainly betterdeveloped, but it would be unrealistic to have expected either of those nationsto flout the wishes of their powerful ally, the United States, by unilaterallyending UFO secrecy.Clearly, for a mass sighting to be effective, it needs, at minimum, multiplevideo recordings. The extraordinary Stephenville sighting did not make furtherheadway because it lacked video or photographic evidence. But even video is notgood enough; it must be absolutely clear and undeniable. For instance, thePhoenix Lights of 1997, although recorded on multiple camcorders, never showed aclear object—only a huge formation of lights that admittedly defied easyexplanation. Some of the Mexican sightings of the 1990s, although recorded frommultiple vantage points, showed white dots in the sky. These white objects wereundeniably strange, and moved in ways that were not normal, but once again theywere not definitely recognizable as something “not ours.” There could always besome reserve of doubt associated with them. Some of the Gulf Breeze photographsand video were compelling, but were typically shot by lone operators (and manyof these by the same person, Ed Walters). The Hudson Valley cases, while utterlyspectacular, occurred during the early 1980s, when camcorders were rare, andpeople didn’t really travel with cameras. In the case of Belgium, there wereseveral interesting photographs, some good video, and Air Force radar data. Theywere not, however, simultaneously recorded.Today’s cell phone video cameras are widespread, and they will continue toimprove in quality and capability. Every major city in the world is “covered,”so to speak, by citizens who have the ability to record strange things in thesky. Many of these objects are already being recorded; a quick web search willturn up hundreds of video recordings of UFOs from around the world. Some arehoaxes, which only serves to complicate the issue. Yet, it is only a matter oftime before an unusual object of exceptional capability is clearly seen byhundreds or even thousands, and recorded by enough of them to force the hand ofthe powers behind the secrecy.That is what is needed to start a chain reaction, or avalanche.It is clear that major media groups have been complicit in downplaying the UFOreality, partly due to alliances with the national security apparatus, butalso—after generations of denial and ridicule—from sheer terror at taking a riskon this subject. It would help, therefore, that the mass UFO event occurredwhile members of the major media were present with cameras already operatinglive. Better still would be to get unrehearsed reactions from on-the-spottelevision reporters or other major public figures.A Combination of EventsWhatever the trigger event to Disclosure, it will certainly feel unique when weexperience it, and it may well draw from different categories. For example,while we are not optimistic that investigative journalism in today’s environmentwill be successful, it may be that a mass sighting leads to greater interest byreporters and then, finally, an investigation. Intrepid journalists may play apart, but will probably not start the ball rolling.By the same token, although no one believes that a photo, by itself, will breakthe cover-up, a photo can be part of an ensemble of evidence. In the event of amass-sighting, photographic and video evidence will be paired with hundreds, ifnot thousands, of witness testimony. This can get covered in the media, maygenerate leaks, and so on.The future is unwritten on this topic, but there is one fundamental reality ofour current era that may play a powerful role in the end of secrecy.Political InstabilityThroughout the past decades, there has been an undeniable relationship ofpolitical instability to the release of volatile UFO data. Mostly, this seemsdue to the likelihood that uncertain times provide greater opportunities forinsiders to talk openly to journalists, as well as for initiatives that forcegreater degrees of government openness. In addition, it seems that there may bea connection between heightened UFO activity with locations and periods ofinstability.It happened in the United States during the 1960s. At that time, extreme socialagitation appeared alongside a willingness by Congress, for the only time inAmerican history, to question the official line on UFOs. Perhaps one can chalkmost of this up to coincidence, but it is true that during the late 1960s,everyone was questioning authority. Members of Congress did so because their ownconstituents demanded answers. In this case, the result was the Condon CommitteeReport, which admittedly was not a victory for Disclosure advocates. The point,however, is that the issue was brought into the open. It also happened that thiswas a time of heavy UFO activity, indeed one of the greatest in U.S. history.A better example of political turmoil and UFO openness occurred after thescandal of Watergate and the collapse of U.S. power in Vietnam. It was duringthis political climate, one of great liberalism by the standards of the Americansystem, that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was strengthened in 1974,when, in the final throes of the Nixon administration it became a useful toolfor matters that included UFOs. It was then strengthened again in 1977. JimmyCarter further liberalized FOIA, explicitly ordering federal agencies that, whenin doubt, the basic rule would be to release formerly classified information,provided that national security was not damaged thereby.Although these new laws were not designed with the release of UFO data in mind,they did result in an avalanche of formerly classified UFO documents being madepublic. From the mid-1970s until the early 1980s, FOIA was behind the mostimportant release of official UFO documents there had ever been—roughly 10,000pages. The result was not the end of denial regarding UFOs, but truly anexposure of the cover-up itself, for it became clear that many governmentagencies that had denied an interest in UFOs were simply lying. It is alsonoteworthy that during this period, large numbers of leaks began to discusssecret retrievals of crashed UFOs, or the possession of alien bodies. In severalcases, retired military people quietly came forward to UFO researchers, becausethey believed that the new openness portended an official announcement thatwould come from the Jimmy Carter administration. Finally, we must also note thatlate 1973 to 1978 were extremely active years of reported UFO activity withinthe United States, as well most of the world.Other nations offer their own examples of political turmoil and transformationlinked to the release of UFO data. In Spain, following the death of longtimeCaudillo Francisco Franco in 1975, UFO information began immediately to reachthe public via official channels.23[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos710037] It is also noteworthy thatSpain was the scene of an impressive wave of UFO activity from 1974 through1976.China, too, appears to show a relationship, especially regarding the death oflongtime dictator Mao Zedong in the fall of 1976. China had previously been ablank spot on the map as far as UFOs were concerned. That changed dramaticallywith the leader’s death. Immediately afterward, Chinese ufology began to growand thrive, and Chinese UFO reports became frequent, many of which werespectacular.Similar to China, UFO activity in the Soviet Union had scarcely reached theWest. This changed as the nation began its final convulsions prior todissolution at the end of 1991. All through 1989, 1990, and 1991, UFOs werereported throughout the country. This was possible because, similar to theUnited States, Spain, and China, important laws were relaxed, which allowedpeople to make such reports and encourage public discussion. For a few years,not only did many well-documented and disturbing reports come out (including oneof a large UFO just east of Moscow on March 21, 1990), but several statements byleading Soviet defense figures confirmed a serious UFO problem. This could neverhave happened under the old regime. However, in an era in which all bets wereoff regarding the future, powerful people, such as Deputy Minister of DefenseIvan Tretyak and Chief of the Soviet Air Defense Forces, General Igor Maltsev,spoke in a surprisingly candid fashion. Maltsev, discussing the March 1990object, told the press that it was a disc 100 to 200 meters in diameter, and itwas able to perform an “S turn” flight horizontally and vertically, as well ashover and then fly “with a speed exceeding that of the modern jet fighter by 2or 3 times.” All the while, it had been silent while doing these things. “At thepresent time,” he added, “terrestrial machines could hardly have any suchcapabilities.”24 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos710302][images/00030.jpg]Reaching critical mass. In the final days, citizens will band together to demandthe truth. Night Falls in Tahrir Square, February 1, 2011. Image courtesy of TheAssociated Press/Tara Todras-Whitehall/AP Images.The outbursts of openness in these nations all occurred during periods of regimechange or extreme instability. Of course, this is no guarantee that UFOinformation will leak, and there are many counter-examples in which regimechanges did not result in the release of such information. But such periods ofinstability appear to lend themselves to this kind of openness in one form oranother.This leads to the obvious question: How likely will the global situation of theearly 21st century lead to another spectacular release of UFO data, one that maypush the world past the tipping point and into Disclosure?By all accounts, the current situation is unstable. The global financial crisisof 2008 is not over; the U.S. economy and much of Europe continue in a free-fallof deindustrialization; Greece and several other European nations are close tobankrupcy; in the United States many states have cut major services and severalhave flirted with bankruptcy; tensions in the Middle East have peaked; nuclearfears dominate the India-Pakistan, North Korean, and Middle Eastern regions; thewars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to bleed global resources dry; anenvironmental crisis struck the Gulf of Mexico; and other eco-crises haveengulfed much of the rest of the world. These problems do not describe the fullweight of the world’s problems, but they show that the global kindle is dry; aspark may well set major crises into motion. As of this writing, the movement to“Occupy Wall Street” has gained worldwide recognition, and is clearly a sign ofwidespread dissatisfaction by people with the current structure of political andfinancial power. Perhaps the global spark has been ignited, or perhaps this is aprecursor to the main event.If history is our guide, the current unrest may jar UFO secrecy loose.Finding Out for OurselvesBehind any of the specific events that may result in UFO Disclosure, however,there is one great, inexorable force, relentlessly pushing us all into thefuture, into the light of truth. That is the steady growth of human technologyand capabilities.The Endgame could happen tomorrow, it could happen in 20 years. It might evenwait longer, although we doubt it. There are a few reasons: the increasing rateof change of our society, the greater volume and acknowledgment of trulymysterious sightings, and the global need to get on with business. We may be atthe tipping point, or at least at its beginning. Even if the Others do not wishto be found, those of us who for so long have been on the outside of this secretmay find them first.Consider the pace of change in our civilization. For thousands upon thousands ofyears, human society went on with very little change. More than a century ago,European farmers commonly used hand scythes not much different than those usedby the earliest farmers from 10,000 years ago. As recently as the 19th century,most human production was based on muscle power, whether human or beast, just asit had been since time immemorial. In the realm of the mind, too, our conditionwas marked, century after century, by the replacement of one set ofsuperstitions with another. That is, until the introduction of scientificthought throughout the last four centuries—a blink in cosmic time.Following eons upon eons of life that went on in a certain way, humancivilization has reinvented itself in the last century. Using science as itsbasic tool, we have unlocked Pandora’s box, releasing our vast potential forgood and ill. From the relatively recent reality of horses pulling carts, wehave invented: the light bulb, the automobile, the airplane, the radio, motionpictures, mechanical robots, insulin, television, frozen food, liquid fueledrockets, the electron microscope, radar, jet engines, helicopters, computers,the atomic bomb, transistors, bar codes, the hydrogen bomb, solar cells, opticfiber, the hovercraft, the modem, integrated circuits, the microchip, compactdiscs, hand held calculators, cell phones, personal computers, super conductors,the World Wide Web, fuel cells, the sequencing of the human genome, the iPad,optical camouflage systems, YouTube, and smart phones.And time will not stop; emerging technologies today are of incredible diversityand transformative power. In the area of transportation, they include: nuclearfusion power, biofuels, nanowire batteries, ultracapacitors, wireless energytransfer, and electric cars. In material science they include high-temperaturesuperconductivity and superfluidity, carbon nanotubes, cloaking devices, andself-healing materials.But it is in the area of information technology that the most dramatic (and forour purposes, relevant) changes are likely to take place. For here, we are onthe verge of entering a completely new world in which computing power achievescapabilities we could not dream of just a few years ago. Within the next fewyears, we are likely to see widespread use of solid state drives, makingcomputers and portable electronics devices lighter, stronger, faster, quieter,and requiring less power. There will be breakthroughs in the areas of holographyand virtual reality, enabling people to immerse themselves within realisticartificial environments. We should also expect improvements in the ability ofthe human brain to interface with the World Wide Web via direct interface withcomputers or even implants.Most profound will be the improvements in artificial intelligence and quantumcomputing. According to computer and AI experts such as Ray Kurzweil, by around2020 we can expect to see computers embedded everywhere throughout our world,even more so than today. Virtual reality environments will be more common, aswill “computer assistants.” By then, it is expected that the computational powerof a leading edge consumer brand computer will be equal to the computationalpower of one human brain. That does not mean that your computer will necessarilybe “smarter” than you are. But it does mean it will possess an awesomecomputational and “thinking” ability that current computers lack (exceptingcomputers within the classified world, where this ability may have already beenachieved).By 2030, it is possible that a typical computer will have the processing powerof 1,000 human brains. The human brain itself may well be mostly “decoded”—thatis, digitized somehow. And if it is digitized, it can be uploaded. There willprobably be direct neural pathways between human and machine, implants of allsorts to enhance human abilities, and computers that claim to be “conscious.”Within such a period of dramatic technological change, can we really expect thatour ability to create forward motion on the matter of UFO Disclosure will notsomehow be enhanced? Consider how portable electronic devices—smart phones—havechanged the way we communicate within the short span of five years. We are allcommunicating with each other in ways that were unforeseen just a few years ago.Indeed, the world of the next 20 years promises a transformation of globalcivilization. It may also see the beginnings of a transformation of the humanspecies itself via developments in biotechnology. All of this will happenwhether or not the Others are acknowledged.The Breakaway Group may not have considered this, but they should. Even thoughthey have had a head start thanks to exclusive access to alien technology, therest of us will soon have the capabilities necessary to find the Others,definitively, without anyone’s help.The OthersFinally, however unlikely it seems, there is one trigger that trumps all others,and brings Disclosure instantly and openly.No one really knows how these “Others” think in the most general terms, muchless how they think about the prospect of revealing themselves to us. It may bethat they do not think about it much. They have not landed in a public space andannounced their presence, like the extraterrestrials from The Day the EarthStood Still. Nor have they been entirely successful at remaining hidden. Indeed,they have been seen by millions of people.If the Others have anything to do with maintaining the status quo, then they arenot apt to announce their presence in any new way. However, it may be that theidea of slow acclimation is not a human one, but theirs. Perhaps their craft donot really crash accidentally. Could it be that, although they could disguisethemselves from our radar and our eyes, they choose not to? Maybe one day theywill decide to end the debate here on Earth once and for all.Facing the LightThroughout the years, this discussion had come up among the human secrecy elite,the Breakaway Group. Always, the rule of secrecy prevailed. On this occasion,the deadlock could well go on for some time, except for one thing: The worldalready understands what is going on.There are many routes by which Disclosure may arrive. Some undoubtedly willmerge with others, and what starts as a trickle will become a river, then aflood. Once the process starts, there will be a free-for-all by many people andinstitutions to reach the truth first.When that moment comes, the people of the world will offer less resistance thanprior generations would have. By now, the public has seen it all. Our collectivecapacity for shock is lower than at any time in history. We have lived throughthe death of Soviet communism, impeachments, natural disasters, rogue nuclearstates, 9/11, destructive wars fought on false pretenses, disputed elections,collapsing economies, and an African-American in the White House.The old choice between the truth and the lie will vanish. The accumulation ofknowledge by ordinary people, the cracks in the stonewalling response, theexpanding consciousness of our planetary condition; all of these together willmove the world closer and closer to the tipping point. For the insiders, it willnow come down to either getting in front of the issue and leading thediscussion, or remaining hidden and letting it slip from their grasp. Such aresult will be unacceptable for the secret-keepers.So, at the end of the debate, members may discuss the state of planning forDisclosure. As far back as the purported November 1952 Eisenhower Briefing Memo,it was mentioned that “contingency plan MJ-1949-04P/78 (Top Secret Eyes Only)should be held in continued readiness should the need to make a publicpronouncement present itself.”Whatever the authenticity of that document, there can be no doubt that acontingency plan of some sort has been periodically dusted off and updatedthroughout the years. Studies would have been commissioned, polls taken. At themeeting, this data will be available, and expert testimony will be read.When the next vote is taken, the ayes will have it in a super-majority. As looksare traded around the room, the chairman realizes the enormity of what has takenplace. He asks, “Well, who’s going to tell the president?”[images/00033.jpg]> A.D. +1> Today on the eve of the one year anniversary of Disclosure, commonly referred> to now as AD1, we begin a series of “Where Were You?” articles, prepared by> our staff, detailing the moments immediately before the news broke and> immediately after.

Its members willneed to appear lawful, not as renegade outlaws. They will need the President ofthe United States to make the announcement, backed by the flags and affectationsof civilian power. They will need to co-opt his trappings of power, and he willneed to let them do so, in order to maintain the appearance of relevance.So one unfortunate soul will trek to the Oval Office to brief the man who issupposed to be in charge. This conversation will not be comfortable for eitherparty.Only yesterday, the so-called Leader of the Free World had no “need-to-know.”That will change now. The president offers coffee, his executive secretarycloses the doors, and the small talk ends. Now begins the briefing as we mightimagine it:[images/00029.jpg]> Mister President, please accept our apologies for you having to receive this> briefing under the current circumstances, but when I lay out the content, I> believe you’ll appreciate why this had to be the case.> We can start here: the so-called Roswell crash was a surveillance craft of> some kind, and it was not a solitary event.

We have had some, but far from complete, success at reverse-engineering> the key technologies, and even less success at communicating with these> survivors, which may have psychic abilities.> They have stated they come from another planetary system, however, we are not> yet certain this is the actual truth. Additionally, there appear to be> multiple species of these visitors, each with different technology and> possible motives. Some of these beings have shown an interest in our own> nuclear technology. We urge you to refer to them as alien or extraterrestrial,> although know the matter is under study.> As to human abductions and experimentation, there is conflicting evidence on> the theory that a hybrid species is being created but there is evidence that> they have visited the Earth going back thousands of years.> We prefer to end the briefing at this point, sir. By doing so, we hope to> protect you from having to answer questions that you may wish to leave in the> classified arena. We recommend that you appoint someone from within your> administration to receive that detailed security briefing in the near future.[images/00029.jpg]As he hears these words, the president understands that destiny has chosen himto be the “Disclosure President.” Although he will go down in history for thisact, he also knows that his Administration’s agenda is now in ruins. From themoment he utters the word “extraterrestrial” in a formal setting, his fate issealed. He will spend the rest of his presidency managing this singular event.If things go poorly, his reputation will be ruined. Still, no man has evergotten to run the government of the United States of America without an ego. Heknows that forevermore, his name, like that of Washington, Lincoln, andRoosevelt will be associated with a key moment in the history of his nation andof the world.That status may ease the sting that behind these closed doors of the OvalOffice, this elected leader has just been told that his own classification hadbeen raised specifically to receive the briefing he has just received. Some ofthe questions he is now asking require an even higher level of classification.The President of the United States—as no doubt his colleagues around the worldare learning at the same time—has just been told that he does not need to knoweverything. Now that he knows something, however, he must help transition thepeople of Earth to accept and cope with this new reality. Certainly, in thebeginning, neither he nor the other world leaders will be able to be completelyhonest with the public. They will all have to hold back information for reasonsof national security and to prevent panic.Endless QuestionsOnce we surmount the basic hurdle of understanding that UFOs are real, once werecognize that Others of some sort are here, we naturally want to know what theyare—who they are. Who has bothered to cross the universe, or pass throughdimensions, or travel through time, in order to interact with us? Nobody makesthat kind of effort without an agenda. At least, no human society would do sucha thing.Outside researchers, lacking cooperation and open communication from theauthorities, are left with more questions than answers. It is like trying tosolve an equation with too many variables.How long have these Others been here? Are they related to us in some way? Werethe different types of reported “aliens” actually separate groups, or were theysimply variations belonging to the same group? Do aliens lie? What do they thinkabout us? Do they come to make war, or to bring peace? Is there a hidden agenda?Yet, even though the secret-keepers have kept a fairly tight lid over UFOinformation, there are still things we can know about the Others based on whatthey have not done.> [images/00012.jpg] They have not sent us messages that can be picked up by> SETI.> [images/00012.jpg] They have not landed on the White House lawn.> [images/00012.jpg] They have not appeared in Motherships above our world> cities, preparing to strike.If the Others wanted us all to know about them, it has clearly been within theirpower to present themselves, regardless of what our militaries or breakawaycivilizations want us to know. These Others could have engineered any number ofmajor events to capture our attention. They have not done so.They are mysterious beings. Their intentions seem to be, as the evidenceindicates, alien.Question #1: Who Are They?A careful analysis of the vast ufological literature, even accounting for thevagaries of human perception, leads to the conclusion that the truth is morecomplicated than what most believers and skeptics think. There has been no edictdemanding that all UFO occupants be extraterrestrial, nor that they all look,think, and act alike.Based at least on alleged witness accounts, multiplicity prevails. Everyone isfamiliar with the ubiquitous “Gray,” the short, spindly being with a large headand large almond-shaped black eyes. They have been frequently reported. It is afallacy that all alleged memories of them are detritus from popular culture.Long before best-selling books popularized them (like Whitley Strieber’sCommunion from 1987), accounts of these beings had been reported privately toabduction researchers by bewildered and frightened people.Other types have also been reported. Reptilian-type beings, who by all witnessaccounts are formidable creatures, both in terms of their intelligence andtechnical capabilities along with insectoid or mantid-type beings. Each one ofthese has been reported with variations: some taller, some shorter, some with amixture of features and colorations. Sorting all this out is daunting, as onecannot be sure of how much actual memory is being recovered as opposed to screenmemory or confabulation. Yet, the patterns are there.Human-looking entities have also been reported. These, however, are not yourrun-of-the-mill human. They are very different, and seem to be “beyond human.”Often termed “Nordics” or “Blonds,” they typically appear as majestic, evenangelic. They often demonstrate deep intelligence and a kind of paternal empathyfor the humans who encounter them. It is difficult to say that they “abduct”people. It is true that many of the people who have allegedly had encounterswith these beings did not ask for contact (although some claim that theyactively sought contact with these beings). It is, instead, that the encountersare usually described as a positive experience.There is also a body of research that describes “almost-human” beings, somethingthat appears to be a hybrid species: part-human, part-something-else. A programto create a genetically modified human being? It might appear so.What do we make of these varied beings? Do they represent different groups? Ifso, what might their own relationships be? Do they cooperate or compete with oneanother?During the 1960s, Ivan Sanderson, a biologist by profession and one of the mostoriginal writers about UFOs, methodically asked not what UFOs were, but whatthey could be. He developed a six-page outline of the possibilities.1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos710698] Therefore, suggestedSanderson, they could inanimate or animate. If inanimate, they might be natural,or artificial, each possibility with several subsets. If animate, they couldalso be natural or artificial. Natural forms might include life-forms indigenousto space, or to atmospheres, or to solid bodies. Artificial forms might bedomesticated natural life-forms, genetically created life-forms, orbiochemically created life-forms. And so on.Keeping a similarly open mind, and with an eye toward comprehending all theevidence offered by this most challenging of subjects, we can summarize theexisting explanations for whom the Others actually may be.ExtraterrestrialBased on humanity’s built-in sense of time linearity and spatial relationships,it is easy to understand why this explanation has been the most obvious anddurable. Our own perceptions of time involve moving forward, and our perceptionsof space involve moving from one place to another.[images/00002.jpg]Deepening the riddle. Who are they and what do they want? Photo courtesy ofNASA/STSci.Extraterrestrials have always been at the heart of the debate about UFOs. Sincethe beginning of the modern UFO mystery, speculation both informed and otherwisehas considered that these unknown objects might be “interplanetary.” Thisincludes analyses from within the United States Air Force, which at variouspoints during the Cold War had substantial factions stating that this was themost likely possibility. Certainly, the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) hasbeen the dominant theory among UFO researchers since the first books on thesubject appeared in the 1950s. We have also seen the ETH demonstrated incountless space alien movies, depicting intentions both hostile and benign.There is a powerful logic to the ETH. Astronomers now estimate that the MilkyWay galaxy alone contains from 200 billion to 400 billion stars. These numbersare staggering, even considering that only 7.6 percent of all stars in ourgalaxy are sun-like “Type 2” stars. If we accept the lower estimate of 200billion stars, this means there could be 15 billion sun-like stars in the MilkyWay. Indeed, within the scant astronomical distance of a mere 50 light years, weknow of at least a dozen such stars.2[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos710917] If we consider thatinter-galactic travel might be feasible in some manner wholly unknown to us atpresent, the field opens up to the hundreds of billions of galaxies estimated toexist.But let us confine ourselves merely to our own, cozy galaxy. We do not know howmany planets orbit around the estimated 200 billion stars, nor how many of thoseplanets might be similar to Earth. Yet, recent discoveries give us cause for aliberal estimate. By late 2011, astronomers have made confirmed detections of693 planets beyond our solar system. Most of these are gas giants like Jupiter,presumably unsuitable for life (although this leaves out the question ofpossible moons around a gas giant that might support life). However, the highproportion of gas giants is a function mainly of our detection methods, whichgenerally have not been sophisticated enough to find many smaller, rockyplanets, like Earth. It is now thought that most of the extrasolar planets arerocky—like Earth. In particular, recent studies indicate that most sun-likeplanets are likely to have rocky planets orbiting them.3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos711219]Understanding that, from this point, we are estimating using logical guessesmore than hard data, let us press on a little. If we consider that onlyone-third of sun-like stars have rocky planets orbiting them, and that onlyone-third of those have a planet that is roughly the size of Earth, and thatone-tenth of those developed life of some sort, and that one-hundredth of thosewere home to a species that attained intelligent life akin to birds, reptiles,and mammals, and one-hundredth of those gave rise to a species that masteredscience and technology, we would be left with more than 16,000 technologicallyproficient civilizations that have existed in the Milky Way alone.Some exobiologists might think these estimates are very high; others mightconsider them conservative. But let us stay with the estimate of 16,000technologically proficient civilizations. What might be the odds that some ofthem currently exist? Here, too, we can do little more than guess, but surely itseems reasonable to suppose that there may be quite a few. Have many of thesemastered the art of space travel, as humanity is only now just beginning to dofrom its home on Earth? Even if some of them rejected the idea of reaching outto other life forms, perhaps for philosophical reasons, there may be others whohave embraced it.Clearly, there are hindrances to them contacting us. There is the problem ofdistance. We are constantly reminded by astronomers of the “astronomical”distances separating the stars. These are far beyond what human beings cantravel. There is also the question of how long technologically advancedcivilizations can last. Considering how quickly we have brought ourselves to thebrink of global disaster by means of nuclear weapons, natural resourcedepletion, and environmental pollution, we wonder if other technologicallyadvanced societies last very long before collapsing. Yet, as we will discussshortly, there may be a good reason to suppose that advanced civilizations canbe durable. They may even be more durable than their planets. It is possiblethat at least some of the UFOs are extraterrestrial visitors who no longer havea home world, or have exhausted its resources, and are travelers in space,stopping to re-source their ships for the rest of their journey.It is certainly possible that all of the diverse beings associated with UFOshave extraterrestrial origins. This scenario is still the odds-on favorite as anexplanation for UFOs. A Las Vegas oddsmaker would have to make this likelihoodthe one to beat.Still, other long-odds answers do exist.Intelligent MachinesIt may be possible that the Others are not alive in the sense that we are. Givenour rapidly approaching abilities in machines and artificial intelligence, andthe fact that other civilizations could be hundreds, thousands, or even millionsof years more advanced than us, it is possible that we are encountering contactwith the products of advanced machine intelligence.Most scientists involved in artificial intelligence research are convinced thatwe are on the verge of a new era in civilization: the age of intelligentmachines. Many of them also believe in the inevitability of an event they callthe Singularity.4 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos711616] This isbelieved to happen when computer intelligence becomes able to upgrade itself, toreprogram itself continuously, and become self-aware.Such a process could involve a rapid, exponential increase in computerintelligence, far surpassing human intelligence. Consider Moore’s Law. In 1965,Gordon E. Moore predicted that the number of transistors per integrated circuitwould double every 18 months. Incredibly, this has held true. In 1971, theleading integrated circuit had more than 2,000 transistors; by the year 2000that number was 42 million. In 2010, Intel unveiled the world’s first 2-billiontransistor microprocessor.Is there a critical mass in terms of hardware, software, connectivity, andstorage that will enable machines to foresee their own technological needs andredesign their software? Instead of requiring 18 months to double their power,what would be needed when artificially intelligent computers are assisting withthe research? Could the time be cut to 12 months? And when it becomes morepowerful still, to six months? Then three months, then one month—then what? Atthat point, as one AI writer put it, “our crystal ball explodes” and everythingwe know goes out the window.When will this happen? Many AI experts believe it could be anywhere from 2020 to2080. Some prognostications are unsettling. More than one scientist haspredicted, for all intents and purposes, a god-like level of intelligenceresiding within machines. Some, like Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems,have issued warnings. Others believe that Singularity may be the only way ourspecies can be saved from itself.Human beings are not suited to live in space, nor anywhere other than Earth. Weevolved here, with Earth’s unique gravity, magnetic fields, temperature,microbes, atmosphere, and food. To live elsewhere, we would need to be modified,perhaps so much that the result would be something entirely different than whatwe are now. A new species, created with some of our DNA, would probably be themost logical means of sending biological organisms to distant worlds. Unless, ofcourse, it is a better choice to let the machines go it alone.Was such a scenario played out somewhere else in our galaxy? Perhaps the answeris yes. If so, it could explain many elements of the UFO phenomenon. Why, forinstance, has no one announced themselves formally to us? Perhaps becauseestablishing relations with human beings on any level of parity makes no senseto a machine or artificial organism.On the other hand, an advanced machine intelligence might be interested in ourbiological resources. In order to interface with natural worlds, a machineintelligence might create biological entities for expressly that purpose.Presumably, the best way to do this would be by custom-creating entities fromthe DNA native to that particular planet. Our scientists are only beginning tounravel the secrets of DNA. But to an intelligent machine wanting a supply ofbiological organisms, such raw material could be very important.This brings us to the Grays. These creatures seem to be perfect candidates forartificially created beings. They appear to be gender-neutral, and manywitnesses claim they lack sex organs. This makes sense. Why would you want adrone-worker to have the ultimate distraction of sex organs, when you can makesuch creatures yourself? Author and abductee Whitley Strieber has described hisimpressions of the Grays as mechanical, working in a tight unison that would beunusual for biological creatures, but reasonable for mechanical ones.Abductees often describe a single Gray taller than the rest, who is “in charge.”They often report a procedure, sometimes called Mindscan, when the entity probesthe person’s mind telepathically and “sees” their innermost thoughts. This mightbe interpreted as tremendous psychic power possessed by the entity, but perhapssuch a thing could be done by implants within the brains of the alien being andabductee. For instance, it is now possible for chimpanzees to move a computercursor across a screen, solely by the power of thought—and a conveniently placedchip in the brain.Such news gives one pause when considering claims of alien implants within humanabductees. Could implants be more than mere tracking and storage devices? Couldthey also function as conduits to an advanced machine intelligence?Consideration of this theory weakens one of the main skeptical arguments againstUFOs: that advanced technological civilizations may not last very long. Skepticssee our own civilization spinning rapidly out of control and extrapolate thisfeature to intelligent life elsewhere. Now, advanced technology wielded bybiological entities may indeed be inherently unstable, but it is not so clearthat such a condition applies equally to advanced machine intelligence. If not,the extraterrestrial hypothesis—combined with advanced AI—becomes more tenableas a way to explain UFOs.As for understanding the motives of any artificial intelligences that are here,this might be as difficult to fathom as life beyond the Singularity. After all,if UFOs are the product of advanced machine intelligence, they passed that pointlong ago.Earth-Based EntitiesMaybe we know less about the Earth than we think we do. Under this theory, weare not the only intelligent life-form living on this planet. It might seemcounter-intuitive that another intelligent species could have evolved here onEarth without our knowledge. But one interesting possibility would be a branchof humanity itself. Is there enough time in the prehistory of humans on Earthfor a technologically capable civilization to have evolved and then, somehow,gone into hiding from the remainder of the human race?We might call this “the Atlantis theory.” Among scholars of alternative ancienthistory, there is a major school of thought contending that there was in factsuch a civilization, and that it suffered a cataclysm around 12,000 years ago.This cataclysm left its mark on later human groups in the form of myths aboutthe Great Flood.Perhaps an early civilization, one which attained great heights of science andlearning, did exist during such an antediluvian period. Could it be thatrepresentatives of that civilization continued on, but kept their knowledge tothemselves? Would they have interacted with the rest of humanity—mere savages bycomparison—and passed themselves off as gods? Could they then, over thefollowing thousands of years, have continued to develop as a quasi-secretsociety, partly interacting with the masses of humanity, but also continuingtheir own esoteric tradition, one in which they eventually developed flyingsaucers?As difficult as it might be to accept for many people, there is an undeniableneatness to the idea. It would explain the human-looking “extraterrestrials,”which would now not be extraterrestrial at all. Perhaps, too, these highlyadvanced humans conducted genetic manipulation to create the other types of“alien” entities.Again, we are left with the question of why we fail to see evidence of such ahuman civilization. But perhaps that is because they have merged themselves withus, effectively living among us. Another possibility is that the human-lookingentities that people encounter are indeed human, but were taken millennia ago byextraterrestrials. After thousands of years, they have been enhanced and made toseem like gods to the rest of us.Whatever the answer, we might wonder if they control human civilization whilestill maintaining themselves as a separate society. It also seems possible someof them have established permanent residence here. After all, we do have abeautiful planet.Extra- or Ultra-DimensionalThe people who lead the way in “out-of-the-box” thinking are the physicists.They openly discuss reality, perception, and nearly every other once-crazy ideain ways that demonstrate how the universe is much stranger than we everconsidered.It should not surprise us, then, to learn that some of them do not confine theircosmology to just one universe. Increasingly, they theorize about a“multiverse,” which includes other universes existing beyond the boundaries ofour own reality. There are several variants of this idea. The idea of “bubbleuniverses” is that some regions of space do not continue to expand or stretchalong with the rest of the universe. They form bubbles, which may containdifferent properties and physical constants, effectively resulting in multipleuniverses. Physicist Michio Kaku has skillfully argued that our universe may bejust one in an endless multiverse, a single bubble floating in a sea of infinitebubble universes. Another version of this idea is through an interpretation ofquantum mechanics by which something that is possible, but not realized in ouruniverse, may exist in another universe. A common analogy is that reality is amany-branched tree in which every possible quantum outcome is realized.5[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos711886]Common sense would have us believe that the Others have been separated from usby space; that they have traveled long distances to reach us. But could it bethat they coexist with us in the same space, only in a parallel reality? If so,traveling from “there” to “here” may not be about long journeys. Perhaps itinvolves some other form of transportation that simply crosses over the barrierin one way or another.It is conceivable, based on statements made by sober physicists, that there maybe multiple Earths in existence, perhaps an infinite number. Is it possible thatone of them has achieved the capability to travel from their version of ourplanet to ours? The mind reels, but scientists increasingly allow themselves tomuse about such matters and are (usually) not laughed at by their colleagues.This is hardly to say that the idea of multiple universes is establishedscience. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to test the theory. Thismeans it is possibly “unfalsifiable,” and therefore outside proper scientificmethodology. Some critics also argue that it seems contrary to Occam’s Razor asan explanatory principle of our reality. More to the point, it is not clearwhich of the several concepts of a “multiverse” would explain how beings couldtravel from one reality to another.There are many cases in the UFO literature describing objects that appear to“wink in” and “wink out” of our reality. Perhaps this means that they havemastered some sort of cloaking technology, or perhaps it means that they trulyenter and exit our reality.If an interdimensional explanation is true to some extent, it could explaincertain phenomena ranging from UFOs to ghosts and other paranormal activity. Itmay turn out they are “bleed-throughs” from other legitimate realities.Angels and DevilsThe written evidence from the earliest human societies suggests that peoplebelieved they had interactions with highly intelligent and powerful beings. Wehave described them by many names, including gods, fairies, angels, and devils.One possibility is that these are names we gave to arriving extraterrestrials,or perhaps to members of a lost, Atlantean civilization.The idea that ancient humans believed extraterrestrials were gods was madepopular in the 1970s by author Erich von Däniken. “If our own space travelershappen to meet primitive peoples on a planet some day, they too will presumablyseem like ‘sons of heaven’ or ‘gods’ to them,” wrote Von Däniken, in Chariots ofthe Gods. “Perhaps our intelligences will be as far ahead of the inhabitants ofthese unknown and as yet unimagined regions as those fabulous apparitions fromthe universe were ahead of our primitive ancestors.” Von Däniken’s writinginspired others, notably linguist Zecharia Sitchin, who wrote a series of bookson ancient Mesopotamia. Together, their speculations have been criticized andridiculed by professional scientists, historians, and archaeologists, yet foundexpression in films such as Stargate and The Fourth Kind.In a discussion that includes time travelers, multiverse visitors, intelligentdinosaurs, and self-replicating AI machines, let us now turn the argumentaround. If extraterrestrials can be interpreted as biblical angels and demons,can the opposite be true?If there are truly angels and demons that exist as part of God’s cosmictapestry, perhaps early humans saw them for what they truly were. Perhaps it ismodern humanity, with its technology and sci-fi movies, that errs ininterpreting the Others as extraterrestrials. From our perspective we like tosee our ancestors as confused, but could the confusion be ours?The late John Keel believed that UFOs were related to the demons, angels, andfairy tales of the past. The events described in that literature, he wrote, “aresimilar, if not entirely identical, to the UFO phenomenon itself…. Strangeobjects and entities materialize and dematerialize in these stories, just as theUFOs and their splendid occupants appear and disappear, walk through walls, andperform other supernatural feats.”6[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos712531]On various websites and ministries, many evangelical Christians have secondedthis belief. Although it may strike some as odd, there are many evangelicalsliving in America who know chapter and verse of the UFO cover-up, can lecture atlength on the difference between Project Grudge and Project Sign, and discussfamous sightings in great detail. They believe; they simply happen to disagreeas to the origin and the intention of these Others.Time TravelersFor science-fiction writers, time travel stories are catnip. Of course, theyusually work best when you don’t think too much about the scenario—just as SarahConnor mused while on the run in Mexico at the end of the first Terminator film.In 1993, the first original film for the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) Channel was OfficialDenial.7 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos712710] Although it wasabout the UFO cover-up, it contained a twist ending in which the question turnedout to be not where the aliens were from, but when they were from. The visitorswere not alien after all: they were ourselves. Having bred diversity from theirDNA in order to survive an environmental collapse, they had returned backward intime to save us, and thus to save themselves. The abduction of certain peoplewas part of a protocol to follow specific bloodlines that were important in DNAdevelopment and ancestry.Although such a left turn makes for a dramatic surprise, it also answers severalquestions about the Others, and in a surprisingly consistent manner. It explainswhy sightings increased markedly after the Second World War. That could simplybe the “jump time” when the modern age began truly to unfold. It also mightexplain why they have been seen throughout human history. Could it be that, in adifferent time stream, there were no “ancient aliens” visiting our ancestors,but that future time traveling humans made the decision to appear in our past?From our present-day perspective, we would perceive these visits as ancientwhen, conceivably, they might be occurring at the same time as ours.The notion of “aliens” as extratemporals, or time-traveling humans from thefuture, is intriguing, if a bit convoluted. Still, the idea of the Others asevolved, time-traveling, versions of ourselves has its own puzzles andinconsistencies. If people of the future are our visitors, then presumably thereis another time stream in which we do not have a UFO phenomenon—at least in theoriginal time stream where the decision was made to go back into the human past.Or does the whole thing go in some bizarre loop? For now, at least, time-travelis only theoretical (and according to many physicists, just barely). Moreover,the full weight of UFO sightings and reports do not easily fit the time-travelthesis.All of the AboveThe universe is not only bigger than can easily be grasped, but the rules bywhich it operates may be odder than we realize. Given this emerging scientificreality, it may be that there are multiple extraterrestrial groups who visit us,a real life Men in Black way-station.By way of analogy, if the United States is a tourist destination, why should theonly tourists come from Japan? What about the United Kingdom, China, Brazil, anda hundred other countries? If there is something on Earth that is interesting toone species of intelligent life, and if the universe is “teeming” with suchlife, then Earth may be a destination stop for many other life forms. Evenwithin a single group there may be multiple agendas.We can mix it up further. If they are not all extraterrestrial, there may bemultiple types of entities that are here, some of which include our othertheories. We may have extraterrestrials mixing with ultraterrestrials, andneither group may think much of the “home-grown” Earth-based Atlanteans. At thesame time, there may also be artificially intelligent and genetically enhancedcreatures tossed in for good measure.If the universe is as huge and diverse as we now believe it is, and life is rareenough to be interesting, but common enough to facilitate interaction, thenanything is possible.Question #2: What Do They Want?Obviously, this is a difficult question to answer. If only we knew who theywere, we might better grasp their intentions.It is clear that whoever these Others are, they have interacted with us on theirterms. This is not a relationship of equals. For many years, they havedetermined when they choose to encounter us, where they have encountered us, andthe nature of the encounter itself.It is distinctly possible, given the fact that we are so deep into a continuingcontact without a singular disclosure event, that they want little to do withus, or at least have no desire for open contact. The Brookings Reportanticipated this in 1960, stating, “If the intelligence of these creatures weresufficiently superior to ours, they might choose to have little, if any, contactwith us.” As Star Trek’s Gene Roddenberry would put it, they might have a PrimeDirective.There is a school of thought that sees the intentions of these beings aspredominantly peaceful and benign. This is the position of Dr. Steven M. Greer,director of the Disclosure Project, which has lobbied members of Congress andother government officials for full disclosure on the ET presence on Earth.“Obviously, any civilization capable of routine interstellar travel couldterminate our civilization in a nanosecond, if that was their intent,” Greerwrote in the “Disclosure Project Briefing Document,” released in April 2001.“That we are still breathing the free air of Earth is abundant testimony to thenon-hostile nature of these ET civilizations.”8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos713070]Implicit here is the idea of social evolution leading to the elimination ofsuffering and want. Accordingly, civilizations older than ours would haveachieved advances in everything from health to politics to resourcedistribution. For such civilizations, war would be unnecessary, perhapsunthinkable. With the attainment of all physical needs, the next journey wouldbe spiritual.Among people interested in the UFO/ET topic today, the idea is often takenfurther still. Some, for instance, claim that they communicate with such beingsvia telepathic messages or channeling. Usually, they claim that the message andintentions they receive is positive, that these beings are humanity’s teachersand even spiritual masters, nudging us to raise our level of consciousness, andpossibly gain admission into a larger galactic community.Although some of these foregoing assumptions, like those gained via channeling,are essentially unverifiable, those regarding the peaceful nature of advancedcivilizations can at least be argued for or against with a certain degree oflogic on either side. After all, it is not impossible to argue that if anadvanced civilization came from elsewhere to Earth, they must have found a wayto avoid the species suicide currently facing humanity. Somehow, they would havediscovered a way based on peace, not war. Author Michael Michaud described thisperspective as being a “contact optimist.”9[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos713257]It is not difficult to point out logical flaws in such a perspective, and indeedMichaud found it unpersuasive. First, just because the Others have notannihilated us so far, there is no inherent reason why they might not do so inthe future. Secondly, possessing advanced science and technology does notindicate superior ethics or spiritual evolution. The Nazi war machine of the1940s made use of very advanced technology and weapons for its time. Similarly,the warfare and weaponry of more recent years does not indicate any ethical orspiritual advancement on the part of humanity.Imagine our own time-travel experiment, in which a small group of 21st-centuryhumans were transported to medieval Europe, carrying a few of our trinkets ofcontemporary life. We arrange a meeting with some of the leading lights of thetime, perhaps philosophers and other scholars. They would notice our clothing,which would be of a craftsmanship and functionality they had never dreamed of.They would notice that we were substantially taller than they were, and in muchbetter health. Through us, they would learn some of the marvels of the world anduniverse. Then they would see our iPhones, laptops, e-readers, and bluetoothdevices—and probably see them as magical, certainly as vastly beyond theirwildest ideas of what was possible. They might very well conclude that we hadsolved all of our social and political problems, that we had discovered a way toimprove human life beyond measure, and that we must be a peaceful race; howcould it be that we had not destroyed ourselves—or them—despite our awesomepower?British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking advised caution when contacting aliens.He warned that if they were to visit us, “the outcome would be much as whenColumbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the NativeAmericans.” These remarks in 2010 stirred up a brief storm, particularly when hespeculated that aliens might want to raid Earth for its resources and then moveon. “I imagine they might exist in massive ships,” he wrote, “having used up allthe resources from their home planet. Such advanced aliens would perhaps becomenomads, looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach.”10[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos713501]Oddly, Hawking seemed to be speculating about “massive ships” in some kind ofhypothetical sense, but quite a few UFO sighting reports, including some bymilitary authorities, describe truly enormous craft. One example came from theChilean Air Force on December 16, 1978. The pilots of two F-5 fighter aircraft,on a training mission near the Chilean town of Mejillones, saw an enormousobject in the sky. Each of the airborne radar systems tracked it, as did groundcontrol, meaning there were three radar confirmations of it. The object gave aradar return equal to 10 or more aircraft carriers. It had been motionless, butas the pilots approached, it took off at an “unimaginable” speed to the west.All at once, the object vanished from all three radar screens. The Chilean AirForce acknowledged the encounter, but offered no explanation. What could itsay?11 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos713724]To UFO researcher Vince White, the phenomenon is disturbing. These giant ships,he wrote, “are carrying a giant something…[perhaps] whole armies over ourheads…[or] hauling resources out of this world we know nothing about.… Couldthere be unwilling and unlucky passengers aboard?”12[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos713968]Perhaps they have come to help, as Greer maintains, or to take, as Hawkinssuggests. Maybe they just like to observe. In the evidence gathered throughoutthe past six decades, there appear to be examples of each motivation.Let us take the example of the Grays, which may well be a type of cyberneticlife form. It could be that they are well suited for space travel, but less ableto function at their destination. Upon arrival, perhaps they are programmed toabduct some of the native inhabitants and bioengineer bodies that would allowthem to colonize. Such a plan would take quite a few generations, maybe evencenturies. In our typical human impatience, we might be inclined to argue that,because they have not zapped us into oblivion, they must be peaceful. Inaddition to the rejoinders offered earlier, we might ask why such visitors wouldwage open war and thereby destroy the planet they found so desirable in thefirst place? Second, in their time frame, it could well be that a centuries-longtakeover strategy is perfectly feasible and normal to them. Patience may betheir dominant trait.We do not know. To assume their intent is peaceful, based solely on theavailable facts, is not responsible. It is possible that the Breakaway Groupknows the answer. It is even possible that this group has collaborated with theOthers. But if any of that has happened, neither side is sharing with the restof us.Scientific ResearchScientists who contemplate UFO reality usually consider the Others to beresearchers, perhaps in part because they want to see extraterrestrial visitorsas being like themselves, only from space.It could be that we are being observed in a way that mimics our owninvestigation into native peoples around the world. The research project(humanity) might involve many factors: biology, technology, sociology, and soforth. German rocket pioneer Professor Herman Oberth, a man heavily involved inearly space age research, speculated that these “intelligent observers” hadobserved Earth’s lifeforms for centuries, “and more recently…atomic centers,armaments and centers of armament production.”13[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos714182]Perhaps some of the abduction phenomenon is explainable as scientificobservation. We tranquilize wild creatures, tag them with transmitters, thenrelease them to track and observe them. From time to time, we pick them up.Dr. Roger K. Leir has removed physical implants from alleged abductees, which hebelieves provide evidence of an alien tracking system. Many of the surgeries,which have been recorded on video, show bizarre, tiny objects being removed frompeople. According to Leir, these usually contain very sophisticated technologyhoused within a bio-membrane of some sort. The analysis of the implants, whileintriguing, still awaits independent confirmation.14[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos714405]A vastly advanced race might not see our technology as a sign of civilization.They may instead see us as inferior life forms, curiosities worthy of study.Membership CommitteeMaybe they see us in a more interesting light. It could be that we are currentlyThe Greatest Show in the Galaxy, about to transition to the next level ofwhatever it means to be a civilization.Perhaps a dormant project was kick-started when the human race crossed thenuclear threshold and created nuclear weapons. Thus, the Others could beobserving us as we are about to develop even more sophisticated technologies,enabling us to jump into their world, so to speak. If that were so, it seemsreasonable that they would observe us to determine our suitability to join agreater galactic community. That may be the reason behind the scientificresearch study.The example has been used that we might remotely observe a native culture fromthe sky in an aerial search, simply establishing that they exist. We might latermove in for a closer look, avoiding being seen. Later, we might allow ourselvesto be seen by members of the tribe who go back and describe strange visitors.Eventually, we might approach them, sit down, and talk.In such a manner, the UFO phenomenon might be seen as an acculturation andacclimatization process, whereby the Others allow us to see them more and morethrough time. Eventually, as years pass, perhaps they will initiate open andformal contact of their own accord, regardless of our own agenda and readiness.A continuing thread of UFO contact through the years has been the idea that theOthers are here to save us. Sometimes the impending danger is galactic, like anapproaching comet, and more recently the 2012 doomsday scenario. A dominant ideais that humanity is a threat to itself, that the planet cannot sustain humanover-population, weapons, pollution, and mismanagement. This line of reasoningdates to the Contactee reports of the 1950s, and has found some voice inabduction research to this day.They Want Our DNAMany abduction accounts include a sexual and reproductive dimension. When we addin fairly consistent witness testimony concerning human/alien hybrids, we get adisturbing scenario. In 1997, Temple University professor David Jacobs publishedhis book, The Threat. After extensive research into the alien abductionphenomenon, Jacobs argued that the Grays were creating a hybrid species designedto replace humanity and relegate us to an inferior status. As a result, theyhave kept their program remarkably secret, especially considering that they areintegrating themselves into our society and world.15[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos714694]The creation of an apparent alien-human hybrid species could mean one of twothings. First, that they seeking a way to merge with the existing humanpopulation. This does not necessarily portend evil for humanity. It might implythe continued existence of our species, albeit with an element surreptitiouslyadded into the mix. The second possibility is a replacement scenario, such asenvisioned by Jacobs. Human genetic material would be necessary in order for theextraterrestrial species to adapt to Earth’s ecosystem. This scenario isespecially disturbing, because some of the interactions recorded by Jacobsbetween the hybrid beings and normal humans have shown them to be cruel,sadistic, and emotionally dysfunctional. He believes their plan to bewell-organized, systematic, and a true threat to the human race.They Want Our SoulsWhitley Strieber has said that his abductors told him, “We recycle souls.” Otherresearchers have occasionally come across startling references from abducteesregarding the interest that these beings have in the human soul. This is achallenging topic to discuss, even in a book dealing with such impolite topicsas extraterrestrials, abductions, secret governments, and the like. In the firstplace, not all people even believe in the existence of a soul.Can a soul be taken? Can it be “rewritten”? Can it be of value to otherspossessing the ability to “take it”? Such claims have been made by peopleprofessing to know the truth. They may prove to be inherently unverifiable. Oneanonymous source, someone who claimed to have a lot of knowledge and wrotedetailed posts on the Usenet bulletin board system, claimed that duringabductions, “sometimes a person’s soul is temporarily removed” and placed in alead box, which effectively contains it. The reason is to prevent what happensnext from being recorded upon that soul, from becoming a part of that person’shistory. “But, perhaps more importantly,” the author concluded, “it doesn’tbecome a part of his history for others to read, either.”16[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos714953]Can such a thing be true, or is this complete fantasy? Can it go deeper thanthis? Does it?Another theory of abductions and the soul is connected to the belief inreincarnation. Eastern religions have maintained that the soul can incarnatewithin creatures of all types. Could it be, as some people claim, that soulshaving previously been in an extraterrestrial race are now incarnating intohuman bodies? Are there Star People among us—people who are human in everybiological and genetic sense, but who have the soul (literally) of anextraterrestrial?They Want Our WorldIf the Others are here, on our world, in our reality, interacting with us insome manner, then why? Could it be as simple as coveting our planet? Within thecontext of our vast cosmos, Earth is surely a paradise, blessed with naturalresources and an abundance of life. If beings from elsewhere come from a worldless abundant than our own, they may be developing a strategy to make Earththeir new home.The idea of extraterrestrials coming to Earth to enslave humankind has been ascience fiction staple since H.G. Wells invoked it more than a century ago inThe War of the Worlds. “Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to ourminds as ours are to the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool andunsympathetic, regarded this Earth with envious eyes,” Wells wrote in theopening to his book, “and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.” Eversince, in books and film and television projects, aliens have taken to trashingour world.Yet, it has hardly been the sole purview of sci-fi writers to invoke alienthreats. American war hero General Douglas MacArthur twice alluded to thepossibility of a future war between humanity and aliens from space. On oneoccasion in 1955, he reportedly told a journalist that “because of thedevelopments in science all the countries on Earth will have to unite to surviveand to make a common front against attack by people from other planets.” In1962, while speaking to the graduating class of West Point, he referred to“ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister forces of someother planetary galaxy.”17 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos715124]Ronald Reagan’s several statements concerning hypothetical alien invasions cometo mind. As someone who had been a UFO witness himself, and who (according tosources of the authors) was also briefed on the topic, it seems unlikely that hewas merely being whimsical.They Want NothingWhat if they are so far beyond us that we offer them nothing at all? Such apossibility has been raised many times throughout the years. Consider theinsights of Whitley Strieber, one of the few people who has openly discussed hisabduction and contact experiences, and is probably the most articulate of them.In our “classical” reality, he points out, when you flip a coin, you get eitherheads or tails. You cannot get both. But at the scale of the very small, realityworks differently: matter can be both wave and particle at the same time.Normally, this is because there is a strong interaction that prevents atoms fromgoing into “superposition” and becoming “indeterminate,” essentially everywhereat the same time.But, Strieber asks, what if we could control the degree to which our bodies werein such a state? What if, in addition to possessing quantum entangled neuronswithin our own brains, we could have quantum entanglement with all other humanbrains, and therefore have access to the knowledge and intellect of billions ofbrains? In that case, writes Strieber, “we would be radically, fantasticallydifferent from what we are. We would have the ability to spontaneously changeour appearance, or even become invisible. We would be able to not only extendour awareness across the whole of reality, but also to draw on our collectiveunderstanding to interpret what we see. We would, in short, be like ourvisitors.”18 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos716065]Of course, he points out, we are most certainly not like them. Theirconsciousness may exceed our own as much as ours exceeds that of the family dog.With perhaps total knowledge of the universe, such beings, according toStrieber, are at “the end of innovation,” something that “would be the mostprofound catastrophe that could befall an intelligent species.” In such asituation, “the quest for the new would take on an almost mythic urgency.” Thus,it would not be entirely true to say they want nothing from us. In effect, theymight be voyeurs who desperately seek to experience, if only vicariously, thefeeling of discovery accorded to humanity.In the same essay, Strieber argued that Disclosure could well “devastate thehuman mind.” For, if the Others appear in numbers, they will enter our minds.“And, I can assure, you,” he writes, “that kind of contact is as hard a thing asa human being can experience. It is an agony beyond terror. I know. I have beenthere.” He concedes that a few people will be able to handle it, but many willnot. They simply will not be ready, nor are they ever likely to be.Question #3: Are We Safe?In the news business, the question “Are we safe?” is the key question thatpeople want answered in any story, whether in an international story like 9/11or a local shooting. From our current perspective (observers who have beendenied certain key facts), trying to determine the threat posed by the Others isguess-work.Still, our “safety” involves some assessment of three criteria. First, howadvanced their technology happens to be. Second, how physically close they areto us. Third, what they want.[images/00035.jpg]Hiding their agenda? If they have come in peace, why have they not contacted usin an open way? Image by Amalgamated Dynamics, Inc.“If we believe their technology is not much better than ours, that they arebasically ‘good guys,’” wrote UC Davis psychology professor Albert Harrison in1997. “We will feel less threatened than if they have an overwhelming technicalsuperiority, are already in our neighborhood, and seem unfavorably disposedtoward humans.”19 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos716350]There are military men and women who have studied these questions, but we cangive quick provisional answers to them right here.First, their technology is clearly superior to our own. Despite scientists whoassert that interstellar or interdimensional travel is impossible, these beingshave managed to reach us, whatever and wherever their origins. Second, they arehere, and not phoning us from 50 light years away. Third, although there areneutral and even positive examples of interaction, there are some examplesindicating a lack of concern or empathy for humans, and even a few that appeardecidedly hostile.Their TechnologyThe capabilities of the Others are clearer to us than their intentions. A reviewof more than a half-century’s worth of UFO encounters gives us an idea of whatthey have, and what they can do. The results are unsettling.> [images/00012.jpg] Craft that can hover silently, indefinitely, and accelerate> instantly in any direction.> [images/00012.jpg] Craft that can negotiate upper atmosphere as well as> undersea conditions.> [images/00012.jpg] Exceptional stealth characteristics when desired, including> physical invisibility of craft and occasionally demonstrated radar stealth.> [images/00012.jpg] Advanced energy weapons that can disarm sophisticated> electronics, communications, and avionics systems in fighter aircraft (1976> Iranian jet fighter incident), or disarm nuclear weapons (1967 Malmstrom AFB> incident).> [images/00012.jpg] Apparent negation of gravitational effects, possibly by> creation of gravitational fields, making them independent of the need for> energy as we define it.> [images/00012.jpg] Management of space-time, possibly indicating some level of> mastery of time itself, even possibly including knowledge of “time streams.”> [images/00012.jpg] Creation of physical paralysis in human beings by means of> apparent light beams or related phenomenon.> [images/00012.jpg] Induction of a range of human physiological or emotional> responses, including terror, unnatural calm, lethargy, or sleep (“switching> off” people during abductions).These might be considered some of the more standard military capabilities. Wewill ignore the possible existence of more substantial weapons, whether these benuclear, scalar, laser, or some other obvious offensive weapon. These may wellexist, and could certainly be intuited from the technical abilities of the craftthemselves, but the open UFO literature does not give us much informationregarding such weaponization.Infiltration of SocietyThere may be another capability that exists, something potentially morenefarious. Is it possible that some of them have found a way to infiltrate humansociety? If so, have they infiltrated the human power structure? Suchspeculation seems better suited for the plotline of a novel, movie, or videogame than for real life. However, from the point of view of any alien specieshere on Earth, it would be valuable to have some of the native populationworking for them. Perhaps this is best achieved through bribery, or through acombination of implants and mind control. Or, possibly, by means of breedingtheir own human population, and even providing them with variousenhancements—genetically, biologically, technologically—to make them morefunctional, more formidable.Included in the legacy of the late abduction researcher Budd Hopkins is hisemerging conclusion that not all aliens look “alien.” In his 2003 book, SightUnseen, coauthored with Carol Rainey, Hopkins published several accounts thatsuggested human-looking people who were decidedly odd in various ways, and whowere connected with abduction experiences, often in a helper-type of capacity.It was unclear who these beings were; Hopkins and Rainey suggested they were atype of “transgenic” being, or alien-human hybrid. If so, they were human-enoughlooking to “pass” without too much problem, essentially being seen as eccentricand little more.20 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos716596]Two other anecdotal pieces may fit in the puzzle.During the late 1980s, retired government scientist Dr. Eric Walker conducted aseries of correspondence and telephone interviews with various UFO researchers.Walker had been a friend of President Dwight Eisenhower. Similar to Ike’sbrother Milton, he had also been president of Penn State University. Mostsignificant, Walker was a former chairman of the Institute for Defense Analysis,one of the most important think tanks in the nation. Simply put, Walker kneweverybody who was anybody.Now, Walker decided to talk. After he confirmed the existence of MJ-12 to aresearcher, he told him that he was “chasing after and fighting with windmills….You are delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about…. Forgetabout it!” Yet, the persistent researcher was later able to get Walker to saymore. There was a “machine” recovered, said Walker, “obviously a landing vehicleonly, fully within the realm of current knowledge. Four normal looking maleswere with it, very much alive. Yet, Walker’s implication was that they were nothuman.For the next few years, Walker had sporadic communications with otherresearchers with whom he continued to discuss this topic. One of his moreintriguing statements was, “How good is your mathematics?” The researcheranswered, “As good as it could be for a doctor in physics. But why?” Walkerreplied, “Because only a very few are capable in handling this issue. Unlessyour mind ability is like Einstein’s or likewise, I do not think how you canachieve anything.” Then Walker asked more questions: “How good is your seventhsense? How much do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it, and know how touse it, you would not be taken in. Only a few know about it.”To all appearances, Walker decided to let his guard down with an occasionalresearcher or two. If so, could it be that beings looking perfectly human, butwith exceptional abilities, have merged on a limited basis into society?Another account concerns the government “remote viewer,” Ingo Swann. During themid- to late-1970s, Swann was engaged in nothing less than psychic espionage onbehalf of the U.S. intelligence community. As part of the cadre of remoteviewers, his job was to learn things that were difficult to learn otherwise,including such things as the location of Soviet submarines, the inside layout ofcertain embassies, and so on.21[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos716830] In the course of such work,it was not unusual for the remote viewers to catch the attention of clandestineprograms to participate in various projects. On one occasion, Swann wascontacted by a “Mr. Axelrod,” and met with him at a secure underground facility,where he was brought blindfolded by two military-looking men whom he describedas “the twins,” because of their identical appearance and coordinated movement.Axelrod never told Swann what agency he belonged to, but was very interested intesting Swann’s ability to remote view the moon (whereupon Swann claimed to seebeings who became aware of him). Axelrod also took Swann to a remote forestedarea, where they waited until a triangular UFO appeared, as if on cue, and Swannwas later asked for his impressions of the object. The program, in other words,had all the earmarks of a counter-intelligence operation by a group of ETs whohappened to look human.22 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos717175]The human race may have a serious challenge not only from advanced weaponry, buta fifth-column. Presumably, the military and intelligence forces of theworld—the U.S. in particular—have already caught the assignment of dealing withthis. The question is, are they up to it?Our Military PreparednessIf our feelings are mixed After Disclosure, nowhere will this be more true thanwhen we consider the military. After all, it will be seen as the initialarchitect of the secrecy, triggering feelings of anger and hostility. Yet, therewill be a strong feeling that it is necessary for possible defense, at leastuntil people understand who these other beings are.There will be much second-guessing, and many forthright questions. Has themilitary succeeded or failed in protecting humanity from a dire threat? Has itacted in an aggressive manner with peaceful visitors? Can we expect it to betruthful now, after generations of denial and deception?Some will fault the military for its secrecy, and for failing to keep citizenssafe. To this, it will undoubtedly respond that it has kept people safe, or atleast as safe as possible, and that secrecy was the only rational path towardaccomplishing this goal, given the potential threat.Of course, the U.S. military will continue to be secretive. It will have nointerest in revealing that it failed to protect its own airspace, nor that asuperior force was able to engage and defeat its best technology and pilots. Thephysical evidence of bodies and wreckage will not be forwarded without a legalbattle. Photos and reports will need to be subpoenaed. Its assessment of thecapabilities of the Others will need to be pried out, if that is even possible.Still, it is inevitable that the long history of military encounters with UFOswill come out. Our history of contact in the skies includes hundreds ofconfirmed, excellent cases where military pilots and observers saw actualphysical craft. In a number of these instances, jets were scrambled to interceptand fire on them. An unknown but possibly substantial number of pilots have beenlost through the years.23 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos717398]Many former high-level military officers have spoken publicly about the realityof UFOs and their evaluation of our own capabilities. Consistently, they haveindicated that our militaries are outclassed.In an A.D. world, however, will the military protect us? To what extent will itneed to? If, as it appears on a basic level, humanity has had a confrontationalrelationship with the Others, a logical question will be whether we have createdrevolutionary technologies with which to defend ourselves.Do We Even Have a Chance?The history of abductions, mutilations, and attempted jet interceptions make itreasonable to suppose that at least some of these Others are not here forscience or diplomacy. If so, we may assume that Earth’s militaries have workeddiligently to play catch-up.If the limits of current military capabilities were what is known publicly, itwould still be a powerful arsenal of weapons.Consider the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world today, the LockheedMartin F-22 Raptor. It employs stealth technology for such missions as airsuperiority, ground attack, and electronic warfare, along with signalsintelligence. In addition to stealth, the aircraft is renowned for its speed,agility, precision, and situational awareness.Or the “stealth cruise missile,” also developed by Lockheed Martin. It is saidto cost less and work better than the famous Tomahawk cruise missile. It carriesa 1,000-pound warhead, which can be fitted with nuclear, chemical, conventional,or biological weapons. As a stealth aircraft, it is able to reach its targetundetected (by known human technologies) and fire its low observable payloadfrom a distance. Enemies that are hit are taken by total surprise.24[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos717575]Lasers would be of obvious interest in any military engagement with the Others.Currently, the U.S. military uses lasers for targeting and other nonlethalpurposes. No doubt these are helpful for battlefield troops, but they are notthe kind of offensive weapons needed to shoot down a flying saucer. Yet, openliterature indicates that we are fast approaching significant capabilities. In2009, Northrop Grumman announced it had built and tested an electric lasercapable of producing a 100-kilowatt ray of light, the long-sought-after “magicnumber,” which is powerful enough to destroy an airplane or a tank.25[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos717777] The U.S. Navy is expectedto incorporate lasers in the near future. One of these, a solid-state lasersystem designed by Northrop Grumman, was described by a program manager with theOffice of Naval Research as “like a high-powered sniper rifle, except with muchmore range.”26 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos718099]Whether these weapons would be capable of knocking out UFOs, however, isdebatable. Effective military action against the Others would surely require arange of sophisticated technologies. It is a good bet that within the deeplyclandestine world of the Breakaway Group, there is still more.The idea that a breakaway civilization may have developed parallel to ourexisting society, fueled by black-ops money for generations, is the ultimatedouble-edged sword. On one level, it is outrageous for governmental authoritiesto have operated on such a massive scale with no citizen oversight. On the otherhand, if we have recovered alien technology throughout the years, we may havedeveloped our own program that is aimed at the likelihood of conflict some daywith the Others.If the motives of at least some races of the Others are harmful, then the worldafter Disclosure will be faced with an ends-justified-the-means argument.Although that issue will be sorted out in all its complexities by futureofficials and courts, it is possible now, through a combination of leaks, logic,and observation, to gain a reasonable idea of what “the program” might be allabout.It appears that a portion of the time, money, and effort has been expendedtoward trying to make a flying saucer of our own. Testimony regarding therecovery of crashed UFOs, reverse-engineering programs, insider claims (such asone to aviation journalist James Goodall that “we have things out there that areliterally out of this world”), and the many eyewitness accounts of UFOs overGroom Lake and Antelope Valley all support this hypothesis.There is evidence that man-made flying saucers have existed since at least the1960s. One confirmed photograph from 1966, taken not far from Dugway ProvingGround in Utah, hints strongly of terrestrial manufacture, as it is nearlyidentical in shape to a craft video recorded inside Nevada’s Nellis Test Rangein 1994, and which was leaked to the television show Hard Copy. The movements ofthe Nellis UFO have been analyzed in detail, indicating extraordinaryperformance characteristics (such as making a right angle turn at 140 mph). Thatit was recorded deep inside one of the most secret U.S. testing ranges gives usreason to suspect that the Nellis UFO was of terrestrial manufacture. That is,one of ours.In between the 1966 Utah UFO and the 1994 Nellis UFO are a multitude of leaksconcerning a clandestine program to manufacture flying saucers. The mostintriguing of these concerns three craft that were said to be in a large hangarat Lockheed’s facilities in Helendale, California, in November 1988, just afterthe presidential election. The main witness, aviation designer Brad Sorensen,told only a few people of what he saw, but what he claimed was astounding.Accompanied by a senior member of the Defense Department, Sorensen says he saw,“three flying saucers floating off the floor—no cables suspended them from theceiling holding them up, no landing gear underneath—just floating, hoveringabove the floor.” These are the words of aviation illustrator Mark McCandlish,the first person to whom Sorensen told his story.Nearby, a general was speaking at a lectern to a group of people. He referred tothe vehicles as “Alien Reproduction Vehicles,” as well as Flux Liners, becausethey used high voltage electricity. He mentioned several fascinating features ofthe ARV. One was that it could perform at “light speed or better.” Another wasthat it ran on energy obtained through the vacuum—presumably this is theso-called zero-point energy field. It was also apparently stated that the ARVhad already performed a general reconnaissance of all planets of the solarsystem in a search for life, and that no life was found. Sorensen noted that theARV looked “ancient,” and as though it had been used extensively. A videoexhibit nearby showed the smallest of the three vehicles hovering over a drylake bed. It made three quick, hopping motions, then accelerated straight up andout of sight within seconds. It was unclear whether the vehicle was silent, orwhether the tape simply lacked sound.27[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos718532]A key point about the ARV that Sorensen described to McCandlish: It wasessentially identical in appearance with the 1966 Utah UFO and the 1994 NellisUFO.The ARV story, which is unconfirmed, indicates that there is a secret spaceprogram. Indeed, there is evidence of anomalous activity in Earth’s orbit. Oneresearcher, Jeffrey Challender, collected hundreds of unusual events that wererecorded on space missions from the United States, Russia, Europe, and China.Some of these clearly have prosaic explanations. Others, are not so clear.28[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos718696] Also of interest in thiscontext is the collection of satellite data provided by researcher Ron Regehr.During the 1990s, while working with the military contractor Aerojet, Regehrfortuitously obtained a printout of data from the U.S. Defense Support Program(DSP), which made it clear that “fastwalkers” (e.g. space-based UFOs) aretracked with regularity.29 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos719023]If these anomalies are genuine, they provide ample reason to develop a secretspace program. It would be necessary to interact with that phenomenon in someway, whether through investigation, communication, or hostilities. For thisreason, there is a possibility that the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)program initiated during the Reagan years housed a covert component related toUFOs, even if that was not its main mission.But there is more to “the program” then secret flying saucers and spacemissions. It also appears to be about studying alien bodies and conductingrelated biotech research. Less information exists on this, but at least onesource described it to a UFO investigator as early as the 1970s. The need forsuch a program would be obvious if alien bodies were ever recovered. In terms ofmilitary application, clandestine biotech research may have aided in someimportant areas. Simply having an example of an advanced non-human life formcould spark advances in the understanding of our own biology and physiology, letalone that of an extraterrestrial species. Biotechnology has become veryimportant to the military. It has been and will continue to be important in thetreatment of war injuries, prevention and diagnosis of diseases, and protectionagainst biochemical toxic agents. It can enhance human battle effectiveness(even to the point of creating “super soldiers”), and enable the creation ofsmall-scale or ultramicro-scale destructive biological weapons.30[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos719222]There may be another activity that deeply clandestine military groups have beenconducting in order to meet the real or perceived alien threat: Performing theirown abductions, a phenomenon that goes by the abbreviation of MILABs, formilitary abductions.MILABs have been discussed publicly since around 1990, although they may havebeen going on longer than that. One of the earliest writers on the subject, Dr.Karla Turner, interviewed a number of abductees who had been taken by human andnon-human groups. Other MILAB victims also came forward to describe theirstories. It would appear that some of them were taken by human groups as acounter-intelligence operation, in an attempt to learn the alien agenda. Througha combination of chemicals, hypnosis, and perhaps other technologies, attemptswere made to extract the memories of the victims that were then wiped, or atleast tampered with, so that it took them years to begin learning the truth ofwhat happened to them.Just as the idea of alien abduction remains controversial and is subject toskepticism, so too is the idea of military abductions, possibly even more so. Tosome, the idea is preposterous, as the deeply criminal nature of the act seemsbeyond the pale, to say nothing of being too risky to undertake. After all, therepercussions of being caught would be catastrophic for any organizationperforming them.The problem, however, is that there is a certain amount of abduction researchthat points in this direction. Moreover, if some of the previously mentionedindications are true, it is not hard to see why the risk of MILABs would beundertaken. It may be that the Breakaway/Majestic Group is behind the MILABphenomenon, using its subjects to learn about the Others. But there may be moreto all this than simple counter-intelligence. Some MILAB abductees haveindicated a strong interest by human black-ops groups in psi phenomena. Indeed,Eric Walker had hinted years before that psi was important in understanding theOthers.This takes us to what may be a crucial element of the abduction phenomenon, bothalien and human. Why are the abductees taken in the first place? Jacobs,Hopkins, and others argued it is for breeding hybrids. But that begs thequestion of whether abductees are taken at random, or specifically chosen for areason. Information that has come to the authors indicates that some of theanswer relates to psi abilities that have been identified in the subject, andthat this is of interest to the Others.It also appears to be of interest to the Breakaway/Majestic Group, which,according to several cases the authors have investigated, puts these people towork as psychic spies of sorts, making sure to manage their memories as much aspossible. We know that remote viewing was an active interest in certain parts ofthe U.S. intelligence community from the 1970s until at least the 1990s, and wealso know the program had several spectacular successes. Why close downsomething that is proven to work, and especially something that may prove usefulin the struggle to understand the agenda of the Others?If the Others have spacecraft that exceed our capacity, it seems likely thathumanity would want to build some of its own. And if the clandestine leaders ofthe human race thought they were fighting a deceptive battle with enemies thatemployed psychic abilities, they would want to improve their talents in thatregard. If Mr. Axelrod, perhaps representing a human-looking group of Others,was trying to test the ability of human remote viewers to detect his group, itcould well be that the Breakaway Group employs such people, some who may havefull knowledge of what they are doing, but perhaps some who do not.What has been going on behind the scenes for so many years may be humanity’sattempt to fight fire with fire. If that is so, the idea that we could be burnedis not outrageous. If relations with the Others becomes aggressive in the worldA.D., humanity will be up against formidable strength. Might they have“doomsday” weapons that could shatter our planet?Again, one sees the irony of our situation. If the Others are hostile, the worldwill probably not complain that the secret-keepers diverted so much black budgetmoney into creating flying saucers and other weapons. When the cards are laid onthe table, people may be thankful that our hand has a few aces.Who Do They Think We Are?Whether they have traveled from other worlds or other dimensions, Others havearrived in our neighborhood.If they are new arrivals, we might gather that they would have passed through anatmosphere filled with satellites processing huge quantities of information,including radio, television, and other digital media blanketing the globe. Wehave no idea whether this massive amount of information—which overwhelmsus—would have the same effect on them, or whether they would have systems,computers, and intelligence that could find patterns and sense in it that mightsurpass our own understanding. Much of the electronic data they sift would beexpendable mediocrity, like a re-run of Mork and Mindy. Some of it would havebeen more edifying, such as our greatest examples of art, music, literature, andphilosophy. Some would be the historic record of man’s folly—a self-createdcatalogue of our own sins from the Spanish Inquisition to the massacres ofRwanda and beyond. That is just the material available at a distance.Of course, they may have scouted and monitored us for a long time. We canspeculate that they would quickly come to understand some basic concepts.First, they would realize that we are not a hive-minded species that practicesgroup-think. Instead, they would see a great variety and complexity in theexpression of human thought, culture, and ways of life. They might view this assomething positive or—if they are hive-minded themselves—as a fatal flaw. Theymay have thought that the outpouring of grief over Steve Jobs, a man who urgedus to “Think Different,” was curious or threatening.Second, they would realize that we are an aggressive species. Not all of us, butenough of us. They would see that humanity has devoted great resources to amilitary footprint extending from nation to nation across the planet. Not onlyare our space weapons, bombs, fighter jets, and wars-in-progress easily seen,but they appear to have tested them as to capability with some regularitythroughout the years.They would also observe the vast disparities in our allocation of resources andwealth, in which billions of people live in abject poverty while a very few livein opulent luxury. Perhaps they disapprove, or perhaps this is the way of theirworld, too. All we really can say is that they will notice everything from thethe groundswell at Tahrir Square to the 2011 anarchy in the UK to the struggleto Occupy Wall Street.They might also have concluded that we have overpopulated the Earth to the pointof impending resource exhaustion, species extinction, and ecological disaster.Abductee reports commonly refer to the Others providing mental imagery ofEarthly environmental collapse. Belief that they are here to save us fromourselves may only be wishful thinking on our part, or it could be a clue as totheir agenda. They might be here to help us save our sinking boat. Or they couldbe here to take it away from us, given our careless stewardship.Perhaps the best that we can hope for is to be viewed as we are: a mixed bagfull of highs and lows, capable of deeds both awful and sublime, simultaneouslygreedy and generous, hateful and loving, warlike and peaceful. If they are herein peace, we may hope that they will see us as an evolving work-in-progress, anintelligent species worth watching and nurturing. If they are here for moreselfish purposes, they might see our short-comings as flags of caution for them,knowing that humans can never be counted out, and will fight when cornered.[images/00038.jpg][images/00041.jpg][images/00001.jpg][images/00004.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5Blowback: Collateral Damage and Unintended Consequences> > Fear defeats more people> > than any other one thing in the world.—Ralph Waldo EmersonHumans are a very adaptable species. When our living conditions change, whetherit involves going to prison or winning the lottery, we alter our attitudes andexpectations. Although Disclosure of the reality of the Others will result in agreat shock, people will adapt in the long run; there will be little choice.During the days, months, and even years following The Great Event, however, suchoptimism may be in short supply. In 1954, Carl Jung warned of the danger ofwaiting too long to inform the public. In the event that extraterrestrials wereconfirmed and were visiting Earth, he wrote, humanity as a whole would be in the“precarious position of primitive communities today in conflict with thesuperior culture…the rudder would be removed from our grasp.” The result couldbe catastrophic. The surest way to avoid this would be for the authorities “toenlighten the public as soon and as completely as possible.”1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos719565]Jung wrote those words more than 50 years ago. If he were alive today, he wouldprobably look at Disclosure as fraught with even greater danger, for our day ofenlightenment has been delayed far beyond reason.After decades of cover-up, in which institutions have been subverted and peopleridiculed, simply lifting the veil will not solve every problem. On thecontrary, it will create new ones.More than 40 years ago, the Condon Report noted in its Introduction, “If, asmany people suspect, our planet is being visited clandestinely by spacecraft,manned or controlled by intelligent creatures from another world, it is the mostmomentous development in human history.” Nothing has changed since those wordswere written, except that the cover-up, by its durability, has placed manyinstitutions front-and-center of any backlash to Disclosure.The world’s governments and military powers will be immediately exposed fortheir deceit. To be sure, they will portray themselves as having hidden thetruth for the public’s own good. Some people will accept these reasons; otherswill not. Even under the most favorable circumstances, however, there will beblowback.We mean “blowback” to signify unintended consequences and collateral damagesfrom a covert operation. This particular one, which has lasted seven decades, isamong the greatest secrets ever kept. Who will get singed in the reaction? Whowill escape with the least damage?The specifics of what will happen will be heavily influenced by the Others. Willthey have a high-touch or benign-neglect policy toward us? Will they show us howto achieve cheap or free portable energy, or will they make us feel that we areunder imminent threat? Or will we simply be forced to live in the twilight,where their agenda remains unclear or hidden? Each possibility will have its owntransformative policies. Each will aim the blowback at different institutions.Being a loser in the eyes of the public is not always catastrophic. During thefirst year A.D., although the public may distrust the military, it will stillwant it for protection. The media, too, will be widely condemned as truthbunglers and national security sycophants. Yet, it will still be the main avenueby which people get information about the new circumstances, although notwithout great challenges. The educational system may have had its head in thesand, but students will still need to go to school.Indeed, we believe that the greatest blowback will happen on the streets—and itwill not matter where they are. From Beijing to New York City and every locationaround the world where people are dependent on the reliable delivery systems ofmodern society, the hot wind of truth will set some fires. Expect to seesomething resembling a global riot to spread like a forest fire, like OccupyWall Street gone global and on steroids, either feeding on itself until it burnsout, exhausted from lack of fuel, or else developing into an even greaterconflagration.The Great Panic of Year OneNot everyone believes that the Great Announcement will lead to panic and mayhem.As we noted earlier, one of the earliest UFO researchers, Donald E. Keyhoe,regularly voiced his belief that people can handle the truth. “We have survivedthe stunning impact of the Atomic Age,” he wrote. “We should be able to take theInterplanetary Age, when it comes, without hysteria.”2[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos719738]That was 1950; six decades ago. More recently, Admiral Lord Peter Hill-Norton,who served as the United Kingdom’s Chief of Defence and the head of NATO’smilitary committee, argued that even if UFOs turned out to be ofextraterrestrial origin, life would go on. People in the 21st century will notpanic, he believed. “They are much more interested in doing the pools or thelottery. They would shrug their shoulders and take it as a matter of course.”3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos719924]And yet the keepers of the secret might not agree. One of America’s legendaryastronauts, Colonel Gordon Cooper, believed fear of panic to be central. In1985, he testified before a United Nations panel that UFO secrecy was “imposedon all specialists in astronautics.” Every day, he said, radar instruments wererecording objects “of form and composition unknown to us.” But the authoritiesconceal this information because of how they believe people will react. “So thepassword still is: We have to avoid panic by all means.”4[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos720215]The question of public panic always hangs over this issue, and this must be animportant concern of the Breakaway Group. Certainly many people would take thenews in stride, as much as one could expect under the circumstances. Althoughthese things are inherently impossible to measure, the argument can be made thatpeople of the 21st century are better able to handle the great shock inherent ina Disclosure statement then their grandparents would have been. A lifetime ofpopular culture dealing with extraterrestrials may have prepared thempsychologically to some extent.But there has always been a certain percentage of UFO witnesses who experiencedeep, powerful fear during their sighting. For many, it is the most intense,overwhelming fear of their life. The history of UFO encounters is replete withexamples of witnesses who became hysterical, filled with sheer terror. What washappening to them was the shattering of a once-solid worldview, and a suddenfeeling of powerlessness in the face of an unknown and alien intelligence. Noteveryone collapses at such a time, but some do.After Disclosure, even the panic of a minority of people will pose a seriouschallenge to society. If as few as 10 percent of the people have a deeplynegative reaction to the news, there will be dramatic repercussions. If thatnumber is 20 or 30 percent, so much the worse. The manner of Disclosure will beall-important, but for some, any Disclosure at all will push them close to theedge. Others will go right over.It would be nice if the world could plan for this extraordinary event as it didfor Y2K, when computer scientists methodically tweaked our technology inpreparation for the Year 2000. In order to do that regarding Disclosure,however, it must be handled openly. Books similar to this one can be written,but realistically most people will not see what is coming until it is on top ofthem. Besides, no amount of planning can conceivably cover all thecontingencies. We must expect the unexpected. Exopolitics activist StephenBassett once stated, accurately we believe, that Disclosure will “mark the birthof a new world.”5 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos720569] And howcan anyone truly prepare for that?Reaction will be full of contradictions. Some will see it as humanity’s besthope for survival. Others will see it as a harbinger of catastrophe. Only timeand shared experience will allow these two groups to begin to see things throughthe same set of eyes.None of this is an argument to postpone the event. Despite what anyone wants,what anyone feels is right, Disclosure will happen. It is only a matter of time.In later years, long after the fact, our memories will recall the frightening,thrilling, challenging, arduous, and momentous time.The Fire SpreadsFor a time, however, people may feel like Japanese civilians walking through therubble in Hiroshima in 1945—dazed, frightened, and unable to fully comprehendwhat just happened. The first 12 months will be so challenging because thestrife and deprivation that accompany them will largely feel self-inflicted byhumans, not the Others.In the immediate aftermath, the world will go to red alert. People will hoard.It is a natural human reaction, seen repeatedly throughout history when peoplereceive destabilizing news. Workplace productivity will drop for a time, as eachworkplace will have some employees who will not cope well. Distribution systemswill sag. Perhaps the driver who drives the truck to your local supermarketevery Thursday has a nervous breakdown, or is hurt in a looting incident. Otherdrivers will be found, but perhaps not immediately nor reliably.Store shelves will soon look thin and picked over. Bulk buys will be upeverywhere and consumers will stock up in massive quantities, beyond what theyhave done before. The Wal-Marts and Costcos will hire extra security, issuelottery numbers, and limit purchases. Even so, a week after the announcement ismade, most of them will be temporarily closed, waiting for re-supply. The blackmarket on the streets for common items like toilet paper, aspirin, and cannedsoup will thrive.The shortages will trigger fear, which will trigger more hoarding and moreshortages in a vicious cycle that may last the greater part of that first year.Panic will express itself in two forms of personal behavior. Some people willpull in, shut themselves inside, watch the news, and wait to see how things playout. Others will need to get out, feeding off the company of friends andcoworkers in order not to be alone as they sort out the changes.[images/00021.jpg]Sorting the winners from the losers. The Great Panic of Year One starts thechaotic process. Japan earthquake aftermath, 2010. Photo courtesy of KellyKaneshiro, via Wikimedia Commons, public domain.If, during the initial announcement, people shrugged their shoulders, they willnot be doing so now. Every day will bring a new set of headlines reporting theforward momentum of contact. Even the old headlines, which will still be withus, will be reported differently. The earthquakes, volcanoes, bombings,assassinations, and other calamities will be seen through a different filter.Suspicion will rule, not merely directed at the government or the Others, but ateach other. Today, only a small, fringe group of people believe aliens walkamong us. That will change after Disclosure. During the first year A.D., you maybe viewed with suspicion by other people, and if you are an average type ofperson, you might look at your own neighbors and friends that way.People with second homes may flee to them. As the days turn into weeks, however,they will realize that supplies in their mountain and sea communities are evenlower than where they came from. And the news will carry reports of unattendedhomes being robbed. They will return home to protect what they have and wait itout. If they are not armed, they will pay a premium to get that way.Sales of guns will be up at least 500 percent from the previous year. The numberof arrests for driving with a concealed weapon will skyrocket. Police officerswill stop making routine traffic stops because they will not risk getting shot.The number of domestic gun accidents will reach an all-time high.Because of the initial looting and riots, martial law will be common in much ofthe world, and some of the largest cities will be first. As smallermunicipalities see how it has worked, they too will experiment with it in orderto calm nerves, although martial law will undoubtedly make matters worse in manyplaces.For those who live through it, A.D. will be remembered as a great surprise,followed by an ominous feeling about how deeply the world changed. People willlook back at how they endured it all, just so they could return to a good lifethat they hoped will still be there, much like how an earlier generation viewedthe Great Depression.Cracked FoundationsLike everything else in life, Disclosure will come with winners and losers.Certain institutions will suffer a loss of confidence, because they eitherparticipated in the secret (government, military) or, by virtue of their nichein society, should have alerted the public (media, academia).Others will have to adjust their business models because they operated in goodfaith that UFOs were bunk. Now, realizing they were duped, they will have tocope and change. Those sectors include the economy, industry, and the legalsystem.These are all familiar institutions that will be changed by Disclosure. There isone, however, that will be unfamiliar to almost everyone. That will be theBreakaway Group. Its members, hidden for so long, will now be exposed. In theimmediate world, A.D., these people will be a target for public anger andhostility, the kind previously reserved for arrogant Enron, AIG, and BritishPetroleum executives.GovernmentThere will be great fury directed at the governments of the world, in particularthe U.S. government. Their salvation will be to acknowledge their complicity andshow the public that they are doing all they can to atone for past sins. Thepath to renewed legitimacy will be to align with the incensed public against thesecret-keepers themselves. One of the great issues of the age will be whetherthis occurs.Among the many hard questions will be, “Where were our elected representativesfor all these years?” We know that most members of Congress were kept in thedark, but that hardly means they should have ignored the signs, the stories fromtheir constituents, the warnings from experts, and the prodding from a few oftheir own who were laughed at rather than embraced. Instantly, Capitol Hill willcome alive with a fervor to investigate.The United States Senate has never held open hearings on the subject of UFOs.The House of Representatives has held two, both of which were limited.The first one was initiated in 1966 by House Minority Leader (and future U.S.president), Gerald R. Ford of Michigan. UFOs were turning up all over his state,and he called for hearings. When the House Armed Services Committee convenedthem, only three individuals testified. All were connected to the Air Force’sProject Blue Book: Harold Brown, secretary of the Air Force; Dr. J. Allen Hynek,scientific consultant to the Air Force; and Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., chiefof Project Blue Book. As a result, Air Force Secretary Harold Brown announcedthe formation of an independent review of Project Blue Book and current UFOcases. The University of Colorado was soon contracted to conduct a “scientificstudy of UFOs.” This was the infamous Condon Committee.The second congressional hearing on UFOs took place in July 1968 by the HouseCommittee on Science and Astronautics. This was during the final stages of theCondon Committee. This time, six scientists testified and six others submittedprepared papers. One who testified, atmospheric physicist Dr. James E. McDonald,recommended the rapid escalation of “serious scientific attention to thisextraordinarily intriguing puzzle.” Another expert, UCLA Engineering professorDr. Robert Baker Jr., called for a government-sponsored UFO action andinvestigation team. In fact, of the six scientists who testified, five thoughtUFOs presented a genuine scientific anomaly that demanded further study (onlyDr. Carl Sagan disagreed).But within months, the Condon Committee concluded that there was no convincingscientific evidence for UFOs, and recommended closing Project Blue Book. WhenBlue Book was disbanded in 1969, the United States government officially got outof the UFO business.That is the sum total of U.S. Congressional action regarding UFOs. Most membersof Congress, more worried about elections and lobbyists, have steered clear ofthe topic. During the 1990s, however, there was one prominent exception:Representative Steven Schiff (R-New Mexico).During the early 1990s, when the Roswell case was resurrected in the public eye,some of Schiff’s constituents asked him to look into it. In early 1994, aftercontinual Pentagon stonewalling of his inquiries, Schiff persuaded Congress’sinvestigative body, the Government Accounting Office (GAO), to examine Air Forcerecords on Roswell. Shrewdly, the Air Force initiated its own report and beatthe GAO to the punch, in which it stated that the crash of a Mogul balloon hadcaused all the commotion. In a later report, the Air Force announced that claimsabout seeing alien bodies were probably caused by its dropping of “test dummies”from high altitude parachutes—despite these having taken place in the followingdecade, and despite the dummies being 6 feet tall and weighing 180 pounds. TheGAO, meanwhile, had concluded that key records that would have shed light on theRoswell crash were inexplicably missing.6[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos720909]Schiff’s crusade for UFO truth ended in 1998. While serving his fifth term inCongress, he developed a sudden and rapid onset of squamous cell carcinoma, atype of skin cancer. He was dead at the age of 51. Roswell researcher DonSchmitt investigated rumors of foul play, but admits the case is weak. However,one source (well known to the authors) stated adamantly of his knowledge thatSchiff was murdered, but declined to name names.7[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos721244] Perhaps, as files areturned over in those first days A.D., some of them may shed some light onSchiff’s death.Schiff’s inquiry into UFOs was the exception. In the world after Disclosure, themen and women elected to serve the public’s interests will be exposed as havingmissed the most important public policy matter ever.[images/00013.jpg]Investigating for crimes. Asking again, “What did you know and when did you knowit?” The Watergate hearings of 1973. Photo courtesy of the Sam Ervin Library(Daniel R. Smith, Curator).But now, politicians will rally. Scurrying to the nearest microphones, they willcondemn being kept in the dark. They will promise congressional hearings. Theywill allocate money for their own investigations. They will jockey for positionto get on the right committees.And they will put on quite a show. At least one showboating committee chair willreach back to Watergate and resurrect Senator Sam Ervin’s famous question: “Whatdid you know and when did you know it?” It will become the refrain once more ashumbled secret-keepers apologize and explain under withering questioning.At that point, the world will realize that some very important people broke somevery big laws. The question will be how to handle their criminality.Truth CommissionsConsider the dilemma facing a president or prime minister. Public anger may beexplosive, and without some way to vent it, the results could be violent andrevolutionary. National governments everywhere will seek to maintain control ofthe process, attempting to vent public anger in a controlled way. One way to dothis may be to establish a Truth Commission.In the United States, there has never been a Truth Commission for a major policyissue on a national scale. The odds are about even that Disclosure will createthe conditions for the first-ever Truth Commission to become operational.A model for something of this magnitude is The Truth and ReconciliationCommission (TRC) assembled in South Africa after the abolition of apartheid.Established by President Nelson Mandela and chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,it was tasked with discovering and revealing past wrongdoing by the government.Many truth commissions have failed in their work, but the TRC is the rareexception, and it served as a crucial component for the transition to ademocratic political system. Its mandate was to bear witness to, record, and insome cases grant amnesty to the perpetrators of crimes relating to human rightsviolations, reparation, and rehabilitation.Although national laws will prevail when it comes to legal remedy, nations areunlikely to conduct Truth Commissions without reference to each other, and inparticular to the United States, widely perceived as the heart of UFO secrecy.Within the U.S., Congress may choose to establish such a commission to deal withthe stain of secrecy.If such a commission is formed, certain similarities to the South Africanexperience are likely to take place. Witnesses identified as victims of thesecrecy violations will be invited to give statements about their experiences,and some of the better cases will be selected for public hearings. Perpetratorsof the secrecy will be given the opportunity to testify and request amnesty fromboth civil and criminal prosecution. If the history of South Africa is anindication, the most prominent participants in the cover-up will probably take apass.After traveling throughout the United States (and possibly, in this instance,being empowered to take testimony in foreign countries), a report will beassembled that will document what happened.At the end of the process, the central issue will still be unresolved. Truthcommissions are sometimes criticized for allowing crimes to go unpunished.Squarely on the table will be the relationship between this truth commission andcriminal prosecution.We believe there is an answer with precedent.Amnesty and PardonIf the President of the United States, at the time of Disclosure, was heavilyinvolved in the cover-up either before or during his tenure, and if thatconnection can be demonstrated, then there will be a resignation in the offing.However, assuming that the President of the United States himself was not anarchitect of the cover-up, pressure will be brought to use presidentialauthority to extricate the country from a very intricate mess.The mess will be one in which a special prosecutor will have been appointed inthe first month or so A.D. As this office conducts its business, it will becomeobvious that many high-ranking current and ex-officials will be targeted forprison sentences. The charges will vary. Certainly perjury will be common, butan entire shopping list of criminal charges will be under review.Matters could become dramatic. In the case of a president about to resign, hemay use his authority to issue thousands of pardons, triggering a separateconstitutional crisis.More likely, a president who has maintained plausible deniability will findinspiration in the acts of two of his predecessors.On January 21, 1977, one day after his presidential inauguration, Jimmy Cartergranted a presidential pardon to all of those who had avoided the draft duringthe Vietnam war. That single act meant the government forever relinquished theright to prosecute hundreds of thousands of draft-dodgers. Such a blanket pardonmay well be issued A.D. in an attempt to focus the nation on the future ofcontact, and not on the past crimes.[images/00029.jpg]> Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the> Constitution of the United States, as the President of the United States, I do> hereby grant a full, complete and unconditional pardon to: All persons who may> have committed any offense between July 2, 1947, and May 17, 2021, while> operating under orders that were given by lawful authorities in order to> maintain secrecy concerning certain knowledge of extraterrestrial or non-human> intelligence operating within the borders of the United States and its> military bases worldwide.

If lives were lost in such ventures, those individuals will go toprison, possibly for a long time.It may be that a blanket pardon fails to suffice for the extraordinary timesthat A.D. will usher in. In that case, specific pardons will be granted forcertain individuals. President Gerald Ford’s pardon of disgraced PresidentRichard Nixon comes to mind. Imagine if high-level generals or ex-presidentshave been connected to the cover-up. They will be pardoned, by name, and forspecific acts. If it were to happen today, for example, it might be formerPresident George Bush, Sr., who was also a former CIA director. Perhaps he wouldbe given a pardon in exchange for his full, truthful testimony.However, the same wildcard disclaimer has to be made here. The way this playsout will be determined by the nature of our relationship with the Others, andwhether or not a deal has been struck with them at any point during the lastseven decades.EconomyEconomies usually like stability. In the short run, at least, there will begreat disruption, as the money markets are shocked and rocked by the news.Permanent damage to the structure of our economy is another matter.There are many examples in which the financial markets bounce back from badnews. A return to business, even if not business-as-usual, is likely to be theA.D. scenario as well, not because the changes will not be deep, but becausethere really is no alternative but to go forward, no matter what that means.History teaches us that humans adapt, and the markets that they create in whichto transact their businesses also adapt.The announcement will probably be accompanied by a bank freeze and a temporaryshut-down of the stock market. There is precedent for both.Three weeks before President-elect Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1933, abanking panic spread throughout America, feeding on itself, causing alarmedcustomers to empty their accounts. The day before Roosevelt took office, morethan 5,000 banks went out of business. Roosevelt called for a “bank holiday” andclosed every bank in the country. After Congress passed back-up legislation, thebanks stayed closed until Department of the Treasury officials could inspecteach institution’s ledgers.Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, theAmerican Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq remained closed for the rest of the week,not opening for business again until September 17. When the markets did reopen,the New York Stock Exchange dropped 684 points in the first day of trading.Both scenarios are about giving people and institutions time to process changes.Whatever happens after Day One, there will be a need for time to considerthings.Taking Stock of the SituationOne financial advisor the authors spoke to anticipated that the immediateaftermath of Disclosure would be “pure chaos and hysteria.” The only reasonableresponse, he thought, would be to shut things down. If Disclosure occurs on aFriday afternoon, as we anticipate, it is likely that the markets will be closedfor the entire next week.But what happens when they resume? Most traders believe that the only way tocalm markets down is to let them open up. Even then, there is bound to be agreat deal of panic selling, and this may well trigger the so-called “circuitbreakers,” which close chaotic markets. Put into place by the major securitiesand futures exchanges, these are coordinated cross-market trading halts that areactivated when a severe market price decline reaches levels that may exhaustmarket liquidity. Under these contingencies, trading may be halted temporarilyor, under extreme circumstances, markets shut down before the end of normalclose of the trading session.These circuit-breakers will probably be triggered repeatedly. During the timeperiod of “close-and-consider,” analysts and traders will be getting an earfulfrom their clients. The people we have spoken with expect that anywhere from 20to 40 percent of stockholders will want to alter their portfolios significantly,if not close them entirely, when they learn that UFOs are real and thegovernment has been hiding this information for generations.Most financial analysts have spent time considering extraordinary contingenciessuch as terrorism, nuclear accidents, natural disasters, and criminal acts. Fewto none, however, seem to have considered the possibility that UFOs might bereal, and that they might have to deal with that. In the world A.D., they willbe unprepared, and most of their advice will be made up on fly.One Certified Financial Manager from a leading financial management and advisorycompany had some thoughts about how he would behave personally, and how he wouldinteract with clients—although he was told by his management that he could notuse his name in an interview with us, presumably because the topic is tooalarming. “My biggest job if this happens,” he said, “is going to be holding myclient’s hands over the weekend when I’ll probably be freaking out myself.”Day-trader Peter Katz is one of the many financial experts who had neverconsidered the possibility that he would have to take ET Disclosure into accountin his stock strategy. When asked about how he would have to adjust, he repliedhe would not take a strong position until he could see how the market wasreacting. “My gut,” he added, “is that the market would be heading south insteadof north.”Stock analysts from Merrill Lynch to Smith Barney will scramble mightily in theaftermath of Disclosure to bring in consultants and experts to help calm theircustomers and assure them that they are preparing to adapt to the future. Theywill create bold new client PowerPoints describing their take on what might becalled the After-Market.But the safe positions of the past may not necessarily apply in this newfinancial environment. For example, it would seem logical that the price of goldwill rise in the panic, and this may happen. Yet, depending on the nature of theannouncement, analysts may speculate that the unleashing of new technology willincrease gold’s value even further or, conversely, diminish it by achieving theancient alchemist’s dream of turning common metals into gold. In general, we canexpect that the discussion of radical technologies will wreak havoc on sometraditional portfolios.Because we are not privy to all the information, there is always a caveat. Ifthe Disclosure announcement and news keeps within our more-or-less establishedview of reality, Wall Street life will continue and adapt. If, on the otherhand, there is an unforeseen complexity to it (that is, the Others have theability to manipulate time), then the entire concept of trading as currentlyestablished could be rendered unworkable instantly.The Biggest Bail-Out EverFollowing the 2008 global financial crisis, Presidents Bush and Obama, alongwith the U.S. Congress, staged the largest bailout of banks and other financialinstitutions in history. Responding to the subprime mortgage crisis, TheEmergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was enacted to rescue the financialsystem of the United States. It authorized the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury tospend up to 700 billion dollars to purchase distressed assets and make capitalinjections into banks. More rescue spending followed. Other countries able to doso staged their own versions of a rescue package.Disclosure that UFOs are real will trigger instability in the economic system tosuch a degree that the corresponding response may be even greater than thatstimulus package. Global leadership will declare that the situation isone-of-a-kind, and that unprecedented action must be taken. Officials worldwidewill reach a consensus that, for the short-term A.D., this is hardly the timefor fiscal restraint. They will try to spend their way past the difficulties ofDisclosure. The public, to a great degree, will want them to.Of course, one obvious problem is that if Disclosure is forced before the end ofthe financial crisis that started in 2008 (still continuing strong as of thiswriting), further printing of currencies could be ruinous. Aside from this, thegrand A.D. economic plan will have strong critics. Recall that Paul Volcker,chairman of Barack Obama’s White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board, arguedthat bailouts signal to the firms that they can take reckless risks. If therisks are realized, Volcker said, taxpayers pay the losses in the future. “Thedanger is the spread of moral hazard could make the next crisis much bigger.”Bailout defenders will reply that unless the post-Disclosure world is quicklybrought to order, we may not make it to the next crisis. Even in the bestscenarios, a low-grade panic will be in the air. Governments and politicians areforever focused on the short-term. They will want to do something now, and theywill act to keep the money flowing. If the economy remains healthy, it will beeasier for citizens to weather the uncertainty of the new circumstances.Ironically, the entity that will be taxing and spending—the government—will alsobe perceived as the architect of cover-up. It will take an interesting doubleback-flip of spin to argue that they have been hiding the truth for decades, butthat they need the people to trust them now in order to save the economy. Yet,without a credible alternative, they will probably get away with it.No matter how successfully the world adapts to the uncertainties followingDisclosure, corporations and people will take a wait-and-see attitude. Only avery few companies will expand their spending. Most will sit on their money andobserve how things shake down. Ordinary people will do the same. On anintellectual level, people may understand that their global economy demands thatconsumers spend, but the reaction will be to let someone else do it first. Witha world set ablaze by historic headlines, a good amount of hysteria, and rattledinstitutions, keeping what they have will become priority number one for mostpeople.There is one fast way to inject money into the economy and be perceived asacting in the national interest. Rather than putting Americans to work on roadcrews or other public works, the winner will be the military. The militaryestablishments of the Earth—already enormous—may grow larger. They will betasked with keeping the peace in the homeland and standing vigilant, ready toprotect humanity from the shadow of the Others. More likely than not, those samearmies will be primarily employed for keeping the peace among humans.Energy’s New EquationNo blowback could be more disruptive than something that radically alters theengine of the global economy—a one-of-a-kind game-changer. When humanitypublicly outs the Others through some form of Disclosure, it will put thisdream/nightmare of fundamental change directly on the table.In terms of dollar value, the petroleum industry is the largest in the world,when one considers its production, distribution, refining, and retailing. It iscritical in the maintenance of our civilization, as it underlies an enormousportion of the rest of the world’s industrial and transportation sectors.Moreover, it is more than a source of immense wealth for the world’s super-rich:of the world’s 20 largest oil companies, 15 are state-owned.8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos721405] Therefore, a substantialnumber of national governments rely explicitly on petroleum for their liquidity.Within the United States, the oil industry (along with natural gas) is thebackbone of the economy. The industry supports more than 9 million American jobsand makes major economic contributions as an employer and purchaser of goods andservices. In 2007, the most recent year for which data is available, theindustry accounted for more than $1 trillion in value, or 7.5 percent of theU.S. gross domestic product.9[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos721630]Humanity needs a post-oil economy; humanity fears a post-oil economy. We need itin order to save the Earth’s environment; we fear it because it will threatenthe way we do business with each other.For humanity, the prospect of moving beyond an oil-based economy is a HolyGrail. The world is addicted to oil, and most of us acknowledge our need to weanourselves from it. The places where it lies in its greatest abundance are someof the world’s most dangerous. Oil accidents can be disastrous: In 2010, amassive spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2011, another occurred off thecoast of New Zealand.Once the president acknowledges that “we are not alone,” it will be obvious to anumber of analysts that at least some UFOs have been real, and it then becomescrystal clear that petroleum is on its way toward becoming obsolete as a sourceof transportation energy. For many years, leaks have occurred and claims havebeen made describing radical propulsion systems in alien flying saucers, as wellas in the home-grown variety. Certainly, anything that can move in perfectsilence, hover indefinitely, and accelerate instantaneously is using somethingbetter than high-octane gasoline as its source of fuel, whether this be someform of the fabled zero-point energy field, a clean burning nuclear fusion, orsomething more exotic.Oil prices remain high because of the continual state of warfare that hasravaged the Middle East. If the Others have been observing us since at leastWorld War II, then surely they have noticed this relationship. Perhaps they areconfused as to why we should allow such conflict to come from a naturalresource, but they can hardly miss the connection between war and oil.Oil experts have disagreed over the fear of peak oil. The bottom-line is, “Willthe world run out of oil?” We can presume that because oil is so important to usand we are apparently so important to the Others that this debate has notescaped them. In fact, from their near-Earth observations and more sophisticatedmonitoring capability they may know the answer to this complex question.The idea of peak oil is not that the world will “run out” of oil, rather, thatit will run out of the easy and cheap oil, the result of which would convulsethe global economy.But even if oil were to continue to be abundant amid a rising global demand forthe next 50 years, as some analysts predict, there are still serious questionswe need to ask regarding the viability of a petroleum-based world. In the firstplace, assuming we have enough oil for the next 50 years, what happens then?Second, can the world environment survive another 50 years of full-speed-aheadextraction, refining, and burning of oil? Therefore, what if UFO technologyprovides us with an energy source that can replace petroleum in many respects?What if this new energy source is clean? What if it is easy to produce, andtherefore very cheap?It does not matter if the Others “give” humanity their energy secret. Once weknow there is a viable alternative to oil, the answer will be found. There willbe incredible pressures on the world’s political leaders on the issue of energy.They may stonewall, but the answer will be found anyway. When it is, the oilindustry will face its greatest crisis ever, and this will translate to much ofthe global economy.Like it or not, trillions of dollars are invested worldwide in the petroleumindustry. Although something better is surely an attractive option for humanityas a whole, it certainly is not for those who own major portions of the world’soil. Suddenly, the long-term value of oil would promise to plummet; suddenly,the portfolio valuations of the world’s largest corporations (and wealthiestfamilies) would plummet. Unless these groups are certain that they can controland monetize whatever replaces oil, they will resist any changeover.In terms of the financial markets, any dramatic change in petroleum futures willaffect everything. No matter what product you can imagine, most of its value isin the energy required to make and transport it. If the services of petroleumwill no longer be required for much of this, the prices of many products willdrop dramatically. Again, this is a good thing for most of us. It may be thatthe power elite at the top of the human pyramid is happy with this outcome, ornot.This is why Big Oil has been one of the powers behind the UFO cover-up. Breakingits hold over the fabric of our society will alter the structure of economic andpolitical power around the world. Yet, the upside in the long-term promiseseasily to outweigh the short-term disruptions and uncertainties.Repealing the Law of GravityReplacing petroleum will be one of the major upheavals of the world A.D., butnot the only one. Serious researchers of UFOs agree that these craft appear tonegate the Earth’s gravity. The world’s militaries and governments no doubt madethat connection long ago. Therefore, the next big upheaval will deal withelectrogravitics.Such ideas have circulated since the 1950s, and they have also receivedattention in the classified world. During the mid-1950s, several aviationjournals discussed what appeared to be imminent breakthroughs inelectrogravitics. One of these, a British research company called AviationStudies (International) Ltd., stated that “electrostatic energy sufficient toproduce a Mach 3 fighter is possible with megavolt energies and a K of over10,000.” Another report, by Gravity Rand, Ltd., agreed. According to thatreport: “To assert electrogravitics is nonsense is as unreal as to say it ispractically extant.” Then, in 1956, such talk stopped abruptly. Did everyone atonce discover that all this anti-gravity speculation turned out to be nothingmore than hot air? Or did it go more deeply under cover?10[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos722025]These are the questions that have led some to conclude that Alien ReproductionVehicle (ARV) is real. Of course, if such technology has existed for some time,it means that every oil-related war was waged under false pretense.The secret-keepers who will face the harsh questions about their behavior anddecisions in that scenario will have their arguments ready. They will argue thateven if the technology exists, it would have been dangerous to share itpublicly, because the intentions of the Others were unclear.They will acknowledge that, in the long term, replacing oil with a better sourceof energy is desirable and perhaps the time has come. The same is true forreplacing our current modes of ground-based transportation with something thatcan quickly, cheaply, and easily get us off the ground. But here is the rub: Howwould such developments affect not only the profits to those interests incontrol of the petroleum industry, not only the financial markets, but also theability of human social and political elites to control society? For whathappens when it becomes possible for all of humanity to have access to anabundant, clean, and cheap energy source, combined with knowledge of anelectrogravitic propulsion system?In the first place, it would mean that you could heat your home forever,probably for next-to-nothing. It might also mean that you could make such asystem of energy portable, which would enable possibilities never dreamed ofwith petroleum. For instance, it might allow everyone to be able to power heavyequipment inexpensively. If you wanted to build a deep underground extension toyour home, you might very easily be able to do it. A quick trip to Germany,Mozambique, Thailand, or anywhere else could be done easily, and perhaps withoutgovernment knowledge or control.How would such new-found wealth and independence sit with those who have beenused to controlling the masses of humanity? And, to be fair, let us also ask,what if the capabilities of new energy and electrogravitics can be easilyadapted to create very destructive weapons?The transition away from petroleum and to something better is more than aquestion of improving our daily “cost of doing business” on Earth. It involves acomplete overhaul of our society. The new destinations to which such changeswill lead us will be public policy issues of the highest order.The questions of energy and how they will be resolved may turn out to only bethe tip of the iceberg when it comes to sorting out the changed reality.Fortunately, we have a system set up that will begin to address these issuesfrom the beginning.Legal SystemAs with most other major issues in American history, from civil rights to healthcare, the courts will have much to say about how we deal with the acknowledgedpresence of the Others. Although it may seem a mundane way to deal withsomething extraordinary, it will be a powerful tool toward helping settledifferences among individuals, companies, governments and even, conceivably, theOthers, as represented through human surrogates.The law can be broken down into criminal law, which are injustices againstsociety prosecuted by the State, and civil law, which are injustices against aperson prosecuted by the injured party.Can You Arrest the Others?Criminal law is not about money. It is about exacting punishment and deterringothers who may be tempted to break the law.When it comes to criminal law’s applicability to the A.D. world, we have todiscuss whether the Others will recognize authority. We even have to ask whetherthey will be physically present in a post-Disclosure society, for in fact theymay not. Because we are not really clear on who they even are, all we can say isthat based on the last 60-plus years, it seems rather unlikely that there couldbe criminal penalties applied to these beings. As years go on, if relationsbecome normal in some regard, then perhaps. Even this, however, represents astretch of the imagination.Can You Sue the Others?The same would appear to apply regarding lawsuits. But here, things become moreinteresting. Civil law is all about torts, which range from personal injury andfraud to negligent and intentional misrepresentation. It also includes falseimprisonment, defamation, assault, battery, and so on. Given the nature ofthings that might be disclosed in a coming clean period, there seems to be amplecause to sue regarding human-to-human interaction brought about by contact withthe Others. For example, Mac Brazel was supposedly detained in Roswell back in1947, held incommunicado while he got his head right about what he found on hisranch that famous day in July. Brazel is long gone, but his grandchildren arestill around. Or what about Communion author Whitley Strieber, who has beenridiculed on South Park, no less, for being subjected to an alien “rectalprobe”? He may have a case against the people who allowed him to look crazy whenhe actually was as sane and maybe saner than most.Civil suits require an injured party. Lawsuits will be filed to seek eithermoney or some kind of injunctive relief. A multitude of new injuries—based onprecedent—may present themselves. It may get very messy before order isrestored.The first issue that lawyers will want to resolve is the nature of the Othersand whether we have any formal understandings or treaties with them. They willwant to know if they are here outside our laws and have presented themselves asa threat to our military, or whether they are as regulated as, say, cruise shipsentering a foreign port of call. If the answer is ambiguous, along the lines of“sporadic continuing informal contact,” it will be necessary to define a legalrelationship with these beings. Lawyers are apt to incorporate this changedreality into our existing legal structure, and the system will continue doingjust that on an ad-hoc basis.On a basic level, attorneys, judges, and officers of the court will want to knowif the Others acknowledge the concept of our “jurisdiction.” On an even morepractical level, they will want to know if the Others accept or refuse “serviceof process.” Although there has been some testimony (and potentiallydisinformation) about treaties being signed with EBEs (ExtraterrestrialBiological Entities) going back to the Eisenhower years, the idea that there isany kind of formal understanding, written or otherwise, between us and theOthers is probably a long-shot. This means that lawyers will have to be contentdealing with secondary effects and collecting damages from human institutions.By way of example, consider the abduction phenomenon. Being kidnapped anddeprived of your freedom is, by definition, a personal injury. Who to sue? Inthe first months A.D., it is likely that some enterprising lawyer, prodded by anaggrieved client, will try to sue the Others for damages. This will be a toughsell in the court system, but it is apt to generate publicity for the client andthe attorney, something both will probably be seeking if they are the first toinitiate such a case.Once in a courtroom, the judge will ask the sticking question: do the Othersacknowledge our jurisdiction? The answer will be no, not really, or at least wedo not think they do. We can proclaim our jurisdiction based on precedent andstatute, of course, but then the question becomes: how on Earth (literally) dowe serve them? The legal answer to that will be some form of publication. If theright judge has been found to hear the case, he or she will accept theplaintiff’s argument that any group able to come “here” from “there” (wherever“there” may be) will also have the technology to monitor our communications. Thefinal hurdle a judge would still have to ask is how, if the plaintiff prevailsin court, will they ever collect the damages? The lawyer for the case will needto be at his or her best here, but will doubtless argue that while there are noformal relations with the Others now, there are bound to be in the future, andwhen those relations become clear, they will collect damages as part of thatopening agreement.Bureaucracy Grinds OnOn a global scale, many international agreements and understandings will be putto a prolonged and strenuous test.One area will be the hot-button issue of immigration law. The term illegal alienwill have a different meaning here, but it will be impossible to avoid theimplications. Every government around the world will be forced to discusswhether or not the Others are actually here, on Earth, in their country, walkingamong the population. If they are, then the nations of Earth have a newimmigration issue.Because we are talking about UFOs, which are flying objects, much of the legalaction will focus on the area of aviation and space law.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency ofthe United Nations, codifies the principles and techniques of international airnavigation. It adopts standards and recommends practices concerning airnavigation, its infrastructure, flight inspection, prevention of unlawfulinterference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for internationalcivil aviation. In addition, the ICAO defines the protocols for air accidentinvestigation. Virtually every aspect of their mandate will be re-examined inlight of ET-reality and the fact that UFOs share our airspace.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is an international industrytrade group that represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 percent of scheduledinternational air traffic. It will have issues about Disclosure—looking to thepast, and planning routes and safety for the future.The Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA) is the statute that establishes thelimitations as to whether a foreign sovereign nation or its agencies may be suedin U.S. courts. It provides the exclusive basis and means to bring a lawsuitagainst a foreign sovereign in the United States.Where this is likely to become important is in the reverse. Other nations andtheir representatives may not be able to be sued in the United States, butbecause most countries are signatory, then it follows that the United States andits own institutions will be protected from being sued in other nations.What might the United States legitimately be sued for?If the United States government, for instance, has recovered crash wreckage andalien technology throughout the years, it is likely to have submitted it toprivate industry, discretely and secretly, for analysis and evenreverse-engineering. A company that was given this contract may be judged tohave had an unfair advantage over its competitors. It is likely, if not certain,that any such contracts awarded by the U.S. government would have gone toAmerican companies.The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides a limited waiver of the federalgovernment’s sovereign immunity when its employees are negligent within thescope of their employment. Under the FTCA, the government can only be sued“under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would beliable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act oromission occurred.” Translated, this means that the government cannot be suedfor things it did as a government; in this case, covering up UFOs.Let us say that the Majestic-12 organization, or whatever else it may callitself, has resorted to extreme measures to keep this secret from time-to-timethroughout the years, such as death threats, torture, or even assassination.Under the FTCA, the government is not liable when any of its agents commits thecrimes of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, maliciousprosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, orinterference with contract rights. However, it also provides an exception. Thegovernment is liable if a law enforcement officer commits these crimes. WouldMJ-12 agents be considered “law enforcement officers,” or simply “agents” of thegovernment? The courts will have to make that call.There will be a political fight to create a new exemption to the FSIA, so thatinterest groups—in and outside the United States—can sue the government, basedon the “Act of God” status of Disclosure.Let us say that Northrop-Grumman (an example only) received either crashwreckage or something else of its kind. No Disclosure would have come from thegovernment about its origin; it would have only been referred to as “foreigntechnology.” Engineers at the company would know not to ask questions—thematerial could have come from the Soviet Union, and it would not be theirconcern. Yet, the company would have profited from any discoveries, held anypatents, and would have reaped incredible advantage in the marketplace.The government may hold itself as being immune to lawsuits, but privatecontractors may not be. If details were not forthcoming in a limited disclosure,some people may start by filing Freedom of Information Act requests designed tosee what technical details were given, how formalized the sweetheart deal hadbeen, and to what benefit. If technology is patented, then it is publiclyavailable but you cannot use it. On the other hand, if technology has beentreated as a trade secret, then other companies can literally tear it apart andtry to reverse engineer it for their own patents. Therefore, what if thetechnology was never patented in order to keep its origin secret and to keepquestions from being asked, but its use conveyed an unfair competitive advantageon the company to which it was given? Moreover, the government helped maintainthe secrecy from which the company benefited.The companies who are damaged include virtually all that did not receive favoredstatus. The question grows more complex legally, however, because the historygleaned from the past behavior of our Office of Foreign Technology shows thatthe government almost never shares the big picture with any one company,preferring instead to share a piece here and another piece there.The Ultimate Aviation Law CaseThe reality of UFOs, given that they are flying objects, may cause members ofthe legal profession who specialize in aviation law to see this as a goldenopportunity to be involved in the thick of the action. Most aviation law dealswith accidents, but that may change, too.There are many lawsuits one envisions following Disclosure. For example, whatabout a pilot who, in our pre-Disclosure world, saw a UFO come so close to hisaircraft that he saw windows on it, so close that he took evasive maneuvers toavoid collision? When the pilot informed traffic control of his situation, hewas informed that multiple ground-based radars confirmed his sighting. When helanded, shaken by what he saw, he filed a formal report. His reward for hishonesty? His company grounded him from flight status for more than three years.This is exactly what happened to the pilot of a Japan Air Lines jet when he flewover Alaska in 1986.Was the pilot damaged by the actions of his company? To the extent that he lovedflying and derived status from it, yes. His ability to seek other employment mayhave been diminished as well. He may have lost salary because he was not flying.All of this is actionable even if the airline had no knowledge about UFOreality. But what if an authority figure at the airline did have professionalreasons to believe that UFOs were authentic and real? And what about the radarreports and other witnesses that the airline decided to ignore?In 2010, it was reported that commercial pilots were encountering UFOs in suchnumbers, creating such an air traffic hazard, that pilots operating out ofLondon’s Heathrow Airport started developing unofficial aircrew reports fortheir colleagues, to ensure that they knew of potential UFO trouble spots. Allof this was privately done, without sanction from their employers.11[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos722678] When it comes to aviationsafety, pilots are educated on wind shear, birds caught in engines, and a litanyof other infrequent events, but not UFOs. This may not yet register heavily in aworld built around denial, but in the A.D. world it is likely to look likenegligence of the highest order.There are many potential cases affecting aviation law that may emerge A.D. Forinstance, as documents are released and old stories are reinterpreted, what ifit becomes clear that an Airbus crash with hundreds of people on board occurredat the same time a UFO sighting was recorded by military radar operators—but wasnever revealed? Perhaps the black box recorded something that, in a world whereUFOs were fiction, got past investigators. In a world where UFOs are fact,however, the data might now be interpreted as a potential cause of the crash.Would the NTSB—an independent agency—want its own reputation bolstered byproving that the government withheld relevant information to its investigation?What about the airline itself, which paid huge settlement money to the familiesof the dead? Supposedly settlements are final. In the world of A.D., however,such theories may be tested as airlines try to recover funds and shiftresponsibility toward the government.Perhaps all of the airlines will gang up on their respective governments, orperhaps they will specifically target the U.S. government. They could easilyclaim that the government knew the airways were more hazardous than itacknowledged, and that the FAA (and its non-U.S. counterparts) had not done itsjob.Eventually, we may see a sub-specialty within aviation and space law.Particularly if there have not been treaties signed, this specialty may becomeknown as “Extra-Legal,” the study of an extraterrestrial presence that operatesnot above or within the law as we know it, but simply outside of it altogether.Although the rest of the world may refer to these strange visitors as “TheOthers,” it is likely the legal profession will call them by a more specificname: “Extras.”An Entirely New Court SystemThe court system will be able to stretch, within limits, to accommodate many ofthe issues that will arise among humans based on an acknowledgment of theOthers. Under such circumstances, the Others are simply a factor in the criminalor civil issues that have created conflict between us.It may seem like bad science-fiction to think that the Others will ever be apart of an official court system. It seems unlikely that they ever will be. Yet,there will be those who immediately push for such a result. They will focus onthe need to get these beings to sign a treaty recognizing our courts andjurisdiction. After all, we currently attempt to deal with foreign nationals ofcountries with whom we have no treaties. It is not always easy, it usually takestime, and often yields less-than-perfect results.Perhaps the Others would agree to contractual relationships but balk at anationalistic country-by-country approach. We may have to create an entirely newcourt system to deal with criminal and civil relations between us and them on aglobal basis. If there are multiple groups of Others and one of them isresponsible for abducting our citizens or mutilating them, we may need a treatywith the “other” Others to police the situation. And if we are tradingtechnology for, say, minerals, then we will need an agreement about how toenforce a contract. Again—assuming they are willing to deal formally withhumanity.The bottom line is that all issues will require discussion about what governingdocument will apply when trying to resolve disputes between a human and anOther. The term used between residents and companies of different states is“diversity jurisdiction.” These are cases that cannot necessarily be heard inone state or another, but have to be heard in the federal courts.It seems pedestrian to discuss such things. But, depending on the relationshipand how it evolves, something of the sort may already exist. If not, it may becreated in the first years A.D.MediaAs we have noted elsewhere, A.D. will be the best of times and the worst oftimes for the major media establishments. It will instantly make reportersrelevant again and will make news a commodity for which the public is willing topay. At the same time, it will reveal the complicity and laziness that thejournalistic institutions of the world have brought to this story, now proved tobe authentic, The Greatest Story Never Told. To appreciate how badly the mediahas blown this story, here are three examples from thousands that illustrate itsembarrassing lack of professionalism when it comes to this topic.Example #1: Apollo Astronaut Edgar MitchellEdgar Mitchell was the lunar module pilot of Apollo 14, and the sixth man towalk on the moon. In February 1971, he spent a full nine hours walking on thelunar surface in the Fra Mauro Highlands region.Mitchell also happened to grow up in Roswell, New Mexico. After his NASAmissions, he returned there. During the 1970s, before the story leaked to UFOinvestigators, many people who had kept the story to themselves for years soughthim out—seeing him as a national figure who could help tell their story. Theytold him that what happened in 1947 was the crash and recovery of anextraterrestrial craft, complete with alien bodies.In the 1990s, Mitchell began to test the waters with his beliefs that we werenot alone in the universe. On July 23, 2008, however, he told presenter NickMargerrison of the Kerrang! radio show, that he happened to be “privilegedenough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFOphenomenon is real. It has been covered up by governments for some time now.12[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos722993]The statement was picked up around the world and, at the very least, did manageto surmount the first obstacle to UFO coverage by the media.This qualified it to go to the second level, where it was ridiculed andmarginalized. CNN coverage included the usual raised eyebrow from the anchorwhile introducing the material, the videotaped package included the musicaltheme from The X-Files and cartoon images of little green men. At the end, theanchorwoman smiled and went to commercial.In another piece of coverage on the same network, Mitchell’s comments wereplayed back, and a statement from NASA read, “NASA does not track UFOs. NASA isnot involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywherein the universe.” The anchorwoman in this coverage also smiled in disbelief,shook her head, and passed off to Wolf Blitzer who managed to say, “Okay, we’llwatch this story with you.”This kind of dismissive superiority was repeated by reporters regardingMitchell’s testimony. What was it that made news producers slot this as a sillystory? What cue did they receive that convinced them the best reaction was tosmile and shake their heads in disbelief?A man trusted to fly the first moon mission after the Apollo 13 disaster,handpicked from thousands of qualified pilots and engineers, came forward toexplain that he believes UFOs are real, that Roswell was the crash of an alienspacecraft, and that the government is complicit in keeping this informationcovered up. The media’s reaction should have been to dispatch investigativeteams to learn the truth. Instead, they gave it the kind of on-camera treatmentthat usually greets the birth of a baby panda at the local zoo.Example #2: National Press Club News ConferenceThere is a long history of U.S. military encounters with UFOs, a fact that hasbeen documented many times over. So when, on September 27, 2010, a newsconference was held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., featuring ahalf-dozen former U.S.A.F. officers speaking directly to this issue, one mightthink that the nation’s major media would be interested. Even more striking wasthat these retired officers described cases in which UFOs had been seen nearU.S. nuclear weapons facilities. These were events witnessed by multiplesoldiers in which nuclear missiles actually malfunctioned in the aftermath.A few news outlets, including Fox News and The Air Force Times, covered theevent competently. A small number of the major outlets provided neutral coveragein their online content. Yet, despite a great deal of advance publicity andprivate money expended to promote the event, the news conference was virtuallyshunned by the media heavyweights.CNN, the once-proud maverick news organization, allowed a pair of condescendingand ill-informed on-air personalities (an anchorwoman and a weatherman) toridicule these military men for coming forward. The openly skeptical anchorwomanactually laughed, invoked Fox Muldur, and even managed to work in “little greenmen.” One could only see the performance in order to believe it really happened.Most of the other coverage, such as it was, was equally shameful. Wired, forinstance, titled its hit piece “Tinfoil Tuesdays,” while the Washington Postsent a lifestyle columnist, John Kelly, who opened his coverage by explaining hearrived late and only came because they offered cookies.13[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos723240]One wonders what it would take to wipe the smirk off the faces of theseindividuals masking as journalists. Most likely, nothing short of Disclosureitself.Example #3: Xiaoshan Airport, Hangzhou, ChinaAnother example concerns the sighting of a UFO over China’s Xiaoshan Airport inHangzhou, China, which is the capital of East China’s Zhejiang province, on thenight of July 9, 2010. According to the report of the municipal governmentthere, an unidentified flying object disrupted air traffic over the airport,causing it to be shut down for an hour while authorities scrambled to figure outwhat it was.As reported from several official and unofficial sources in China, the UFOshowed up on the airport’s radar a little past 8:30 pm. Soon after, airportpersonnel saw a “shining light” in the air that was later confirmed bypassengers who were flying at the time. They described it as a “twinkling spot”that “disappeared very soon” with a “comet-like tail.” A striking photo wastaken that shows structure and four lighted windows.[images/00017.jpg]Forcing the media. Finally the Greatest Story Never Covered will actually getthe attention it deserves. Xaioshan Airport in China closed in July of 2010because of a UFO. The photo was taken by an anonymous Chinese resident, and hasbeen widely used in the media.Service was suspended at the airport, which serves as a hub for Air Asia. Anextensive aerial search began, leading to a total of 56 minutes of down time,the delay of 18 flights, and the stranding of about 2,000 passengers.CNNGo reporter Jessica Beaton ascribed it to a publicity stunt. “There’s nobetter way to make headlines,” she wrote, “than to have a UFO sighting.” Hertone, always important, conveyed amusement. “We’re not saying we think littlegreen men landed,” she said glibly, “why choose China when Thai beaches are soclose by?” To her credit, she did not immediately accept the officialexplanation. “But really, a reflection from an airplane shut down an airport?They should come up with a better excuse than that.”14[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos723964]But why the jokes? After all, one of those Chinese officials also said that thesighting had a “military connection.” Further details could not be divulged atthe time, he added. Was this American technology? If so, why are Americansflying it in China? If it was Chinese technology, what do they have that lookslike the object in the photo, which apparently hovers and then acceleratesinstantly?The American media, nearly en masse, ignored the event. The “roundtable” onABC’s This Week had time to discuss basketball star LeBron James. NBC’sMeet-the-Press dissected Sarah Palin’s YouTube video where she cast herself as a“Mama Grizzly.” No enterprising American journalist traveled to China toinvestigate what happened at Xiaoshan. That, apparently, would be nonsense.These Are the People Who Will Tell Us About DisclosureAfter Roswell, “deny and ridicule” became policy relating to all mattersufological. We have now reached a place where the mainstream news coverage hasbeen wholly committed to protecting the status quo of the cover-up. One mightdismiss this as simply lame behavior and lazy coverage, which it clearly is, butthere is also the likelihood of deceit at the higher levels.Recall that only a few companies now control most of the media, particularly inthe United States. These corporate structures have had a long history ofcollaboration with the U.S. intelligence community. The management of news bythe CIA and other intelligence groups around the world is an open secret, and alot of good analysis has been done on the topic. More than 30 years ago, CarlBernstein wrote an excellent exposé on the CIA’s influence over mainstream U.S.media for an article in Rolling Stone, and much follow-up work has been donethrough the years.15 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos724450]This does not mean that the CIA and its kind control every aspect of newscoverage and spin; control is seldom complete. But the indications are that onthe big issues, the right relationships have been made with major media. Theserelationships have continued and deepened through the years.Disclosure will not change that situation. The national security community willnot walk away from the table after having invested so much to control it.Coverage of the post-Disclosure world will continue to comport with theinterests of the intelligence community. In the immediate aftermath, all thewrong people will continue to be quoted. As today, so tomorrow: people will needto be vigilant for the truth, and major media will need to be held accountable.When the smiling anchors and dismissive experts are confronted with Disclosure,will they be honest enough to admit their own ignorance and lack of curiosity?It seems unlikely; about as unlikely as the public feeling good about gettinginformation from these people after the truth is out.Blowback will singe away whatever credibility remains of the Fourth Estate. Theymay not notice their hair is on fire, but most people will. The New York Times,and institutions like it, with all their resources, will suffer greatly becausethey willfully failed to give serious attention or investigation into the topicin the past.It is against this backdrop of ham-handed coverage, at best naive and at worstdisinformation, that the world of A.D. will emerge. The question is, how strongwill the public reaction against the media be? Will there be a new version ofOccupy Wall Street, but one directed at the tightly controlledcorporate-intelligence-media complex? Rather, perhaps we should not ask “will ithappen?” but “how strong will that reaction be?”Some truth-tellers, such as Whitley Strieber, whose Communion deserves creditfor bringing this issue to a wide audience, will gain a new status. What makeshim unique today, though, is bravely speaking out against a wall of ridicule.Once authorities confirm his story and thousands of other abductees comeforward, he may fade back, like the grandfather who puts on his old militaryuniform every Memorial Day and marches in a parade. Or—and this is to behoped—he will be respected as someone who has given more thought to what it allmeans than most people alive today. Much of the difference will most likelydepend on how strong the public reaction is to media portrayal of Disclosure.The news will spread like a firestorm, blowing everything else away for weeksand months. Everything from quarterly economic reports to local sporting eventswill be reported through the prism of this contact. Every assignment editoreverywhere will be looking at reporting and asking, “Where’s the contact anglein this?” As the media transitions from its steady diet of the trivial into a24/7 news cycle of contact, it will ignore its own culpability in allowing thecover-up to exist under a rock it chose not to see, let alone turn over.With no apparent embarrassment, establishment journalists will point the fingerof shame and skepticism at the government, the military, and the scientificestablishment. Whistleblowers will come forward on a daily basis for quite sometime, all now feeling unfettered by previously signed national securityagreements, ready to feed the firestorm. Each new revelation will light theflame under a still newer one. Bloggers will have a field day, offering opinionand insight. Every photo released in the first wave of Disclosure will beendlessly circulated on the Internet.For three decades, local TV reporter Mark Sanchez covered just about everythingthat came up on his general assignment beat. He sees a firestorm and seriouspublic backlash against the press in the aftermath of Disclosure. Complicity inthe cover-up will have eroded public confidence in all public institutions.“Experience tells me disbelief, cynicism and insufficient alarm will greetfuture proclamations made After Disclosure,” he said. “The truth is liberating,but serious social upheaval will erupt as the truth sinks in…. What followscould be the real legacy of denial the past six decades: public overreaction,intolerance and widespread instability across every level of society.”Whether or not Sanchez’s pessimism about our ability to handle the truth iswarranted, one can hardly argue that widespread instability is bad for the newsbusiness. Dislocation and social upheaval are the stuff of Pulitzers and Emmys.Imagine the golden trophies awaiting reporters who get to cover these kinds ofstories:Sparks Fly Over Majestic’s Role at Commission HearingThe Presidential Amnesty OrderStock Market and Bank ClosureMan Kills 17 People Thinking They Were AliensCover-Up Architect in Critical Condition After Mob BeatingAbductees File Class Action Lawsuit Against OthersNetwork News Reporter Fired for Bribe-TakingPope Welcomes “All God’s Children”Presidential Candidates Clash Over Contact PolicyCentral Park Rally Biggest EverAs the days and months unfold, however, a legitimate question in the aftermathof Disclosure will be whether or not the media will have the ability orintegrity to investigate why it failed so utterly and completely to see thisstory. Were media owners actually bought-off by those elites managing thecover-up? Will a single news executive actually be fired or held accountable?We believe that the media institutions that survive Disclosure and thrive A.D.will be the ones that practice a form of “ultimate transparency.” By this, wemean that they devote substantial resources to shining the light on their owninternal processes of story selection, investigation, and editing. This includeshaving live cameras in the newsroom streaming the debates and conferences ontothe Internet 24/7, so that the people who missed this awesome story no longerhave a place to run or hide in the aftermath of their failure.They Will SurviveInstitutions, such as law, media, and government, do not just go away. That iswhy they are called institutions. They can change, reform, reorganize. They canadapt, incorporate, and morph. Disclosure will blow through them like a hot windin a summer dry spell. It will seem that sheer accountability will demand thatthey be allowed to fail. Some will argue that this should happen.But we are not talking about a single car company or an individual bank.Newspapers like The New York Times may fail. The Department of Energy may beorganized out of existence. Old courts may be folded into new ones. The bigpicture, however, remains.How we see and relate to the world around us is the issue. And even though theremay well be higher planes of consciousness in store, as some have argued, peoplewill still need to shape their world through familiar processes.The Worst It Could BeWhenever one discusses a situation spinning out of control, there is the dangerthat it will stay that way and get worse. It is certainly possible that all the“snap-back” inherent in human beings and institutions will only “snap” thistime.If the system breaks entirely as a result of Disclosure, this is what it mightlook like:The economy could shatter into a global depression. The governments of the majorfinancial powers could be so completely discredited on the issue that no onewill want to grant them the power to intervene in a way that might fix things.Depression mixed with fear is a potent drink to swallow. It leads to repression,long-term military rule, and fascism.Seeing the world come apart could also have a devastating psychological effecton humanity. Many pundits and psychologists throughout the years—in comments andreports—have speculated that the interaction of a superior and inferiorcivilization could lead to the collapse of the weaker one. If our natural humanresiliency is suppressed by faltering economies and violent reaction, we couldfall into a vicious downward spiral that simply cannot be stopped.The bottom could be the unhinging of our world, the loss of the industrial baseneeded to run a technological society, and a descent into a kind of globalmadness. Our civilization could collapse as completely as did the Aztecs orIncas.Writer and historian Will Durant said, “A great civilization is not conqueredfrom without until it has destroyed itself from within.” Whether one thinks thathumanity will recover and grow from the experience of Disclosure depends notjust on what the Others are here for, which is an external consideration, buthow strong one views the civilization that humankind has built.We are not naive on that score. The world exists in a precarious place today,primarily as a result of our own choices. The pessimists have much evidence fromwhich to argue their case.Although we believe the immediate impact of Disclosure will be very difficultthose first years and perhaps beyond, we do not believe—short of news that theOthers actively mean us harm—that this collapse is a certainty. Instead, theworld could easily see a re-birth. In the last century, we have adapted to somuch fundamental change that widening our perspective to include the vastuniverse should ultimately be seen as a beginning and not an end.[images/00020.jpg][images/00024.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6The [New] Age of Aquarius: Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out> > If the masses started to accept UFOs, it would profoundly affect their> > attitudes towards life, politics, everything.

People will see, once again, that governments cannot betrusted and that powerful conspiracies really do exist.The older generation will interpret Disclosure through establishmentperceptions. They will see only how it challenges the world they knew. Youngerpeople will embrace a new way of looking at our world and other worlds. Becauseof this split, the first decade After Disclosure will come closest in tone andtexture to the 1960s as any decade since. Whether you think that is good news orbad, be ready. The elements are already in place.One big difference from the 1960s, of course, is that more technology will be inplace. Ideas will spread faster, morph faster, disappear faster. All of thiswill contribute to a new generation gap, a new counter-culture. Protests will becommon, as large, unhinged segments of the population turn away from the statusquo and experiment with new ideas. Music will carry political messages. Socialexperimentation will take center stage. Although some will cling to the oldtrappings that brought them comfort, others will throw them aside and seek abrand new day.Friend or foe, the presence of other intelligent beings will make peopleconsider humanity’s place in the universe. Life may still consist of work, dailyroutine, and the final flickering out of our loved ones and then ourselves, butour days on Earth may also be elevated by wonder and awe. Possibly even a senseof destiny.For others, it will create existential dread. Because fear and panic willprobably predominate at the beginning, there may be a lingering, dampeningeffect on the human spirit for a time. Whether or not the Others pose a directthreat to humankind, their acknowledged presence will still precipitate anindirect negative effect on our institutions, particularly those dealing withwealth and power. That will make life hard for a while, and cheerfuldispositions may be greatly in demand.Naturally, what happens after Disclosure will depend greatly on what is actuallydisclosed. If the news is catastrophic, terrifying, or unfathomable, then allbets are off. Most of the following possibilities (but not all), deal with thetype of Disclosure that can be intuited from our own research and observations.Namely, that we will learn a massive cover-up has been underway for years, thatOthers exist, and that we are still coming to terms with what it all means.Shock and awe will predominate for some time. Some will argue that the so-calledDisclosure is itself a cover-up, just another form of mind-control. This beliefwill be supported by the fact that the political leadership will be concernedabove all else with managing the information, withholding what it can andspinning the rest. This obviously includes lying. People will continue to needto make their voices heard loudly if they want positive change and, above all,the truth. Others will simply want to be a part of the great shift. They willclaim to have seen UFOs or to have been abducted. Some will be telling thetruth, some will have been mistaken, and others simply will be piling on in anew version of stolen valor.There will be finger-pointing and accusations of collaboration that will turnneighbor against neighbor. This could be aggravated if it is confirmed that oneor more species of the Others exist in human or near-human form, or can take onthat form through some manner of manipulation.Finally, we will learn that, in the name of protecting the population, actionswere taken that are disturbing, illegal, and dangerous.Will these revelations alter life? Certainly they will bring great change, butnot necessarily in every way. After all, people from all over the globe havelearned about their governments committing war crimes, assassinations, and grossdeception, and still those citizens carry on with their business.Daily LifeThe grinding “Great Panic” of the first year A.D. will not prevent people fromtrying to return to some sense of the normal. The operative word here is“trying.” It will not be an immediate snap-back, and the situation will varyfrom city to city, nation to nation. Disruption will continue, from sustainedpower brown-outs, to transportation delays, to canceled events and meetings.Rude awakenings await the fussy kind of person who gets angry over a droppedcell phone call while driving to his favorite restaurant. Things will not workperfectly for a while.Roads may be easier to navigate because fewer cars are on them, in turn due todisruptions, shortages, perhaps even the rationing of gasoline. When ambulanceshave a full tank of gas, they might set records reaching the scene. A fewweddings may be postponed, but just as many others may be scheduled by loverswho fear a cosmic Armageddon. Why not meet your death in holy matrimony?In this period of adjustment, the new normal will be about learning to live withuncertainty. “Sure things” will be less sure. All of this will occur even in theabsence of a counter-move by the Others. Whether they are openly seen or not,their presence will permeate everything. If they do react in some fashion,reactions will intensify even more.[images/00028.jpg]Expressing ourselves. We must come to grips emotionally with the speed andimpact of the changes. Image by Masteresfx.With time, however, people will long for their old ways. Human resiliency willplay its part, but so will the lack of options. Staying home and watchingendless television will not be an option everyone can embrace. People willcontinue to need to work, lest the power plants fail, satellites becomeinactive, and wi-fi stops working. Even during the great disruption ofDisclosure, people will still need to emerge, in one form or another, from theirelectronic caves into the sunlight.Restaurants that closed to give employees time with their families, and thenstayed closed because they could not get the proper foodstuffs, will try tore-open but with limited menus. The trend toward consuming locally grown foodwill accelerate. More restaurants will begin growing some of their own food andspices.When cars break down, we need someone to repair them, and when they are notrepairable, we expect someone to sell us a new one. The people who sell themwill need the banks to offer credit. Automotive dealerships that had armedsecurity for months A.D. will soon find customers showing up again. Thesecustomers will either want big, secure cars and SUVs that can go anywhere, orthey will want cheap, fast, gas-efficient ones. Buyers will care less aboutcolor choices or chrome wheels. Companies will experiment with new car designsthat incorporate names related to space news, perhaps Andromeda, Universe, orSatellite.Family Still MattersStrange as the new world may seem, bursting with situations altered from whatthey were before, the essential basics will still have to operate in our lives.Even Germany and Japan came back to life after the devastation of World War II.Life finds a way.Whereas much of the adjusting will be happening around the world as seen on thescreens of our computers, phones, and televisions, the most important changeswill occur in people’s homes.Bruce Sallan, author of a parenting column, A Dad’s Point of View, will probablybe one of the voices advising us amid the blanket of media that will descend. Toparents wondering how they should talk to their children, he emphasizes as muchhonesty as the child can handle. “It is alright to be scared,” Sallanemphasized. The important thing is to learn everything possible and be preparedto answer your child’s questions as honestly as you can. But pay specialattention to your child’s state of mind. There are already plenty of childrenwaking up from nightmares in the middle of the night, Sallan reminds us, andthis will undoubtedly intensify after Disclosure. The accounts of kidnapping byaliens will terrify adults and children alike. There will be parents who seek tominimize this and to tell their children that nothing really has changed,because to their knowledge most families have not had vivid UFO encounters orabduction experiences.However, other families have had experiences, and once Disclosure happens,virtually all of the people who have kept their sightings and experiences tuckedaway out of public view will be able to have them acknowledged. Honesty,therefore, should be the best family policy.1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos725084]EducationAlong with family, one of the great regulators of the return to normalcy will beschool. Parents will still wake up, still feed their children, and still sendthem to school, so that they themselves can get to work, get paid, and keep thelights on. In even the smallest towns, school is the community gathering place.Keeping kids in the classrooms will be a priority.Imagine the first day back, A.D. In the teacher’s lounge, many teachers willwonder if so much of what they have previously taught is either wrong, or aboutto seem basic, simplistic, and outdated. Most textbooks will need to bere-written.In the classrooms, students will feel the uncertainty infecting theirinstructors, but they will also sense the excitement of living through amonumental re-evaluation of what passes for knowledge during a turning point inhuman history. Initially, schools will focus on reassuring young children thattheir world is not about to end, that they are safe. Many of those preachingcalm will doubt their own words.Assuming the days go on with no catastrophic attack from the skies, the moodwill change from one of projecting calm to a new phase. If ever a “teachingmoment” is to be thrust into the world headlines, the moment of Disclosure willbe it. All of the books in public libraries and bookstores that have beenrelegated to the “Metaphysical” section will fly off the shelves. This will beconfusing in its own right, given that the disinformation campaign throughoutthe years has fed one fallacy after another into the dialogue. Ironically, atthe same time that so many textbooks become outdated, so too will many of thebooks about UFOs and aliens.Even as they are working with their students, teachers will realize that theyhad been living in a kind of fiction. Their previously accepted knowledge willbe subject to critical analysis. In the A.D. world, the teachers will be as muchstudents as the children they teach, swimming in the deep waters of a newparadigm, trying to find solid ground.No More Falsehoods or DerisionsInitially, the academic world will receive harsh criticism. For years, there hasbeen more evidence supporting the reality of UFOs than there has been forspeculative scientific theories about black holes and dark matter. Yetprofessors and researchers refused to consider that evidence, preferring thesafety of more comfortable topics. But like the media, the academic communitywill quickly forgive itself. Its members will fall over themselves to fund,research, and study the impact of Disclosure. Some careers will shatter like somuch broken glass. Others will be made overnight. This will be a new academicgold mine.Universities were incubators of change in the 1960s, places where traditionalliberal arts disciplines were undergoing rapid transformation. This will happenagain as Disclosure redefines and rejuvenates each of them.History and Political ScienceHistory books will need a top-to-bottom rewrite as we assemble a new chronologyof our civilization. In particular this will mean everything from the SecondWorld War onward, but also possibly a significant portion of our ancienthistory.It will be a sobering moment when educators admit that much of what they knewwas wrong. Textbooks will be missing more than a few pages about the world’sclandestine history and the lies that were told to keep it contained. As thestructure of UFO secrecy is subjected to hard analysis, it will become necessaryto reinterpret most of modern political history.Consider the work facing a presidential historian if a few of the followingstories turn out to be true.> [images/00012.jpg] President Dwight Eisenhower’s famous Farewell Speech of> 1961 issued a warning about the growing power of the “Military-Industrial> Complex.” Was Ike also speaking about the breakaway civilization that was> being created to capture, profit from, and hide UFO reality?

Events that seem like conspiratorial fantasy in a> world without UFOs might seem credible in a world where their reality is> confirmed.In the A.D. world, the preceding questions may be fruitful or not. But it isguaranteed that there will be many new and intriguing questions to emerge,burning bright in the media, then settling into academia for furtherinvestigation and integration into the historical record.Political science—the study of the political institutions of the world and aboutthe nature of power—will be hit hard by Disclosure. How could it be thatpolitical scientists have missed something as powerful (and expensive) as theUFO coverup? How could political scientists have ignored the hundreds of knowncases of military jets being scrambled to intercept UFOs?Society will see how the discipline of political science had become anideological prop for the National Security State, part of a revolving doorsystem whereby government insiders, once they leave their jobs in Washington,become hired to teach at prestigious universities. In the A.D. world, peoplewill see them as complementing the intelligence community and private moneygroups that have been managing the UFO secret.The upside will be the advent of many young political science scholars who willdedicate themselves to understanding and dissecting the true structure of powerin our world. They will take no prisoners in this endeavor to understand thecriminal nature of so much of contemporary governance.EconomicsAlthough traders, industrialists, and entrepreneurs work to keep the economicengine of the global economy running, the academicians will watch them, studyinghow the economy has been hit hard in the short-term, and deep in the long-term.The numbers comparing life before and after Disclosure will be an unendingsource of reports, papers, and dissertations.Of greater significance will be the new field of black budget economics.Consider Deep Throat’s advice to Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and CarlBernstein to “follow the money,” then consider economists applying this adviceto the entire UFO cover-up. At one conference after another, economic scholarswill discuss and analyze how it was possible to siphon away billions uponbillions of dollars in public and illegal funds.Entire careers will be devoted to this pursuit. Scholars will be forced torealize that not all of the black budget monies derived solely from tax dollars.Sophisticated studies will be published detailing the relationship betweenintelligence communities and such illegal activities as drug trafficking andfinancial fraud.PsychologyThe study of the human mind will need to keep pace with the emerging facts.After the requisite soul searching and recriminations about how thepsychological community dropped the ball regarding potentially millions ofabduction victims, allowing them to believe that they were victims of some formof mental defect, the field will be primed for a rejuvenation.One area of concern will be the field of human memory. How, for instance, has itbeen possible to manage human memory in the aftermath of the abductionexperience? True, many memories leaked through after the experience, but mostdid so incompletely, and so many never did until many years had passed. This isan area in which the classified literature is undoubtedly vastly ahead of the“topsiders.”There will also be a resurgence in the study of the phenomenon of socialcontrol. What is it about the human brain that enabled billions of human beings,from the slow-witted to the brilliant, to become duped by a propaganda system ofUFO denial? Why could they not see that the Emperor was, indeed, wearing nothingat all?At the same time, the ongoing adjustment to the reality of Disclosure shouldspawn study after study trying to make sense of how people coped with theinitial shock, and then the transition going forward. College courses will beconstructed around the Great Panic of Year One, focusing on the human desireA.D. to hoard all manner of items for reasons that were unclear even to thehoarders.The great prize for psychologists will come when enough information becomesavailable to begin comparative psychological studies of humans and the Others.Presumably, at some point, they will have access to information about how theseOthers think and live. When they do, we will inevitably learn new truths aboutthe nature of ourselves.AnthropologyThe study of comparative human cultures has long been relegated to the sidelinesof the liberal arts, but will be energized by the emergence of“exoanthropology.” No longer forced to focus solely on the possibilities of whatit means to be human, anthropologists, similar to psychologists, will be lookingat the human being by way of comparison with the Others. As in the field ofpsychology, many new insights will emerge about such things as human socialinteractions, organization, hierarchy, aggression, and collaboration.There is probably much that the men and women who have been working secretly forthe Breakaway Group already know about the Others. Much of this may beintegrated into the academic environment, facilitated and controlled to a largeextent by these hidden scientists. This will be an area of great sensitivity,and black-world scientists will not readily participate. When they do, theirsources of information will be scrutinized carefully. This topic is important,as governments around the world will want accurate information on the Others. Ifthere are multiple groups of Others, trying to define the hows and whys of theirown interactions may be critical to our own survival.ArcheologyFor years, establishment archeology has ignored evidence of advanced technologyin the remnants of ancient cultures. The construction and features of the GreatPyramid of Giza, Peru’s plains of Nazca, Stonehenge, the famous Central Americancrystal skulls, and many more anomalies have been excluded from the debate inmodern archeology. Professional archeologists do not deny these artifacts; theymerely explain them as fundamentally conventional (as in the case of thePyramid, Stonehenge, and Nazca) or declare them as of unproven authenticity (aswith the crystal skulls).Scientists who are quietly interested in these matters can hardly expect topublish papers about them. Orthodoxy, not diversity, rules this field. Disputethe dominant theories, and you fail to get published. Failure to get publishedtranslates into a loss of funding, credibility, and ultimately one’s livelihood.Once the existence of the Others has been acknowledged, the game changes.Suddenly, what is now dismissed as “forbidden archeology” becomes mainstream,even cutting-edge. Undoubtedly, some of the alleged evidence of alienintervention will turn out to be dead ends, but will all of it? It will be thejob of archeologists worldwide, most of whom work in universities, to sort outwhat is true and what is not.Disclosure of the truth about the presence of Others on planet Earth will hitarcheology like a 9-plus Richter magnitude earthquake. It will open that fieldup to a fresh analysis of the ancient origins of the human race. One in which wemay discover—and begin to fill—a gaping hole in our ancient history.Literature, Philosophy, and the ArtsAlthough clearly distinct from each other, philosophy and literature are bothessentially studies in human wisdom. Philosophy, after all, means “love ofwisdom,” and there is no question that the world’s great literature isfundamentally about reaching deeper levels of wisdom regarding humankind’s placein the universe.Disclosure will shake the academic communities of these disciplines, forcing itsmembers to confront the often meaningless and irrelevant discussions to which somuch contemporary literary criticism and academic philosophical analysis has nowdevolved. There is nothing like the shock of such a life-changing event asDisclosure to force one to start looking at the big picture in one’s life andrealize how much time one has wasted.What will be left for these disciplines are their foundations, which are basedon some of the deepest reflections that human beings have ever made aboutthemselves and the universe. When confronting the reality of another speciesthat may pose a substantial threat to one’s ego, if not one’s very existence,what humanity will need is inspiration. People will need strengthening of thespirit. They will need the example of the best that our species has offered, andthis is readily available through the great books of our civilization.We will rediscover the power, solace, inspiration, and spur to greatnessbequeathed to us by such writers as Tolstoy, Goethe, Shakespeare, Milton, Yeats,Marcus Aurelius, and countless others. The same holds for the tradition of finearts and music, including such geniuses as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, orwithin the great tradition of jazz, or the exquisite traditions of music fromthe Indian subcontinent, of China, of the Near East and Africa. Then there isthe human artistic tradition, too overwhelming to summarize. Our species hasbeen nothing if not continually inventive in the fine arts, finding new ways ofexpressing who we are, what we are, and where we are in the cosmos.Do the Others have philosophy? Literature? If they do, what are these like? Whatdo they think of our contributions? It is mind-expanding simply to consider thetopic.Our past writers, philosophers, musicians, and artists have given us perhaps thegreatest gift for life A.D. They are reminders of who we are. And of theinherent greatness and divinity that resides within the human being. Thus, thegreat souls of the past will be rediscovered. They will be needed to support andinspire those of us living in the most demanding period imaginable.Those thinkers and artists will also inspire the greatest outpouring of deepreflection and profundity of the human condition yet achieved. On the shoulderof giants will stand those, After Disclosure, who will see farther, clearer.Popular CultureSome people do not read Shakespeare or listen to Mozart. They swim in the watersof popular culture, a milieu encompassing movie stars in drug rehab, artistsorganizing charity concerts, and every new film, song, and artist arriving onthe scene. All of that will be affected, changed, and re-formed by Disclosure inways about which we can only speculate, because pop culture always arises fromthe moment in unpredictable manifestations.After Disclosure, humanity will experience a cultural explosion that will rivalor surpass the Renaissance. The revelation that we are not alone willsupercharge the Zeitgeist. Artists the world over will need to expressthemselves on this subject, to interpret it for their audiences. Painters willturn to their canvasses, writers will struggle to tell the story in new ways,and even comedians will find fresh new jokes.From Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, the Internet will be ablaze. The numbers ofWebsites spawned by Disclosure will dwarf anything before. People will need tocommunicate their feelings and discuss their fears, and therefore the socialnetworks will vibrate with activity.Reliably, if it happens within the next decade, Bruce Springsteen will have anew song about it, and it will be the most downloaded song on iTunes. Oldprotest songs may be dusted off, given new lyrics, and find a second life.Almost certainly, too, there will be a revival in the use of hallucinogenicdrugs. After Disclosure, users of such drugs will try to “break on through tothe other side,” in this case, the other side being a place where they willclaim to find the other entities inhabiting our world. Whether the drugs arepsychedelic standbys such as LSD, or mescaline or emerging ones like SalviaDivinorum, Ayahuasca, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), or something newly developed ina laboratory, one or more will be embraced for the counter-culture’s newvision-quest. The idea of the party drug scene will shrink back, and the idea ofseeking enlightenment through drugs will be in favor again.Meanwhile, the media will never be as happy as it will be AD. Even seeminglydistant relatives of the news, such as Entertainment Tonight, will find theirown spin. Everything that affects the world, like 9/11 or the Arab Spring, alsoaffects celebrities. News will want to cover how the rich and famous arehandling Disclosure, because the celebrities will act as surrogates for theaudience. If they admit to being scared, the audience will know that “it’s okay”for them to feel the same way. This will translate to red-carpet interviewswhere celebrities wear gray ribbons and talk earnestly about reaching out inpeace to the Others.An entirely new form of celebrity will be created. From among those who have hadsome form of abduction or contact experience with the Others, a few of them willbe famous or modestly famous for one reason or another after Disclosure. We maysee an entire group of B- and C-level celebrities who are vaulted forward intothe public’s awareness, simply because they will be able to talk openly abouttheir experiences.But the biggest emerging celebrity will be someone in the lineage of Carl Saganand Neil Degrasse Tyson, a scientist who has a tremendous ability to connectwith an audience. Unlike Sagan and Tyson, however, this sci-lebrity will fullyand completely embrace the technological wonder that allowed the Others to comefrom their home to ours. On the other hand, for every newly minted celebrity whospeaks in a careful, measured manner about how the world is changing, there willbe new versions of Nancy Grace, Keith Olbermann, or Glenn Beck.This Revolution Will Be TelevisedAdapting to change is what television does best. As a relentless purveyor ofculture, it mercilessly tosses aside what is not working and casts about forsomething else that will work. Then it produces that form of programming for aslong as people will watch it, eventually tossing aside the genre, star, orseries until it needs to be called into duty again, albeit with a “new” twist.As our digital age continues to transform itself, people have gained many newoptions for watching their news and entertainment. Even so, television—namely,serialized episodes of news, non-fiction, reality, drama, and comedy—will stillexist in some form after Disclosure, and it will adapt. Indeed, ratings willprobably be exceptional.There has never been a twist as new, invigorating, potent, and compelling asDisclosure. So long as the Others do not detonate magnetic pulse weaponsworldwide, depriving us of our technology and knocking us back to the Stone Age,television will love this brave new world.For decades television shows have been attempting to prove or debunk UFOs. Mostof those will become instantly obsolete and will never air again, at least intheir original form. New programming will be needed. Veteran Hollywood producerRob Kirk predicts that networks will scramble immediately to re-purpose thoseold episodes. They will still have plenty of excellent interviews and eyewitnessreports that can be salvaged. The narration will be re-written to remove thetone of skepticism and incredulity that these shows have often had as theirpoint of view. A few new interviews, a couple of all-nighters re-writing all thevoice-overs, and new programming that looks tailor-made for AD will be on theair, almost immediately.However, that is patch-work compared to what will come. Depending on the type ofDisclosure that comes to us on Day One, there may be photos, videos, labreports, secret warehouses, and unclassified documents. It may very well be atreasure trove of raw material. As the news divisions scramble, no one will bebetter prepared to turn this around quickly than a Hollywood reality producer.Deals between production companies and networks will be struck so fast in thedays immediately AD that there will be no time for Business Affairs lawyers evento write a deal memo. These will be virtual “handshake” deals, struck andconsummated over text messages, e-mails, and cell phone calls. Entire shows willbe delivered and aired in these early days before the paperwork catches up. Thiswill be a boon to the existing companies, as networks will want instantly tocall and hire teams they have worked with before.There will be requests coming out of Hollywood to embed camera crews intogovernment or private enterprise groups that are on the leading-edge of contactissues. If it turns out that there is a fast-response crash retrieval teamsomewhere in the breakaway civilization, networks will demand access to it fortheir own purposes. Imagine how addictively watchable The Deadliest Catch becamefor audiences. What if, instead of fish, aliens are invoked?As an example of what we might expect, imagine a new show called Above andBelow. In this series, almost anything goes, but its stock in trade is an aerialpoint-of-view, seeing the world below from a POV of a flying saucer. This isused as a transitional device to go into the world below, the massiveunderground base and tunnel system that has been created over the decades.The series would be a vehicle to take audiences into previously classified labs.If there are any live EBEs that have been acknowledged, access to the units thatmanage them medically, as well as the security attached to them, will be deemedof paramount importance. The best example from today’s landscape would be ademand to go to “S-4” (just south of Area 51) with an all-access pass and seewhat is going on there. If it turns up empty and abandoned, expect loud cries of“foul.” However, that is non-fiction programming. In TV parlance, this meansserialized documentaries, no matter how hyped or inflated they may be. The otherside of the coin is so-called “reality” programming, which, as viewers mostlyrealize, is not especially real at all.Reality producers will not miss a single beat to inject Disclosure into theirseries. Any series in production—featuring anything from survivors on an island,to competitors locked in a house, to suitors vying for spouses—will keep thecameras rolling. This will give us moments where the latest celebutantes cry andrage over their reactions to the news.Although it may seem to trivialize the news that is breaking around usminute-by-minute AD, the truth is it will provide a service that should not bediscounted. These kind of contrived shows still feature real people, or at leastpeople who are more real than an actor on a sitcom. Audiences identify withtheir problems, share their anxieties and pain, rejoice in their triumphs. Theywill be looking to these same people, whether we like it or not, to see how theyrespond and, by extension, how they themselves should respond. Producers whoscript the scenarios for these reality shows will incorporate reactions fromwhat they see on the news, their friends and family, and their own feelings.They will then create situations for the players, contestants, and celebritiesto react to Disclosure. For example, The Biggest Loser may be about trying tolose weight, but the immediate post-Disclosure shows will feature players whostruggle not to over-eat to calm their fears about the Others and the potentialfate of the world.Yet even as existing shows bend and twist to add Disclosure as just another“challenge” for their contestants, writers, producers, directors, and executiveswill be assessing what should come next and to get it on-the-air before theircompetition beats them to the punch. This process is going to yield some showsthemed specifically around contact that are likely to be stranger than we caneven predict now.Within months, the tsunami of Disclosure will hit scripted programming.Television dramas and comedies will also work through the impact of AD in waves,just like their non-fiction and reality brothers and sisters. Existing showswill incorporate it immediately into their scripts, if at all possible. Forexample, an episode of the C.S.I. franchise may, depending on the facts that arelearned, deal with human mutilations by the Others. Some shows may beconstrained because of their period settings, but some, perhaps Mad Men, mightslip in a line from a character about the police officer in Socorro, New Mexico,who thought he saw a flying saucer and its alien occupants out in the desert.A standard three-camera sitcom, however, could insert content into the nextscript up, and put it on the air almost immediately. Humor will be tricky, butit won’t be long before people demand to laugh, no matter what the news aboutthe Others turns out to be.Oddly, writers who once specialized in ripped-from-the-headlines movies of theweek, a genre now nearly extinct, will be the ones who have immediatelyacceptable skills.As an example of new dramatic series in the AD world, imagine an hour-longdrama, Breakaway, that allows viewers to experience the pre-Disclosure world ofsecrecy through the eyes of real characters whose life stories have beenoptioned for their underlying rights. If Mad Men can find success withcharacters from another time living their lives against the backdrop of a NewYork advertising agency, then it seems likely that viewers can similarlyexperience the cover-up in order to understand how we got to where we are.Then again, in television programming, anything can happen.The Next Generation of Movie AliensWhat will the new models of alien/human contact look like in Hollywood films?It’s a challenging question, particularly because the one thing we know forcertain about this contact, based on where we are now, is that it has happenedby stealth, hiding for decades in the shadows of public discourse.Unless these Others appear with hundreds or thousands of Motherships in theskies, an entire genre of films dealing with hostile alien invasions such asIndependence Day will probably be wiped out. A potentially more interestingtemplate may be the kind springing from films such as Alien Nation and District9. Less firepower, more nuance.The world, even the world as interpreted through fantastic storytelling, willhave to adjust to this new reality. Because, in the new world, fact will havecaught up to fiction.The Man Who Puts the Extra in Extra-TerrestrialTodd Masters is a special effects creator who has offices in both Hollywood andVancouver, B.C. For two decades, Masters has made his living designing all kindsof creature effects for film and television projects. Ask Masters how manyversions of an alien gray he has helped create and he just laughs. He createdthe original Dark Skies grays, and multiple other iterations of alien life,including those from The Day the Earth Stood Still, Invasion, The Arrival, andeven The Last Mimzy.Masters knows that his life will change after Disclosure. For starters, he andhis team of creature designers have always made alien beings the old-fashionedway, creating them based on experiences and living organisms that exist here onEarth now and in the past, then interpreting them “to the furthest reaches ofthe mind.” He says that, similar to everyone else, he will be glued to thetelevision news coverage on Day One, but that even as he is watching, he willalso be directing design teams to base a new generation of physical and digitalcreations on the emerging reality. Even if all he has to go on at first is ablack-and-white photo of a dead alien from decades ago, that will be enough tobegin.The hitch in the work flow, however, is that the demand for his company’sservices will be fundamentally changed.Currently, his buyers want fantastic eye-popping creatures. They want to seemovies that are “what-ifs,” whether they be about alien parasites ornever-before-seen werewolves. After Disclosure, Masters thinks that non-fictionwill eclipse fiction, at least for a while, and that audiences will want storiesbased on fact. He thinks that many films that would have been dismissed as too“sci-fi” in the past will now be greenlit to production as true stories.Filmmakers Thrust into the FutureJames Cameron’s Avatar, a massive success today, may immediately be seen as ahopelessly naive, antique artifact of the last days of official denial. That is,his portrayal of humans as the marauding bad guys may be inverted if we learnthat human culture has been subverted by an alien presence. If so, it will notend the desire to hear stories, but merely change which ones have the greatestresonance. It could potentially tarnish or damage Cameron’s career, given hisheavy-handed “bad human, good alien” storytelling.We have already discussed Steven Spielberg, but here we can add that, given thesuspicions through the years that he has been part of a government plan toacclimate the public to the reality of ET, one can imagine that he will jumpinto the fray.Disclosure will not end Steven Spielberg’s fascination with aliens. Rather, itwill send him off on the journey of his lifetime. He may abandon whateverproject he is currently working on and begin on what may be his seminal work.The man who has given so many windows into contact can hardly turn his back onthe field when his dream of knowing the truth finally comes true. Nor will themovie-going public accept passivity from him. They will have seen him ontelevision as a regular commentator in the immediate aftermath of theconfirmation of contact, opining on what it all means simply because—by virtueof having tried to make sense of it through his own prism of film—he will beconsidered an expert. And compared to the average human being on the planet whohas only given the subject passing thought, he will be one.A Comic Book PerspectiveMany have already thought about this world of AD because they have read widelyin the world of comic books. After all, alien invaders, predators, and warriorshave always been a staple of storytelling in these pulpy pages.The aliens of Marvel Comics tend to be more spiritual, blurring the line betweenGod and extraterrestrial. Characters such as Galacticus and the Silver Surferpossess vast cosmic abilities that make Earth’s superheroes look like insects.In DC Comics, the concept of the alien is more about the heroes. Superman andMartian Manhunter, for example, are given great powers by virtue of coming toEarth to live.Beau DeMayo, a self-described “comic book nerd,” has read them all. Perhaps mostimportant about aliens in the Marvel Universe, he points out, is that they areresponsible for the evolution of human life on Earth, an idea supported by manywho believe in ETs. The DC Universe is also interesting, DeMayo points out, asit takes a “community approach to its aliens.” In its pages are organizationssimilar to the Federation in Star Trek, or intergalactic police forces comprisedof many aliens.Both the DC and Marvel universes share one common theme: To rise to their fullpotential, aliens must discover and embrace the essence of humanity. “Beinghuman,” for example, is the way Superman seeks to check the potential abuse ofhis powers that he might otherwise indulge in. The Green Lantern is the best ofthe Lantern Corps, because of his human will and spirit. Even the Norse GodThor, whose Asgardian past is now being played as rooted in extraterrestrialorigin, must live among humans to be humbled and grow to be a better man.Because the focus is always on the discovery of the hero’s humanity despite hisor her off-world heritage, it could be seen as creating a strange prejudiceagainst aliens.Comic readers will also not have a problem accepting it if the reality turns outto be that there are multiple races of the Others interacting with us. Whereasfilms tend to see the human-alien interaction as binary—us and them—comic bookssee the universe as us and them, and them, and them. With hundreds of alienraces in those fantasy universes, humanity is portrayed as just another race.However, we are not completely knocked off our pedestal, because all life in theuniverse is connected. Usually, too, all roads lead back to Earth in somefashion.Stan Lee’s Point-of-ViewStan Lee’s name is almost synonymous with comic books. He was the man in chargeof Marvel’s creative output during its heady rise to fame during the 1960s.Almost all the characters being turned into movies these days—Iron Man, Hulk,Spider-Man, Captain America, Thor, X-Men, the Avengers—were created, co-created,or re-invented by Lee during his days as the company’s patriarch. Through theyears, Lee has given a great deal of thought to aliens. “I always try to goagainst the grain and use them as the starting point for the story and try totwist it,” says Lee. “If they’re introduced to us as being good, then they’reactually bad. If we’re told to fear them, then they’re probably here to helpus.”As for real ETs, in contrast to the comic book variety, Lee thinks they are “outthere” for sure, and maybe even over here. “There must be other intelligent lifein the universe—living, sentient beings,” he said. “Whether they have come herein UFOs or not, I don’t know. But I figure there must be something to thembecause so many people have seen them.”Indeed, Lee had personal testimony to that effect. His “right-hand man” atMarvel was his operations director and artist Sol Brodsky. Lee describes him asbeing very “level-headed,” so he was shocked to hear from Brodsky about a cartrip he had just made to Las Vegas. “When we were driving, I think we saw aflying saucer,” Lee quotes Brodsky as telling him. “It was fast, it didn’t haveany wings, stopped right over our car, hovered, then zipped away faster thananything I’d ever seen.” Both men wondered if it was a government test of anexperimental aircraft, but Brodsky believed it was more than that. In theaftermath, Lee developed his own theory that flying saucers were not from otherplanets but from the future.On the subject of a panicked population, Lee has played it both ways through theyears as a writer, doing what suits the story and his telling of it. Personally,he believes Disclosure would stimulate an “incredible amount” of curiosity fromthe public, that people would be “intensely interested” in the news. He predictspanic only if the aliens are portrayed as dangerous and hostile. Otherwise, hefeels that people will accept them and continue on with their lives. In hisview, the group that should feel panic most would be the people who have keptthe secret—because the rest of us are going to feel anger and annoyanceregarding their decision to withhold information.What would happen to the aliens of Lee’s imagination, as well as to that ofother comic book writers, once we know aliens are real, and we have confirmedphotographs of them? Lee thinks that comic writers will adapt and assimilatequickly. They will soon be telling stories starring the Others, trying to helptheir readers work out their own feeling about them.Contact as a Laughing MatterThe revelation of first contact with an alien intelligence is a serious matter.Still, like almost everything else in the world, it will be treated by someoneas the inspiration for a joke. Whether it is a riff on “To Serve Man” being acookbook, to an alien fixation with probing and crop circles, Disclosure maywell usher in boom times for joke-telling.Chris Rush is a New York comedian and an original contributor to the NationalLampoon series. When he spoke with the authors, he was in the final preparationfor a one-man comedy show called Reality: The Myth. He is a devoted “verbalcartooner” who revels in the art of the ad-lib and could see himself immersed inthe coverage of Disclosure. Then, he would get himself down to a comedy stage,armed with three or four premises, and let loose.3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos725730][images/00029.jpg]> Maybe they won’t be little gray guys with Jiffy-Lube and anal probes.

He thinksDisclosure will create a climate where people need to laugh more than ever.Rush was friends with comedy great George Carlin, and the two had spoken atlength about the nature of reality. As Rush notes, “The UFO thing just naturallyfalls in there.” In their discussions, Carlin expressed his opinion that the“planet’s owners” have known about the Others for a long time, but have notconfessed their knowledge because they never felt they could control what wouldhappen if they did. Carlin thought that knowledge of how complex the universe isand how other life has come here would “put us in our place and make us think.”Also, that “the them and us thing here on Earth might disappear.”Visions From the FutureEvery artist in the world—whether they be American or Chinese or Iranian—willhave something to say about humanity’s changed circumstances. Trying to imaginethis explosion of content is nearly impossible, given that there will behundreds of millions of minds trying to express it when the time comes. By wayof example only, here are a few possible turns in this coming story:> [images/00012.jpg] A traveling museum containing exhibits of alien artifacts> and bodies that will generate lines like the earlier King Tut exhibit, times> 10.> [images/00012.jpg] Competing stadium rallies, pro and con for increased> contact, will force singers, actors, and politicians to choose sides.> [images/00012.jpg] More than 1,000 new books about contact will be available> for purchase within two years AD.

In many cases, it will create newforms of commerce around its expression. All this is unpredictable, except thatit will surprise us.But what art will the Others bring? Will we get to see their culture as theyhave seen ours? Or is it possible that among their great works of art ishumanity itself?The Next Great Healthcare DebateConsider the state of biotechnology today, independent of any interference orassistance from the Others. Humans stand on the verge of dramatic breakthroughsin genetic engineering, synthetic biology, anti-aging drugs, stem-celltreatments, body implants, and regenerative medicine. By 2020, it is likely thatthe human genome will be understood, meaning that the ability to manipulatehuman DNA will be vastly greater than it is today. This means that a genetictransformation or beneficial remodeling of humanity will be possible. A morefrightening thought is that it portends the possible temptation for a genetictransformation of some humans into a kind of Master Race.What if the Others already began this process?Abduction reports suggest that our reproductive systems and DNA are of interestto them. There is belief among many researchers that some form of hybrid specieshas been the end goal. There has also been ample speculation that the Othershave manipulated the human genome in our ancient past. We may be their creation,or been biologically influenced by them.If it turns out that the Others have played God with our biology, it would shakeus as much as the basic confirmation that we are not alone. It not only wouldmake us feel less unique; it would shatter any perception of equality we mighthave with them.The debate would then move to motive. We would look for evidence—in abducteereports, DNA study, the revised historical record, and from the BreakawayGroup—as to what the Others hoped to get from this. Do they think of us as theirchildren and are simply trying to make us better and healthier? Or do they thinkof us as livestock, put here to populate the planet for their return andcolonization?If anyone wants a scenario for panic in the streets, it will come from this.This discussion may not start immediately on Day One. It may take years, as newinformation is released and discovered.Although the shock from such a revelation would be deep, its effect may begreater still on our current debate about using genetic tampering to createeverything from clones to healthier humans. If we have already been manipulated,one might argue that it removes a key obstacle to further tampering. Some willundoubtedly argue that it is better for humans to manipulate their own genesthan to have another species do it for them. Our own scientists, now armed withpublic support, may work to accelerate human evolution in order to make usstronger to a dangerous interloper from elsewhere.Conversely, it may turn out that the knowledge and help of the Others willenable humankind to live longer and healthier lives.Whatever the motivation, if Disclosure creates scientific conditions where humanDNA can be altered without a great morality debate to hold it back, our childrenor our children’s children may grow up in a world where they have been given abonus allotment of years. This might give the individual much more time toexperience the glories of being alive but, for society, it may be a mixedblessing. Our population is already testing the carrying capacity of the Earth.If we live longer and die less, Earth’s resources may simply exhaust that muchfaster.There is no doubt that the state of medicine today is changing rapidly and greatadvancements are coming, contact or not.Dr. Jeffrey Galpin specializes in Infectious Disease Medicine, MolecularBiology, and AIDS research, and was the principal investigator who applied thefirst gene therapy for HIV/AIDS. He also contracted polio when he was 8 yearsold, something that changed his life, and gives him pause to consider what anadvanced intelligence could offer us, if they wanted to. He held out hope that“there would be a sharing of intellectual properties between our civilizations.”This could lead to better treatments and preventative measures for our mostfeared illnesses. Still, humanity needs to beware of such gifts. The moleculargenetics of life is tied to and dependent upon the universal clock of aging anddeath. All manipulations, therefore, will have consequences.Such changes could affect the economy, expanding the number of productive yearsthat people would want to be in the work force and lengthening the years theywould live in retirement. If such gains come with a need to have our bodiestinkered with like a car getting a replacement part, some of us will sign on andothers will not.Ultimately, besides simple life expansion, the Others could conceivably help usachieve immortality by mapping the chemistry of the human brain like a harddrive, and facilitating its implantation into a new cloned body that is younger,healthier, and yet still the same person. Sort of.Still, nothing is more likely to fan the flames of paranoia and hostility morethan the thought that the Others have been messing with our bodies, for whateverreasons. This returns us to our premise that the decade after Disclosure willborrow some inspiration from the 1960s.The Next GenerationToday, as our world is observed and acted upon by unknown intelligences,humanity is mostly asleep at the wheel. Disclosure will rouse many of us. Thatdeeply felt shock, the presence of Others, will cause great masses of people toquestion their values, to question how they had been living their lives. Theknowledge that there is another species operating here on Earth, a species thatlives and thinks in ways that may well be beyond what humans generally reach,will be sobering and liberating at the same time.Imagine that billions of people, upon considering the presence of beings thatare exceptionally intelligent and maybe telepathic, possessed of magicaltechnology, and possessing a cosmology of far greater sophistication than ourown, are here now. Many will ask a basic question: Have I been wasting my life?This feeling, aggravated by political assassination and misguided war, is whattriggered the change that started in the United States and spread globally asthe 1950s gave way to the 1960s.[images/00031.jpg]Reliving the Sixties. Peace, love, and understanding won’t be any easier to findthis time. Photo courtesy of Jacom Stephens, iStockphoto.Wherever we are going as a society, as a world, we will not arrive there on theDay of Disclosure, nor even 10 years later. The changes inherent in such amind-expanding way of seeing life will create ripples of hope and fear for manyyears. It may be unclear for decades which emotion will prevail.We remain optimists. Eventually, humanity will find its way home. New ways willtake root, and life will go on.Most change—to become firmly entrenched—requires the arrival of a new generationthat no longer remembers the old ways. This will be true of Disclosure.This time around, perhaps the new incarnation of the 1960s really will usher ina time of peace, love, and understanding.[images/00037.jpg][images/00026.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Paradigm Shift: Our New Place in the Universe> > The greatest obstacle to discovering the shape of the Earth, the continents,> > and the oceans was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.—Daniel J. BoorstinThere are times in human history when new information and new revelations cantransform the world. Ideas that had been held as timeless truths can shatterovernight. In our world, Disclosure will be that trigger. It will usher in atime comparable to the era of Copernicus and Galileo, when humankind firstrealized that the universe did not revolve around the Earth.The word paradigm was coined by the philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn, in his1962 study, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. He used it to describe acoherent theory of reality. When scientists obtain data that fails to conform tothe dominant paradigm, the data are considered anomalies and normally discarded.Kuhn agreed that sometimes this is reasonable to do, but when too many anomalieslitter a paradigm, something is wrong. Every now and then, a great thinker comesalong who sees the world differently. This new vision makes sense of theanomalies and incorporates them into a larger, more complete, more accurateparadigm. Newton was such a thinker, said Kuhn. So was Einstein.In this chapter, we discuss how the impact of Disclosure will affect thedominant paradigms in scientific thinking, as well as that other greatinterpreter of reality: religion.Five centuries ago, it was the religious institutions that resisted the paradigmshift. The issue was whether the universe was Earth-centered or Sun-centered.The Polish astronomer, Nicolas Copernicus, was so fearful of Church reprisals tohis great work on this subject, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, that it waspublished only after he died in 1543. It was an important theological issue,because the Catholic Church had taken a stand on the matter. The Churchmaintained that, as God had made humankind the centerpiece of his Creation,mankind’s world was at the center of the universe. Science, however, made itclear that this was not so.Incidentally, the issue of extraterrestrial life was raised at around the sametime, and received even greater resistance. The Italian scientist andfree-thinker, Giordano Bruno, had the audacity to believe that the stars were infact like Earth’s own Sun (he was the first known person to argue this). Hebelieved in the existence of other worlds and of other beings created by God. Inother words, Bruno said that there were extraterrestrials in our universe andthat they, too, were God’s children. His reward was to be imprisoned for sevenyears, then burned alive for heresy in the year 1600.During most of the ensuing centuries, Christianity in general has been silent onthe matter of extraterrestrial life. Since the modern UFO era began, however, wehave seen interesting developments on the matter. Christianity is a largeumbrella, encompassing an impressive number of branches and sects, and itsadherents have expressed every position on ET life and UFOs one can imagine.Today, the greatest blind-spot regarding Disclosure belongs to the scientificcommunity. Despite the evidence, it has steadfastly ignored the UFO mystery.Indeed, establishment science has hampered the search for truth by joining thechorus of naysayers who have made the experiencers of extraordinary events feelshunned, ridiculed, and possibly insane.The situation regarding religion is different, if for no other reason than thereis such a variety of them around the world. People’s spiritual beliefs may havecertain things in common, such as the existence of a reality beyond the physicalone of our five senses, but beyond that, almost anything goes.Yet we should distinguish the science and religion from their institutions.Science, despite its institutional shortsightedness and conformity, isultimately based on empirical observation and testing. That is why so manyscientific conclusions, no matter how firmly believed, are called “theories”(Einstein’s Theory of Relativity and Darwin’s Theory of Evolution). As thephilosopher of science Bertrand Russell pointed out, scientific conclusions arealways provisional. They are subject to change when new evidence is presented.This may be an emotional drawback for those who demand certainty in their lives,but Russell argued that it is an advantage over the long term.1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos726035]Religious truth, on the other hand, at least when it is based on revealedstatements from Holy Books, is not so easily subjected to modification. As aresult, we may expect certain of those religions to push back when confrontedwith a reality as shattering as Disclosure. Many of their adherents willundoubtedly see this unbending quality as a strength, a firm shelter within theraging storm around them. Even so, there is reason to believe that many of theworld religions will show the ability to adapt.The End of Religion?Many analysts have concluded that the announcement of intelligent life in theuniverse would destroy traditional religious faith. They point out that many ofEarth’s religions continue to be heavily anthropomorphic, seeing humanity as thecenter of God’s plan. The announcement (or arrival) of sentient beings,therefore, would be too much for them to bear.Other analysts, such as astrobiologist Paul Davies, theorize that visitingaliens might have discarded theology and religious practice “as primitivesuperstition,” and would persuade humanity to do likewise. Or, “if they retaineda spiritual aspect to their existence, we would have to concede that it waslikely to have developed to a degree far ahead of our own.”2[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos726225]These assumptions seem to have become a mantra in the Search forExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) community and elsewhere, repeated so oftenthat it feels as though they were established fact.No FearIn 1994, researcher Victoria Alexander conducted a survey of clergy fromProtestant, Catholic, and Jewish congregations that asked, “Would you agree that‘official confirmation’ of the discovery of an advanced, technologicallysuperior extraterrestrial civilization would have severe negative effects on thecountry’s moral, social, and religious foundations?” She concluded thatministers did not feel this would threaten their faith or that of theircongregations. Religions would not collapse.3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos726394]Eight years later, in 2002, a Roper Poll similarly asked, “Would an announcementof extraterrestrial Intelligence precipitate a religious crisis?” Not only wasthe answer overwhelmingly “no,” it actually rose with age. Ninety-three percentof respondents over age 65 said it would not be a big deal. Roper concluded that“very few” Americans thought that an official government announcement onextraterrestrials would cause them to question their religious beliefs.4[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos726700]In early 2010, another survey examined the issue, this time with respondentsfrom around the world. The results put another nail in the coffin of the SETIclaims of religious berserkers running amok over Disclosure.The survey was designed by Ted Peters, a professor at the Pacific LutheranTheological Seminary in Berkeley, California, and was called The Peters ETIReligious Crisis Survey. With his colleague Julie Froehlig, Peters interviewed1,300 respondents, including believers from Roman Catholicism, mainlineProtestantism, evangelical Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity, Mormonism,Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Atheists and agnostics were alsoincluded. The survey tested this hypothesis: “Upon confirmation of contactbetween Earth and an extraterrestrial civilization of intelligent beings, thelong established religious traditions of Earth would confront a crisis of beliefand perhaps even collapse.”5[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos727076]Here are some of the responses they received.> [images/00012.jpg] “Finding ETI, I believe, would be a profound and wonderful> event.”> [images/00012.jpg] “Extraterrestrial religious beliefs and traditions will> differ, perhaps greatly in some ways. However, they live in the same universe> with the same God, and a similar array of religious responses and developments> would likely have developed on their world.”> [images/00012.jpg] “Nothing would make me lose my faith. God can reach them if> they exist.”> [images/00012.jpg] “I believe that Christ became incarnate (human) in order to> redeem humanity and atone for the original sin of Adam and Eve. Could there be> a world of extraterrestrials? Maybe. It doesn’t change what Christ did.”The authors concluded: “Religious persons, for the most part, do not fearcontact.”A small minority did not believe in extraterrestrials. These respondents, inwhat can be described as the “rare Earth” camp, believe life on Earth to be sorare that a second creation of life is unlikely to have occurred elsewhere. Eventhis belief, however, does not necessarily make people fragile. One evangelicalProtestant remarked, “I don’t think they are out there. But if they are, that’scool.”The only respondents who predicted the collapse of religious belief systems wereself-described atheists and agnostics. Believers expected to carry on with theirlives. Many even expected some form of Disclosure within their lifetimes.The acknowledgment of Others demands that we look at our universe as larger,more crowded, and less Earth-centered than we have in the past. That, by itself,is not a fatal blow to any institution.The Vatican Moves Toward DisclosureThe world’s largest church seems to be positioning itself to be at the forefrontof Disclosure. The Vatican has long maintained several major astronomicalobservatories and a collection of radio telescopes. In recent years, itshierarchy has stated, in one form or another, that we have company. Perhaps theyknow something is afoot, or suspect its inevitability.Until his death in 2008, Monsignor Corrado Balducci, long-time friend of PopeJohn Paul II, and the Vatican’s leading exorcist, had stated his personalopinion many times about the reality of extraterrestrial life. “There must besomething between us and the angels,” he told an interviewer. “If there areother beings, they are surely more evolved than we are…. It is illogical and abit arrogant to believe that we are the only intelligent beings in God’screation.” Balducci believed that Jesus died for these beings, just as he didfor humanity. “He is called King of the universe,” emphasized the Monsignor.“Never underestimate the great mercy or compassion of God.” Balducci was notspeaking in purely theoretical terms. He stated more than once his belief thatcontact between humans and extraterrestrials was real.6[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos727412]The Vatican’s astronomers have also expressed their belief in extraterrestriallife. In 2005, Vatican astronomer Guy Consolmagno concluded that chances arebetter than ever that humankind is facing a future discovery of extraterrestrialintelligence.7 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos727650] In 2008,Vatican chief astronomer Father Jose Gabril Funes granted an interview to theL’Osservatore Romano newspaper that made headlines around the world. FatherFunes stated his opinion that intelligent life may exist elsewhere in theuniverse, and that such a notion “doesn’t contradict our faith.”8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos727920] The same year, the ReverendChristopher Corbally, the vice director of the Vatican Observatory, said, “Howwonderful it would be to have other life beyond our own world because it wouldshow how God’s creation just flows out without abandon.”9[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos728274]It is doubtful that all of these Vatican authorities would speak so openly ifthey felt they were in conflict with official doctrine. Quietly, a policyappears to have been decided upon.Christians and AliensSome Evangelical Christians have placed the Bible squarely into the middle ofthe UFO issue. They have no problem believing UFOs are real, and some evenwelcome the idea of extraterrestrial visitors. One respondent of the PetersReligious Crisis survey wrote, “From an evangelical Christian perspective, theword of God was written for us on Earth to reveal the Creator. Why should werepudiate the idea that God may have created other civilizations to bring himglory in the same way?”Yet this viewpoint is a minority among Biblically-based Christians. The Biblemakes no reference to other worlds. Such Christians who do believe in UFOsusually interpret them as demonic, not as extraterrestrial. One respondent ofthe Peters survey spoke for many Christians when he stated, “I personallybelieve that Satan, the enemy of Jesus, will attempt to deceive the world intobelieving he is an ET and many will fall for it.”Charles (Chuck) Missler is one of the world’s leading Christian ufologists. Heis a graduate of the United States Naval Academy and Air Force flight training,and holds a Master’s Degree in Engineering from UCLA. He also knows as muchabout UFOs as most non-Christian ufologists. He is well-informed about theirhistory, the cover-up, and specific cases. He knows about the testimony fromastronauts, radar controllers, and jet pilots. He simply explains UFOs andaliens through the lens of Biblical interpretation as inter-dimensional beingsthat have a physical reality.In his book, Alien Encounters (coauthored with Mark Eastman), Missler arguedthat what we call UFOs are not aliens from another planet, but demonic entitiesdescribed in the Bible. Read the Book of Genesis and you will find this passage:“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, anddaughters were born unto them, that the Sons of God saw the daughters of men,that they were fair, and they took them wives of all that they chose.”10[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos728795]The offspring of these encounters were known as the “Nephilim” or “Fallen Ones.”Some ufologists interpret this passage as interbreeding between humans andextraterrestrials posing as “the Sons of God.” Missler replies that the truth isthe other way around: what people think to be aliens are actually “the FallenOnes.” They are not from another planet, but have been here all along. Theyoppose the will of God and seek to undermine God’s creation, humankind.That UFOs often appear to be physical and are even tracked by the world’smilitaries does not alter this. Such entities, according to Christianufologists, can be completely physical, and there is nothing stopping them fromappearing to use technology. During abduction experiences, they also manifest inphysical form, yet this remains a form of spiritual attack. Christian ufologistDr. Michael Heiser describes these as most likely “an inter-dimensional (thatis, spiritual) reality… one that can manifest in truly physical form, and notbeings from another planet.”11[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos728921]There is also a Christian school of thought in ufology that claims abductionscan be fought with prayer, specifically by invoking the name of Jesus Christ.12[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos729217] Not surprisingly, this hasbeen rebuked by non-Christian abduction researchers, and is questionable by areview of abduction literature. One of the most famous of all abductees, BettyAndreasson Luca, was a devout Christian who experienced multiple abductionsspanning most of her life. She also certainly did not interpret her experiencesas demonic.In the post-Disclosure world, many Christians will see the Others as demonicbeings. To them, the Bible is not a matter of interpretation or conjecture, butthe unerring word of God for all time. Christian author and former televisionproducer Coleman Luck recalled that the New Testament speaks of a “greatdeception” to take place during the “End Times.” At that time, the Anti-Christwill appear and will deceive most Christians away from their faith. He addedthat “an essential part of that deception will have to do with what appears tobe alien contact.” Beings claiming to be extraterrestrials will seem to provethat Jesus was not the savior of mankind. “Ultimately,” Luck concluded, “thatlie will be overthrown.”13 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos729467]It is a clear that most evangelicals will interpret the “Others” according tostrongly held Biblical-based beliefs. In this context, some of the most relevantpassages in the Bible will be:“For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against theprincipalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness,against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.”14[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos729651] This is from Ephesians, aletter from the Apostle Paul, and one of the earliest Christian documents. WhatPaul appears to be saying here is that humanity’s great struggle is againstspirits that are literally “in the heavens.” In the same letter, he refers toSatan as “the prince of the Power of the Air” and “the prince of the aerialhost.”15 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos729774]Another passage from Paul, this one from Thessalonians, will resonate withChristians in the post-Disclosure world, as it speaks of the arrival of “Satanwith all power and signs and lying wonders.”16[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos729896] Might the shock and awe ofa more technologically advanced civilization be interpreted in this way?Another passage, this one from Matthew, will surely be read in Churches aroundthe world: “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shallshow great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shalldeceive the very elect.”17 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos730020]Ultimately, many Christians will interpret a Disclosure announcement in light ofthe Book of Revelation, which discusses the Second Coming of Christ beingpreceded by natural disasters, famines, the arrival of the Anti-Christ, and awar in the heavens.18 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos730147]During the Cold War, it was easy for Christians to interpret this last as anuclear exchange between the United States and Soviet Union. However, theannouncement of extraterrestrials could provide just as much fodder forinterpretation. What this means is that Christians will be wary, at the veryleast, of a major Disclosure statement. They may well take on a more seriousopposition as matters develop, expecting that the battle of Armageddon is athand.People do not change overnight. For better as well as for worse, during times ofstress, during periods of great uncertainty and even fear, believers will holdmore closely than ever to their faith. One key article of faith among Christiansis that God will not allow his creation, humankind, to be possessed by dark,Luciferian forces. Instead, it remains within the power of all souls to acceptGod and reject Satan.If the Christians are right about how they interpret the UFO phenomenon, it ishoped that the rest of humanity will thank them for their stand against ademonic presence masking as extraterrestrials. If they are wrong, or evenincomplete, in their analysis, they will be seen as obstructionist or evendangerous, refusing to see the truth that stares them in the face.Disclosure may not resolve this matter. The dispute may continue for a longtime.Other Faiths, Easier TransitionsSome faiths appear positioned to accept the reality of “Others” arriving orliving on Planet Earth.Belief in extraterrestrial life is integral to members of the Church of LatterDay Saints. In Chapter One of the Mormon Book of Moses, we find this explicitstatement: “And worlds without number have I created; and I also created themfor mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine OnlyBegotten. And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many. Butonly an account of this Earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you.”19[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos730478]God tells Moses that there are other worlds and other peoples. These otherworlds are God’s business, and need not concern Moses or people on Earth. YetMormons do believe that they will have interaction with extraterrestrials aftertheir death. Similar to other Christians, and like people of other faiths,Mormons see themselves as children of God. Unlike other versions ofChristianity, however, they believe they will become God—who, according to theirbelief, was once a man. Members of the Latter Day Saints believe they are Godsin training, so to speak, who will rule a world with its own population in theirnext incarnation. How this might affect their attitude toward extraterrestrialor interdimensional entities that are here on Earth would certainly beinteresting.20 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos730710]Islam, with 1.5 billion adherents, is the world’s second most-practiced religion(after combining all the various Christian faiths). It does not have a strongposition on the existence of extraterrestrial life; belief one way or the otheris not related to the fundamentals of its creed. But neither does the religionprovide any roadblocks toward accepting an extraterrestrial or interdimensionalreality. One respondent of the Peters survey stated, “Islamically, we do believethat God created other planets similar to Earth.” Another wrote, “Only arroganceand pride would make one think that Allah made this vast universe only for us toobserve.”The texts of the Koran give support to these positions. “All praise belongs toGod,” states Islam’s holy book, “Lord of all the worlds.” One commentator onthis verse continues: “Worlds of Matter and Force, worlds of Spirits and Angels,worlds of Beauty and Goodness, worlds of Right and Law—worlds that we canimagine or understand and worlds which we cannot comprehend even in ourimagination.”21 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos731155]The Islamic scholar Mirza Tahir Ahmad quotes another verse in the Holy Korandiscussing the creation of “the heavens and the Earth, and of whatever livingcreatures He has spread forth in both….”22[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos731471] Islamic scholars have longcommented on the extraterrestrial implications of this verse. During the 1930s,Abdullah Yusuf Ali commented, “It is reasonable to suppose that Life in someform or another is scattered through some of the millions of heavenly bodiesscattered through space.”23 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos731761]Passages such as these will certainly hearten Muslims in the face of theacknowledged presence of Others on our world, whether they be extraterrestrial,interdimensional, or anything else. Allah rules over all, and may introduce themto humanity at His discretion.The post-Disclosure world will also prompt many Islamic scholars to re-examinethe nature of the jinn, commonly translated into English as genie. The jinn arefrequently mentioned in the Koran as creatures occupying a parallel world tothat of humankind. Along with humans and angels, they are one of the threesentient creations of God. Interestingly, only humans and jinn have free will.The jinn live in their own communities and, similar to humans, can be good orevil. The Koran mentions that they are made of “smokeless flame.” In otherwords, a source of heat or light.Unlike Christianity, where the devil is a fallen angel (Lucifer, or “lightbearer”) who had rebelled against God, the Islamic devil is a jinn named Iblis.He was granted the privilege to live among angels, then rebelled against God,and ever since—like his Christian counterpart—has continued to lead humansastray, which he will do until the Day of Judgment.We can easily see, then, how other beings that become known to humans in theworld AD, might be interpreted as fallen angels by Christians, or as jinn byMuslims. In the case of Muslim believers, however, the attitude may well be lessantagonistic than those of Christians, because some jinn are said to be good.Furthermore, according to Islamic belief, while the jinn Iblis may be adeceiver, he has no power to mislead true believers in God.Although Judaism has little to say about the idea of extraterrestrial life, thereligion, like Islam, should have little difficulty in assimilating it.According to the Talmud, there are at least 18,000 other worlds, although littleelse is said about them, including whether or not they are physical orspiritual. One kabbalistic book, the “Sefer HaBrit,” even mentions a planetcalled Meroz, where extraterrestrial creatures exist.Buddhists, too, will have no problem assimilating the new reality. Buddhism hasalways understood that there are beings throughout the universe. This was taughtby Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, more than 2,500 years ago. One Buddhistresponse to the Peters survey was that “ETs would be, essentially, no differentthan other sentient beings, i.e., they would have Buddha Nature and would besubject to karmic consequences of their actions.” Another wrote: “As a MahayanaBuddhist, with a worldview that includes in scriptures Buddhas and bodhisattvasfrom many different world systems, such news would not be shatteringtheologically, though of course institutions and practices might reverberate.”The same reactions can be expected from adherents of Hinduism, which also holdsto the idea of multiple worlds and their relationships with each other. Inaddition to these material worlds, there is also the unlimited spiritual world,where all purified living entities live with a perfect conception about life andreality. Indeed, spiritually evolved humans have received guidance and help fromthese entities of the spiritual world.New ReligionsGiven the sheer diversity in worldwide religions, there will be no singlereligious response to Disclosure. Some already agree with the premise, othersare moving in that direction, others have never considered it, some embrace theOthers as divine emissaries, and some assail them as the work of the devilhimself.No matter what the disposition of the many religious institutions, standing patwill not be viable. Change will be a bumpy ride, more so for some faiths thanothers. In the end, most of the world’s faiths will expand their message. Godwill be seen to rule over all life in the universe, although undoubtedly somefaiths will continue to claim that humankind has a special place in God’s plan.Religion has never been a static human endeavor. We have seen Christianity andJudaism compete for loyalty, and we have seen Christianity fracture into itsmany permutations. Other faiths, too—such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam—havegone through their own historical changes.Undoubtedly, new religions will be formed in the post-Disclosure world,influenced by who the Others are and what we learn of them. They will also beinfluenced by some of the adept and facile minds that spring to take advantageof the instability.At least one of these religions will explode into the public consciousness withthe right message at the right time. It is possible that the top religion of thefuture is one of which you have not yet heard.The Universal OrderAs with all our examples, the claim is not that this particular chain of eventswill occur. Rather, by outlining one specific possibility, it is easier tounderstand the post-Disclosure dynamics that will be at work.Imagine that the Disclosure is murky rather than clear. Authorities only confirmsome form of visitation by intelligent non-human beings. Yet, we are not in anytangible contact with them, our knowledge of them is ambiguous, and they seemuninterested in communicating with us. Such a shadow world is perfectly suitedfor the creation of a new religion.In this scenario, we focus on a congregational minister in Albuquerque, NewMexico, who uses Disclosure to vault into prominence. The minister, we can callhim Reverend Harper, seizes the initiative on the first Sunday following theDisclosure announcement with a stirring speech from the pulpit. Rather thandenounce these mysterious beings as being Satan’s army, he announces that he hasbeen called by God to reach out, bringing them to Christian religion if they arenot already devoted to Christ.Reverend Harper puts his congregation to work 24/7. They build a website andsend out an e-mail prayer. The message of his e-mail prayer is simple: Harperhas received word from God to reach out to these Others and let them know thatthey are loved and welcome in the greater Kingdom of Heaven. Within days,Harper’s site has received millions of hits and crashed servers. As the firstweek after Disclosure draws to a close, Harper has been interviewed by the majorbroadcast and cable networks and been quoted in major newspapers and magazines.The publicity has caused groups to spring up in cities around the United Statesand elsewhere, all signing on to Harper’s agenda. Throughout this media blitz,his message has continually refined itself. His small church in Albuquerque hasa new sign out front proclaiming itself “The Congregation of the UniversalOrder.”Next Sunday, Harper’s sermon is covered live and streamed around the world. Thatnight it is posted on YouTube to million of views. Ready or not, ReverendHarper, the Universal Order and his extraterrestrial connection, has gone viral.He also realizes he needs something more to keep people interested.Now Harper announces that he is starting a prayer chain to contact the Othersdirectly and speak to them about their feelings about the deity and tocommunicate to them the love that people of faith have to share. He points outthat governments have had more than 60 years to communicate and have failedmiserably. It is time now for God to be consulted. Harper says that when themembership of “The Universal Order” reaches 10 million, the prayer chain willfocus its holy energy into an attempt to contact the mind and spirit of theOthers in the service of the Almighty. They will extend the hand of friendshipand ask them to join in common cause to find the greater Glory of God throughoutthe universe.It takes two days to hit the 10 million number. At noon the following day, againto massive news coverage, Harper bows his head in prayer as the news camerasrecord millions of other people world-wide doing so. From Albuquerque to NewYork to Paris to Beijing to Mexico City, heads bow with him. It is the largestprayer chain ever attempted.All eyes and cameras turn to Harper to see how he interprets the results. Theman who less than two weeks earlier was a mid-level minister with no careerprospects now has the ear of the world. He says he has been humbled by theexperience and realizes he has been called by God to be his messenger. Harperconfirms that, indeed, the Others have spoken directly to him. He has been givena vision to build a church in the middle of the New Mexico desert. It will belarge enough to accommodate 100,000 people. It is here, he says, that the Otherswill reveal themselves.As the days go forward, Harper’s vision appears to have a price tag in excess of1 million dollars. His critics argue that there is no way to verify anycommunication with this other intelligence. Harper’s answer is that the time forsoldiers, lawyers, and bureaucrats to handle this affair has passed. Now it istime for men and women of faith to take the lead. Within weeks, ground is brokenon property less than 75 miles from Roswell, New Mexico.Within a year of Disclosure, the Congregation of the Universal Order holds itsfirst services in the new church. One hundred thousand people have seats in theenclosed stadium-like affair, at least that many others are in RVs on thecampgrounds surrounding the area, and nearly a billion people worldwide takepart, in real time, as the Reverend Harper, the new Prophet of Contact andChanneler of the Universal Order, walks to the microphone. He turns his eyestoward the heavens and says, “We are here Brothers and Sisters. Are youlistening?”The Nature of GodWhile it may be useful to learn about free energy, an extraterrestrial UnitedPlanet, or to peruse the Encyclopedia Galactica, it may not be the first thingon our minds when we begin to engage in honest contact with the Others. Ifpeople could ask one single question, many would want to know how these Othersconceive of God, followed closely by their attitude toward the afterlife.Energy, flying cars, and genetic manipulation will come further down the list.Certainly, we may learn something new about God. Either these Others believe insome form of deity or they do not. If they do, it may be possible to compareideas. If they do not, they may have their reasons, just as many of us haveours. It could lead to a spirited debate among humans, if not with the Others.Most likely, what they think about religion will be related to the other greatinstitution through which we interpret reality: science.ScienceThe first great question that Disclosure will raise for scientists will be: Howdid the Others manage to get here?Did they cross the incredible distances of the universe to get to us? If so, wewould need to ask why most reputable scientists declared such a thing to beimpossible. It will either mean that the laws of physics do not operate the waythey think they do, or they have closed their collective minds to things thatobviously were possible. Have the Others always been here in some manner? Didthey traverse dimensions or even time? If so, it still means that scientistshave collectively lived with their heads in the sand.Beneath these issues, deeper trouble will be brewing. The shock experienced byall other sectors of society will be amplified among professional scientists.Recall the 1961 Brookings Report. It concluded that, of all groups withinsociety, scientists and engineers might be most shocked by the discovery ofsuperior creatures, “since these professions are most clearly associated withmastery of nature.” Although non-religious people tend to believe thatDisclosure would traumatize the faithful, it may well be that men and women ofscience will be most deeply troubled, at least initially. For during times ofcrisis, faith may be all a person has to rebuild their life. The scientist’sfaith in “mastery of nature” will surely be humbled, if not broken, by theOthers.They will also be subject to profound public scorn. For years, scientists hadarrogantly ridiculed legitimate inquiries into UFOs, dismissing virtually allcontact evidence as hoaxes. The ineptitude of the scientific establishment indetecting such an obvious presence will be of profound significance.With their record of failure and lack of intellectual rigor so badly exposed,people will begin to study the relationship of science to the national securitystructure of power. Not in generalities, but in specifics. That will inevitablylead to the clandestine world, the world of secrets, and the breakawaycivilization that has grown within its secure confines.At this point the public will hit upon some answers, one of which is that aportion of the scientific community has known about these things all along. Itis just that their work was classified for decades. And the rest of thescientific establishment bought into the “deny and ridicule” concept so deeplythat they were forced to simply ignore inconvenient facts for fear of losinggrants, prestige, and promotion.Even in the pre-Disclosure world, independent analysts have concluded that toomuch of America’s scientific and innovative talent is dominated by nationalsecurity restrictions and requirements. A 2009 report from the National ResearchCouncil argued that “national security controls on science and technology arebroken and should be restructured.” Such controls, stated the report, initiatedto protect U.S. technological secrets and advantages during the Cold War, havebecome obsolete, and now hamper America’s global competitiveness.24[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos731993]Disclosure will bite the world of secrecy in its proverbial ass, and there willbe calls around the world to investigate the structure of innumerable scientificestablishments.There will be two other areas of immediate concern and blowback to thepost-Disclosure scientific community. One will be the previously mentionedSearch for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The other will be the NASAspace program.Disclosure of UFO and ET reality means not only have classified elements of thescientific community known about it, but that the SETI program has been nothingother than a diversion. NASA’s controversy will be worse. Most likely, therewill be admissions that NASA astronauts were silenced regarding UFO data andsightings, as has been frequently argued. Moreover, what if it also turns outthat NASA had concealed anomalies on the surfaces of the moon and Mars, alsosomething that has been argued for years. The result would be an angry publicand a call for a complete housecleaning.25[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos732828]What the public will learn—along with many unsuspecting scientists themselves—isthat the management of the scientific community for national security purposeshas been a matter of policy, overseen at the highest levels of power.Many important re-evaluations will be underway. One of them will concern thelate Dr. Carl Sagan.[images/00014.jpg]Keeping the faith? We may finally reconcile science and religion.

Photo byYuri Beletsky (ESO) via Wikimedia Commons.Carl Sagan: They’re Everywhere But HereCarl Sagan took America by storm during the 1970s and 1980s and became,practically speaking, America’s public Scientist-in-Chief. He first enteredmillions of living rooms as the affable scientist who appeared regularly on TheTonight Show with Johnny Carson. The Cornell University professor had a passionfor astronomy and a gift of making complex ideas easy to understand.Sagan’s celebrity increased with the release of the PBS Cosmos series in 1980,when he became famous for his phrase “billions and billions” to describegalaxies, stars, and planets. He pioneered the science of exobiology andpromoted SETI through the use of radio telescopes to listen for signals fromspace.As an investigative reporter for PBS, specializing in space science, Bryce Zabelmet Carl Sagan several times in 1981. Cosmos was still airing on the network,and the unmanned Voyager spacecraft was approaching the planet Saturn.Sagan gave a live, on-air interview as the pictures came in and were assembledby the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He was effusive about what a greatmoment it was for humanity. He talked passionately about how this first stepbeyond Earth would someday lead to manned adventures further into space. He waspositive that the universe, because of the sheer number of habitable planets andwhat he saw as the “bias” toward life, would be teeming with intelligent beings.After the show, Zabel asked Sagan if given his feelings about a universe filledwith life and humankind’s imminent expansion beyond our own Earth—he felt thatsome of those life forms could have already come here to see us? Might thisexplain reports of UFOs? Sagan reacted strongly and negatively, citing hisfamous phrase, “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”In a half-hour parking lot debate, an annoyed Sagan made his case. He arguedthat the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth were vanishinglysmall. His explanation for all the UFO sightings hit the basic points. Most weremisidentifications of natural phenomena, he said. The rest were from lonelypeople who created hoaxes in order to feel important.What about all the police officers and pilots? Sagan shrugged and said not oneof them ever got a good photo of what they saw. No extraordinary proof meant itcould not be taken seriously. Sagan did allow that the Cold War might have had apart to play in the UFO mystery. Some sightings could be of classifiedtechnology, and this most likely explained the suppression of some UFO data.His bottom line could not be moved. He stressed as strongly as he could that, inhis view, there was no strong evidence that aliens were visiting the Eartheither in the past or present. Then he got in his car and drove away.Throughout his career, Carl Sagan continued to advocate for the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. He even wrote Contact, a novel on the subject that wasadapted into a film. He clearly described his own feelings when, in the novel,the director of Central Intelligence (DCI) explained to a cabinet meeting,“There had been more than a million UFO sightings reported worldwide…and not oneof them seemed on good evidence to be connected with an extraterrestrialvisitation.” Fifteen years later, in his final book, Demon-Haunted World, Saganwrote, “There are reliably reported cases that are unexotic, and exotic casesthat are unreliable.”Sagan’s twin insistence that the universe was full of intelligent lifeforms, yetnone could ever reach Earth, seemed wildly illogical for a man so open to theidea that intelligent life was thriving throughout the cosmos. This isespecially odd, given his contention that we were a young civilization and thatmost others were likely to be many years beyond us.One of Sagan’s classmates at the University of Chicago, Stanton Friedman, anuclear physicist-turned-UFO researcher (and the man who broke the Roswellcase), called Sagan out publicly on his dismissive stance. “Every large scalescientific study of flying saucers has produced a significant number of caseswhich not only cannot be identified,” argued Friedman, “but which clearlyindicate that some so-called flying saucers are manufactured objects behaving inways that we Earthlings cannot yet duplicate with our manufactured objects.”26[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos733148]Why would a man of Sagan’s brilliance waste his professional life-energy withinsuch a close-minded and contradictory belief system? Why shut your mind to theone thing you most want to discover? It made no sense during Sagan’s life, andit makes less today. What could explain such behavior from a man who ferventlybelieved in alien life and seemed committed to finding it?There is one answer—speculation only—found in fiction. In 1997, just four monthsafter Carl Sagan’s death at the age of 62, the penultimate episode of the NBCUFO series Dark Skies gave Sagan his own fitting tribute. In that episode, thedebunker hired by Majestic-12 to confound the public with radio telescopessearching for signals from space while simultaneously discrediting all UFOreports was none other than Carl Sagan.The cover-up authorities had given him a choice as to whether or not he couldlearn the truth. Once he did so, however, he would never be able to speak aboutit publicly. Just as Harvard astronomer Donald Menzel had done before him in the1950s and 1960s, he would have to deflect people from the truth. Or he couldinsist on his right to speak freely—but then the real truth would be withheldfrom him.In the TV episode, the Carl Sagan character selected Door #1. Perhaps the realCarl Sagan made the same decision. In the topsy-turvy world of official denial,it is reasonable and possible that some day, in the not-so-distant future, aFreedom of Information Act request will uncover a document that shows Carl Saganwas in on the cover-up. For people who respect his vision and intellect, itwould make a great deal more sense.Whatever his motivation, however, the legacy of Carl Sagan will be tarnished. Hewill be seen either as blindly refusing to believe extraterrestrial life couldactually be here now, or as willfully hiding that fact from humanity.Sagan Was Not AloneCarl Sagan was hardly the only scientist relentlessly hostile to the idea thatalien life could be interacting with humanity here on Earth. If anything, themore we have learned about the probability of intelligent life elsewhere, themore the stridently skeptical the scientific community has become on this point.With a few exceptions, astronomers and astrophysicists today have acceptedSagan’s skewed view that the universe probably abounds with life, and none of ithas ever reached us. Even when Stephen Hawking made waves by arguing that aliensmight be hostile, he never entertained the possibility that UFOs might be real,and those beings flying them might be the very aliens he was worried about. EvenU.K. Royal Astronomer Lord Rees, while firmly favoring the likelihood ofextraterrestrial life in a landmark March 30, 2010 lecture, could not resistending it with a dig against UFO belief. “If the aliens had made the tremendoustechnological effort to come here across inter-stellar space,” he opined withobvious amusement, “what a pity they only made a few corn circles and went awayagain and what a pity they only met a few well-known cranks.”27[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos733355]His statement proved two things. First, as noted earlier, the policy of “denyand ridicule” has worked so well that most of society’s established authoritiesnow do the work of the secret-keepers without prodding. Second, and moreimportantly, it proved that when Disclosure actually does come, the scientificcommunity will be filled with prominent members who not only did not get it, butnever looked for it. What can one say of Lord Rees and his colleagues, learnedmen and women, whose scientific curiosity missed the greatest story of our time,whose scientific method included ridicule of decent observers who actually werecorrect?Fortunately, however, scientists are not the same as science itself.New FrontiersThe Disclosure of a non-human intelligence interacting with humanity and planetEarth will shock and discredit the scientific community’s old guard, but it willalso rejuvenate and spur our science to an unprecedented degree. Some of thismay depend on whether or not the Others decide to be helpful, and some of it maydepend on what secrets can be pried out of the Breakaway Group. However, it isprobable that, barring any support from either of those (who have, after all,been secretive all along), there will still be important breakthroughs in anumber of areas of current scientific endeavor.> [images/00012.jpg]Genetic manipulation.

Or perhaps the ETs or> Breakaway Group might decide to tell the rest of us, if they know.There are a few other areas that warrant an expanded treatment.In Search of Holy GrailsAny technology that has allowed interstellar or interdimensional travel hasprobably harnessed a basic source of energy available in the universe. Thequestion is: Will it be shared with us to our benefit, or used against us?As we have noted, our oil-based economy is unlikely to survive for the next 100years. If ETs have learned how to utilize an unlimited energy source of theuniverse, then it may very well be that power is literally all around us, and itis free. Of course, we might assume that somehow, the human power structure willfind a way to make people pay for it. This could be a major political battle ofthe future. (See Chapter 8 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_015.html#filepos587746]for more details.)For now, the best that our current paradigm of scientific thinking has offeredus is that we need to become more efficient and conserve more. Breakthroughs arenot discussed or apparently anticipated. Within our current, conventionaltechnology, an interesting invention known as “the Bloom Box” offers someintriguing possibilities. The Bloom Box is described as a solid oxide fuel cellusing liquid or gaseous fossil or bio fuel to generate electricity on demand. Itis essentially a small box that can power a home. Oxygen is fed to it on oneside, and fuel on the other. The two combine within the cell to create achemical reaction that produces electricity. There is no burning or combustion,and no need for power lines. The box is said to be highly efficient, but itsexact operation is still not widely understood. Although it is clean, it stillrelies on hydrocarbons, for example, fossil fuels.29[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos734196]Another source of energy, widely used in our world today, may receive a boostfrom Disclosure. This is the Sun. After all, the Earth receives 86,000 trillionwatts, or terawatts, of solar radiation energy on a constant basis. This is morethan 6,000 times the amount of energy used by all humans on Earth each year. Itought to be enough for quite some time, assuming we develop a way of utilizingit. However, although this is attractive, it is hard to imagine using solarpower to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo, at least without other radicalbreakthroughs.30 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos734572] Nor doesit seem likely that flying saucers operate on solar energy. Still, it ispossible that important developments can be achieved, some of which mightreceive a boost from what we learn of UFOs or the beings operating them.Moving into more exotic solutions, we arrive at Zero-Point Energy (ZPE). It iscalled “zero point” because it is energy that exists at zero degrees Kelvin; inother words, without any thermal energy. For this reason ZPE is often referredto as the vacuum energy, as it is associated with the vacuum of empty space.That is, ZPE exists everywhere. An easy way to visualize it is to imagine anocean from high above, and then at the surface level. Far above, it looksplacid, calm, and flat. But in a rowboat in the middle of the Pacific, you wouldsee tall waves and constant, powerful activity.This is something like the fabric of reality. Imagine an atom, then aninfinitesimal portion of that, and then another infinitesimal portion of that.At that incredibly small portion of reality, there is a great deal going on.Matter and anti-matter seem to “pop” into our reality and annihilate each other.There is a tiny release of energy at that level, and capturing it has become aHoly Grail for a few visionaries. If it can be extracted and used, one could seeits application for interstellar travel, as well as for possibly anything else;it is truly “free” energy. Do the operators of UFO craft employ ZPE? Maybe.It may also be that the operators of UFOs—both “ours” and “theirs”—use cleannuclear fusion. This form of power generation is often discussed in the openliterature, but is something the general public knows little about. It isanother Holy Grail.Current nuclear power plants use a process known as fission, which tears atomsapart, releasing energy and radioactive by-products. Fusion is different. Itoccurs inside every star, and has been replicated by humankind in the form ofthe hydrogen bomb. A nuclear fusion reactor would duplicate this process, but ina controlled way. It involves fusing together two “heavy” hydrogen atoms, knownas deuterium and tritium, to produce helium—inert and harmless—and vast amountsof energy. Electric cars, to name merely the first and most obvioustransformation, would become nearly universal.We have yet to produce clean, controlled fusion, at least in the open,non-classified world. But researchers continue to work on this problem, and manybelieve it can be achieved. If so, we would vastly reduce our dependency onpetroleum, make energy clean and relatively cheap, and profoundly change ourworld.No matter what the breakthrough may be, we cannot expect immediatetransformations to take place. For energy to be widely utilized, it must bewidely distributed. This requires changes in the “built environment,” or inother words, within a society’s infrastructure. One energy analyst described theproblem by way of an analogy from 18th-century Britain, when coal was alreadyunderstood to be a vastly better source of energy than wood. Yet, wood remaineddominant all through that century. The reason was that the economy, technology,and distribution systems were set up for wood. Coal extraction techniques hadnot become efficient enough. By the 19th century, the built environment hadcaught up and could meet the challenge of transitioning to coal. Even in the21st century, such things can take time.31[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos734953]No matter what the long-term solution to our energy needs may turn out to be,there is a likelihood that Disclosure will clear a path toward it. After all,whatever these craft are using for power, it is something that enables them tohover indefinitely and accelerate instantly, all in silence. This is anextraordinary amount of power. It is something we do not currently use, and thatis what matters. We can be sure that the scientific community will be jumpingover itself to understand everything about it.ComputingWith or without Disclosure, humankind is on a trajectory. Certain events mayspeed it up, others may impede it, but the destination is clear. That is a worldin which computing goes vastly beyond our current levels, creating a world sodifferent that we struggle to visualize it. This is why many computer scienceprofessionals used the term Singularity to describe it. Just as the singularityof a black hole is a unique phenomenon in physics, beyond the ability of ourphysical laws to predict, so too is the world that lies before us in regard tocomputing, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. Inparticular, the Singularity signifies the moment when machine intelligenceexceeds biological human intelligence, becomes sentient, and becomes the drivingforce of our civilization.The relationship of Disclosure to Singularity has never before been raised. Indoing so here, we are opening a new discussion and expect that any hypothesissuggested now may need to be refined, revised, or even rejected with the passageof time.Anyone who feels that UFOs are a bit “far out” for their normal intellectualfare may want to consider what our near future is probably going to look like.Ray Kurzweil, arguably the most prominent of the futurists writing aboutartificial intelligence, foresees machine intelligence surpassing humanintelligence during the first half of the 21st century. Among AI experts, thisappears to be a mid-range estimate, possibly a bit early. Generally, mostpredictions for the advent of Singularity are between 2030 and 2080, although afew push the date into the 22nd century.It may not be a world in which machines replace people—the vision of which isseen in such apocalyptic movies as The Terminator, The Matrix, I Robot, andothers. According to the experts, humans will also be modified and plugged-in,making old-fashioned, unenhanced homo sapiens a thing of the past.Nanotechnology may have a major role to play. Imagine a nanochip the size of ahuman brain cell, designed to duplicate all the functions of that brain cell.Such chips are currently thought to be possible. Now imagine that it functionsmore efficiently than your brain cell, and imagine that a certain percentage ofyour frontal lobe is supplemented by these nanochips, giving you an IQ of 200 ormore. What’s more, you would have telepathic connectivity to the World Wide Web,and also to other people.Though this may be possible, it gets even stranger.Consider developments in genetics and biotechnology. During the first decade ofthe 21st century, the human genome was finally mapped in its entirety. This isimportant, but this incredibly complex genome is only beginning to be understoodby scientists. Within the next few decades, it will be better understood andmastered. Inevitably, attempts will be made to enhance it in one way oranother—if not for the masses then for the few. Such enhancements might include“switching off” the gene for aging. Others might enable greater physicalstrength, greater intelligence, or even abilities to interact with otherdimensions of reality—what some would call “the spiritual realm.” Thepossibilities are almost too awesome for contemplation.Nanotechnology is about to become a major industry. Defined as “the engineeringof functional systems at the molecular scale,” it has also been described by theU.S. National Science Foundation as “the next industrial revolution,” enablingmicroscopic implants that kill cancerous cells, a box the size of a sugar cubecontaining the entire contents of the Library of Congress, or materials lighterthan steel with 10 times the strength.32[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos735321]The potential of nanotechnology goes far beyond these examples. Think about“nanofactories” similar to the replicator device featured in the televisionseries, Star Trek: The Next Generation. Packed with miniature chemicalprocessors, computing, and robotics, a nanofactory would produce items quickly,cleanly, and cheaply, directly from blueprints. It might also proliferateexponentially, as nanofactories make more nano-factories. Such a device wouldmake “the building of products…as cheap as the copying of files.”33[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos735757]What this all means is that, with or without Disclosure, with or without the aidof the Others, human society is going to look very, very different than it doestoday. Consider how the continually increasing connectivity will change ourworld. During the late 1980s, the rudiments of the Internet were coming intoplace. By the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web, complete with graphical userinterface, was a fact, but still in its infancy. By 2000 the web was ubiquitous.Still, the revolution continued. YouTube arrived in 2005, roughly when cellphones became true hand-held personal devices with digital cameras, musiclibraries, full web access, and more. What level of global connectivity willexist in 2030? 2050? 2100? How intelligent will our “devices” be? How small?We all know this abstractly, intellectually. But to use a loaded word, the worldwill be utterly alien, with or without real aliens being acknowledged. Here isthe world as it may well look during the second half of the 21st century.> [images/00012.jpg] Computers that exceed human intelligence in many or most> key areas.> [images/00012.jpg] Genetically modified human beings with a variety of> implants.> [images/00012.jpg] Human-machine cognitive interfacing to create the> possibility of a truly cybernetic organism.> [images/00012.jpg] Computers embedded everywhere.> [images/00012.jpg] Microscopic “nanobots” that can be programmed with> intelligence (or perhaps by a computer intelligence) to compile or decompile> at will into any shape or structure imaginable.> [images/00012.jpg] Holograms and virtual reality everywhere.> [images/00012.jpg] The advent of quantum computing, an event that may be a> profound leap into a new world of computing, vastly beyond our current level.> [images/00012.jpg] Lifespans that may go on for a long, long time.What we are talking about is essentially a new species of human and mostcertainly a new level of intelligence, possibly orders of magnitude beyond whatwe experience today. Perhaps human nature will not change all that much, butthen again perhaps it will. It may also be that only some humans stand tobenefit from such perks, and may set themselves up as a true Master Race,genetically modifying and enhancing themselves to their heart’s content, whilealso modifying the “rabble” to suit their specifications. After all, humans havedone it to farm animals for 10,000 years. The coming world may be paradise, orit may be hell, depending on who you are.This is a realm of speculation that will probably have more than one mistake andseveral dead-ends. Yet, as of this writing, these are outcomes that, strange asthey may seem to some, are possible to envision. Only time will tell.Disclosure and the SingularityBecause predicting the future requires a combination of imagination andextrapolation, there are several ways that this techno-utopia or technodystopiamay relate to Disclosure. It depends upon when Disclosure occurs, and it dependson when the Singularity occurs.If Disclosure occurs first, it will likely speed up the coming of theSingularity. After all, while shocking the scientific community and psyche tothe core, Disclosure will nonetheless spur it to an unprecedented degree.Computer science will undoubtedly be one of the key areas of study, if for noother reason than to deal with possible defense implications.One thing to consider is how the approach of the Singularity will affectDisclosure. For the closer we approach the Singularity, the more likely thatDisclosure will occur. As the power of the computer becomes overwhelming, as theinterconnectivity of our world becomes ever more pronounced, as our ability todetect other intelligences continues to broaden and deepen, it becomes ever morelikely that something will give. The unknowns are when it will happen and whatwill trigger it.If the Singularity occurs sooner, so will Disclosure. If, as some of theSingularity “optimists” would have it, that event is likely to occur in oraround 2030, then Disclosure will probably arrive a year or two before—barring,of course, the accidental mass sighting or some other unforeseen act—say, asurprise statement by a powerful figure. If, however, the Singularity is slowerto arrive, for instance 2080 or 2090, this will make Disclosure predictions alittle more interesting, and certainly more difficult.All we can say is that time does not stand still, and the world of tomorrow willnot resemble the world of today. Somewhere along the line between now and thepost-Singularity world will be a moment when the sum total of intelligence andcomputing power in human civilization will see the obviousness of an advancednon-human presence here on Earth. Exactly where that moment will be along theline is impossible to know, but that we will cross it is undeniable.Religion and Science:New Paradigms From an Old ConflictOne of the most fascinating results of Disclosure will be a new relationshipbetween religion and science. The two modes of thought have been uneasybedfellows since the modern age of science began four centuries ago, and, infact, the basic conflict extends back more than 2,000 years to the ancientGreeks.Two elements of the conflict must be distinguished. The first concerns whatphilosophers would term epistemology—that is, how do we know what we know? Whatconstitutes valid evidence for knowledge?Accounting for certain variations and distinctions among them, religions usuallyclaim to acquire their knowledge by revelation. The assumption is that animportant element of reality is normally hidden from humanity, but can berevealed at certain times. These revelations often come as flashes of insightappearing to a single person. The source of the revelation is usually understoodto be divine. Such revelations are not usually debatable; believers are meant toaccept them without argument. After all, how could God be wrong?Such an attitude toward truth is unacceptable to a scientist, who is constrainedto adhere to a certain method—the scientific method. This means, above all,collecting data through observation and experimentation, then formulating andtesting a hypothesis. Such testing must also be repeatable. Someone else must beable to be duplicate the test. This is a critical point. The hypothesis, inorder to be valid, must be testable, or to use the word that scientiststhemselves use, it must be “falsifiable.” Simply put, the hypothesis may betrue, or it may be false. But if you can test it to find out one way or theother, then at least it is falsifiable.It is unlikely that Disclosure will alter this distinction between scientificand religious thought. These are two systems of thinking that are fundamentallydifferent. They comprise a basic philosophical divide. And yet, this does notmean they cannot coexist. Many of our best scientists possess a faith in God.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the Human Genome Project, said eloquently that“reason alone cannot prove the existence of God. Faith is reason plusrevelation.” To do this, one must think with the spirit as well as the mind.“You have to hear the music, not just read the notes on the page. Ultimately, aleap of faith is required.”34[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos736051]Disclosure and the God HypothesisThere is another element to the conflict of Religion vs. Science. To describeit, we need to speak in more general, approximate terms. Yet, the conflict isreal. It is about something that religious thinkers believe in, and somethingabout which most scientists remain agnostic or even doubtful.[images/00032.jpg]Parting the heavens. The Big Picture begins to emerge. Photo courtesy ofNASA/STSci.We are talking about the existence of a spiritual realm, the existence of God,and all that goes along with it. In other words, will Disclosure will offer usproof for this belief, or at least strong supporting evidence?Within UFO research literature, there is no shortage of claims that the “aliens”possess their own spiritual orientation. People who recall abduction experienceshave occasionally commented that the beings took them to pray. Indeed, it seemspossible that these beings themselves exist in what we might loosely call thespiritual realm.What if these beings claim to be the “divinities” worshiped by early humansocieties, or that they created us? Even if they made no such claims, what ifmany people gain that impression? Five thousand years ago, the ancient Sumerianswrote about their gods, calling them the Anunnaki. What if some of these beingsare interpreted as such? What if they have something provocative to say aboutJesus Christ, Mohammed, or other important spiritual beings of human history? Inother words, what if Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha are seen as one of “them?”Events like these would spark intense reaction by people everywhere. Some wouldbelieve the claims; others would call them deceptions. Even barring something sospectacular, it is conceivable that the Others may have insights into otherdimensions, insights that people come to accept.Throughout the history of modern ufology, there have always been “nuts andbolts” researchers who have taken a strictly materialist point of view of theseother beings. The assumption is that the Others are flesh-and-blood entities,probably from another planet somewhere else in the universe, and have come hereto investigate us. However, not everyone agrees. For sure, the UFO phenomenonhas often been strange, and has suggested various non-materialist aspects.Telepathy seems to be involved. Time sometimes seems to be manipulated in someway that we cannot yet understand. And there are many people who claim toreceive channeled or telepathic communications from ET beings. None of thisproves that the Others are spiritual entities of some sort, but it may be thatthis is sometimes the case.Ultimately, we may learn that the concept of “mind over matter” is not onlyvalid, but true. Admittedly, this is a definite if, but if the Others candemonstrate that all humans possess inherent spiritual gifts that have beendenied throughout much of our history, if we as a species learn to awaken thatpart of us which may be dormant, if we learn to “see” reality from a broader,deeper perspective than we have previously seen, clearly that would changereligion, and it could well change science, too. This is because, for humanitywould then have upgraded its operating system. In such a situation, much of theold software would probably be upgraded, too. This does not mean rejecting oldbeliefs and values, which seems unlikely. It would be more like expanding ourcircle of understanding to incorporate new realities.Our eyes would see more, our minds would grasp more, our hearts would feel more.No thinking person can deny at least the possibility of our ability to attainsuch a state. The question is, will knowledge of the Others spark such anawakening? After all these years and all these debates, where lives have beenlost and ruined on both sides, it is possible that somehow the Others will beinstrumental in bringing about something we have yet to do ourselves: fusespirituality and science.If so, then our current debates between religion and science will seem pedanticand irrelevant to people a century from now. If they are lucky, they will havegraduated to the next grade level in the grand school of God’s universe.[images/00034.jpg] From:Shiloh Ray <s.ray@netburbank.com>Subject:Re: Thursday MeetingDate:November 16, 20219:23:02 AM PDTTo:Robb Canwood <robb.c@netburbank.com>Hey, Robb!

At that point, questions will abound: Who will speakfor humanity? What issues will be on our agenda? Where, how, and when willformal contact take place? What will our world be like? How will Disclosurechange us?The answers will be determined the same way humans deal with other problems: thepractice of politics. In countries around the globe, from China to Israel to theUnited Kingdom, this process is often nasty, and the other side is oftencharacterized as evil, stupid, or both. When practiced between nations, outcomescan be positive and cooperative, or aggressive and violent, ranging from theeradication of smallpox to global war. When practiced between humans and anotherintelligent life form, one can only imagine the outcome—which is what we will doin this penultimate chapter.The Politics of ExopoliticsThroughout the years, the UFO phenomenon has prompted the creation of new termsand concepts:> [images/00012.jpg] Ufology, as the study of the UFO phenomenon.> [images/00012.jpg] CE1, CE2, CE3, CE4, and CE5, to describe levels of “close> encounters.”> [images/00012.jpg] Disclosure, as the effort to end UFO secrecy.In the 21st century, another term, exopolitics, coined by researcher and writerAlfred Webre, has come into use.Stephen Bassett, head of the Paradigm Research Group (PRG), which has advocatedfor UFO Disclosure since the 1990s, defines exopolitics as “the art or scienceof government as concerned with creating and maintaining governmental policytoward extraterrestrial-related phenomena and extraterrestrial beings.” TheExopolitics Institute, headed by Michael Salla, PhD, describes it as “aninterdisciplinary scientific field, with its roots in the political sciences,that focuses on research, education and public policy with regard to the actors,institutions and processes, associated with extraterrestrial life, as well asthe wide range of implications this entails through public advocacy and newlyemerging paradigms.”In other words, exopolitics involves the politics of “us” and “them.”Considering all the problems associated with human-to-human politics, imaginewhat mistakes have been made or could still be made in any relationships withOthers.In human-to-human politics, people never agree for long; factions andin-fighting are the norm. The same is true for exopolitics. The bottom line ishow we assess ourselves, and how we assess the Others. If we cannot agree on theformer, how can we possibly agree on the latter? In our world today, it is afantasy to think people can agree on that point. Throughout the history ofufology, there have been researchers who have emphasized the dangers posed bythese other beings, and probably just as many who have focused on theirbenevolence. In exopolitics as in national politics, you have Conservativesversus Liberals.Most of the voices today who explicitly identify with exopolitics fall into theLiberal camp. In the first place, by advocating for UFO Disclosure, theyimplicitly oppose the secret-keepers in the clandestine world. Second, the veryact of considering how to engage beings from elsewhere in a politicalrelationship implies a belief in common ground. Third, contemporary proponentsof exopolitics often (although not always) characterize the Others as highlyevolved spiritual beings who are concerned for humanity’s positive development.If this is true, then we surely would want to move this process along. If thereare technological secrets being held by the clandestine world in the form ofclean and cheap energy, then we have yet another reason why Disclosure isdesirable.This is the turf staked out by “The Disclosure Project,” headed by Dr. StevenGreer. Since the 1990s, this group has periodically called for “open,secrecy-free [Congressional] hearings on the UFO/Extraterrestrial presence onand around Earth.” In addition, it calls for revealing secrets about “advancedenergy and propulsion systems that, when publicly released, will providesolutions to global environmental challenges.”1[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos736324] Greer argues that there aremany witnesses who can testify about the reality of such covert programs andtechnologies, although they are afraid to come forward without help. His groupalso wants legislation to ban space-based weapons, focusing on a vision ofspace-based exploration that brings all Earth cultures together.Greer’s attitude toward extraterrestrials, described earlier in this book, is toembrace and welcome them. Depending on how one assesses them, his program can becharacterized as visionary, utopian, or dangerous.In essentials, the same can be said for the Exopolitics Institute, headed by Dr.Michael Salla. Its philosophy is very inclusive, promoting “citizen diplomacyinitiatives” for peaceful interactions with extraterrestrial civilizations thatare monitoring humanity. It also supports “whistle-blowers” or even privatecitizens who claim to have physically interacted with extraterrestrials, or hadaccess to covert military-corporate programs involving extraterrestrialtechnologies.2 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos736593]Both of these groups offer hope that a post-Disclosure world will be a betterplace. Certainly, one would be hard-pressed to disagree with their desire tochallenge the global military-intelligence-industrial complex. Basically, togive peace a chance.If these other beings turn out to be rapacious, destructive, or otherwise athreat, as speculated earlier in this book, the argument for secrecy might wellbe a strong one. Why cause panic if we are helpless anyway? Under suchcircumstances, naturally, we would be less inclined to want to engage them inany sort of constructive political process. To such researchers who believe thisis the case, the very idea of exopolitics is foolish at best, suicidal at worst.And yet, it could be counter-argued that, even under these conditions,exopolitics is a reality. “They” are here, and are interacting with us. Even ifthe relationship is one of hostility, politics inevitably enters the process atsome point. Von Clausewitz, the great theoretician of modern warfare, famouslydescribed war as “the continuation of policy by other means.”Perhaps our exopolitics would benefit from fewer strongly held positions aboutthe nature of the Others. It seems likely, anyway, that the truth lies somewherebetween the extremities.Stephen Bassett’s Paradigm Research Group (PRG) avoids discussion of the matteraltogether. Instead, Bassett’s message is simple: the “truth embargo” needs toend first, and all other issues can be sorted out later. His activism hasresulted in numerous annual “X-Conferences” near Washington, D.C., organizingfax campaigns on Washington, and trying to pull the world together website bywebsite. In 2011, PRG organized a World Disclosure Day on July 8, and later inthe year gathered more than 17,000 signatures for a Disclosure Petition to theWhite House “to formally acknowledge an extraterrestrial presence engaging thehuman race.” The White House policy to all petitions is to offer a formal replyonce the signatures exceed 5,000.Regarding the petition, the White House did issue a predictable statement onNovember 4, 2011: “The U.S. government has no evidence that any life existsoutside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted orengaged any member of the human race. In addition, there is no credibleinformation to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public eye.”3[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos736829] Any other answer wouldcertainly have brought a storm of unwelcome publicity to the White House,especially in the lead-up to an election season. Still, PRG can claim credit forbeing the first civilian organization to elicit a formal policy position on UFOsfrom the White House, and has positioned itself to continue beating the drum andengaging the media on this issue.Throughout the years, PRG’s efforts have resulted in hits and misses. YetBassett has been an active and forceful proponent of Disclosure, having promoteda strong movement throughout Europe and elsewhere. As of mid-2011, there wereactive exopolitical websites in more than 20 countries.4[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos737020] Beyond that, he hasencouraged others to imagine what a post-Disclosure world will look like. “It isnot whether there is an extraterrestrial intelligence engaging the planet, it iswhat are we going to do about it?”5[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos737329]Exopolitics is an idea whose time has come. Because Others are already here,then by definition exopolitics is being practiced. The fact that it is not yetbeing conducted openly makes no difference as to its reality. Some humans arealready making decisions based on UFOs operating within the Earth’s environment.In fact, the political dialogue between Us and Them may be strained, nearlyincomprehensible, and potentially dangerous. But it has been underway for a longtime, and it is happening now as you read this book.The First ExopoliticiansGiven the situation of military minds of the 1940s grappling with somethingbeyond any previous experience, we can appreciate their sense of urgency, theirscramble to understand the truth, and their need to try to catch uptechnologically.Such a situation would require the utmost secrecy, not only from one’s nationalrivals, and not only from one’s population, but also—perhaps most important—fromthe Others themselves.The first exopolitical decision to be made was to keep things hidden. Thatdictated countless other decisions that followed, the accumulation of whichcreated a secret world. With the same hubris that allowed pharaohs to buildcolossal monuments, these men built a new world. They populated it with theirtrusted fellow-travelers, and resourced it with money and assets that weresiphoned from the public they convinced themselves they were serving.In time, the structure of secrecy among the human players had becomeotherworldly. Probably by the 1970s, they had largely moved beyond formalgovernmental channels of control, although government funding and militarysecurity continued to be useful. Enough breakthroughs had been made, even bythen, to distance them from the civilization they had set out to defend.Homemade flying saucers? It is possible that they even had those, along with asecret space program and more.[images/00040.jpg]Changing our POV. Seeing the Earth with new eyes. “Moonbase Clarke” by KimmoIsokoski, used with permission.But there is more to this breakaway civilization than mere possession of flyingsaucers. Recall that the NSA in 1965 was 35 years ahead of the consumer world inits computing technology. May we assume that it and other deep-black agenciesare at least a few decades ahead of the world right now in a variety of keytechnologies? If our mainstream scientists are predicting major breakthroughs incomputing, artificial intelligence, nanotech, and biotechnology by aroundmid-century, what is the likelihood that the classified world will achieve themsooner? What is the chance that key breakthroughs in those fields have alreadybeen made? And yet there is more to a breakaway civilization than even thesedevelopments. There is the matter of physical separateness.Separate, Not EqualEveryone has heard of Area 51 as a location where the human response to theOthers is said to be carried out. It is by no means the only such place. Thereare other bases, as well as warehouses and levels in normal military andcivilian locations, that belong to the breakaway civilization.It is entirely possible that the passage of time has allowed the separateness toinclude deep underground facilities. In other words, Earth may be home to anunderground community that is “off the grid.” A lot of good research on this hasbeen done, most notably by the investigator Dr. Richard Sauder, who hasdemonstrated that the U.S. national security establishment made plans to go verydeep underground no later than the 1960s. He also made it clear that for years,the technology has existed to go deep. Finally, he has exposed leaks frominsiders giving information about massive, deep, clandestine bases and tunnelsthat traverse beneath our feet in almost labyrinthian fashion.6[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos737634]If deep underground bases seem chimerical, consider the likelihood of bases deepbeneath the seabeds of our world. That is, beneath the oceans themselves. Lestone dismiss this as mere fantasy, consider that the technology has existed formany years to make this a reality. There are, of course, several known examplesof tunnels that go for miles beneath the ocean floor. The Channel Tunnel, orChunnel, connecting Britain to France, is the most famous of them. Likewise, thetechnology to extract oxygen from the ocean has existed for more than 50years—it is through this technology that nuclear submarines can stay submergedfor months at a time. If you have enough oxygen and a source of power—forinstance, a small, portable nuclear or geothermal generator—you have enough toget started on a large base that can be rather comfortable below the oceanfloor.7 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos738078]In addition to Sauder’s well-documented research, there are other tantalizinglinks to the underground world.One, for example, concerns an assistant secretary to a branch of the armedforces in a new Republican administration. This person told a family friend thathe had been “briefed” for some eight weeks at an underground facility outside ofWashington. Asked the purpose of the briefing, this highly placed man, who wenton to become a cabinet secretary, said, “There is intelligent life in theuniverse. It’s here. And I’ve seen it.”The man said that the information he had been given caused him to cry himself tosleep for a number of nights. The reason, he told his shocked listener, was thathe had children. “This is not the kind of world I thought they’d grow up in.”8[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos738469]What kinds of things are going on that require months-long briefings inunderground facilities and cause grown men to cry? The cabinet secretary toldthe family friend that aliens were just the “tip of the iceberg” in terms ofmind-blowing revelations.It is clear, then, that large underground facilities not only are real, but areconnected in some way with the reality of ETs or “Others” here on Earth.We should ask ourselves: Who are the people who briefed the incoming cabinetmember on the nature of the Others? Presumably, these would be therepresentatives of Majestic, or whatever the organization is being called now.That they can traumatize a worldly, intelligent professional with dramatic newinformation about the nature of reality reinforces the idea that we are, indeed,talking about a Breakaway civilization.The combination of secrecy, money, new technologies, new types of encounters,and physical separateness make up for a different state of mind that existsamong such a group.After all, perhaps the key feature that defines a distinct civilization is itsbelief system—its paradigm, in the fullest sense of that word. That is, the sumtotal of beliefs concerning one’s place in the universe, as well as one’sknowledge of other civilizations. Here, too, the world of Majestic appears tohave developed something entirely different from the rest of us. After all, itis a world that may have its own space program, a vastly more powerful computingand artificial intelligence, biotechnology that may be off the charts by ourstandards. With all this, it could well be in some form of contact withintelligent non-human groups. One can only wonder at the changes in worldviewthat would be launched by such regular contact. In all likelihood, it is a worldin which the fabric of reality is understood in a way that we have not begun tograsp. Its members may see themselves as so far removed from the rest of us thatthey have given up on the possibility of bringing us to their level. They maynot even see the rest of humanity as “fully” human.Unlocking the DoorThis Breakaway Group is a key component in any post-Disclosure exopoliticalequation. It ought to be a major priority of a U.S. president, along with othernational leaders, to gain control over it. The question is, will any occupant ofthe Oval Office have the courage to try?The answer depends not only on the ambitions of the president, but his or herability to manage and influence the key levers of power within the government.No president can do this alone.A glaring reality of our era is that the law is not being followed regardingpresidential control over the UFO situation. Some apparently are briefed on thematter, others not.One inside source has told the authors of his “professional knowledge” thatPresidents Reagan and Bush (senior) were briefed on UFOs and extraterrestrials,and is near certainty that President Carter had also been briefed. He was lesscertain about President Clinton, and felt confident that President George W.Bush had not been briefed. Another well-placed individual said that PresidentObama had been briefed on the bare essentials of the UFO/ET reality, but that hehad no influence over policy. The distinct impression was made that the briefingwas not mandatory. It was given, the insider said, “out of respect” for thepresident’s office.9 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos738746]Yet another story related to the authors, given by a retired officer from one ofthe U.S. military services, underscores the lack of power held by the U.S.president on this matter. An elderly man lay on his deathbed, speaking in asecured medical facility to the officer, who was accompanied by a securitydetail. Long before, the dying man had handled alien wreckage and seen alienbodies. The officer interviewed the man for some time, comparing notes. Thebodies the man had seen were definitely not human: they were short, had largeheads, and had fairly human-looking eyes—not the black, insect-like eyesattributed to the “Grays.”Near the end of their meeting, the officer opined that it was a shame the man’sstory could not be revealed, that it was a matter of importance to the world.The man replied that he could never talk, that he had taken a life-long secrecyoath. Yes, but wouldn’t it be wonderful, said the officer, if the man werereleased from his oath, say, by an executive order from the president?The dying man’s answer was startling and instructive: “It would take a hell of alot more than an Executive Order from the president to release me from my oath.”When asked by one of the authors what this meant, the officer replied that,obviously, it meant someone else was in charge. When asked if this meant aninternational control group, something like the Bilderbergers, was in charge,his answer was, “Yes, something like that.”10[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos738906]John Podesta, a senior advisor to President Clinton and the transition chief forthe Obama Administration, has been outspoken on the need for openness on thematter of UFOs, while implicitly acknowledging the lack of presidentialauthority on the matter. At the National Press Club in 2007, he said, “I thinkit’s time to open the books on questions that have remained in the dark on thequestion of UFOs. It’s time to find out what the truth really is that’s outthere. We ought to do it because it is right. We ought to do it because theAmerican people, quite frankly, can handle the truth, and we ought to do itbecause it is the law.”11 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos739067]Whether justified or not, the UFO phenomenon has prompted the creation of asprawling, illegal, extra-constitutional structure, beyond the control of thehighest elected official in the land and beyond the oversight of the citizen’selected representatives.This unlawful structure no doubt explains why the record on presidentialbriefing appears to be so spotty. If the president is aware of the illegalnature of the cover-up, as the sworn chief executive of the country, his oathwould demand action. Therefore, knowing the bare essentials sounds like a usefulcompromise. The president knows that the challenge is real, but is assured thatcompetent people are on the job. The less he knows about specifics, the greaterhis plausible deniability.All indications are that congressional representatives are not briefed on thismatter. How can prominent elected officials worldwide—the people entrusted bycitizens around the world to run their governments—be so in the dark about thisgreat secret? The answer lies with the secret-keepers themselves who appear tobelieve that revealing the presence of extraterrestrials is too dangerous astep, and that elected officials represent the ultimate security risk.When Disclosure finally moves from impossible to inevitable, politics will takethe most prominent seat at the table.Politically IncorrectThe first problem of one’s “exopolitics” is deciding what to think of theOthers. This will depend on the evidence that has been provided about them, andpossibly whether any of them are discussed in a Disclosure statement. No doubt,one’s exopolitics will also be tied in some way to their current politicalbeliefs, whether these be liberal, conservative, radical, or anything else.Let us speculate that Disclosure is forced (say, by an undeniable masssighting), but no extraterrestrials are produced, and none come forward. Thiswill cause no small headache for the ruling groups, to say nothing for the restof us.In that case, even the existence of the Others will be treated politically.Everything else is treated that way, from immigration to national defense; itwill be the same for Disclosure. First, the president will be advised on what todo and how to do it. The advice will probably boil down to this:[images/00029.jpg]> > “Mister President, if you decide that we need to be forthcoming on this> > issue, then we will need to act quickly. If our opponents get a clear> > picture of what is going on, they may go public before we do. If they do,> > you will look like part of the problem. They will taint you with the decades> > of lies, and you will forever be on the defensive.

You need to place yourself on the> > side of the people and promise them more information. It’s like the> > campaign, sir, you have to run against the Establishment.”[images/00029.jpg]The Pottery Barn rule also applies here: You break it, you bought it. Whicheverparty controls the presidency will own Disclosure, an unpredictable place to be.But once the decision has been made in the White House, the only viable optionfor the party in power will be to jump all over it, then hope that theopposition is confused enough to be slow off the marks.In the United States, there will be a national coming together, a closing ofranks. The party in power will reach out to the opposition in the spirit ofbipartisanship, and the outsiders will have to play along. But as the days turnto weeks and the weeks into months, the disruptions and difficulties will becomepolicy issues. The opposition leadership will then be free to embrace thepresident’s goals, but not his methods. He and his party will be accused ofincompetence and partisanship. Whichever party is in power will be accused bythe opposition of acting too slowly, or too fast, or too strongly, or notstrongly enough.Beyond the policy implementation aspect, it is interesting to consider whetherthe two major parties in the United States will have an exopolitical “attitude”that forms with time in the world after Disclosure.One might imagine the Democratic party tending toward inclusion. We may hearstatements implying that the Others are innocent until proven guilty. They maytend to press for conciliatory gestures on the part of the nations of the Earth,and messages of peace. They—or more accurately, their constituents—will morelikely see the glass as half full. They may even press for the United Nations togrow in strength and become the leading voice speaking for the Earth.[images/00039.jpg]Defining the future. The rules constantly change and so does the game. A votetaking place at the United Nations Security Council. Photo courtesy of UNPhoto/Mark GartenThe Republican party, in contrast, will move toward security first. They willinvoke President Ronald Reagan’s famous phrase from Cold War missilenegotiations, “Trust, but verify.” They will argue that gestures need to be madefrom a position of strength, given that the Others have shown such a consistentinterest in human military capabilities since the 1940s. They will certainly nottrust the United Nations to speak for anyone, let alone the United States. It isto be remembered, also, that a substantial portion of Republican Party strengthdraws from Bible-belt Christians, who will be likely to see the Others asdemonic.Disclosure will accomplish something in American politics that has happened onlyrarely. Very likely, there will be a credible, capable third party arising fromthe chaos of the moment. Perhaps even a fourth and fifth. Disclosure willshatter the old political paradigm.One new party finding support might be called the Aquarius party. Its agendawill be that the Others should be embraced. They will not be hardened politicaltypes, but a collection of New Age believers who see this new reality asconfirmation that the Age of Aquarius is here, if only we embrace it.Another party may favor an Earth-First approach. Its members would argue thatthe Others are irrelevant. They have not attacked, nor have they revealedthemselves since their arrival. Humanity’s problems are vast and deepening, theywill say, and we must solve them ourselves. Expecting help fromextraterrestrials is wishful thinking and unlikely to happen. Their slogan willbe “Power to the People,” and by people, they will mean humans.There will also be those who see the Others as the beginning of end times. Thisis the Armageddon group, populated by doomsday thinkers, evangelicals, andsurvivalists. They will have much to say because many of them will have beenwaiting their entire lives for something this devastating. Some of them maystart within the Republican Party, but they may well bolt if they feel theRepublicans are not responsive enough to their beliefs.If one thinks of the American political system as a spectrum of belief, theDisclosure world will look like this, going from pro- to con- regarding thearrival and disclosure of the Others:AQUARIUSDEMOCRATREPUBLICANEARTH FIRSTARMAGEDDONThe success or failure of these new competitors for the American voters willdepend on who can convert their passion into competition in the political arena.Armageddon believers may have the most passion, but some may not stay active ifthey think the world is ending. Earth Firsters may find themselves absorbed intothe Republicans in the same way that the latter have tried to harness theTeaparty movement of 2010, or it could go the other way around, with theRepublicans collapsing into the new party. The Democrats will try to appeal toAquarians as being sympathetic to their cause but still “solid” regardingtraditional national security.It will be a political free-for-all. The winners may still be the Republican andDemocratic parties, but even if they survive the battle, they will be changed bythe fight to stay in power.In nation after nation around the globe, great changes will be played out as thepolitical deck is shuffled. The volatility of the situation is more easily seenin light of the Arab Spring of 2011.Indeed, the Arab world will become further inflamed by Disclosure. Thedemocratic uprisings that swept across that political landscape showed deepdissatisfaction among the people. The rest of the world discovered, much to itscollective surprise, that a new generation of Arabs want a greater voice, andnot necessarily one influenced by sharia law. Arab youth of today, like youthelsewhere, have grown up with the Web. Arab women are also finding their voice.We are seeing an entire culture that had been dominated for generations by atightly authoritarian political and cultural system now, in the age of theInternet, showing cracks. Matters will become more volatile still with a growingbelief that the traditional cultural patterns need to be revised. This is asidefrom the pandemonium likely to occur because of uncertainties in the petroleummarket, up until now the main source of income to much of the Arab world. As wasonce said of the American Revolution, it will feel like “the world is turnedupside down.”Elsewhere in the AD world, dictatorships will fall to populist uprisings whilesome multi-party systems may face calls for dictatorships. Change will be in theair.Amid such turmoil that is likely within the domestic politics of so manynations, the ultimate political battle must be waged internationally. How willthese many nations come together to blend their voices into a single message forthe Others? Is that even possible?Before discussing this, we need to understand the specific troubles that will befaced by the United States, for years the leading force behind the cover-up, andmost probably the source of most of our knowledge of the Others.Reclaiming Legitimate PowerThe United States lacks the global power it had during the Cold War. Yet itremains, at least militarily, the world’s most powerful country, and in manyways still the global agenda-setter. Many nations will view the United Stateswith increased skepticism if its role in the UFO cover-up is establishedclearly. Still, its military power will be seen as the best shield possibleagainst an outside threat, although some nations might see it as unnecessarilyprovocative.In a nation founded on principles of popular sovereignty, in which Lincoln’sphrase, “A government of the people, by the people, for the people,” carriesdeep emotional resonance, it is no small matter that in the world AD, thepresident acts not just with Americans in mind, but the citizens of the entireplanet. Many of the important issues at stake in today’s world will be amplifiedpost-Disclosure:> [images/00012.jpg] Will we live in a world that promotes human freedom, or> will we live in a global police state?> [images/00012.jpg] In a world that is already a global village and interweaves> further each day, who will make the most important decisions affecting the> lives of ordinary people?> [images/00012.jpg] Will we have a public culture in which truth is readily> available, and in which citizens can make informed decisions about their> world?> [images/00012.jpg] How can Disclosure help the human-built infrastructure> support our ever-increasing population with its ever-stronger thirst for> energy?> [images/00012.jpg] Can Disclosure save the natural global ecosystem from> collapsing due to excessive human pressures?Change is coming; the only question is what it will look like. That battle isbeing fought now; it will still be in progress when Disclosure occurs. Then,that radical act of openness on an issue of such magnitude will energize andultimately transform the debate.All modern presidents have been elected with the support of the wealthy andpowerful, all of whom have strong interests in the promotion of an internationalorder that they themselves dominate. This puts the Disclosure president in themiddle of this battle—entirely separate from the issue of the Others and theiragenda. He or she must decide what side to choose.The first option will be to embrace the status quo of power, and to continue tonavigate the ship of state through the rough waters with as little disruption aspossible. Recall that for Disclosure even to happen, the powers-that-be willhave had to make a decision that the cost of maintaining the cover-up wasgreater than the cost of letting it go. Letting go of the cover-up, however,will not mean letting go of power. Having given the president the information,and thus the go-ahead, they will now want him or her to help them re-assemblethe system in a way that continues to grant them control.The second option is to embrace change. It would mean using the act ofDisclosure as a personal release from duty to the puppet-masters. It would meanworking for reasoned, humanitarian policies to bring about a peaceful transitionand a courageous confrontation of the truth.Will the world get another Millard Fillmore, or a new Abraham Lincoln?The Disclosure president will already know that he has thrown the dice and bethis presidency on this single announcement. He will have had company, of course.Many other world leaders will have thrown their own reputations into the fire ofDisclosure, but it is the American president to whom the world will look.His advisors will carry messages from the power elite that the world is sotroubled now that the president must keep the peace at all costs. As theexpression goes, he must “dance with the one who brought him.”It will be a powerful argument. No president will want the world to comecompletely unhinged on his shift; better to play it safe. Yet the A.D. world hasno safe course of action. Knowing this, the Disclosure President may chooseanother way. He may choose to go to war. Not with the Others, but with theBreakaway Group.In that eventuality, he would actively work to reclaim full constitutionalauthority in the name of the people. This does not mean seizing power in theform of a dictatorship, but it does mean enforce his authority over the runawayblack budget, and particularly over the Majestic operation insofar as itutilizes the resources of the U.S. military and U.S. tax dollars, and insofar asit operates on U.S. territory.In the disruption that follows Disclosure, if the president were to assume thislevel of power, he would understand that his life would be in danger. Yet,perhaps in a moment of quiet while sitting in the Oval Office, reflecting on theactions of those who came before him, he may decide that the risk is worth itbecause the times demand it. The opportunity to set things right may not returnfor a long time.He may survey the political landscape and realize that the dynamic has shiftedand that he has more legitimate power than the secret-keepers. There would beallies. They will include the people—not only U.S. citizens, but citizens fromevery country on Earth. And he would see the posturing on Capitol Hill, theinvestigation committees being formed, and the subpoenas being issued.He might sit up at night with a trusted advisor, and together they may war-gamethe pros and the cons of his next move. They agree on a plan of action. TheAttorney General will be brought in to make sure the language is clear, legal,and above misinterpretation. A single loyal executive secretary will be broughtin before daylight to type up the statement. It will be released in the morningbefore any time for leaks or attempts to interfere.[images/00029.jpg]> > “By Executive Order, the President of the United States releases all> > individuals from black-world, ET-related secrecy oaths.

After all, the Disclosure president maybe as co-opted and corrupted as most of his predecessors, but it may not matter.Primal forces of people power will be unleashed, and the end result may still bethat the Breakaway Group’s days will be numbered.In terms of the global situation, no matter what the actions of the U.S.president, there will still be a power vacuum. If the U.S. Disclosure Presidentis strong, that is to say actively involved in a struggle to reassert the powerof the American people to control their own government, he will be tied up inbattle at home. If he is weak, he will be damaged by the fact that his owncountry will be seen as the prime architect of the many decades of subterfuge.Elsewhere, other nations will be roiling with their own issues. The politicalleadership of many countries—France, England, Russia, and so on—may find thatthey, too, were duped by the Breakaway Group which was, at its peak, one of mosthighly functioning global organizations ever created. Other countries may wantto ignore Disclosure, but find themselves struggling with its collateral damageof economic dislocation. No one will have emerged unscathed.We cannot forget the Others in this equation. Whether or not they revealthemselves more openly, they will remain a focus of attention. Exopoliticsdemands that the nearly 200 nations in the world learn how to act and react tothese changed circumstances in a coherent and effective manner.Currently, exopolitical activists accept, as an article of faith, that the onepiece of enduringly good news about any public revelation and acceptance—whetherthese Others are benign or nefarious—is that their presence will serve to unitethe people of Earth as never before. Nationalism will suffer as we see ourselvesas Earthlings first, and distinct nationalities second. An international problemneeds an international solution, they say. It will be necessary to establishopen, international, collaboration on a full array of political, scientific,social, economic, cultural, and religious issues.Having this degree of international cooperation will be pointless if humanityresponds in an uncoordinated fashion. What if, after all, we are dealing with areal threat? Coordination will be essential. What if, even barring a direimmediate threat, we wish to transition to a new energy paradigm? In such acase, uncoordinated action can have severe and negative consequences.Another Way to Look at ItThe elephant in the room AD is none other than the United Nations. AfterDisclosure, the U.N. will be very active and receive much attention. Resolutionswill be passed and committees formed. There will be more work than ever toconsider, a shifting trail of facts, and discussions about the correct course ofaction. But the announcement that the Earth has visitors will not suddenlytransform the United Nations into a gathering place for the brotherhood of man.Instead, the unprecedented level of stress upon it will lead to the realizationthat it is not up to the task at hand.The greatest issue to split the United Nations will not be the Others and thedifficult debate about what should be done. Instead, it will be a simpledefinition of what the U.N. is meant to be in the changed conditions. There willbe impassioned debates about how powerful the organization should be. No onewill agree. Meanwhile, the problems will grow and this international gridlockwill occasion despair around the globe.Then, one of the members will act. Although the country we are about to suggestis an example only, to provide a scenario, the point is that it will be anon-traditional outreach by a country not normally associated with globalleadership.Imagine the country is Brazil. During the years of cover-up, this country hadits own thriving group of UFO investigators and a military that tried to grapplewith the problem. In 1957, four years before the Betty and Barney Hill case inthe United States, the abduction of Antonio Villa Boas occurred there. In 1958,the Trindade Island UFO photos were taken off its coast. In 1986, as many as 20UFOs were seen by at least six airplanes and tracked over Brazil by ground radarin a case that was widely publicized. In 1996, an alleged crash of a UFO tookplace there, near a small town called Varginha.Brazil also happens to be the fifth-largest country by geographical area andpopulation. When, in our hypothetical scenario, it invites representatives fromChina, Russia, and the United States to discuss the lack of coordinated responseto the Others, these nations respond in the affirmative. When the four leadersemerge from the talks, they announce formal invitations to key countries to jointhem in Sao Paulo to continue the discussion.The President of Brazil is suddenly the man of the hour, and his country is theplace. The leaders say they are not challenging the United Nations, they aresimply moving past it, looking for a fresh start, acting out of a desperateneed, expressed worldwide, to stop the fighting and get some work done.They form a group, announced in Brazil as the Alianca planetaria externas, orthe Planetary Alliance External. The world’s media immediately shortens it toPAX, which everyone likes, because it means “peace” in Latin.PAX begins monthly meetings in Sao Paulo. The first thing members agree on isthat the purpose of their meetings is not to surrender their nationalsovereignty. Their constituents back home, having seen the failure at the U.N.,seem to agree.The Past Actually Is PrologueOur world today is in a situation analogous to that faced by the young UnitedStates of America more than two centuries ago. The American colonists had foughtfor independence from the monarchy of Great Britain, and the concept of libertywas central to all political discourse. The idea of instituting a new monarchywas discarded in favor of the more radical idea of a republic, something thathad only succeeded in the past on a limited, small scale, and which only oncehad existed over a large area: ancient Rome.A basic problem was, how to ensure sufficient freedom for the 13 newlyindependent states, while keeping them strong enough to provide forself-defense. In other words, what was the balance between centralization anddecentralization?The first answer was to decentralize. This was the early United States under theArticles of Confederation. Immediately, problems arose because the young nationwas already far more knitted together than people realized. The centralgovernment had almost no power; it had no president (only a Congress), and evenlacked the power to tax (having to request funds from the states). Each stateset its own currency and tariff policy, so that if one state instituted hightariffs, these would be negated by a neighboring state that eliminated them,which in fact happened. The situation was untenable for the long term,especially for such a large nation as the young United States. There were callsto create a system with stronger centralized powers.Such calls were anathema to many of the patriots who had fought forindependence. Why did we bother, they said, if we are to replace one king withanother? Centralized, concentrated power, then as now, was fiercely distrusted.The solution was an ingenious compromise: a federalized system with checks andbalances. The central government was strengthened considerably and stillanswerable to the people. The states retained considerable (although less)independence of action. And finally, the piece that enabled the anti-Federaliststo live with the compromise: The Bill of Rights, which codified the basic,inalienable rights that each citizen would forever possess. The new solution wasnot perfect (it retained the institution of slavery, for instance), but itcreated a structure with great flexibility and durability.Now, in the 21st century, our world continues to move away from a system ofindependent nations. Corporations engulf the globe, spanning nations, answerableonly to shareholder value. Today, they are like feudal barons who have dividedup the world’s resources. National laws are subverted by their power, andinternational political structures are too weak to stop them. This is thecurrent structure of the “New World Order.” It does not have to be this way,though. The advent of Disclosure can prompt the promotion of a federalized,global system of governance that is not under corporate domination, which infact submits them to enforceable laws, and which also has an enforceable global“Bill of Rights.”No system of “One World” government will work. Nationalism is still too strongand it still has its advantages. But the arrival of the Others guarantees thatthe status quo is also unacceptable. It demands a new vision, and a pragmaticglobal system that will eventually replace the faltering United Nations, just asthe United Nations replaced the faltering League of Nations.Creating a stable, flexible, and fair international system will require anexceptional degree of vision, pragmatism, ethics, dedication, persistence, andcourage. We do not know if it will happen, however, we do know this: it issurely possible, and it is what should be done. For an equitable future forhumanity, it must be done.Some of the issues that ought to come up early in the deliberations of aglobalized, federalized system, should be:> [images/00012.jpg] How to research and implement the many solutions inherent> in UFO technology to the problems facing our society today, and how to ensure> that these are safely managed for the greater good of all.> [images/00012.jpg] How to transition human society safely away from its> petroleum-based global economy.> [images/00012.jpg] How to reign in and manage the culture of runaway secrecy.> [images/00012.jpg] How, generally speaking, to meet the challenge posed by the> Others.In short, this process would oversee the transformation of our civilization.Although we present a positive path for world leaders, a path that we believehas a good chance of being a benefit to humanity, we must not delude ourselves.Post-Disclosure matters may continue to develop according to the trends of thepast many decades.This is the trend of growing international corporate power, of centralized statepower, of ever-greater regulation of citizens, and of even more intrusion intothe private lives of people via electronic surveillance (both in public placeslike metropolitan areas and inside your computer). It is the trend toward apermanent state of “Code Yellow” within the United States. It is a trend todistract and control populations from the reality of the world around them. Itis, therefore, a trend to siphon power from the public realm to the privaterealm, reserved only for those few who possess the resources and manage thelevers of power in order to maintain themselves in their positions.If it turns out that there are energy solutions in UFO technology, as it surelyappears, then it is equally likely that some of those solutions could be adaptedfor weaponry. It would be of paramount importance to prevent a free-energydevice that can heat a house indefinitely from being converted into a bomb thatcould wipe out a nation. Ensuring safety over this process might involvecontrols and surveillance measures that have already begun with the HomelandSecurity revolution following 9/11. This will, no doubt, meet with a great dealof resistance.Other issues would also be tricky, but ultimately resolvable. What if, within ageneration or two after Disclosure, the rest of the world gets the ability to dowhat the Breakaway Group is alleged to be doing now, traveling potentiallyoff-world in exotic craft to places that are energy-sufficient, which haveoxygen below-ground, and so on? Would the powers of the Earth at that time allowpeople simply to go off around the solar system, colonizing at will? In fact,they might, but then again maybe not. We may see a variation of the activitiesand struggles that occurred during Europe’s age of expansion and colonization,perhaps with new declarations of independence, as well.This struggle will not be resolved overnight. It will take years, decades,generations, centuries.Besides the basic political issues, there will be other key concerns: worldpoverty, climate change, pollution, possible extinction of our species, and manyothers. These will also be on the table.Big Brother Versus Big OtherIn the post-AD world, our exopolitics will not be fully in our control. It seemsclear that the other intelligences—the Others—will be in the picture. The threemain possibilities are:> 1. Constructive engagement. If they admit their presence openly, we can begin> a formal process of interaction. We should make it clear that they have no> right to interfere. Our planet, our society, and our lives are at stake. We> must control our destiny.> 2. Benign Neglect. This seems to be the current policy. They interfere, at> least covertly, and we ignore it. This way of doing business is going to wear> very thin, post-Disclosure. It is one thing to debate whether something is> happening and take no action because it is unclear what to do. But if> something is happening, and you know it, and they know you know it, then> interfere-and-ignore simply is at odds with our human nature. Still, if> humanity is not in a position to do anything about it, that may be a long-term> result.> 3. Hostile Convergence. Undeniably, the most frightening option. Namely, that> at least some of our visitors mean us harm, whether it be phasing out the> human species as we know it, or some other form of control and manipulation.> If this is so, as we said earlier, humans will resist when cornered.The mind reels at the implications of some of the other wildcards of contact ifthey come to pass, and how they would affect and possibly destroy progresstoward a reasonable future for humanity in the shadow of Disclosure. The mostdisturbing one may involve the infiltration of our society by the Others.What if it comes out that some people in our society are actually not of us, butare with the Others?Is this so difficult to believe? If the the Others understand the trajectory ofhumanity’s technological development, they would probably know full well thatwithin another few generations, humanity might pose some genuine problems forthem to contend with. They might decide that when this happens, the “right”people are governing the world. Wouldn’t it be logical for them to have their“people” working on the inside, so to speak, managing the human hierarchy?Even aside from the issue of control, abduction researchers such as BuddHopkins, David Jacobs, and others have concluded that an important component ofthe abduction phenomenon includes creating a hybrid species. Presumably thesehybrids at some point might be living among us.If the Grays are a kind of biological artificial intelligence designed and builtfor space travel, then their arrival on Earth, a planet with a differentatmosphere and gravity than their own, would pose dangers to them. Perhaps themission statement embedded in each Gray is to create a life-form using theindigenous body of the prevailing intelligent species. Maybe that is why it hastaken so long—generations—to accomplish.What would our reaction be if we learned that something like this had occurred?In other words, if we learned that “they” in effect had taken over control ofour all-too-human infrastructure? Or if they had managed us all along,throughout our history? There would probably be many people who might throw uptheir hands and say, “Fine. Whatever. Let them run the world.” But not everyonewould feel so generous. A political firestorm would be in the making. Theremight just be a long-term political movement that attempts to determine who the“infiltrators” are. We might experience an alien-hunting McCarthy-era.This could quickly get very dangerous, both for reasons of public vigilantism,as well as for the reaction it might engender from the Others. Still, in theevent that our society and culture are under subversive attack, many would arguethat humanity needs to get a handle on the matter now and deal with civilliberties later.Already, without reference to the threat of “Others,” humanity has started downthe road of citizen control. Consider the Internet, for example. It is notsimply nations such as China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and North Korea that seek tocontrol access to the Internet. Nations such as Australia, the United Kingdom,the United States, and other societies with long traditions of freedom have beenpassing laws to intrude upon and restrict Internet access, and have been puttingout feelers to see just how far they can go.12[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos739390]Within the United States, various cocktails of laws have been passed during theClinton, Bush, and Obama administrations to enable government surveillance ofcitizen Internet activity. Starting in 2005, news reports began to assert thatthe NSA was conducting warrantless spying on phone and e-mail communications ofpeople inside the United States, and that it was secretly collecting phone-callrecords of millions of Americans. They were doing this from data provided bymajor telecommunications companies such as AT&T. Despite several legalchallenges, the program continues to exist under the Obama administration.13[A.D._After_Disclosure_split_017.html#filepos739596]Developments like this are merely the tip of the iceberg. The legal revolutionundergone in post-9/11 America has been formidable, but really only codified thechanges that had long been taking place. Rather like a debutante, 9/11 promptedthe “coming out party” of the National Security State.All things being equal, liberty-loving people world-wide would agree that thisis a bad thing. And though it is not easy to find passion to defend thesecret-keepers of the Breakaway Group, we have not been allowed to know all thefacts they have. If they have knowledge that causes them to believe humanity isin the midst of a silent invasion, then their ramping up of security,surveillance, and military power could feasibly be defended. If that is so,however, it virtually guarantees that the most intense debate AD, in a politicalsense, will mirror the 9/11 post-mortem, especially if there is a rush tosecurity followed by a longing for freedom.Suddenly, in a silent invasion scenario, martial law seems very plausible. Ifsuperior beings from somewhere else have come here, and their designs on us donot involve blowing up the planet as they do in the movies, but taking it overwithout a fight, then Disclosure will set powerful forces into motion. As bothLincoln and Roosevelt did to win their respective wars, the Disclosure presidentmay lead the charge to fight back first and sort out the damage later.Again, we come face-to-face with the great unknown in the debate overDisclosure. The people most complicit in the cover-up know things that we donot. After seven decades, we certainly should hope they have a better idea thanwe do. If, however, after all their advantages of money and security, they donot know any more than the rest of us, we should fire them for incompetence ifwe can.Imagine what the top-level of the Breakaway Group may know by now. It isentirely possible that the Others have been here, interacting with the Earth andhumanity for eons. Throughout all of human history, our species would have hadno ability to deal with them in any way approaching parity. Surely, they couldeasily avoid detection if they wished.Recall that our amazing, magical technology is all recent. Consider what itmeant to belong to a small agricultural or nomadic community anywhere on Earth amere 300 years ago. At that time, the total human population was one-tenth whatit is today. There were no telephones, no automobiles, no locomotives, not evenbicycles. There were people and horses and carts and sailing ships. Most peoplelived their lives within a small geographic area, interacting with the samepeople in the same small village for their entire lives. Most could not read orwrite, and there were still entire cultures that had no writing at all. In sucha situation, anyone who saw a craft or object from one of the intelligent groupsthat were here on Earth had virtually no options. Amazing sightings might bediscussed with family members or friends, and perhaps become passed along aslocal legends. That would be about it. For millennia, this is how it had been.Then everything changed. Human population began the sharp increase thatcontinues to this day—in 2011 we surpassed seven billion. Science took hold ofour civilization and transformed us in ways scarcely imaginable to previousgenerations. Within the blink of a cosmic eye, humanity went from being asociety of horses pulling carts to one in which we now stand at the brink ofquantum computing, advanced AI, nanotech, and biotech. We are about to re-inventourselves as a society, as a civilization, as a species. Our means of detectingand recording UFOs is vastly better than it ever was, and this will onlyimprove.Is there any possibility that these Others would not know this? If they havebeen here all along, they know of our development. They see us now, poised andready to leap into their world. Perhaps not as equals, no. But as scientificprogress is not a linear thing, it is just possible that we are on the verge oftransformation that is not quantitative, but qualitative. Something utterlydifferent, more substantial, more formidable.Yes, they must know this. We must ask ourselves: What is their attitude towardthis?They might have taken only a passing interest in humanity for many ages, whilethey went about their business, here on Earth and perhaps elsewhere. Perhaps ourrecent development as a scientific species was something they did notanticipate, or perhaps it has been something they have been waiting for.Of course, if they have been here for a long time, humanity is possibly along-standing project. Have we been modified by them? Have they managed us insome way throughout our history? If so, did they guide us to an understanding ofscience? Did they influence our religions and spiritual beliefs? And if so(considering the violence inspired by so many religions) did they do somaliciously, or with an intent to help?Or could it be that, despite the suggestive hints left by ancient drawings,carvings, artifacts, and architecture, that the Others are indeed only recentarrivals? If so, did they arrive when they realized we were on the scientificfast-track?The answers to these questions, if we ever get them, will influence how werespond to them. If we get no answer, we will surely develop countless thinktanks to study and debate the possibilities.In such an event, what might those think tanks conclude? They would study theavailable UFO evidence, just as many researchers did before them. Judging fromthe sightings, possible abduction experiences, and other encounters with whatmay have been some of these beings, they would be left in some confusion.For instance, why have the Others alternately hidden and revealed themselvesthrough the years? The majority of UFO sightings, after all, have not been overdensely populated areas, or seen by large numbers of people—but some have. Arethe Others being coy in some manner? Are they trying to get our attention? Whyshow up so blatantly in certain places, such as the lower Hudson Valley in theearly 1980s, or the collapsing Soviet Union in the late 1980s, or Phoenix in1997, or Stephenville, Texas in 2008, or China in 2010 and 2011? Are theynudging us? Slowly making themselves more and more obviously known? If so, theconclusion might be that they have been preparing us all these years forcontact.Then there are the crop circles. Although there are claims that the formationsgo back many decades, even centuries, reliable reports started in the 1970s. Atthat time, most were simple affairs. By 1990, however, they had attained anawe-inspiring complexity, size, and precision that defies common sense. Despitethe proliferation of hoaxers, there appear to be distinguishable differencesbetween the “real” and the “fake” circles, including biological oddities at thenodes of the stalks in genuine crop circle formations, the perfection of thecreations themselves, the astonishing size of some of them, and the speed withwhich the genuine circles are made—typically overnight, and several apparentlyin the middle of the day with no one seeing the culprit.Some have speculated that the circles are a clandestine human operation. Perhapsthey were “scrolled” from a geosynchronous satellite using precision microwavetechnology. If so, then why? Is some black-budget operation playing a head-gamewith humanity in the fields of southwestern England and central Ohio, makingpeople believe that aliens are creating mathematical and artistic masterpiecesin our corn fields? Or that some secret team of Leonardo da Vincis continues toevade being caught? For, no matter who is making them, these formations areamong the great artistic creations of our era.We should hope that the Others are behind them. If so, they are probably tryingto nudge us into a realization of a higher intelligence. This would surely be agood thing.Author/abductee Whitley Strieber has written nearly a dozen books on thesubject, and claims to have experienced ongoing abductions. He has felt personalcontact with the Others, (or the Visitors, as he has called them), and believesthat their agenda may involve a warning about an impending apocalypse here onEarth. Other abductees, too, have often claimed they have been exposed to imagesof environmental disaster.If these people are to be believed, the Others are warning us about the dangerto our planet through nuclear proliferation and ecological meltdown. And while,as silent invaders, they may not have changed our ways, an open Disclosure oftheir presence may lead relatively quickly to an emerging global consensus aboutsaving the Earth, realizing how precious it is.But the extreme variety of UFO sightings, the many types of vehicles seen, thevarious types of “aliens” themselves, will lead to a major problem for futurethink tanks. It is probably a current problem inside Majestic. This is how tofill out the “scorecard” of just who is who.The maddening aspect of a post-Disclosure world is that we may not be muchfurther along in knowing just who we are dealing with than we are today.Frankly, what is most unsettling is that there is no guarantee that Majesticdoes, either.There are so many possibilities to contemplate, so it is easy to lose oneself inspeculation. Still, if we observe the phenomenon not as scientists demandingproof, but rather as intelligence specialists trying to assemble the most likelyscenario, we might conclude that there are multiple groups with (probably)multiple agendas, here to visit Earth, perhaps live on Earth, and to observehumanity at this particular juncture in history. We may well be, at the dawn ofthe new millennium, the greatest show in this sector of the galaxy.Our Universe, Our Planet, OurselvesDisclosure is the ultimate wake-up call. Recognizing that other intelligencesfind our world and ourselves of interest will have a powerful impact on ourconsciousness.Open knowledge of them will simultaneously turn us inward and outward. Forexopolitics is not only about our relations with the Others, it about how weorganize among ourselves in relation to them.People will begin to grasp that, compared to our differences with the Others,the differences among ourselves in terms of race, sex, nationality, and religionare insignificant. This realization will create a new political opportunity. Aglobal consensus will emerge about saving the Earth. We will realize more fully,more painfully, how glorious and precious our beautiful blue world is. Perhapsthis is the true message from the Others. But even if not, it will be our ownrealization.This new way of looking at ourselves may enable us to save the planet fromenvironmental disaster, as we find ourselves able to work together to stopecological ravages and the massive loss of species diversity. We may even stopour own extinction.At the same time, humanity will look outward. Whatever our assessment of theseother beings, whether they be hostile, benevolent, indifferent, or somecombination of the three, we will recognize a connection with forms of lifebeyond our world. It will be a key moment in the history of human consciousness.“If we ever establish contact with extraterrestrial life, it will reveal to usour true place in the universe,” wrote author Isaac Asimov. “And with that comesthe beginning of wisdom.”Some of us will begin to advocate for spreading the human race beyond thiscradle of life into the vast universe, probably using alien technology as animpetus. It will be the ultimate exopolitical act to devote our resources tobuilding these craft.In success, a future generation of exopoliticians may save our home only to makeit possible for some of us to leave it.[images/00010.jpg]> OpinionDynamics> Abstract: Emerging Views after Disclosure> Poll Question:> Since the public disclosure of the presence of extraterrestrial life here on> Earth, describe your level of confidence in the United States government to> handle the matter correctly.> A.D. + One Week> 39%> Not Sure> 23%> Confident> 17%> Skeptical> 12%> Extremely Confident 09% Extremely Skeptical> A.D. + One Year> 32%> Extremely Skeptical> 27%> Skeptical> 21%> Confident> 15%> Not Sure> 05%> Extremely Confident> A.D. + Ten Years> 30%> Skeptical> 25%> Confident> 17%> Extremely Confident> 15%> Extremely Skeptical> 13%> Not Sure> ANALYSIS> The initial shock of Disclosure was followed in the first 12 months with a> tremendous degree of skepticism regarding the government.

Itis not simply the greatest story in human history; it may be the story of humanhistory. We can only hope that as this reality unfolds, we will also come torealize, as will the Others, that humans are one-of-a-kind, worthwhile, and havesomething to contribute in the overall scheme of things.We do not subscribe to the view, often espoused as a joke, that Earth is somebackwater, out-of-the-way planet in the middle of nowhere, and that we would beof no interest to other life forms.Whether or not the universe is “teeming” with life, any expression ofit—particularly one with intelligence—is bound to be of interest to otherintelligences. The Earth is bursting with an astonishing variety of life, andhumanity is a unique and often-contradictory life-form. Indeed, there is plentyto recommend this planet and its inhabitants for visitations by curious Others.Let us, for one final time, return to the famous Brookings Institute report,because even in 1960 there was hope that learning “we are not alone” might begood news.[images/00029.jpg]> > The knowledge that life existed in other parts of the universe might lead to> > a greater unity of men on Earth, based of the oneness of man or on the> > age-old assumption that any stranger is threatening.

The authors of the reportassumed that any communication between humans and Others would be punctuated byyears of silence, due to the distance of the stars and the limitations of radiocommunication. They did not consider that we had already attracted visits to ourworld.To us, that is the ultimate call to action. We have written three “open letters”as we conclude this book.> 1. First, to the unelected people who keep this secret contained to this very> day.> 2. Second, to the Others who have created the situation in which we find> ourselves.> 3. Third, to those of us who believe we can handle the truth and are prepared> to help make that day happen. That is, quite possibly, to you.To The Keepers of the SecretWe know who you are. We have saved this last chapter for you.You might have been called Majestic-12, or MJ-12, or Majic at one time oranother. Perhaps you still are. Perhaps you are the same group that was oncelabeled the “Silence Group.” Maybe you are a private enterprise group, livingpart-time in our world, and the rest of the time in your own society—the one wehave labeled here as the Breakaway Group.It does not matter. You know the outlines of the truth, and you have spentuntold fortunes delaying the day when you share it with the world. You mustthink about that responsibility you have taken upon your shoulders. You mustwonder occasionally if perhaps the time has come to lighten the burden.We know that at least a few of you are reading this book, or you have assignedsomeone to read it and summarize it. This is not our ego talking; given that thephenomenon is real and the secret is being kept, it is obvious that someone’sjob must be to understand the issues relating to Disclosure, to gauge thepublic’s evolving attitude, and to calibrate contingencies.Although some believe that you are preparing the world for gradual Disclosure,we are skeptical. You probably have done some analysis of what A.D. will looklike, an analysis that resides in deeply classified “contingency plans.” In ouranalysis, you seem to be in no hurry to use them. However, you should be.We have written this book to help prepare the world for Disclosure, knowing fullwell that such a duty should never have fallen to people like us, but rather toelected government officials. You created the vacuum; we merely stepped into it.You have read eight other chapters to reach this one. Some of it may have struckyou as naive, and some of it may have made your blood run cold, knowing that weknow what you do with your lives, even if we do not know exactly who you are.You would not be human if you did not feel some guilt over how far thissituation has gone, and for so long.Do you really believe that only you have the right to know this information? Isit your view that by blinding the rest of humanity to this reality, the world’sproblems will be easier to solve? Or is there something else at work here,something about power, even a misplaced sense of entitlement and birthright?There must be some of you who are ready for this next step, some who understandthat whatever the original motivations for the secrecy, it is long past time todeal with it. Time only makes the problem harder to manage.We sympathize to some extent with your situation. If the positions werereversed, it is possible we might have acted as you have. Because we do not knowall that you know, we can only speculate.Inside your group, the inside joke may be that you can’t be “a little bit”forthcoming on this issue any more than a woman can be “a little bit” pregnant.But that may not be entirely true. At least initially, the public may accept thenotion that some information must remain classified for national securityreasons, and that other information is being shared with other countries as acomprehensive plan is worked out. Eventually, partial disclosure will lead tofull Disclosure—yes—but as this road is traveled, there will be time for peopleto grasp one concept at a time before moving on to the next. Disclosure can comein stages, and in fact that is realistically the only way it can proceed. It hasto start somewhere, however.The decision to move ahead will come from within, or it will come from without.If within, it will be because some of you concede that the time has come forreasons that are either self-serving or pragmatic. If it comes without, it willbe because events dictate no other choice. You must sense that current inactionguarantees eventual compulsion. If you wait until forced, the public will judgeyou more harshly than if you step forward now, into the light of openness, andspeak the truth. It will be easier to spin a voluntary Disclosure than a forcedone.[images/00036.jpg]Moving beyond. As we explore the universe, history begins again. “Double StarStation” by Kimmo Isokoski, used with permission.A great divide separates the world of today from the world of your fathers andgrandfathers. That world, shaken by wars both hot and cold, was judged unable towithstand the shock that Disclosure would bring. This world has seen deep intothe vastness of our universe with powerful technology and, instinctively, we allknow that we are not alone. You will not destroy us by confirming the basicfact. We will hear the truth, absorb it, and move forward with our lives,changed as they might be. The details are another matter, but they should beworked out with representatives of the people rather than an unelected, secretsociety. Pass the baton.You have had a lifetime to assess the situation privately. Now is the time todiscuss it publicly. In every time, there is a season, and the season ofopenness is upon us. Public opinion has shifted through the years to where thisnext act is inevitable.Have you developed new technologies that put humanity on a better footing withthe Others? Why keep it to yourselves, hidden away for a war that may not come?Share it with the world, unleash it for the betterment of humankind. If thetechnology you have come across still bewilders your best scientific minds, thenbring it into the light. Let the millions of scientists around the world addtheir effort and understanding to the problem.Mostly, you need to understand that we already know. Not the details that youhave, to be sure, but the macro idea of contact. By coming clean, you will allowus to take control of our governments again, to reach out to other leadershiparound the world, and to move forward in uniting the Earth.This is happening, anyway. Every public relations expert on the planet—includingthose in the very military that spawned your group—knows that the best outcomein today’s world comes in getting ahead of the story. Assuming you areinterested in controlling the spin of this reality, you cannot successfully spinfrom behind, only from the lead.Take a stand, come forward, admit your mistakes, and claim your victories. Giveus the truth that we deserve, the truth as you know it.Many of you will still have a place—based on your own expertise—in the world asit re-forms A.D. Some of you will need to retire and step aside. A few, probablynot so many, may face penalties. But all of you stand before God as you knowGod, and before your fellow humans, with a dark stain of lies across your souls.The truth will set you free.To the OthersWe know less about you than you do about us. On that basis, establishinganything like an open relationship with you is not especially practical. Basedon the history of your actions, you want it this way.And yet you of all beings must know that time will not stop. Our civilization,our species, is on a trajectory. The day will come when we find you, openly,without question. We believe that day is coming soon, whether it be five years,20 years, or even a century more, it is as inevitable as day follows night.It may be that, knowing this eventuality cannot be stopped, you have elected tocontrol us in some way, to manipulate us. If this is so, you play a dangerousgame. You have seen how quickly the human race can learn, how quickly it cantransform itself. If you are seeking to control us, particularly if this is foryour benefit at our expense, then your plan will eventually backfire. For theday will come when we learn of this deception. At that point, things may becomedifficult for you.It may also be that you support us, this world, and all the life that liveshere. Naturally, we would like that to be so, and we know that some researchershave found reasons to believe it. If this is the case, however, we must ask youwhy you stand by while Earth, so magnificent, so precious, continues to slideinto chaos and disaster. We do not look for a savior; we know that, havingcreated this mess, we must clean it up. But it strikes us as odd that, if youare in fact benefactors, you seem to be standing by as helplessly as the greatmasses of humanity.Perhaps you look on us and our world as a kind of zoo. Maybe it even amuses youas you observe the spectacle that is humanity. We are something like a trapezeartist on a high wire. If we reach the other side of the wire, our society willbe even more fascinating, more challenging, than ever before.And yet we may fall. If we do, if our infrastructure suffers a significantcollapse, that could change things, at least for a while. Is this why you arehere—to see whether or not humanity will successfully move to the next level ofcivilization? Or, have we simply evolved enough that we are now intruding onyour reality more and more, and are becoming a positive nuisance?Whatever the answer, we can assure you that the day will come when we know it.Our species may seem ignorant and blind, and it is true that for most of ourhistory it has been so. But it will not always be so. Things are changing. Theday will come when you are forced to deal with us in some manner moresubstantial, more mature, than you have hitherto.To Those of Us Coming Out of the DarkThe very fact that you read this book says something about you. Whether or notyou gave the matter any previous thought, you are now an activist in theDisclosure movement.The struggle to end UFO secrecy has been going on since the 1940s. To our olderreaders, we encourage you to join this struggle because the history of the worldduring your lifetime demonstrates its necessity. You know in your heart thatchange is overdue. To our younger readers, born into the throes of a world intransformation, we ask you to be visionaries. We ask you to incorporate your ownworldview of the Earth as a small, blue planet that needs healing with another,grand, view: that knowing we are not alone will create its own positive changein our lives.The first step in effecting this change is to acknowledge what Eleanor Rooseveltsaid, “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” You are not a“UFO nut” who can be dismissed or laughed at. Have no fear. That wind you feelat your back is the truth. That others do not yet feel it says more about themthan you.Although ending UFO secrecy is inevitable, the kind of Disclosure that comeswith it still must be decided. Ditto in regards to how we all handle the newreality. To get the best possible outcome:> [images/00012.jpg] We must be willing to discuss this topic patiently and> rationally with people who do not yet share our understanding.> [images/00012.jpg] We must increase personal knowledge of the topic, in order> to become clear and persuasive.We need to bring our game up. This means that more is not always better. Moremisspelled, angry rants littered with unfounded assumptions and leaps of faithdo not help. They only provide the secret-keepers, and the rank-and-file ofcitizens, with the ammunition they need to dismiss us as amateurish. The crazierwe sound, the lower our public credibility. As in public speaking, so too inpublic writing: learn your facts, avoid hyperbole, and lower your voice.This is so, even if the final answers to this mystery are more bizarre, moreshattering, than anything we have even suggested in this book. The reason issimple: you cannot lead unless you have followers. Those around you, who knownothing of this topic, nothing of its profound implications, cannot always soeasily dive into its depths. One step at a time is the surest way to keep otherheads nodding, one step at a time in a logical, defensible sequence.Of course, it is perfectly normal to speculate. It is even smart to do so,providing you distinguish between what you know and what you think you know, andproviding you remind others of this difference. No one has every answer, and noone will expect you to have them all, either. Be comfortable with uncertainty.Now is the time to begin the transition from an Internet collected group of“conspiracy theorists” to a potent political force of openness and honesty. Weneed to elevate our standards and take inspiration from political movements ofthe past. The civil rights movement may be the best example of any. No politicalgroup can ever act perfectly, nor will we always agree with our leaders, northey with themselves. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X did not seeeye-to-eye on tactics, but they both knew there was a mountain to climb.If the UFO/ET reality is about a powerful signal that is obscured by thedistortion of noise, it is time to focus on the signal. Even in writing thisbook, we were mindful that we needed to present an argument in a sequence thatwould not alienate readers needing to understand the basics before appreciatingthe nuances. As an example, it is important that people understand and acceptthat at least some UFOs are physical, structured craft from somewhere that isnot here. They must become comfortable with that basic understanding before theycan appreciate Zeti-Reticuli, Nordics, abductions, and other challengingconcepts.We have to stop talking only to ourselves. Although it is nice to meet withother like-minded individuals in meetings and conferences and even virtually,this is not where the battle will be won. Posting on our own websites will notforce the hand of the secret-keepers. We need to move beyond our circles intothe circles of others. Talk to people who do not believe or know what you know.Persuade them. Spend less time with those who agree with you, more with thosewho disagree.The battle for UFO Disclosure comes from millions and millions of individualconversations, individually and in groups, with people who simply do notbelieve. It involves speaking to our friends, family, and colleagues in a calmand rational way. This often involves substantial bravery. After more than 60years of denial and ridicule, it is always easier to keep quiet about this,especially in polite company. The antidote to ridicule is knowledge.This involves work. Read more. Think more critically. Remember that you are anactivist in a wholly new kind of political movement. So many years ago, duringthe Vietnam War, the images that motivated change were on the news every night.In our movement, the images and facts are not on the news. Quite the opposite.We seek to force acknowledgement of a reality that has long been hushed up andswept away. We must explain that we are not waiting for radio telescopes toconfirm other life in the universe. We are waiting for the rest of the world towake up and see that which has been placed before them, but which most haverefused to see.Do not ask politicians if they believe in UFOs. In today’s climate, their onlyappropriate answer to that question will be to dodge it. Instead ask them totheir faces, during campaigns, if they support full disclosure of UFO relatedmaterial. Ask them if they know anyone who has ever seen a UFO. Ask them if theybelieve we are alone in the universe. They can answer these questions withoutgetting branded by their opponents, and it helps us build a consensus.Particularly important to remember is that most of the people involved insecrecy have their own friends and neighbors. They live in nice homes, getmarried, have children, maybe even go to soccer games. But they also lead adouble life in which they carry this incredible secret around with them, everyday. Anyone you meet in government, aerospace, technology and themilitary—particularly those in private industry as contractors—is a potentialcandidate for being one of them, or knowing someone who is. Speak your mind tothese people about the need to end the secrecy.Be the change you want to see. You know this is real. Go about your daily lifeand make sure you let others know that you know. Change the dynamic one personat a time.Then, one day, when the mass sighting or the physical evidence or the deathbedconfession pushes the issue to the top of international agenda, thesecret-keepers will look around and realize that we already know, and they willfinally come clean.It can happen. It starts with you.Our Last ThoughtThe journey we have taken to write this book has been life-altering. We havebeen forced to consider things that others have danced over lightly in previousbooks, or even ignored altogether. We have had to look inside our own souls totry seeing the souls of our fellow humans, even those of the Others.The Others are the great wildcard in this game. They have always had it in theirpower to disclose themselves, yet they decline to do so. Will the fact that wehave disclosed them to ourselves change their thinking? Perhaps in such ascenario, Disclosure will be the active ingredient in creating whatever comesnext.Will knowing that Others are lurking in our own neighborhood create the “onenessof man” that so many have speculated about? Will former adversaries suddenlyreconcile? North and South Korea? Israel and the Arabs? India and Pakistan? TheUnited States and its list of terrorists? Multinational corporations and theircompetitors, to say nothing of the rest of the world?Probably not, to say the least. Disclosure may, however, focus our attention innew ways that can benefit us and lead to resolution of thorny problems.A study such as this, which seeks to peer into a volatile future, can never becomplete. This is especially so, as it is the first of its kind. Many willdisagree with some of our conclusions. We have simply done our best to advancethe cause of ending secrecy and beginning Disclosure. Others will follow anddraw different conclusions. Only when Disclosure is a reality will we truly knowhow it will unfold.The world will change with this knowledge, of that there can be no doubt. Merelycontemplating this reality changes a person, but actually seeing it may bealmost too much to bear. We shall see.The only thing we can know for certain is that no one has the right to hold sucha deep knowledge from the rest of us, no matter what it is, no matter how itmight change us. The policy of denial, the policy of lies, does not propel usforward. It only holds humanity hostage.We are ready to be told. It is time for truth to turn the page.Even after that happens, it will take at least a quarter-century before ourchanged world dynamic becomes something of a routine to live with. Then,finally, we as a species will perhaps embrace the idea that we have company inthe universe, that some of these Others are long-term visitors. Of course, bythat time, we may be visiting strange new worlds ourselves. We may then become“Others” to other intelligent species, and hide our presence from them as wasdone to us.Soon, we shall tell ourselves the truth. The day is coming when we shall looktoward the stars and see ourselves looking back."},{"pageContent":"NotesChapter 2> 1 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_009.html#filepos94605]. “Proposed Studies on> the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs,” a.k.a. “The> Brookings Report.” Submitted April 18, 1961, to the Committee on Science and> Astronautics of the United States House of Representatives.> 2 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_009.html#filepos95492]. “Air Force Order on> ‘Saucers’ Cited,” New York Times, February 28, 1960.> 3 [A.D._After_Disclosure_split_009.html#filepos97926].
