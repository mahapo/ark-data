While several historical studies of the controversiessurrounding the reports have been conducted, the military and intelligenceimplications have, until now, remained in a state of confusion.As a longtime student of the phenomenon, I can testify to the complexity of thedata Richard Dolan had to decipher. The U.S. Air Force itself, overtly the maincontender in this drama, never attempted to compile a comprehensive history ofits own files on the matter. When I reviewed the 11,000 cases in the air forcefiles between 1963 and 1967, the military had no index of that data. The mostcogent participants, such as Capt. Edward Ruppelt and professor J. Allen Hynek,did write about what they had done but they left many undocumented areas.Interested outsiders picked up the pieces of the various projects, and presentedpersonal interpretations of what had happened. Understandably, the result was avibrant mélange of facts, fiction, and subjective interpretations, which has ledto the wildly conflicting theories the media love to exploit.Even the White House was unable to reconstruct the full picture when PresidentJimmy Carter instructed NASA to undertake a review of UFO information in thelate seventies. A Washington wag described the space agency’s reaction to thispresidential order as “a flurry of alarmed paralysis.” At the height of theCarter effort a small group of us from various research institutes anduniversities volunteered to help. I vividly recall a meeting I had with ahigh-level official at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, across thestreet from the White House in September 1977. 1 tried to convey to him that wehad experts all across the U.S. who were ready, willing, and able to getinvolved in NASA’s review of the phenomenon if they were given a green light. Helistened to me sympathetically but expressed discouragement about what he saw as“an impossible political situation.” Discussion turned to the fact that the CIAand the air force, as well as several other agencies, must have entire filecabinets filled with reports from their own people, if only because thephenomenon is known to trigger the kinds of sensors that have been deployed todetect enemy threats during the Cold War. I was told there was plenty of dataall right, collected by the military and intelligence community, but it “neversaw the light of day.” The White House might force some of it to be released, hetold me, but that might not advance the problem: “Those guys twist everything tosuit their own political schemes. It’s like pulling teeth to get data, and younever know if they tell you the truth.”Into this murky world of deception and confusion Richard Dolan has now cast awelcome light. But it will take a sustained effort along the lines he haspioneered if we hope to validate the facts, uncover the motives, and reconstructthe patterns. In order to conduct this analysis it is very important to takenotice of what is not there: the missing parts of the overall puzzle. What isnot there constitutes a world of heroic complexity and immense proportion.I had a vivid example of this fact, on a much smaller scale, when I unearthed asecret letter from a Battelle scientist named Cross, who had written to the CIAat the time of the Robertson panel in 1953. (I have referred to this document inmy previous books as the “Pentacle Memorandum.”) To this day there areufologists who claim the letter was unimportant. Yet there are indications itmay represent the point of major bifurcation when the most serious part of theofficial study plunged underground while Blue Book continued as a publicrelations exercise, the visible effort by the military to gather UFO reportsfrom American citizens.The experience of tracking down that single document makes me appreciate thedelicate nature and the sheer difficulty of the task undertaken by Richard Dolanin compiling the present book.The Cross letter was significant because it implied that a group of specialistsworking in the shadows on the most massive UFO study to date had the power tokeep critical information from a prestigious national security panel.Furthermore, they had another plan, a brilliant project of far-reachingimplication which they proposed to implement as a way of getting to the heart ofthe phenomenon. I had a copy of that letter. It was stamped “Secret.” I knew itsexact origin. Yet all the efforts I made to unearth an official copy from theair force or the National Archives through the Freedom of Information Act failedto yield results. It is finally through Congress that I obtained clearance torelease the text. The process has given me a sobering view of the ability of thebureaucracy to hide the truth for decades, occasionally using the colorfulcommunity of UFO believers itself as an unwitting tool as it covered its tracks.To this day, I am convinced that historians of the phenomenon have remainedblind to some of the implications. It is my hope that books like the present onecan stimulate a renewed effort to get at the truth.Like the “missing mass” that astronomers are trying to locate in the far reachesof our universe, the UFO phenomenon rests on an ocean of dark matter, deepsecrets, and forgotten wars fought only in shadows. Not all of it had to do withthe kind of objects the American public imagines UFOs to be. Some of thewarriors seemed to have understood, early on, that if UFOs existed as a genuinenew phenomenon of intelligent origin, this fact did not necessarily mean theywere from outer space. And other warriors may have decided that the belief inthe reality of UFOs could be twisted, exploited, and bent to obscure politicalends. They may have planted false UFO stories to hide real experiments. They mayhave disguised helicopters as flying saucers, or lied to witnesses at siteswhere advanced prototypes had crashed, never to be divulged again. No wondereven White House officials get confused when they try, years later, toreassemble the facts.As we ponder the implications, we are led, inexorably, to a much larger issue.As anyone learns who has become a naturalized United States citizen, the rockupon which American democracy is built is “an informed citizenry.” Without fullinformation, how would you know how to vote? And if you didn’t know how to vote,could you still pretend you lived in a democracy?In the last fifty years the various branches of the military and intelligencecommunity in the United States have so clouded the reports of the UFO phenomenonthat the citizenry has been left not just uninformed but indeed misinformed.This may not have been the intent, but it is indeed the result. Those who trulycare about democracy are justified in asking that the government come cleanabout what it knows and—most importantly perhaps—what it doesn’t know about aphenomenon of such far-reaching consequences for our science and our society.All efforts to break open the mystery so far have made the assumption that the“big secret” merely involves extraterrestrial spacecraft put together with metaland rivets. This partial view is supported by the many instances in which UFOshave been seen by pilots, photographed, and tracked on radar. Yet modernphysical theory opens up a much wider, richer spectrum of hypotheses for objectsthat might blink in and out of perception, impact the consciousness ofwitnesses, accelerate without creating sonic booms, change shape, and merge withone another dynamically. Concepts of higher dimensionality, once on the fringesof physics, have entered the mainstream of science. Given what we know about theuniverse today, it is irrational to assume it can be described with only threedimensions of space and one dimension of time.The UFO witnesses are telling us they have experienced objects of vastcomplexity that challenged their sense of reality. Such observations areanomalous in the narrow sense of the classical physics we learn in school, butthey may help build a conceptual framework for the physics of the twenty-firstcentury. It is all the more important then, as Richard Dolan points out, to makea precise assessment of what the most reliable witnesses have observed, and toseriously start looking for the missing parts of this famous puzzle. UFOs havebeen with us since the beginning of recorded history. Could they be trying totell us who we are, and what true place we are destined to occupy in theuniverse ?—by Jacques F.

Therefore,I decided to tighten the book throughout, eliminate some redundancies ofdescription, and shorten it by about 150 pages.The result has been both less and more than I expected. As for length, this newedition is only shorter by about fifty pages, but it has several changes fromthe original that make it substantially different. Every chapter has beenedited, although the bulk of the changes are in the first half of the book. Themost significant are:Some paring down of non-UFO-related activities by the American military andintelligence apparatus. This is not complete by any means, and certainly enoughremains to place UFO policies and activities within an appropriate context.Streamlining and clarification of the crash at Roswell; more thorough analysisof the Maury Island and MJ-12 controversies.More complete analysis of some documents from late 1947, including a correctionregarding the Schulgen Memo and a better study of the “Soviet angle.”Expanded coverage of the Mantell case of 1948, Secretary of Defense JamesForrestal, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, Thomas Townsend Brown, and anti-gravityresearch from the 1950s.Improving the footnoting so as to cite primary documents whenever possible. Nothaving done this adequately the first time had been a major regret.Throughout, I took the opportunity to improve organization whenever possible,add new and relevant information, and always keep the reader’s best interest inmind.—Richard M.

Over the years, enough pieces of thepuzzle have emerged to give us a sense of what the picture looks like. I havetried to use these pieces to construct a clear, historical narrative, focusingon the national security dimensions.Because this subject is so widely ridiculed, it is important to stress why it isworthy of serious attention. Stories of strange objects in the sky go far backin time, but the problem received little attention until the Second World War.At that time, military personnel from Allied and Axis countries reportedunconventional objects in the sky, eventually known as foo fighters. Inretrospect, this development is not so surprising. First, human aviation hadbecome widespread for the first time. Above the clouds, thousands of pilotssuddenly had the kind of visibility never before possessed. A second reason wasthe invention of radar, which extended the range of human vision by electronicmeans. Most investigators during the war assumed the odd sightings were relatedto the war itself, the product of anomalies related to their new technologies ofdetection, or perhaps enemy experimental aircraft.With that in mind, one might have expected such sightings to vanish after thewar’s end in 1945. Instead, they increased. In Europe in 1946, then America in1947, people saw and reported objects that could not be explained in anyconventional sense. Wherever sightings occurred, military authorities dominatedthe investigations, and for perfectly understandable reasons. Unknown objects,frequently tracked on radar and observed visually, were flying within one’snational borders and, in the case of the United States, over sensitive militaryinstallations. The war was over. What was going on here?During the UFO wave of 1947, American military and intelligence organizationsconducted multiple, simultaneous investigations of these sightings. Although theair force was officially charged with investigating them, it was never the onlygame in town. Every service was involved. The FBI investigated UFOs for a while,and by 1948 at the latest, the CIA initiated an ongoing interest.Initially, some Americans feared that the Soviet Union might be behind the“flying saucer” wave. This possibility was studied, then rejected. At a timewhen the world’s fastest aircraft approached the speed of 600 mph, some of theseobjects exceeded—or appeared to exceed—1,000 mph. What’s more, they maneuveredas no aircraft could, including right-angle turns, stopping on a dime, andaccelerating instantly. Could the Soviets really have built something like that?If so, why fly them all over America and Western Europe? To experts, the ideaseemed far-fetched at best, and fifty years later, their conclusion stands.Could the objects, then, have been American? The possibility was studied andrejected for the same reasons. It was not credible to American investigatorsthat their military had secretly discovered a hypersonic antigravity technology.Options quickly narrowed. Either this was something real and alien, or it wassomething “conventional” but as yet unknown or unexplained. But what couldexplain the strong appearance of metallic craft performing the impossible ? Bythe end of 1947, a contingent of analysts at the Air Technical IntelligenceCenter (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base believed that UFOs wereextraterrestrial. By the summer of 1948, this team prepared an “Estimate of theSituation,” stating the extraterrestrial thesis that landed on the desk of AirForce Commander Hoyt Vandenberg. As the story goes (there are no official papersproving this, only the statements of several insiders), Vandenberg rejected it,either for lack of proof or because it did not state his desired conclusion.Either way, he made it clear that the air force would not accept speculationabout extraterrestrials as a solution to UFOs.Of course, people continued to see these things and wondered what they were. Inthe summer of 1952, for instance, UFO sightings were so frequent and often ofsuch high quality that some in the air force actually wondered whether aninvasion was under way. With some help from the secret CIA-SPONSORED RobertsonPanel of January 1953, the air force improved censorship over the problem.Still, it never quite went away. Civilian organizations began to collect andanalyze interesting UFO reports. Moreover, the air force had backed itself intoa corner by committing itself to monitoring UFOs as a possible national securitythreat. Those who criticized the air force’s dismissive statements aboutUFOs—and there were many such people—frequently asked, if saucers posed nothreat to national security, and existed only in the imagination, why did theair force create Project Blue Book to study the reports?Then came the great UFO wave of 1965 and 1966, when the air force could nolonger hide behind weather balloons and swamp gas, nor withstand publicscrutiny. As a result, it funded a scientific study of UFOs by the University ofColorado, known to history as the Condon Committee, to “settle” the matter.After two years, the committee concluded that UFOs were not worthy of scientificstudy. Critics replied that the study’s conclusions did not match its own data.The committee certainly had bad blood among its own members, which resulted inthe removal of the “pro-UFO” contingent midway through the project. It appearedto many that the project’s leadership had been set on a negative conclusion fromthe beginning. Rumors spread about control over the committee, either by the airforce or CIA.As messy as the Condon Committee was, it enabled the air force to close BlueBook. In December 1969, the air force announced it was no longer investigatingUFOs. The major civilian investigative organizations soon declined, and peoplewho saw UFOs had scarcely anywhere to turn.Let us pause to assess the situation. By the mid-1940s, America’s intelligenceapparatus had reason to believe that there were artifacts in the skies that didnot originate from America, Russia, Germany, or any other country. These objectsviolated some highly sensitive military airspace, and did not appear to benatural phenomena. One may presume that the affected national securityauthorities made it an immediate obsession to determine the nature and purposeof these objects, and we may infer that the issue probably became a deep secretby 1946, or 1947 at the latest.Some will dismiss this as one of the many conspiracy theories dotting America’slandscape. The very label serves as an automatic dismissal, as though no oneever acts in secret. Let us bring some perspective and common sense to thisissue. The United States comprises large organizations--corporations,bureaucracies, “interest groups,” and the like—which are conspiratorial bynature. That is, they are hierarchical, their important decisions are made insecret by a few key decision-makers, and they are not above lying about theiractivities. Such is the nature of organizational behavior. “Conspiracy,” in thiskey sense, is a way of life around the globe.Within the world’s military and intelligence apparatuses, this tendency ismagnified to the greatest extreme. During the 1940s, while the military and itsscientists developed the world’s most awesome weapons in complete secrecy, theUFO problem descended, as it was, into their laps. Would they be interested inunknown objects snooping around their restricted airspace? Would they want torestrict the information they acquired? The available evidence, contained withinthis book, indicates an affirmative response.If we assume, then, the existence of a UFO conspiracy, we may ask, where is it?Is there a central control group, for example, managing the problem? Perhapsyes, perhaps no. It is possible, even plausible, that no one holding publicoffice today knows what is going on. It may be that a UFO control group existedat one time within the Department of Defense or the CIA, but there is noabsolute reason why such a situation must exist today. Not only is secrecywithin those circles axiomatic, but information is so highly compartmentalizedthat it is easy to imagine how various strands of UFO information could fallinto dozens of semi-isolated domains.Clearly, within the military, secrecy remains the rule regarding UFOs. Despiteclaims of noninterest, the military continues to respond to reports ofunidentified flying (and underwater) objects. But military personnel would befoolish in the extreme to be caught discussing this with the public. Themilitary’s “Oath upon Inadvertent Exposure to Classified Security Data orInformation” is taken by all personnel exposed to classified information of anykind, and is binding for life, under all circumstances. When you sign this oath,in the words of 133rd Airborne Wing Officer James Goodell:> ... you sign away your constitutional rights. You sign a piece of paper saying> that if you violate your security agreement ... without a trial, without the> right of appeal, you’re going to go to the Leavenworth federal penitentiary> for twenty years. That’s a real big incentive to keep your mouth shut.1> [index_split_254.html#filepos1417353] The military has taken the UFO issue deep undercover.

UNOFFICIAL CULTURE Some things are true, and some things are officially true.In 1937, Joseph Stalin authorized the first Soviet census in a decade. Based ongrowth estimates of the 1920s, he expected a total near 170 million.Unfortunately, the numbers came in at 156 million, and Stalin was none toopleased. Rather than inquire as to what happened to the 14 million missingsouls, Stalin devised a simpler solution: he had most of the census takers shot,the rest sent to the Gulag. Two years later, a more amenable 1939 census counted170 million, which became the official number.Anyone who has lived in a repressive society knows that official manipulation ofthe truth occurs daily. But all societies have their many and their few. In alltimes and all places, it is the few who rule, and the few who exert dominantinfluence over what we may call official culture. While Stalin’s solution to hiscensus problem was extreme, all elites take care to manipulate publicinformation to maintain existing structures of power. It’s an old game.Like everywhere else, America has its topics that are too sensitive to discussopenly without distressing some powerful interest. UFOs have always been such atopic, as seen by the combination of official denial, extreme secrecy, publicridicule, and widespread popular belief connected to it. Officially, UFOs do notexist, and are only discussed in public as a kind of joke, or perhaps a piece ofcultural kitsch. Yet, some three-quarters of Americans believe in them. Why thisdisparity? After all, most Americans believe in God, and there is no officialridicule associated with that belief. Could it be that a belief in UFOsis—however odd this may at first seem—slightly subversive?"},{"pageContent":"THE REDMOND, OREGON, INCIDENT There are many examples in this book that illustrate the disparity betweenofficial and unofficial truth about UFOs. Here is one: the Redmond, Oregon, UFOcase.Shortly before dawn on September 24, 1959, Police Officer Robert Dickerson wasdriving through the streets of Redmond, Oregon, when he saw a large, brightobject descend over the city, stop abruptly, and hover at two hundred feet. Theobject was low enough that nearby treetops glowed. Minutes later, Dickersondrove to the Federal Aviation Administration office at the Redmond airport.Meanwhile, the object rapidly moved to an area northeast of the airport and onceagain hovered. Its color had changed from bright white to reddish-orange.Through binoculars, Dickerson and others perceived it as flat and round; tonguesof “flame” occasionally extended from its edge.At 5:10 A.M., the FAA reported the object to the Seattle Air Route ControlCenter, which relayed the message to Hamilton Air Force Base in California. At5:18 A.M., six F-102 jet fighters were scrambled from Portland to intercept.Witnesses were still watching the hovering object when the jets roared overRedmond. As the aircraft approached, the object squelched its “tongues offlame,” emitted a fiery exhaust, shot up into the air at an incredible speed,and disappeared into the clouds at fourteen thousand feet. It was so close tothe path of the jets that one of the pilots swerved to avoid hitting it. Anotherjet, caught in the turbulence of the tremendous exhaust, nearly lost control.One pilot, using gunsight radar, continued the chase, but the object abruptlychanged course—an event that was tracked by radar at Klamath Falls GroundControl Intercept—and the pilot gave up. For two hours afterward, the unknownobject continued to register on radar, performing high-speed maneuvers ataltitudes between six thousand and fifty-four thousand feet.The pilots immediately received an intelligence debriefing and were ordered notto discuss the matter, even among themselves. But hundreds of Redmond citizenshad heard the jets, some had seen the interceptors, and a few had made reportsabout the unknown object. Forced into an explanation, the air force said theflight was a routine investigation caused by false radar returns. Excitablewitnesses probably imagined the glow.Word soon leaked out, however, that the FAA was checking for abnormalradioactivity where witnesses saw the object hover and “blast off.” This made itdifficult for people to swallow the air force explanation. Why would the FAAcheck for abnormal radiation if the whole event was illusory? As a result, theair force changed its solution: the object everyone had seen was probably aweather balloon. It did not bother to explain how a weather balloon couldoutdistance jets flying at 600 mph.When offering this explanation, the air force did not know that the nation’sleading civilian UFO group—the National Investigations Committee on AerialPhenomena—had obtained certified copies of FAA logs. This was an unexpectedcoup, as the FAA logs described the UFO and its maneuvers in great detail,including its evasion from the interceptors. The logs also included air forceconfirmations of radar tracking, scrambling of Portland jets, and a report fromKlamath Falls.When this information became public, the air force promptly denounced the FAAfor issuing false information and maintained its balloon answer. After morepressure from NICAP and several legislators, however, the air force finallyannounced the “true” explanation: the witnesses had seen the planet Venus.3[index_split_254.html#filepos1417653]"},{"pageContent":"THE NATIONAL SECURITY STATE “We think we’re Luke Skywalker,” says a friend of mine, “when we’re actuallyDarth Vader.” America is a country with a bad conscience, nominally a republicand free society, but in reality an empire and oligarchy, vaguely aware of itsown oppression, within and without.

SECRECY Nearly everything of significance undertaken by America’s military andintelligence community in the past half-century has occurred in secrecy. Theundertaking to build an atomic weapon, better known as the Manhattan Project,remains the great model for all subsequent activities. For more than two yearsnot a single member of Congress even knew about it, although its final costexceeded the then-incredible total of $2 billion. During and after the SecondWorld War, other important projects, such as the development of biologicalweapons, the importation of Nazi scientists, terminal mind-control experiments,nationwide interception of mail and cable transmissions of an unwittingpopulace, infiltration of the media and universities, secret coups, secret wars,and assassinations all took place far removed not only from the American public,but from most members of Congress and a few presidents. Indeed, several of themost powerful intelligence agencies were themselves established in secrecy,unknown by the public or Congress for many years."},{"pageContent":"2. WEALTH Since the 1940s, the U.S. Defense and Intelligence establishment has had moremoney at its disposal than most nations. In addition to official dollars, muchof the money is undocumented. From its beginning, the CIA was engaged in avariety of off-the-record “business” activities that generated large sums ofcash. The connections of the CIA with global organized crime (and thus de factowith the international narcotics trade) has been well established and documentedfor many years.4 [index_split_254.html#filepos1417824] In addition, the CIAmaintained its own private airline fleet which generated a tidy sum ofunvouchered funds primarily out of Asia. Indeed, much of the original money torun the American intelligence community came from very wealthy and establishedAmerican families, who have long maintained an interest in funding nationalsecurity operations important to their interests."},{"pageContent":"3. INDEPENDENCE In theory, civilian oversight exists over the U.S. national securityestablishment. The president is the military commander-in-chief. Congress hasofficial oversight over the CIA. The FBI must answer to the Justice Department.In practice, little of this applied during the period under review. One reasonhas to do with the secrecy: the compartmentalization of information withinmilitary and intelligence circles. “Top Secret” clearance does not clear one forall Top Secret information. Sensitive information is available on a need-to knowbasis. Two CIA officers in adjoining rooms at the Langley headquarters can beinvolved in completely different activities, each ignorant of the other’sdoings. Such compartmentalization increases not only secrecy, but independencefrom the wrong (i.e., official) kinds of oversight.A chilling example of such independence occurred during the 1950s, whenPresident Dwight Eisenhower effectively lost control of the U.S. nucleararsenal. The situation deteriorated so much that during his final two years inoffice, Eisenhower asked repeatedly for an audience with the head of StrategicAir Command to learn what America’s nuclear retaliatory plan was. What hefinally learned in 1960, his final year in office, horrified him: half of theNorthern Hemisphere would be obliterated.If a revered military hero such as Eisenhower could not control America’snuclear arsenal, nor get a straight answer from the Pentagon, how on earth couldPresidents Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, or Nixon regarding comparable matters?"},{"pageContent":"4.

Like other areas within its domain, theUFO problem has been handled secretly, with great deception, and withsignificant resources. The secrecy stems from a pervasive and fundamentalelement of life in our world, that those who are at the top of the heap willalways take whatever steps are necessary to maintain the status quo."},{"pageContent":"CAN THEY REALLY COVER THIS UP? UFO skeptics often ask, “Do you really think the government could hide somethinglike this for so long?” The question itself reflects ignorance of the realitythat secrecy is a way of life in the national security state. Actually, though,the answer is yes, and no.Yes, in that cover-ups are standard operating procedure, frequently unknown tothe public for decades, becoming public knowledge by a mere roll of the dice.But also no, in that UFO information has leaked out from the very beginning. Itis impossible to shut the lid completely. The key lies in neutralizing anddiscrediting unwelcomed information, sometimes through official denial, othertimes through proxies in the media.The severity of military orders is certainly a major incentive to secrecy. Inaddition, the history of the U.S. media shows unsettling developments, not leastof which is penetration by the intelligence community. By the early 1950s, theCIA had cozy relationships with most major media executives in America. The mostsignificant of these were with the New York Times, Washington Post, ChristianScience Monitor, New York Herald-Tribune, Saturday Evening Post, Miami Herald,Time-Life, CBS News, Scripps-Howard Newspapers, Hearst Newspapers, theAssociated Press, United Press International, the Mutual Broadcasting System,and Reuters. In addition, the CIA had major ownership over many proprietarypublications throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas. By the early 1970s, theagency admitted to having working relationships with over four hundred Americanjournalists. Consider the possibilities with four hundred strategically placedpeople throughout the mainstream media. There is evidence that this relationshipcontinues.5 [index_split_254.html#filepos1418292]The result is effective news management. Without question, the mainstream mediahave supported government propaganda about UFOs. From 1947 onward, while the airforce worked to remove the UFO problem from the public domain, the media helpedit to ridicule the subject. The release of every major air force and CIAstatement about UFOs has, without exception, been met by uncritical mediaacquiescence. It is true that the decade of the 1990s brought a different kindof media openness about UFOs than existed in decades, due to the recognitionthat money can be made. The net result, however, is a very mixed bag. At thesame time that such television networks as A&E and Discovery have providedfairly serious documentaries on the subject, UFOs have essentially become anadjunct of pop culture. Moreover, serious treatment by the major networks hasremained nonexistent.6 [index_split_254.html#filepos1418474]"},{"pageContent":"SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS In the conclusion of the University of Colorado Report on UFOs, physicist EdwardU. Condon asked with evident annoyance, if aliens are really here, why haven’tthey presented themselves? The whole question, he wrote, “would be settled in afew minutes if a flying saucer were to land on the lawn of a hotel where aconvention of the American Physical Society was in progress, and its occupantswere to emerge and present a special paper to the assembled physicists....”7[index_split_254.html#filepos1418674]If there are aliens here, they do not appear to be interested in announcingthemselves to us. Is it yet possible to prove the issue? Are there hypothesesthat can be tested? Can “believers” somehow produce the proof that skepticscontinually demand?What would constitute proof? Many people have videotaped UFOs. Some are hoaxes,while others appear to be genuine. Is it possible to prove one is genuine? Whatabout consistent witness testimony? Perhaps persuasive in a court of law, butprovable in the court of science? What about radar/visual cases, such as theRedmond, Oregon, case described earlier, in which a UFO was observed visuallyand tracked on radar? Certainly compelling to someone who was there, but...proof?We must ask not only what constitutes proof, but who would be authorized to deemit so? Certainly, an acknowledgment of aliens would have to come from a majorspokesperson of official culture—a message from the president, perhaps. In otherwords, the matter may be more political than scientific. UFO evidence derivedfrom a grassroots level is unlikely to survive its inevitable conflict withofficial culture (fifty years of failure have borne this out). An acknowledgmentabout the reality of the UFO phenomenon will only occur when the officialculture deems it worthwhile or necessary to make it. Don’t hold your breath.As a result, the easiest thing to do with UFO evidence is to ignore it, which iswhat most people do. Much harder is to confront it honestly, whether this meansaccepting or debunking it. That is, accepting into one’s worldview something as“far out” as extraterrestrials is not easy for many people, especially whenone’s official culture finds little more than ridicule in the subject. Theproblem with most skeptical arguments against alien visitation is that, quitesimply, they fail to look at the UFO evidence. They appear plausible at first,but usually fall apart when presented with a few good reports. (When all elsefails, a committed skeptic can always retreat to the final line of defense:claiming the event was hoaxed.)The most common of the theoretical complaints are:> Granted that there may be intelligent life elsewhere in the universe,> interstellar travel is still impossible. The distances between stars are too> vast to travel. J. Allen Hynek, longtime consultant to the air force’s Project Blue Book, had anexpression for this kind of attitude: “It can’t be; therefore, it isn’t.” It istrue that the distances of interstellar space are so vast as to make travelappear to be impossible. No person could survive a ten-thousand-yearinterstellar journey, considering our current technologies.The most common rejoinder is that perhaps a breakthrough in propulsiontechnology is possible, and that perhaps we can somehow surpass or bypass thespeed-of-light obstacle, like the Enterprise at warp eight. Physicists scoff atthe idea, except those who are now working on it. Is it at least possible thatsomeone else might already have gotten further on this problem? The claims ofthousands of eyewitnesses point to revolutionary propulsion methods of UFOcraft.Even dismissing breakthroughs in propulsion technology, however, recentdevelopments in just two areas—artificial intelligence and biotechnology—willbring revolutionary developments within the next century. Many in those fieldsbelieve it will be possible to create an artificially intelligent organism.Perhaps, having found a twin to Earth somewhere out there, an artificiallyintelligent organism could make the long journey. Or why even use an organismwhen one could equip the ship itself with artificial intelligence?If we can plausibly imagine ourselves finding another planet with featuressimilar to our own, and sending an intelligent probe there, how likely is itthat someone else has already done the same to us? There are many unknownvariables, to be sure, but the prospect cannot be denied.Why haven’t they announced themselves?This was Condon’s question. After all, the landing of an alien vessel on theWhite House lawn would settle matters. The question, however, assumes some kindof parity between humans and any others who may arrive. A human scientiststudying a band of gorillas would not introduce herself to the dominant malewith a view toward establishing diplomatic relations (although she mightinteract with some or all gorillas in some manner). Perhaps open relations withaliens are not possible, or at least less practical than we typically imagine.Or perhaps the prospect promises too many headaches for them. We just don’tknow.Besides, if one takes seriously the thousands of reports and claims of alienabduction, it appears that aliens have made their presence known. They have doneso, however, covertly, in a manner that bypasses all official channels of ourcivilization—an act of extreme subversion. Aren’t people really seeing experimental or classified aircraft?The question is valid. There are objects being tested and flown today ofstaggering technology. The fabled Aurora craft, an open secret flown out of Area51 in Nevada, possesses extraordinary speed, maneuverability, and stealthcapabilities, and is rumored to incorporate revolutionary principles inpropulsion technology. Regarding the early years, CIA historian Gerald Hainesargued recently that most UFO sightings in the 1950s and 1960s were actually ofclassified aircraft such as the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes.8[index_split_254.html#filepos1418812] There is no doubt that some of those UFOreports were of these aircraft. A closer inspection of the facts, however,reveals his claim to be specious. The U-2, for instance, did not fly until 1955.Its altitude was typically eighty thousand feet, and it flew straight as astring. It did not hover, nor accelerate instantly, nor land vertically, nor doany of the other things thousands of witnesses attributed to UFOs. The same canbe said for the rest of America’s cutting-edge technology of the cold war. Itshould be added that, even today, experimental technology does not appear to bethe explanation for the majority of good UFO reports, but such a discussionexceeds the scope of this book.Infrastructure questions.Where is the infrastructure of this alien civilization that can produce suchincredible technology and enormous vessels? Or, if UFO reports are to be takenseriously, there must be thousands, or even millions, of aliens already here—howcan that be? Good questions, surely, but which—like many of the others—areguilty of the same mistake: trying to place us inside the enlarged heads ofthese aliens. Such questions presume that we can somehow think for them andimagine what their civilization can be like. They are too theoretical. It is onething to discuss the likelihood or impossibility of space travel, quite anotherto examine and explain a few good UFO reports."},{"pageContent":"POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS OF THE UFO PROBLEM So, how serious is the UFO problem? Are aliens really among us? If so, what dothey want?Keeping this discussion completely factual, we can acknowledge that the UFOphenomenon has always been global. It is not, as some Americans continue tobelieve, a uniquely American phenomenon, or restricted to the southwesternstates. By no means. Sober, reliable people of all sociological strata havereported unconventional objects throughout North and South America, Europe,Africa, Asia, Australia, Antarctica, all the world’s major bodies of water, andeven outer space.UFOs are also actual objects, not simply atmospheric phenomena. This is not tosay that some atmospheric phenomena have not been mistakenly believed to beflying saucers, but that the core of difficult UFO cases is of actual objects ofapparently unconventional design (e.g., disc-shaped), and capable of incrediblespeeds and maneuverability. When an object is seen visually, is tracked clearlyon radar, and when pilot after pilot is adamant that what he saw was a realobject, it is reasonable to conclude that we are dealing with something real.It is also true that from the 1950s and beyond, people around the world havebeen claiming to see alien entities. Now, it is certainly possible that theywere mistaken. It is interesting to note, however, that such people havefrequently been interviewed by civil and military authorities, and typicallyhave been considered honest. In late 1954, for example, hundreds of witnesses inFrance and the rest of the Mediterranean region, as well as South America,claimed to see short alien beings. The witnesses were men, women, youths,elderly, doctors, professors, mechanics, homemakers, and peasant farmers.Several cases left significant landing traces. Were these people hoaxing? Notaccording to the authorities who investigated them. Were they delusional? If so,what caused such widespread and similar delusions? Was it a case of masshysteria? If so, it was an event that cut across national and language barriersamong people who knew little about UFOs to begin with.There is also no doubt that the actual number of UFO sightings vastly exceedsany official total. Hynek believed the difference to be a factor of ten. That,of course, was when people had somewhere to report their sightings. I can addthat, in the final twelve months of writing this book, I encountered aboutthirty people who volunteered UFO sightings to me, without any solicitation onmy part. In every case, the witnesses never reported what they saw to anyauthority, and in most cases told either no one, or perhaps a close friend. Howmany people have seen a UFO, but not reported it? I believe the answer is, lots.This is a widespread phenomenon affecting many people, generating high levels ofinterest, taking place in near-complete secrecy, for purposes unknown, byagencies unknown, with access to incredible resources and technology. A soberingthought, and cause for reflection."},{"pageContent":"SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION Bodies need bones; history needs facts. In the course of this study, someseemingly outlandish claims are made; how do I back them up?In preparing this book, I have drawn from three basic groups of sources."},{"pageContent":"1. PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS RELEASED THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATIONACT. The Freedom of Information Act was a completely unforeseen development to thoseinvolved in UFO secrecy during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Act was passedin 1966, but gained some teeth only in the aftermath of Watergate and Vietnam.By the mid-1970s, many citizens filed FOIA requests regarding governmentinvolvement with UFOs, and obtained information that confirmed extreme interestin UFOs."},{"pageContent":"2. PRIMARY SOURCES (E.G., BOOKS) FROM PEOPLE INVOLVED IN UFO RESEARCH AT THETIME. Many of the primary sources from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s are hard to comeby. Still, with some effort, it is possible to track down the key sources. Therewere three organizations of the period that collected significant UFO data. Theyare: (1) Project Blue Book (formerly Projects Sign and Grudge), which wasconducted by the United States Air Force; (2) the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization (APRO), a global organization founded by Jim and Coral Lorenzen;and (3) the National Investigative Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), ledby retired Marine Corps Major Donald Keyhoe. The records of these organizationsare not especially accessible. Blue Book’s records are available for a fee atthe National Archives in Washington, D.C. APRO’s records were never published ina systematic form and have been unavailable for years. NICAP’s files ended up atthe Center for UFO Studies in Chicago, but have never been published.There are books that have made use of the above sources. Many Blue Book caseswere distilled by Air Force Captain Edward Ruppelt and astronomer Allen Hynek.Ruppelt headed Blue Book in the early 1950s; his Report on Unidentified FlyingObjects (1956) derived heavily from Blue Book files and was amplified by hisaccount of military and government attitudes toward the UFO problem. Hynek wrotetwo books based on his twenty years of affiliation with Blue Book. In addition,the complete list of Blue Book unknowns is available at several Internet sites.9[index_split_254.html#filepos1418945] Two Internet sites with complete listingsof Blue Book unknowns are available.10 [index_split_254.html#filepos1419079]Much of APRO’s work was published in the many books of its founders, Jim andCoral Lorenzen. All are valuable and most are difficult to find. Many NICAPreports are available through the extremely rare UFO Evidence, which NICAPpublished in 1964. Besides this, the writings of NICAP director Donald Keyhoecontain a wealth of information. It surely helped that Keyhoe was friend andassociate to prominent figures in the American military and intelligencecommunity.It is true that Keyhoe and the Lorenzens made their share of mistakes, andHynek’s writings are often self-serving and coy (until his “conversion” to theUFO cause during the mid-1960s, Hynek was held in low regard by many UFOresearchers for his servility to the air force). Still, these writers offeredsome of the best information we will ever have on this period. Read with care,they and other early writers about UFOs remain indispensable sources ofinformation."},{"pageContent":"3. CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARSHIP. There is quite a lot of good scholarship on this subject, in book form and onthe Internet. While most of it is not historical writing, per se, it remainsvaluable. For years, the best genuine history of the subject was The UFOControversy in America (1975), by Temple University historian David Jacobs. Itstwo major drawbacks are its time of publication, which preceded the greatrelease of UFO data through FOIA, and its paucity of information about the U.S.intelligence community. Jerome Clark’s three-volume UFO Encyclopedia is anotherimportant resource for the serious reader. Although I disagree with someinterpretations offered by Clark, his work is valuable. Other useful books areindicated in the bibliography.The waters of UFO research are deep, and I have tried not to lose my footing.Throughout, I have been careful never to veer far from established facts.

If there are other answers,then this book should clarify some of the key patterns involved.Unfortunately, those patterns leave little cause for optimism regarding eitherthe problem or its response. Americans are in a bad enough state trying tostruggle through the ordinary smoke of their official culture. How can they beexpected to assess the implications of the UFO problem? They can begin only byrecognizing that secrecy over UFOs exists, and that this secrecy is part of abroader policy of control and deception.

A steady stream ofreports—stories might be a better word—appears through the centuries, some ofthem suggestive of modern reports. Of course, most of these stories were notabout spaceships, although some of them were. Rather, people interpreted whatthey saw in the terms and concepts they knew best: they saw fiery wheels orchariots in the sky, conversed with fairy folk, or had visions of God, angels,and demons.1 [index_split_255.html#filepos1419539] While the accounts arecertainly worth collecting, there is not much we can do with them other thanreflect on the possibilities they suggest. Ultimately, they remain just stories.Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the number of these stories spikedupward. Whether this means that more weird events were really taking place, orsimply that more people were noticing them, is anybody’s guess. Even today, someof these reports make for interesting reading. The London Times of September 26,1870, for example, described a strange elliptical object that crossed the faceof the moon. In November 1882, astronomer E. W. Maunder, a member of the RoyalObservatory staff at Greenwich, noted “a strange celestial visitor” in hisobservational report. Others also saw this object, which they described astorpedo- or spindle-shaped. Years later Maunder said the object looked exactlylike a zeppelin, except that there were no zeppelins in 1882.2[index_split_255.html#filepos1419848] Sightings were widespread for the rest ofthe decade, occurring in Mexico, Turkey, Nova Scotia (a five-minute sighting inwhich shipmates saw a huge red object rise from the ocean, pause, and fly offrapidly), New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, and elsewhere.In 1897, the United States experienced the first modern wave of sightings. Thesewere the “airships” which first appeared in San Francisco in late 1896 and movedeastward.3 [index_split_255.html#filepos1419996] Thousands of people, includingastronomers, saw them, which typically had lights (usually red, green, orwhite), moved slowly, and seemed to be under intelligent control. Sometimesvoices could be heard, whether in English or something unintelligible. On a fewoccasions, people claimed to see their occupants, and even to speak with them.Such outlandish sightings got some press. The New York Herald-Tribune describeda sighting in Chicago on April 9, 1897, that lasted from 8 P.M. until 2 A.M.:> Thousands of amazed persons declared that the lights seen in the northwest> were those of an airship, or some floating object, miles above the earth....> Some declared that they could distinguish two cigar-shaped objects and great> wings. Two giant searchlights apparently illuminated the object. Other, far stranger,incidents occurred. Explanations included many of the standard culprits of laterages: mass hallucination and hysteria, experimental aircraft (private, notmilitary), opium-induced dreams, hoaxes, or all of the above.The 1897 airship sightings were the most remarkable of the pre-1940s era. Butother noteworthy UFO events also took place, including one in western China in1926 by the party of explorer Nicholas Roerich. In his book, Altai—Himalaya,Roerich described the sighting as an “interesting occurrence.” As he related,his party noticed a high-flying shiny object. The group brought “three powerfulfield glasses” and watched a “huge spheroid body shining in the sun, clearlyvisible against the blue sky, and moving very fast.” Roerich and his party werecertain they saw something real. What was it? What would be flying like that inthe western China desert—in 1926? No answer ever emerged.4[index_split_255.html#filepos1420220]These early reports are intriguing, but offer few avenues for further research.UFOs appeared sporadically, elicited minimal response from the public andauthorities, and were promptly forgotten. One wonders, in any event, what kindof response would have been possible?The Second World War changed all this. Before the war, airplanes were scarce andradar nonexistent—by the war’s end, both were global. In other words, it becamemuch, much easier to detect strange aerial phenomena after 1940. Since militarypersonnel were the main users of radar and airplanes, they might naturally beexpected to encounter more UFOs than the average person—and they most certainlydid. Let us take a moment to review some key developments of the Americanmilitary and national security establishment."},{"pageContent":"THE NATIONAL SECURITY CONNECTION When UFO skeptics claim that hiding something as significant as alien visitationis impossible, they should study some of the secrets that were kept for many,many years. A veritable secrecy industry exists in the modern world, completewith its own standard operating procedures and tricks of the trade.The granddaddy of all secret projects was the Manhattan Project, the program todesign and build an atomic bomb during the Second World War. More than any otherprogram, it helped to forge the American military-industrial establishment, andserved as a model for future secret projects. One of its key contributions wasits secret—or black—budget. When President Roosevelt learned that such a weaponmight be feasible, the best guess was that it would cost $100 million. Theactual cost ballooned to a mammoth $2.19 billion, over twenty times the originalestimate. Getting that much money through traditional means (i.e., congressionalapproval) raised the dual problem of asking Congress to authorize outlays thatwere unprecedented while at the same time alerting the enemy to the Allies’ mostimportant military weapon. The money, therefore, had to be hidden from Congress.Roosevelt told his science advisor, Vannevar Bush, he could draw upon hiddenfunding, “a special source available for such an unusual expense.” Most of themoney for the project was disguised in two line items in the military budget,and the rest was buried in other appropriations. The secrecy of the ManhattanProject was so remarkable that when the scientists at Los Alamos laboratoryexploded an atomic device on U.S. soil in July 1945, the most decisivescientific achievement in human history, no one in the country knew a thing.5[index_split_255.html#filepos1420355]The Manhattan Project showed that the U.S. defense establishment could keep asecret. There were several others, such as its research into biological weapons,the interception of domestic cable transmissions, the wiretapping and bugging ofFirst Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and much more. But the military had no monopolywhen it came to spying against American citizens. Indeed, no organization hadthe kind of open-ended mandate bequeathed to the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation. In 1940, Roosevelt authorized the FBI, directed by theobsessively paranoid J. Edgar Hoover, to engage in electronic eavesdroppingagainst political spies, saboteurs, or merely suspicious individuals. This orderbecame the basic document that permitted later presidents to wiretap.Thirty-five years later, Attorney General Levi testified that the FBI installed2,465 microphones (bugs) against American citizens from 1940 to 1975, nearly allof which required break-ins. This total derives only from the FBI files thatremained intact after Hoover’s death in 1972—much had been destroyed. Hooveralso systematically collected blackmail information against members of Congress,a substantial and secret effort that lasted for decades.6[index_split_255.html#filepos1420496]Compared with the wartime activities of the military or FBI, the birth of theOffice of Strategic Services (OSS) might seem a humble affair. It was not.Forerunner to the CIA, the OSS owed its existence to the great failure ofAmerican intelligence: the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Roosevelt established it onJune 13, 1942, and placed Gen. William “Wild Bill” Donovan at its head. Themission of the OSS was to gather intelligence, but it soon became famous for itssuccess in special operations, just as the CIA did in the post-war period. TheOSS earned its romantic reputation from a long list of wartime successes,including its work with resistance movements in France, Italy, Greece,Yugoslavia, and elsewhere.7 [index_split_255.html#filepos1420745]The OSS successes prompted Donovan in late 1944 to plan the creation of anAmerican central intelligence authority headed by himself. Hoover, however, sawthe plan as a threat to his own ambitions (at the time, he was runningintelligence operations throughout the Western Hemisphere). Hoover obtainedcopies of Donovan’s memo and leaked them to a Chicago Tribune reporter inJanuary 1945. End of plan. Donovan also faced opposition from the Joint Chiefsof Staff, which pigeonholed his plan. The OSS was an upstart, and with so manycompetitors in the American intelligence community, the birth of the CIA was noforegone conclusion.Secretive, competitive, lawbreaking, and at times paranoid—into precisely thisworld was the UFO problem thrust. The very organizations of the new nationalsecurity apparatus became those groups responsible for dealing with UFOs. Oftenthe same people were involved, a pattern that recurs throughout the scope ofthis study.Closely related to the world of intelligence was the world of science. TheSecond World War changed forever the relationship of professional scientists tothe state. Shortly after its conclusion, half of all scientists and technicalpersonnel in America were working for the Defense Department. The result was notonly the most incredible leap in weapons development in human history, but aleap in power for scientists themselves. Men who had had to scrape for money inthe 1930s now found themselves in positions of prestige, often above that ofmilitary leaders.8 [index_split_255.html#filepos1420921]“Power scientists” were actively involved not only in the Manhattan Project andother secret projects such as Paperclip (which imported German scientists afterthe war), but in the UFO problem. Scientific names that cropped up in connectionwith one project were often tied to another. Names like Bush, Berkner, Bronk,Teller, Sarnoff, Page, Robertson, and Goudsmit would soon intersect with the UFOproblem at some key juncture, and all were involved in other projects involvingextreme levels of secrecy, always in close collaboration with military groups.It is a matter of significance that such men of science, power, and secrecywould become interested in the problem of unidentified flying objects."},{"pageContent":"FOO FIGHTERS Even today, little is known about foo fighters, the bizarre aerial phenomenaencountered by pilots of all countries during the war. Still, researchers overthe years have collected enough information to describe some strange goings-on.Perhaps the earliest foo fighter report, a tame affair, dates from September1941. In the early morning hours of a clear night out in the Indian Ocean, asailor aboard the SS Pulaski, a Polish vessel converted for the Britishmilitary, saw “a strange globe glowing with greenish light about half the sizeof the full moon as it appears to us.” He alerted a gunner, and the two watchedthe object as it followed them for the next hour.9[index_split_255.html#filepos1421056]A not-so-tame incident occurred in Los Angeles on February 25, 1942. That night,a number of unidentified craft flew over the city and seemingly caused ablackout. At least a million residents awoke to air raid sirens at 2:25 A.M.,and U.S. Army personnel fired 1,430 rounds of antiaircraft shells to bring downwhat they assumed were Japanese planes. But these were not Japanese planes.George Marshall wrote a memorandum to President Roosevelt about the incident,which remained classified until 1974. Marshall concluded that conventionalaircraft were involved, probably “commercial sources, operated by enemy agentsfor purposes of spreading alarm, disclosing locations of antiaircraft positions,and slowing production through blackout.” Despite the barrage of Americanantiaircraft fire, none of these “commercial” planes were brought down, althoughseveral homes and buildings were destroyed, and six civilian deaths wereattributed to the barrage. Considering the carnage, the military’s explanationwas meager. U.S. Navy Secretary Knox even denied that any aircraft had been overthe city; he called the incident a false alarm due to war nerves. The localpress, needless to say, idid not take this very well. The Long Beach Independentnoted that: “There is a mysterious reticence about the whole affair and itappears some form of censorship is trying to halt discussion of the matter.” Itis noteworthy that for thirty years, until the release of the Marshallmemorandum, the Department of Defense claimed to have no record of the event.10[index_split_255.html#filepos1421194] Five years before Roswell, the militarywas already learning to clamp down on UFOs.The very next day after “The Battle of Los Angeles,” the crew of the DutchCruiser Tromp in the Timor Sea saw “a large, illuminated disc approaching atterrific speed.” The object circled above the ship for three or four hours, thenflew off at an estimated speed of 3,000 to 3,500 mph. Obviously, the officer onduty could not identify the object as any known aircraft.11[index_split_255.html#filepos1421367]Many similar, baffling sightings occurred throughout the war. An RAF bomber overZuider Zee in Holland in March 1942 saw a luminous orange disc or spherefollowing the plane, about one hundred or two hundred yards away. The tailgunner fired some rounds—no effect—and the object departed at 1,000 mph. OnAugust 12, 1942, a U.S. Marine sergeant in the Pacific saw a formation of about150 objects, no wings or tails, wobbling slightly, not Japanese planes. Hecalled it “the most awe-inspiring and yet frightening spectacle I have ever seenin my life.”12 [index_split_255.html#filepos1421530] On August 29, 1942, an ArmyAir Corps control tower operator named Michael Solomon in Columbus, Mississippi,saw two round reddish objects descend near the AAC flying school, hover,accelerate, and speed away.13 [index_split_255.html#filepos1421669]Such sightings continued through 1943 and 1944. In November 1944, a B-17 pilotin Austria reported being paced by an amber-colored, disc-shaped object. InJanuary 1945, a pilot with the 415th Night Fighter Squadron was followed bythree red and white lighted objects which followed his evasive maneuvers. InFrance that month, an American pilot reported being paced by an object at around360 mph before it “zoomed up into the sky.” In March 1945, while in the AleutianIslands, fourteen sailors aboard the U.S. attack transport Delarof saw a darksphere rise out of the ocean, follow a curved trajectory, and fly away aftercircling their ship.14 [index_split_255.html#filepos1421806]The last significant foo fighter sighting occurred in the Pacific, and nearlybrought down an American plane. On August 28, 1945, less than three weeks afterthe atomic bombings and Japanese surrender, twelve 5th Air Force intelligencespecialists aboard a C-46 flew toward Tokyo in advance of the occupation forces.As the plane approached Iwo Jima at ten thousand feet, the crew saw threeteardrop-shaped objects, brilliantly white—“like burning magnesium” —and closingon a parallel course to the plane. The navigational needles went wild, the leftengine faltered and spurted oil, the plane lost altitude, and the crew preparedto ditch. Then, in a close formation, the objects faded into a cloud bank. Atthat moment, the plane’s engines restarted, and the crew safely flew on. One ofthe plane’s passengers was future UFO researcher Leonard Stringfield.15[index_split_255.html#filepos1421947]One would expect that events such as these warranted an investigation, and thatis what they received. There were at least two official American investigationsof foo fighters. The U.S. 8th Air Force, under the command of General JamesDoolittle, conducted a study, although no copy of it has come to light. Thereport is said to have concluded that the sightings were possibly Axisexperimental weapons, static electricity charges, misidentification of ordinarysights, or some kind of “mass hallucination.” The young OSS also investigatedthe phenomenon. At first its investigators believed the sightings to be Germanexperimental craft, but soon discounted that theory. Donovan and his staffapparently settled on the notion that the objects, if that is what they could becalled, were unusual but harmless. The New York Times published a story on foofighters on January 2, 1945, under the title, “Balls of Fire Stalk U.S. Fightersin Night Assaults over Germany.” The article suggested German “sky weapons” asthe culprit. None of the American investigators knew that the Germans andJapanese had encountered the same unusual phenomena, and had explained them assecret Allied weapons.16 [index_split_255.html#filepos1422093]It is not known whether American interest in foo fighters continued after thewar. Quite possibly, foo fighters got lost in the shuffle. After all, nocasualties resulted, and none of the objects showed clearly hostile activity.Much can get lost in something as big as the Second World War. But it remainspuzzling that over fifty years later, no one really knows what the military orOSS thought about the strange foo fighters.For a while after the war, stories of foo fighters remained submerged, thesubject of discussion among veterans who had encountered them but not talkedabout openly. During the 1950s, the well-connected UFO investigator Maj. DonaldE. Keyhoe collected foo fighter reports and said that “hundreds” of foo fighterswere encountered by American, British, German, and Japanese pilots. One of hissources claimed to have a dozen or so reports that Pacific gunners fired atstrange objects circling their ships.17 [index_split_255.html#filepos1422511]Considering what little about foo fighters has slipped out, such reports couldwell be true. Unfortunately, we will probably never know. Reports like Keyhoe’sand Stringfield’s lack official sanction, and for that reason elicit mere shrugsand smiles from the military and press—that is, when they are not simplyignored, which is the rule."},{"pageContent":"GHOST ROCKETS The puzzling foo fighter sightings of the war had scarcely ended when a new waveof aerial sightings took place. In the spring of 1946, the Scandinaviancountries began witnessing an impressive spectacle of luminous objects zippingthrough their skies, night after night, and at times during the day. Swedenremained the center of action throughout, with additional heavy activity inFinland, Norway, and Denmark. By late summer, the phenomenon had spreadthroughout Europe and beyond, to places such as Portugal, France, Tangier,Italy, Greece, and even India. Witnesses eventually numbered in the tens ofthousands. This was a serious development, and indications are that the Americanmilitary watched it closely.Many sightings were of elongated, cigar-shaped objects. On May 24, 1946, at 2A.M., for example, several Swedish witnesses saw a wingless cigar-shaped object,a scant three hundred feet above the ground, spurting “bunches of sparks” fromits tail. The object moved at the speed of an ordinary airplane. On thethirty-first, just before noon, a wingless, huge metallic cigar was seen movingrapidly at about one thousand feet altitude.18[index_split_255.html#filepos1422659] From these kinds of descriptions, theobjects acquired the name of “ghost rockets.” It soon became clear, however,that these could not be conventional rockets. In the first place, they left noexhaust trail. Second, they were almost always silent. Third, many of them movedtoo slowly to be rockets. Fourth, they were often seen in formation, breakingformation, maneuvering, or hovering. Finally, the longest trajectory recorded byobservers was one thousand kilometers : this was three times the range of theGerman V rockets. Strange rockets, for sure.Still, the Swedes, Americans, British, and other interested parties (whichincluded just about everybody) looked into the possibility that these wereSoviet missiles of some sort, constructed with the help of their cache of Germanscientists from Peenemunde, home of the V rockets. Even then, most investigatorsrealized this was unlikely, but few could rule it out completely.Americans were most likely to blame the Soviets. On July 11, 1946, a member ofthe American Embassy in Stockholm actually saw a ghost rocket and sent atelegram to Washington:> One landed on beach near Stockholm... without causing any damage and,> according to press, fragments are now being studied by military> authorities.... If missiles are of Soviet origin as generally believed (some> reports say they are launched from Estonia), purpose might be political to> intimidate Swedes ....19 [index_split_255.html#filepos1422798] This is an important development: here is a clear statement that fragments werecollected and studied. Who had them, and what were they? If the fragments werenot Soviet, perhaps they were from a meteor, as some have later asserted.20[index_split_255.html#filepos1422978] Still, conclusive evidence remainslacking.Many people assumed the ghost rockets were meteors. On July 19, the Frenchnewspaper Resistance wrote about them as “bright meteors traveling at fantasticspeeds across [Swedish] skies.” However, on July 25, a Swedish defense staffspokesman told newspapers, “[That] they are meteors in every case is a theorywhich has been rejected without further ado.” Two days later, a French newspaperdescribed the objects as rocket-propelled projectiles and said that over fivehundred of them had been seen over Sweden since the beginning of July. The sheernumber of occurrences suggested a serious national security concern.21[index_split_255.html#filepos1423294]Needless to say, the ghost rockets were the topic of conversation in Sweden. OnAugust 8, the chief of Swedish Air Defense, Gen. Nils Ahlgren, stated that someof the objects were seen at low altitudes, many maneuvered in half-circles, andmost appeared to come from the south. On August 11, the Swedish military issueda press release acknowledging that the objects had become a common occurrence. ANew York Times article described Stockholm as “near the boiling point.”22[index_split_255.html#filepos1423473] On the thirteenth, it reported that “theSwedish General staff... described the situation as ‘extremely dangerous,’ andit is obvious that Sweden no longer is going to tolerate such violations.” TheGeneral staff noted, for example, that they received more than a thousandreports of “rocket bombs” from the night before and that very morning. Oneastronomer evidently saw one such “bomb.” It was at least ninety feet long, hesaid, exploded without a sound only a mile and a half away, and gave “a terrificlight” that “for a moment blinded me. No fire, no smoke or sparks werenoticeable.”23 [index_split_255.html#filepos1423636]On August 13, American General James Doolittle and David Sarnoff arrived inStockholm. Doolittle, it will be recalled, had recently headed the American 8thAir Force’s investigation of foo fighters, a fact unknown to the public.Doolittle said he was in Sweden merely as a private citizen on behalf of his newemployer, Shell Oil Company. Sarnoff, of RCA, was one of the world’s leadingelectronics experts, a pioneer in radio and television, and had been a brigadiergeneral during the war. Upon consulting with the highest Swedish authorities onthe ghost rockets, they learned that some objects had been tracked on radar.Unfortunately, little else is known about the Doolittle-Sarnoff trip or whatconclusions they reached. What is clear, though, is that soon after theirarrival, the Swedish government clamped down on ghost rocket information. That,in turn, coincided with an upsurge in interest by prominent Americans. The NewYork Times, for example, mentioned that American Undersecretary of State DeanAcheson was personally interested in the matter, although he maintained that theU.S. government was never consulted officially on the subject. Were Doolittleand Sarnoff “loose cannons,” acting on their own? This seems doubtful. Mostlikely, Doolittle and Sarnoff were acting on behalf of the U.S. government underthe cover of private citizens. 24 [index_split_255.html#filepos1423779]On the fifteenth, Swedish authorities disclosed that they came upon a fragmentof metal less than three inches long and with letters on it. If this ever helpedto solve the mystery, the answer is not publicly known. A week later, on August22, Sweden’s defense staff announced it had obtained radar results, and thatthey would soon identify the source and nature of the rockets. In the meantime,they issued a ban of information “limited to any mention of where the rocketshave been seen to land or explode.” In Norway, where the activity was onlyslightly less intense, the Norwegian General staff asked the press not tomention any appearance of the “rockets” over Norwegian territory, but instead toreport them to the Intelligence Command of the High Command. The Danish militarysoon followed suit.25 [index_split_255.html#filepos1423936]Let us pause for a moment to reflect on the significance of rockets that were“seen to land.” Invading one’s airspace was serious enough, but landings-ifthese were indeed controlled landings—were a problem of an entirely differentmagnitude. In the first place, it would rule out natural phenomena. Second, itwould point to piloted craft, assuming we are talking about human technology—in1946, an object that landed had to be piloted. But what human agency could havepiloted these objects? No viable candidates ever emerged. What did the militaryauthorities think about this? We do not know.While the Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes investigated and clamped down, Britainand America provided assistance. On August 23, British radar experts, back fromSweden, submitted secret reports to the British government on the origin of therockets. Their conclusion: the objects were not of Soviet origin. The scientificadvisor to MI6, Prof. R. V Jones, found it doubtful that “the Russians weresupposedly cruising their flying bombs at more than twice the range that theGermans had achieved.” On September 9, the British Air Ministry’s Directorate ofIntelligence (Research) summarized the main features of the ghost rocketphenomenon and included eight types of sightings. Some Americans remainedsteadfast in their belief that the ghost rockets were a Russian ploy tointimidate the Swedes. On August 29, the American Embassy in Stockholm sent aTop Secret message to the State Department in Washington:> While over eight hundred reports have been received and new reports come> daily, Swedes still have no tangible evidence. Full details of reports thus> far received have been forwarded to Washington by our military and naval> attaches. My own source is personally convinced some foreign power is actually> experimenting over Sweden and he guesses it is Russia.26> [index_split_255.html#filepos1424111] Within Sweden, explanations were conventional. Some scientists blamed masshallucinations, others meteorological balloons, others were openly puzzled.Although, inevitably, the rockets became the butt of jokes, no one mentionedextraterrestrials. UFO researcher Jacques Vallee pointed out that “there doesnot seem to have been one single voice suggesting that the objects seen in 1946might have been of interplanetary origin.”27[index_split_255.html#filepos1424277]Sightings slowed down in September, but also spread to new places. Reliablewitnesses continued to see cigar-shaped objects with flames projecting from thetail, traveling at the speed of a normal or slow airplane, and giving off littlenoise except for an occasional slight whistling. In France on September 6, twoluminous globes were seen flying in a straight line. The witnesses said theobjects were not a shooting star or plane. That same day, a photograph of one ofthe Swedish ghost rockets was published in the Daily Telegraph.28[index_split_255.html#filepos1424419]The objects appeared over Greece. Projectiles were seen over Macedonia andSalonika, and one appeared to fall into the sea, according to Greek PrimeMinister Tsaldaris. Living in Greece was Dr. Paul Santorini, a physicist ofworld renown: he had helped to develop radar, fuses for the atomic bomb, and theNike missile guidance system. According to a statement Santorini made in 1967,the Greek government was seriously alarmed by the presence of the ghost rocketsover its territory, initially believing them to be Russian missiles. He claimedthat the Greek army supplied him with a team of engineers to investigate theproblem. The team’s conclusion: the ghost rockets were neither Russian normissiles. Before long, U.S. military officials pressured the Greek armycommanders into silence. In Santorini’s words, “before we could do any more, theArmy, after conferring with foreign officials, ordered the investigationstopped.” Santorini himself was closely questioned by U.S. scientists fromWashington. He later reaffirmed this statement to UFO researcher RaymondFowler.29 [index_split_255.html#filepos1424576]Back in Sweden, on October 10, the Swedish defense staff officially announcedits failure to explain the ghost rockets. After four months of inquiring intoapproximately one thousand ghost rocket reports—a number much smaller than theactual total of sightings—they said that 80 percent were some form of “celestialphenomena” such as meteors. The rest had clear, unambiguous evidence that couldnot be explained as natural phenomena, nor as Swedish aircraft, nor imaginationon the part of the observer. At least two hundred of the “rockets” were trackedon radar, and these were definitely not the V-type missiles used by the Germansduring the war. Beyond that, the Swedes gave no clues as to what they believedthe objects to be.30 [index_split_255.html#filepos1424750]The Soviets repeatedly denied they had been behind the ghost rocket sightings.Of course, the denial would be expected whatever the truth of the matter, but noevidence linking the ghost rockets to the Soviets has ever emerged.So ended the ghost rocket mystery, except for one addendum. On December 1, 1946,a Swedish report that remained classified until 1983 noted that> approximately one hundred impacts have been reported, together with fragments> from thirty of these. All have been investigated by the Defense Research> Institution. It has been impossible to make certain that any of the objects> originated as parts of projectiles or rockets; they have generally been> attributed to other sources. The committee admitted it failed to learn the nature of the rockets.31[index_split_255.html#filepos1424953] Thus, the mystery did not so much concludeas stall out."},{"pageContent":"DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLIES There is nothing to show that the ghost rockets sprung from Soviet or Germantechnology. Still, over the years, a few people have continued to speculate thatUFOs resulted from Nazi war technology.32 [index_split_255.html#filepos1425120]The theory is based on frail evidence, loose interpretation of known facts, anda great deal of speculation. The Germans had been working on some advancedaviation technology. Their V-1 and V-2 rockets are well known. Indeed, one ofthose crashed in Sweden in 1944, which let the secret out in the first place.They experimented with a disc-shaped airframe, although it led to nobreakthroughs, and even developed the first rocket-powered fighter plane, theMe-163, which was effective but limited in supply. Less can be said for thefamed Horten flying wing design, which never made it to production (more on thislater). This German technology cannot account for the vast numbers of UFOreports, nor for the reported characteristics of the observed objects.Still, there are connections between Nazi scientists and UFOs. Not only wereNazi scientists involved in the cutting edge of American aviation and propulsiontechnology in the years after 1945, but many of them worked at installationsthat became indelibly associated with UFOs, such as Wright-Patterson Air ForceBase and White Sands Proving Ground. The project that brought these scientists,engineers, and spies into the United States became known as Paperclip. It was anexceptionally well-orchestrated web of propaganda and lies that hid their Nazipast. Military intelligence even succeeded in bringing the press on board forassistance.Within the world of intelligence, the cold war started before World War Twoended. OSS officers such as Allen Dulles realized the importance of obtainingNazi spies with Soviet expertise. With OSS/CIA money, they recruited the bulk ofHitler’s Abwehr intact. For years, in fact, this organization actually reignedas the dominant intelligence service in West Germany, before it was even legallyconstituted. Thus, an illegal, foreign-funded group held more power than theofficial West German intelligence organization.33[index_split_255.html#filepos1425428]Scientists, however, were the real prize. The competition was intense—Americans,Soviets, British, French, and even Argentines scrambled for scientists. Severalwere kidnapped, despite everyone’s denials. These German scientists, the mostprominent of them being rocketry genius Wernher von Braun, were years ahead ofAllied scientists in a number of areas, including aircraft design andchemical/biological weapons. There remained the small matter that many of themwere ardent Nazis, some wanted for war crimes. But the U.S. militaryintelligence falsified their records before putting them to work. We can assumeother countries did likewise.34 [index_split_255.html#filepos1425596]Army intelligence (G-2) countered dissent against the project through wiretapsand domestic spying, and it soon became necessary for the army to lie to theState Department on a regular basis. The press promoted a sanitized version ofthe project to the American public. In late November 1946, the War Departmentissued a five-page press release favorably describing how German scientists werehelping Americans at Wright Field. In December, Life and Newsweek gave the storynational coverage. The Nazi past of many of the scientists escaped notice, asdid the strong undercurrent of hostility many Americans at Wright Field hadtoward these “former” Nazis. All in all, it was perfectly orchestrated WarDepartment propaganda posing as news. Paperclip continued as part of Americanpolicy through the 1950s and even into the 1960s, albeit in a more limitedfashion. Congress and the public knew nothing about it for decades.35[index_split_255.html#filepos1425742]"},{"pageContent":"COMING TO AMERICA After the Second World War, much effort went into reorganizing the Americannational security establishment. In September 1945, Ferdinand Eberstadt, uponNavy Secretary James Forrestal’s request to study various military mergerproposals, recommended a “complete realignment of our governmental organizationsto serve our national security.” Truman believed he was doing his part when inthe same month he disbanded the OSS, scattering OSS personnel throughout theDepartments of State and War. No doubt Hoover was gleeful.36[index_split_255.html#filepos1425902]However, Truman soon developed second thoughts about his OSS decision. InJanuary 1946, he created a National Intelligence Authority (comprised of theSecretary of State, Secretary of War, Secretary of the Navy, and Chief of Staff)and, under it, a Central Intelligence Group (CIG)—the direct forerunner of theCIA. To head the CIG, Truman swore in old friend Rear Adm. Sidney Souers as thenation’s first director of central intelligence (DCI). The CIG’s mission was to“coordinate” information, and its operation was as modest as it was secret: ithad no spies, no legal power, and was not financed by lawful appropriations, butrather with funds secretly diverted from the armed forces budgets.37[index_split_255.html#filepos1426068]CIA historian Thomas Powers called the CIG “something of a joke.” Certainly,compared with its later growth it was. But from humble beginnings, the CIG grewrapidly. On June 10, 1946, Hoyt Vandenberg, the army’s former director ofintelligence, replaced Souers as head of CIG. By the year’s end, he enlargedCIG’s staff and won the right to collect intelligence in Latin America (althoughthe ever-jealous Hoover denied him use of the FBI’s agents or files). By the endof 1946, the CIG also obtained the authority to engage in psychological warfareand conduct covert operations. We know that some policy makers regarded theghost rockets as Soviet psychological warfare. It is plausible that covertaction policy was, at least in part, a response to the ghost rockets.38[index_split_255.html#filepos1426249]The resurrection of the OSS was not the only facet of wartime continuity. InSeptember 1945, the army’s Signal Security Agency used a combination ofarm-twisting and calls to patriotism to persuade ITT, RCA, and Western Union tocontinue its wartime cable intercept program, code-named Shamrock. This was amassive operation (albeit unknown to Congress) to intercept foreign and domesticcable transmissions. It targeted companies, governments, and private citizens,with or without grounds for suspected espionage. The army implemented it byphysically scanning the text of cables made available by the three companies,and by directly monitoring international telephone and cable traffic. After thewar, the participating companies conveyed their fears to Forrestal. After all,this was wholly illegal. Forrestal assured them that the Administration wouldsoon introduce legislation to legalize the program. True to his word, he floatedthe idea to several members of Congress, but got nowhere. Such technicalities,however, did not end Operation Shamrock, which continued in extreme secrecy forthe next thirty years. Truman appears not to have known about it, and certainlyno other president until Nixon knew. The implications are well worthpondering.39 [index_split_255.html#filepos1426431]By the end of 1946, much of America’s “invisible government” was in place, justin time to respond to a steady increase in domestic UFO sightings. There hadbeen at least one interesting American UFO sighting during the ghost rocketperiod. On August 1, 1946, Capt. Jack E. Puckett was flying a C-47 transportplane thirty miles from Tampa, Florida. Suddenly, he and his copilot saw a largeobject speeding toward them on a collision course. The object had a longcylindrical shape, which Puckett described as “twice the size of a B-29 bomber.”He claimed to see a row of portholes. The object trailed a stream of fire halfits length, and disappeared at the incredible speed of 1,500 to 2,000 mph.40[index_split_255.html#filepos1426611]The defense establishment was secretly receiving UFO reports from its militaryno later than January 1947. On January 16, 1947, an army air force plane had along chase over the North Sea at twenty-two thousand feet. A classified memowrote that “the unidentified craft appeared to take efficient, controlledevasive action.” A month later, in the afternoon of February 28, 1947, an airforce jet pilot, a Lieutenant Armstrong, flying thirty miles north of LakeMeade, Nevada, saw a formation of five or six white discs at an altitude of sixthousand feet. Throughout the spring of 1947, sightings of disc-like objectsoccurred sporadically throughout the United States, including at least one thatwas observed through a theodolite (a small telescope that pivots in twodirections to give accurate sighting angles, and is used for accurate trackingof airborne objects). Several of these sightings were later investigated by theFBI and air force intelligence.41 [index_split_255.html#filepos1426768]On May 1, 1947, Rear Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter replaced Hoyt Vandenberg asDCI. Hillenkoetter was an Annapolis graduate who spoke three languages, had beenat Pearl Harbor, and had set up an intelligence network for Adm. Chester WNimitz. He was also a friend and Annapolis classmate of future UFO researcherDonald E. Keyhoe. One of the interesting, ignored tidbits of American history isthe fact that, from 1957 until 1962, Hillenkoetter sat on the board of directorsof the country’s leading civilian UFO organization, the National InvestigativeCommittee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). For some reason, historians of Americannational security and the cold war do not find this interesting. Why, we mayask, did a CIA director who held the post for three years—during some of themost dramatic moments of the cold war—become interested in NICAP, and even makepublic statements regarding the need to end UFO secrecy? Was Hillenkoetter“eccentric”? Was he spreading disinformation? Was he sincere? What did he knowabout UFOs? Professional historians, taking the road most traveled, do not askthese questions, or indeed any questions regarding Hillenkoetter and UFOs, eventhough the most cursory review of the man’s career clamors for such treatment."},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY A process began during the war years which gained momentum during 1946 and 1947.This concerned the ability of human beings to detect and do something about anage-old phenomenon: UFOs. Such a development required the growth of a large andtechnologically sophisticated national security apparatus. After all, until the1940s, the only way to detect UFOs had been by looking up at the sky. Moreover,there had been nothing one could do about such things. By the war’s end, thiswas no longer the case. On the contrary, the emerging cold war required extremediligence by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the other major militariesof the world to monitor their national borders against unauthorized intrusions.By mid-1947, the reorganization and expansion of America’s national securityapparatus was well under way, and a fair portion of this remained covert. Itshould not be surprising, therefore, that the UFO problem emerged within theAmerican military before it became a public issue. Yet, on the eve of theKenneth Arnold sighting, no one could have foreseen just how big the UFO problemwould become."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2 Saucers in the Skies: 1947 > The first rule in keeping secrets is “nothing on paper.”—CIA Director Richard Helms "},{"pageContent":"CRESCENDO In the summer of 1947, flying saucer mania spread across America. Millions ofpeople read about strange objects that were seen throughout the country andseemed to defy the standard rules of flight. Were flying saucers some odd,unknown natural phenomenon? Were they mechanical objects, and if so, whose? Acommunist stratagem? War nerves? Hoaxes? A new fad? Rubbish? Everyone wondered,no one knew.Before Kenneth Arnold sparked the flying saucer frenzy on June 24, there hadbeen a steady buildup of odd things in the sky. On June 2, 1947, a UFO sightingoccurred at Rehoboth, Delaware, which the air force investigated. Not much isknown about it: the case is missing from the Blue Book files, although in theoryBlue Book was the comprehensive repository of unidentified sightings reported tothe air force. The air force also investigated a Weiser, Idaho, report from June12, describing two strange, fast-moving objects. Around noon on thetwenty-first, residents of Spokane, Washington, reported eight disc-shapedobjects about the size of a house, said to be flying at around 600 mph. Theobjects then fell with a “dead leaf” motion, landing on the shore of the SaintJoe River in Idaho before ten witnesses. On the twenty-third, in Cedar Rapids,Iowa, a railroad engineer saw ten shiny, fluttering disc-shaped objects in aline high in the sky. That same day, pilot Richard Rankin saw a formation of tenobjects in Bakersfield, California, flying north. They, too, seemed to bedisc-like, with a diameter of about one hundred feet, flying in formation at agood speed, anywhere from 300 to 600 mph. Dick Rankin was a respected pilot withover seven thousand hours of flight-time experience. His sighting remainsunidentified.1 [index_split_256.html#filepos1427063]These sightings, all by civilians, eventually gained some publicity. But theseries of sightings which began that month at the Oak Ridge nuclear facility inTennessee remained unknown to the public for years. Oak Ridge was the atomictesting facility for the Atomic Energy Commission, housing some of the world’smost sophisticated technology. In 1947, nuclear technology was cutting edge, andthe U.S. government severely restricted access to it. Violating the airspaceover Oak Ridge was a very serious matter. And yet something, according to adeclassified FBI document, without authorization flew over Oak Ridge that June(another FBI document mentioned July). This object was photographed by acivilian employee, a resident engineer with Air Material Command. A 1949 FBImemo to Hoover discussing this noted that at least twenty-four copies of thephotograph had been made, and said that an unnamed source asked the employee torecover all of them and bring them to air force intelligence. He complied.According to the FBI document, the witness “further stated that [blacked out]had appeared extremely concerned over the matter and seemed quite emphatic thatthe matter should be given no more publicity than was absolutely necessary.”UFO sightings over Oak Ridge continued with great frequency during the late1940s and beyond. A number of them were radar and visual cases, although theradar and visuals were reported from different locations. The events causedgreat concern at the FBI Field Office in Knoxville, the U.S. Third Army, and theAtomic Energy Commission’s security division at Oak Ridge. A classified FBIreport from November 1950 listed a recent spate of sightings over the facilityin a chronological summary.2 [index_split_256.html#filepos1427319]"},{"pageContent":"THE FLOODGATES OPEN The skies were becoming busy, yet all was quiet. The dam broke on June 24. Onthat day, pilot and businessman Kenneth Arnold from Boise, Idaho, was flyingnear Mount Rainier, Washington, in search of a downed C-46 Marine transport anda sizable reward. He saw a “tremendously bright flash” and noticed a formationof nine bright, extremely fast objects moving along in a column. He was startledbecause he saw no tail on the objects. At first he thought they must beexperimental jets and that the air force was using camouflage to hide the tails.He said “they flew in a definite formation” but “backward” (with the first craftelevated more than the others). “Their flight was like speed boats on roughwater” or “like a saucer would if you skipped it across water.” He estimatedtheir size to be about one hundred feet in diameter. Arnold was struck by howfast the objects seemed to be moving, so he decided to measure their speed asthey passed between Rainier’s peak and another peak he knew to be fifty milesaway. They covered this distance in one minute and forty-two seconds—a speed of1,700 mph! Arnold could not accept his own calculations, the speed was just toofast. He reworked his calculations, allowing for all possible errors, andarrived at the still-incredible speed of 1,200 mph. In 1947, no flying craftcould reach much more than half that speed.Arnold gave up on the C-46, flew to Yakima, and told his story. One pilot said,“It’s just a flight of those guided missiles from Moses Lake.” Arnold wasunconvinced and flew on to Pendleton, Oregon, unaware that someone at Yakima hadtelephoned ahead to report his strange encounter. When he arrived, a large crowdon hand for an air show was waiting for him. A discussion followed, and Arnoldwarmed to the idea of guided missiles. Speaking to the East Oregonian, he was“fairly convinced that it was some new government invention along the line ofguided missiles.”The next day, the East Oregonian ran the first flying saucer story under theheadline “Impossible! Maybe, But Seein’ Is Believin’, Says Flier.” The story hitthe AP wire and made page one of the Chicago Daily Tribune. The phrase“saucer-like” quickly became “flying saucers,” and Arnold was flooded with phonecalls and requests for interviews. Kenneth Arnold’s sighting has never beenexplained satisfactorily, although UFO debunker Donald Menzel tried to do soseveral times.As people began talking about flying saucers, it became apparent that Arnold’ssighting had not been the first. In fact, there were many other sightings fromthe twenty-fourth, most from the Pacific Northwest. Within the hour of Arnold’ssighting, an Oregon prospector named Fred Johnson saw five or six “round,metallic-looking discs” through a telescope over the Cascade Mountains. As theycircled overhead, they disrupted his compass needle. Johnson insisted he had notheard of the Arnold report, which was not broadcast until early evening. Helater wrote about the incident to the air force and was interviewed by the FBI,which judged him “very reliable.”3 [index_split_256.html#filepos1427522]The day after Arnold’s sighting, people in Kansas City, Oklahoma City, andPueblo, Colorado, reported sightings of “flying discs.” All of these involvedseveral objects flying in loose formations. Sightings were also being made inCanada, Australia, and New Zealand. On June 27, Army Air Force Public RelationsOfficer Captain Tom Brown stated the army had “no idea what they are.”4[index_split_256.html#filepos1427911] In mid-afternoon of the twenty-eighth, anarmy air force pilot in an F-51 flying near Lake Meade, Nevada, saw a formationof five or six circular objects off his right wing.

It zigzaggedwith bursts of high speed.5 [index_split_256.html#filepos1428094] On June 29, atWhite Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, a naval rocket expert, Dr. C. J. John,along with two fellow scientists, saw a silvery disc. He reported the sightingto the army with the observation:> We noticed a glare in the sky. We looked up and saw a silvery disc whirling> along. We watched the thing for nearly sixty seconds and then it simply> disappeared. It didn’t go behind the mountain range.

The objectslooked about ten feet in diameter and seemed to land about twenty-five milessouth of the canyon.7 [index_split_256.html#filepos1428463]A mere week after the Arnold sighting, flying saucers seemed to be engulfingAmerica. The Pacific Northwest had the heaviest concentration of activity.Newspaper coverage of flying saucers was intense, and interesting sightingsoccurred into July. On the first of the month, an Albuquerque Chamber ofCommerce official saw a “disc-like, bluish object following a zigzag path in thenorthwestern sky” over New Mexico. Another report from New Mexico came from theNavajo reservation in the northwestern part of the state. Flying saucer reportscame from the east, too. Meteorologist E. E. Unger, who ran the U.S. WeatherBureau at Louisville, Kentucky, believed he saw one. In eastern Canada, fourpeople on Prince Edward Island saw objects “traveling at great speed high in thesky.” One witness described them as “shapeless, but glistening in thesunlight.”8 [index_split_256.html#filepos1428602]On July 3, an astronomer in South Brookville, Maine, saw a UFO about one hundredfeet in diameter. Air Material Command publicly explained it as birds orinsects, although the air force’s Project Grudge later listed the sighting as an“unusually well-supported incident” with no explanation. That evening in Denver,several people reported seeing “projectiles” variously described as “too fastfor an airplane and not fast enough for a falling star,” “not moving at all,”and “traveling at great speed.”9 [index_split_256.html#filepos1428779]Activity increased yet more on Friday, July 4. One sighting that occurred nearBoise, Idaho, received a great deal of attention, since the objects werewitnessed by Capt. Edward J. Smith and his copilot, Ralph Stevens, of UnitedAirlines. Smith was a highly regarded pilot with much experience in the air.While en route to Portland, Smith and Stevens saw nine disc-like objects.Smith’s stature prompted an FBI investigation into the sighting, which creditedhim as reliable. In Portland, many people, including police officers, saw alarge number of UFOs in the middle of the afternoon, in formation and alone. InRedmond, Oregon, a car full of people saw four disc-shaped UFOs streak pastMount Jefferson. In Seattle, a Coast Guard yeoman took the first publicly knownphotograph of a UFO, a circular object moving against the wind. The photo showeda round dot of light.10 [index_split_256.html#filepos1428959]"},{"pageContent":"MAKING SENSE OF IT It is easy to see why flying saucers elicited such strong interest. Here wereclearly seen objects that did not look like airplanes, and often moved atincredible speeds. Were they even real? If so, what could they be? The mostwidely discussed possibilities were experimental military craft (Arnold’sinitial opinion), experimental civilian-designed craft, foreign (e.g., Soviet)craft, atmospheric and meteorological phenomena, and mass hysteria. No one wroteabout aliens.It is reasonable to assume that so many well-observed strange sightings would beof interest to the U.S. military. Publicly, however, the military’s attitude wasvaried. A July 3 article said the Air Research Center at Wright Field waslooking into the matter, “and all service intelligence agencies are at work onthem.” According to the army spokesman, “If some foreign power is sending flyingdiscs over the United States, it is our responsibility to know about it and takeproper action.” The next day, an army air force spokesman discounted the secretweapon theory—nothing in America’s possession could have caused the sightings.He dismissed the Arnold sighting as not realistic enough to deserve furtherstudy, and dismissed the whole flying saucer phenomenon. Perhaps the whole thingwas meteorological. Air Material Command, he noted, was trying at this moment todetermine that very possibility. 11 [index_split_256.html#filepos1429125]Behind the public facade, however, the military wondered about more seriousimplications. After reviewing what documents he could find a few years later,Capt. Edward Ruppelt, who for several years managed the air force’s Project BlueBook, believed the air force during this time established “a project toinvestigate and analyze” all UFO reports. He described their attitude as “astate of near panic.” Donald Keyhoe later obtained military sources who told himthat the air force at this time ordered its pilots “to down a UFO forexamination, by shooting, or by running and bailing out.” We know that the armyair force, the Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), and the FBI were all doinga great deal of field work regarding UFOs, interviewing witnesses and trying todetermine just what these things were.12 [index_split_256.html#filepos1429301]Within this context, let us move on to the most controversial event in theentire history of the UFO phenomenon, the crash at Roswell, New Mexico."},{"pageContent":"ROSWELL, ROSWELL! The debate over what crashed at Roswell has monopolized UFO researchers for ageneration.13 [index_split_256.html#filepos1429479] Something certainly fellfrom the air and crashed outside Roswell, New Mexico, during the summer of 1947.The date is disputed, but the leading candidates have generally been June 14,July 2, and July 4. Some have even placed the date in May. On Saturday, July 5,sheepherder Mac Brazel, foreman of the Foster ranch seventy-five miles fromRoswell, found crash debris. Accounts have varied as to how widely this debriswas scattered. Brazel discovered metal, plastic-like beams, lightweightmaterial, foil, and either string or “stringlike material.” Some of the materialseemed unusually lightweight and strong. Brazel spoke with his nearestneighbors, the Proctors, but they were too busy to visit his field. It appearsthat at some later point Brazel showed them some fragments, which he hadtried—and failed—to cut or burn.On Sunday, July 6, Brazel brought some of the material to Roswell to showSheriff George Wilcox. Wilcox sent two deputies out to the ranch and notifiedthe Roswell Army Air Force base. At RAAF, Col. William Blanchard, the commandingofficer of the 509th Bomb Group, ordered air intelligence officer Captain (laterMajor) Jesse Marcel to investigate. The 509th was one of the nation’s eliteunits, and the only military group in the world with atomic capability. Marcel,accompanied by Army CIC Capt. Sheridan Cavitt and Cavitt’s subordinate, MasterSgt. Lewis S. Rickett, visited Wilcox’s office and spoke with Brazel. They thenaccompanied Brazel back to the Foster ranch, where they arrived late that night.This issue is somewhat confusing because for many years Cavitt denied havingbeen to the debris field. But not only was he there, so was Rickett, who gavedetails to researchers such as Friedman and Mark Rodighier. Meanwhile, it tookan interview with Air Force Colonel Richard Weaver in 1994 to elicit aconfirmation from Cavitt that he, too, had been at the debris field.After these men left Wilcox’s office, the sheriff’s two deputies returned toRoswell without finding the debris field, although they claimed to see a burnedarea in one of the pastures, where the sand had been turned to glass. Militarypolice arrived at Wilcox’s office and collected the wreckage Brazel had leftthere.On Monday, July 7, Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining, commander of Air Material Command(AMC), flew unexpectedly to Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, then made aside trip to Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque. He remained in the area until July 11,although reporters initially had been told that Twining was “probably” inWashington, D.C. Meanwhile, Gen. Carl Spaatz, commander of the army air forces,was vacationing in the state of Washington. One wonders how much of a vacationit could have been. According to the New York Times, five P-51 Mustangs of theOregon National Guard were flying over the Cascade Mountains on an airbornealert—they were searching for the mysterious flying discs. Spaatz told reportersthat he knew nothing about the saucers or of the plans to search for them.14[index_split_256.html#filepos1430560] Whether by coincidence or design, two ofthe nation’s most important air force generals just happened to be in thenation’s two leading UFO hot spots.Regarding the Twining visit, it should be noted that a declassified documentfrom June 5, 1947, stated that Twining, Gen. Benjamin Chidlaw, and a few otherhigh-level brass were scheduled to attend a three-day temporary duty status atSandia Base in Albuquerque for a Bomb Commanders Course. This took place betweenJuly 8 and July 11. Visitor logs and secretary calendars indicate that thisgroup did take the course. But Twining was also scheduled for a trip to Boeingat this time, which he had to cancel. In a July 17 letter to a Boeing executive,Twining referred to a “very important and sudden matter that developed here.”Since Twining had not received confirmation of his clearance to attend theconference at Sandia until July 3, it is possible that this is what he wasreferring to. It is also likely, however, that the Roswell crash received hisimmediate attention.Let us now follow Jesse Marcel’s experience, as he related thirty years later.On Monday morning (the day Twining flew to New Mexico), Brazel took Marcel andCavitt out to the debris field. According to Marcel, the field wasthree-quarters of a mile long, and two to three hundred feet wide. A gouge inthe field extended for four or five hundred feet, “as if something had toucheddown and skipped along.” The debris was as thin as newsprint, but incrediblystrong. Marcel said that one soldier later told him that the metal wasunbendable and could not be dented, even with a sledgehammer. Marcel also foundfoil that, when crumpled, would unfold itself without any sign of a wrinkle, andI-beams with odd symbols on them and a pink/lavender coloration. The beamsflexed slightly but would not break.Marcel concluded that the debris was “definitely not a weather or trackingdevice, nor was it any sort of plane or missile.... It was something I had neverseen before, or since... it certainly wasn’t anything built by us.”Marcel and Cavitt collected debris at Brazel’s ranch for most of the day.According to many accounts, including that of Roswell skeptics, Lewis Rickettdrove out with Cavitt at some point. After filling Cavitt’s vehicle, Marcel toldCavitt to go on ahead and meet him back at Roswell AAF. He then filled his ownvehicle and, late at night, began his drive back to the base. On the way,however, he made a stop at his house at 2 A.M. He woke up his wife, Viaud, andhis son, Jesse, Jr., showed them the debris, and identified it as part of aflying saucer.Marcel and Cavitt arrived at RAAF the morning of Tuesday, July 8, with twocarloads of debris. Blanchard notified the Eighth Air Force headquarters in FortWorth and ordered Marcel to go there with the debris and meet with Gen. RogerRamey. At this point both Marcel and Blanchard believed they had obtained piecesof the mysterious flying discs. At around noon, Blanchard ordered PublicInformation Officer Lt. Walter Haut to issue a press release stating this. Hautgave the release to Frank Joyce at radio station KGFL, who sent it to WesternUnion, radio stations, and newspapers. It reached the AP wire by 2:26 P.M.; atthat point, all hell broke loose throughout Roswell and, we may assume, up themilitary chain of command.15 [index_split_256.html#filepos1430781] The RoswellDaily Record, an evening paper, carried three stories about the crash, all onthe front page. The main statement: “The intelligence office of the 509thBombardment group at Roswell Army Air Field announced at noon today that thefield has come into possession of a flying saucer.”16[index_split_256.html#filepos1430937]Meanwhile, Marcel arrived with the debris at Ramey’s office. What happened nextis disputed. According to Marcel, the two left the office, then came back.Marcel swore that this time, the debris was different, that it had been changed.In its place was a ripped-apart weather balloon scattered on the floor.Nonsense, maintained the air force. Ultimately, we are left with Marcel’s wordon the matter versus that of the air force.Ramey brought in the Associated Press, which broke the story—only three hoursafter the original RAAF press release—that the Roswell flying disc was nothingmore than a weather balloon. Ramey also appeared on a local Fort Worth-Dallasradio station to announce that Marcel and the officers at Roswell had beenfooled by a weather balloon.17 [index_split_256.html#filepos1431093]The FBI followed the events in Roswell. An FBI teletype labeled “Urgent” andheaded “Flying Disc—Information Concerning” was sent shortly after the Rameypress conference to J. Edgar Hoover and Strategic Air Command in Cincinnati.Following Ramey’s lead, the author of the teletype said it was all just aballoon—sort of. The message stated that:> Major Curtain, HQ Eighth Air Force, telephonically advised this office that an> object purporting to be a flying disc was recovered near Roswell, New Mexico,> this date.

Of particular interest is the phrase: “telephonicconversation between their office and Wright Field had not [blacked out] borneout this belief.” Not borne out the belief that this object was a high-altitudeweather balloon?By July 9, newspapers were reporting that the Roswell disc was just a weatherballoon. Mac Brazel, under military guard for several days, had meanwhile beenled back into town under military escort. Contrary to his initial claim, he wasnow telling reporters that he found the wreckage on June 14, but continued tomaintain it was no weather balloon.19 [index_split_256.html#filepos1431429]Meanwhile, a poll among Roswell residents revealed that most thought thatexperimental military tests were behind the saucer sightings, slightly fewerblamed mass hysteria, while most of the rest attributed them to naturalphenomena. The army baked it, the press served it, the public ate it.For the next thirty years, the Roswell incident became a nonevent, forgotten byeveryone except the residents. In 1978, while in Baton Rouge, UFO researcherStanton Friedman heard a story that Maj. Jesse Marcel, retired from the airforce and living nearby, had once handled the wreckage of a UFO. Friedmaninterviewed Marcel, reexamined the stories about Roswell, found other witnesses,and concluded that there had been a cover-up of “cosmic Watergate” proportions.His research became the basis of the 1980 book The Roswell Incident, cowrittenby Charles Berlitz and William Moore.In 1988, the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Chicago sponsored a team to findthe crash site, recover any remaining debris, and interview surviving witnesses.Three years later the key members of that team, Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt,published their conclusions in the book UFO Crash at Roswell. Not only had themilitary recovered a UFO at Roswell, they asserted, they also retrieved alienbodies. In 1992, Friedman and Don Berliner coauthored Crash at Corona, whichargued that the government recovered not one but two saucers in July 1947, alongwith seven dead extraterrestrials and one that was still alive. The firstcrashed at Corona (near Roswell) after a midair accident that showered debris onthe Foster ranch, the second on the Plains of San Augustin. Randle and Schmittwrote a Roswell sequel in 1994, which disputed the San Augustin crash story,moved the date from July 2 to July 4, and argued that alien bodies were taken toRAAF, examined, sealed in a crate, and taken to a hangar and flown to AndrewsAFB in Washington, D.C., at 2 A.M. on Monday, July 7."},{"pageContent":"ROSWELL: MORE WITNESSES By the 1990s, many of the main alleged witnesses to the Roswell events weredead.

According to Bill (and other witnesses), this lasted for about aweek, during which time Mac was seen on the streets of Roswell with a militaryescort.

Loretta Proctor’s brother, Master Sgt. Robert Porter, was a B-29 flight engineerwith the 830th Bomb Squadron. Porter claimed to have flown Roswell debris toFort Worth and that one officer said they were parts of a flying saucer. Onboard were Lt. Col. Payne Jennings (deputy commander of Roswell) and MajorMarcel.First Lt. Robert Shirkey was assistant operations officer of the 509th BombGroup. Shirkey said that he saw part of the loading process that transported thedebris to Fort Worth, “carrying parts of the crashed flying saucer.”Robert Slusher, a staff sergeant assigned to the 393rd Bomb Squadron,corroborated Shirkey’s account. Slusher said he was on board a B-29 that carrieda single crate from Roswell to Fort Worth, which he described as twelve feetlong, five feet wide, and four feet high. The contents of the crate seemed to besensitive to air pressure, since the plane flew at the unusually low altitude offour to five thousand feet (rather than the standard twenty-five thousand for aB-29). Unlike the cabin, which could be pressurized, the bomb bay (where thecrate was stowed) could not be pressurized. This suggests the crate was carryingsomething other than metal. Slusher also believed the flight to be unusual inthat it was a hurried flight, ordered with little advanced notice; he alsoreported rumors that the crate had debris from the crash.Another witness to the transport of debris was Robert Smith, a member of theFirst Air Transport Unit, which operated Douglas C-54 Skymaster fourenginedcargo planes out of RAAF. Smith helped load crates of debris into the aircraft.He described seeing many armed guards, something unusual at Roswell, and “a lotof people in plainclothes all over the place.” There were quite a few crates toload, and the whole process took six to eight hours.

Schiff accused the Pentagon of“stonewalling,” called its lack of response “astounding,” and said he was“clearly getting the runaround.” As a result, he asked the General AccountingOffice, Congress’s investigative arm, to prepare a report on the status ofgovernment records related to the Roswell incident. In July 1995, the GAO issuedits report, “Results of a Search for Records Concerning the 1947 Crash NearRoswell, New Mexico.” The GAO reported that, incredibly, all administrativerecords of Roswell Army Air Field from March 1945 through December 1949 wereinexplicably destroyed, as were all outgoing messages from October 1946 throughDecember 1949. These were permanent records that should not have been destroyed.In the words of the report, “our search of government records was complicated bythe fact that some records we wanted to review were missing and there was notalways an explanation.” As Schiff put it, “documents that should have providedmore information were destroyed. The military cannot explain who destroyed themor why.” No explanation or follow-up ever occurred.27[index_split_256.html#filepos1432668]For nearly fifty years, the air force had maintained that the crash at Roswellhad been nothing other than a downed weather balloon. In July 1995, it released“The Roswell Report: Fact Versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert.” The airforce now modified its weather balloon explanation. A balloon did cause thecrash, but this was no ordinary balloon. “Its real purpose was to carryclassified payloads for a top secret U.S. Army Air Forces project. The project’sclassified code name was Mogul.” Mogul was designed to assist the U.S. militaryin detecting signs of Soviet nuclear explosions—in other words, to learn whenRussia got the bomb. It had a 1A priority classification, the highestavailable.28 [index_split_256.html#filepos1432803]The report introduced Charles Moore, a scientist who worked on Mogul in 1947, asits key witness. Moore explained that Mogul involved launching trains ofballoons that carried acoustical equipment designed to monitor Soviet nucleartests. The balloons were equipped with corner reflectors to track them moreeasily by radar. The reflectors were put together with beams made of balsa woodand coated with Elmer’s-type glue to strengthen them. A toy company thatmanufactured the reflectors had reinforced the seams with leftover tape thatMoore recalled had “pinkish-purple, abstract, flower-like designs,” markings,according to the report, that Major Marcel could have misinterpreted ashieroglyphics.The air force report claimed “with a great degree of certainty,” that Mogulflight Number 4, launched on June 4, 1947, was the actual debris mistaken for aflying saucer. The report gave three reasons for this conclusion.> 1. Descriptions of the debris provided by Brazel, Cavitt, and Mogul scientist> Dr. Albert Crary (who kept a diary of the launches), as well as the photos of> the debris in Ramey’s office, “were consistent with the components of a Mogul> service flight....”> 2. Brazel’s statement of July 8, 1947, that he found debris on June 14,> “obviously eliminating any balloons launched in July.”> 3. Only two flights launched in June were unaccounted for, Numbers 3 and 4. Of> these, Number 3 did not have unorthodox corner reflectors. Flight #4, launched> on June 4, was tracked to within twenty miles of the Foster ranch before it> disappeared from the radar scopes in mid-June. Of these three reasons, only the first is an actual reason, as the other twowork entirely within the structure provided by the first. That is, the entireair force Mogul explanation rests upon accounts by Brazel (as reported on July8), Cavitt (a loyal CIC officer known to be hostile to the UFO explanation), andCrary’s diary. All other evidence—and there is a lot of it—was ignored. If onedoes not accept the June 14 crash date, as many do not, the air forceexplanation falls.The original air force explanation made no mention of alien bodies, althoughmany Roswell residents claimed either to have seen bodies or heard about themsecondhand. The air force representative explained the omission simply: “Itseemed rational to us that since we proved there were no UFOs, it automaticallymeant no aliens.” In the summer of 1997, amid the mayhem in Roswell marking thefiftieth anniversary of the crash, the air force issued its second officialreport on the crash. The air force now indicated that, during the 1950s, it hadconducted experiments that involved dropping dummies from high-altitude balloonsto study the results of the impact. Witness descriptions of the “aliens”somewhat matched the characteristics of the dummies: bluish skin coloration andno ears, hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes. The air force dummies, however, were allsix feet tall. The air force maintained that people who saw these dummiesprobably mistook them for aliens. As for the apparent incongruity of the dates,the air force contended that the sheer span of time made it difficult for peopleto remember exact dates.29 [index_split_256.html#filepos1432939]Let us, with efficient dispatch, look at the combined air force argument moreclosely.> 1. In neither report did the air force make any attempt to interview> still-living witnesses of the 1947 events.> 2. The air force ignored its own experts, such as Lt. Col. (Ret.) Raymond A.> Madson, a project officer on Project High Dive, who told the Associated Press> that there is no way the dummies could be confused with aliens.

Neither report tried to answer why the army incarcerated Brazel,> interrogated him for a week, and held him incommunicado. Brazel’s detention by> the military was corroborated by his family, friends, neighbors, Roswell base> provost marshal, and Wilcox’s family.> 8.

Another example was Mogul #6, launched June 7. Albert Crary noted in his diarythat rancher Sid West found the remains of this balloon train and payload. Westeasily identified the balloon and knew immediately who to contact. The next day,two men associated with Mogul came by to pick it up.Considering that Mogul #4—the supposed Roswell object—was simply an unlistedtest flight, carrying no classified equipment, it is strange that so manywitnesses should have attested to such stringent security around it."},{"pageContent":"ROSWELL: CONCLUSIONS Roswell has been the Holy Grail of UFO research. It has offered hope to thoseseeking to prove a UFO cover-up, but has yet to deliver the goods. Inretrospect, Roswell’s hammerlock on public discussion about UFOs has beenunfortunate. Through the lens of the pop media, the Roswell case has become akind of litmus test for the legitimacy of the entire UFO phenomenon. The casefor the UFO is much broader and stronger than a fixation on Roswell warrants.While Roswell debate is important on its own merits, it has brought an unmeritedsense of finality to the UFO debate in general.Another problem with placing all of one’s chips on Roswell is the unlikelihoodthat the true nature of the crash will ever be established—to the satisfactionof all concerned parties. Heated though the Roswell argument has become, thereis just not enough proof to establish beyond any reasonable doubt either of thetwo main contentions: (1) that an extraterrestrial object (with alien bodies)crashed, or (2) that the crash resulted from debris of a balloon of some sort.Ultimately, Roswell will probably always have more evidence than proof, lots ofwitness testimony but no smoking gun.One thing we can say with reasonable certainty: claims to have “closed the case”are greatly premature, based on slender evidence, wrapped in the cloak ofofficial sanction, and given widespread circulation by the mass media. In suchan environment, it is unrealistic to presume that we will ever get to the bottomof the mystery. We may form opinions about what we think happened, but we wouldbe wise to refrain from claiming to know much of anything, except that themilitary deceived the public about it for fifty years, and probably continues todo so.A final observation that often goes unnoticed: the Roswell crash occurred amidone of the greatest UFO-sighting waves in modern history. While the case muststand or fall on its own merits, isolating it from its historical context hasbeen an all-too-common mistake."},{"pageContent":"OTHER SIGHTINGS The Roswell crash not only followed a rash of interesting sightings, it precededone. On Sunday, July 6, as the events in Roswell were still unfolding, asergeant in Birmingham, Alabama, saw several dim, glowing lights speed acrossthe sky, and photographed one of them. The same day, a B-25 crew saw a bright,disc-shaped object below their aircraft. At Fairfield-Susan AFB in California, apilot saw a strange object “oscillating on its lateral axis” shoot across thesky in a few seconds. In southern Wyoming, an aviation engineer also saw anoval-shaped UFO.30 [index_split_256.html#filepos1433097]On Monday the seventh, a young man named William H. Rhodes of Phoenix, Arizona,took two photographs of a flying saucer, which were published two days later onthe front page of the Arizona Republic—right next to the article debunking theRoswell crash. The photographs did not appear in any other newspapers, butRhodes was soon visited by an FBI agent and an Intelligence officer fromHamilton Field, California. At their request he gave them his pictures, which henever saw again. In early 1948, Rhodes was asked to come to Wright-PattersonField for an interview—he declined—and was soon afterward interviewed for asecond time at his home. Years later, publisher Raymond Palmer erroneouslycharged that the army had picked up all sixty-four thousand copies of thenewspaper’s July 9 edition and destroyed the plates. The paper humorouslyrebutted his claim. After conceding his mistake, Palmer said he had heard thestory from a Phoenix resident, and asked the paper for a copy of the edition ora front page photostatted from the back issue file. He never heard from them.For the rest of his life, Palmer continued to think “that Rhodes photographedthe real thing, and that the air force felt it was necessary to quiet the wholematter.”31 [index_split_256.html#filepos1433253]While Roswell buzzed with activity, claims, and denials, an extraordinary seriesof sightings occurred in California’s Mojave Desert, at Muroc Air Field (nowEdwards AFB). Ruppelt called it “the first sighting that really made the airforce take a deep interest in UFOs.” This is unlikely, but there is no denyingthat the events there concerned the air force.On July 8, 1947, at Muroc, four separate sightings by a number of officers andtechnicians took place. Each involved circular or disc-shaped UFOs seen at 9:30A.M., 11:50 A.M., 12:00 noon, and 3:50 P.M. The first is by far the best-known.Several pilots on the ground saw two silver-colored, spherical or disc-like UFOsmaneuvering over the base, circling tightly at eight thousand feet at speeds of300-400 mph—rather fast maneuvering. According to the report, the “objects inquestion were not, repeat, were not, aircraft.” Nor were they balloons, sincethe objects were traveling against the wind. They simply flew off anddisappeared. Very soon afterward, the witnesses saw another object “traveling incircles.” One witness said, “I have been flying in and have been around alltypes of aircraft since 1943, and never in my life have I ever seen anythingsuch as this.”Somewhat later, at 11:50 A.M., a crew of technicians saw a white-aluminum objectwith a distinct oval outline descending and moving against wind. Then at noon,an air force major at the field saw a thin metallic object climb, oscillate overthe field, dive down to ground level, and rise again. The event wassimultaneously observed by a test pilot (a captain) at Rodgers Dry Lake, asecret test base. The final sighting occurred as an F-51 pilot saw a flat object“of light-reflecting nature” pass over his plane. There were no known aircraftin the area at that time.Over fifty years later, the public explanation of the sightings—“probably”research balloons—remains not credible. Balloons are incapable of 300 mph speedand the tight circles reported. The Muroc incident continues to provide evidencefor military knowledge, interest, and secrecy regarding UFOs.32[index_split_256.html#filepos1433402]"},{"pageContent":"ENTER THE FBI On July 9, 1947, the day that Roswell debris probably arrived at Wright Field,Brig.

Ladd, Clyde Tolson, and Hoover. Laddrecommended that the bureau not assist, since many sightings were found to be“pranks.” Tolson wrote, “I think we should do this.” Hoover wrote, “I would doit, but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discsrecovered.

That town sits on the main Highway 28 near theintersection with Highway 380, which leads to White Sands Proving Grounds andthen to Roswell. The distance to Roswell, however, is over 150 miles, making aRoswell connection appear unlikely.35 [index_split_256.html#filepos1433951]By the end of July, Schulgen assured Hoover that the FBI would have full accessto any crashed discs. There was no hint that the discs were anything other thanof terrestrial manufacture. On July 30, Hoover agreed to give full FBIcooperation in the investigation of flying discs. His main concern seems to havebeen that the discs might be made by subversive individuals, or those “desirousof seeking personal publicity, causing hysteria, or playing a prank. ”36[index_split_256.html#filepos1434260]Even before Hoover’s formal approval, the FBI interviewed many prominent UFOwitnesses, including E. J. Smith and Kenneth Arnold. By the end of July, theFBI/Army Intelligence Report concluded:> (a) This “flying saucer” situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in> some natural phenomena.

The two jealous organizations had a rocky relationship. A September 3letter from Air Defense Command Headquarters implied that the FBI was only goodfor “relieving the numbered air forces of the task of tracking down all the manyinstances which turned out to be ash can covers, toilet seats, and whatnot.” Thememo reached an FBI agent in San Francisco who sent it up the chain, where itsoon reached Hoover. On September 27, Hoover notified the air staff assistantchief that the FBI would “discontinue all investigative activity regarding thereported sightings of flying discs.” Four days later, the FBI formally ended itscooperation with the air force, although it continued to investigate UFOs.38[index_split_256.html#filepos1434829]"},{"pageContent":"MEDIA CLAMPDOWN These documents remained classified for nearly thirty years, unavailable for aninformed public to judge. Meanwhile, people relied on newspapers and radio,which continued to ply their trade on behalf of the national securityestablishment. After the middle of July, flying saucers disappeared withastonishing rapidity from mainstream journalism, unless to appear as the subjectof ridicule. The New York Times published a tongue-in-cheek editorial dismissingflying saucers, while Life magazine compared UFOs to the Loch Ness Monster. Bynow, as historian David Jacobs noted, “newspaper reporters automatically placedany witness who claimed to see something strange in the sky as in the crackpotcategory.”According to Ruppelt, the few members of the press who did inquire into the airforce attitude toward flying saucers “got the same treatment that you would gettoday if you inquired about the number of thermonuclear weapons stockpiled inthe U.S.’s atomic arsenal.” Thus—a very important point to consider—there was noindependent investigation of UFOs to compete with the military monopoly.An August Gallup poll reported that 90 percent of the adult population had heardof flying saucers; most considered them to be illusions, hoaxes, secret weapons,or other explainable phenomena; a small number believed them to be from outerspace.39 [index_split_256.html#filepos1435025] Interesting sightings continuedto occur, however, several of which involved U.S. military personnel. Sometimeduring the summer, a navy commander saw a disc-shaped UFO over the airport inPittsburg, Kansas. In Media, Pennsylvania, an air force pilot reported a dischovering and speeding away.40 [index_split_256.html#filepos1435164]An interesting case was related by the Signal Corps of the Alaska CommunicationSystem to the commanding general of the 4th Air Force in San Francisco. Thereport stated:> Capt. Jack Peck and his copilot, Vince Daly, have stated that on August 4,> 1947, they sighted and followed a flying saucer northwest of Bethel, Alaska.> This object was bigger than the Douglas DC-3 they were flying, crossed their> course at right angles to them.

The report emphasized the excellent reputation of Captain Peck and added that“no one here doubts in the least but that he actually saw this object.” Thesighting report was forwarded to Air Defense Command.41[index_split_256.html#filepos1435302]U.S. military personnel in Guam reported two objects—“small, crescent-shaped,and traveling at a speed twice that of a fighter plane”—flying in a zigzagmotion over Harmon Field on August 14 at 10:40 A.M. The objects flew westerly at1,200 feet and disappeared into clouds. A few seconds later, a single object,possibly one of those just seen, emerged from clouds and proceeded west.42[index_split_256.html#filepos1435458] Later that week, an air force major atRapid City AFB in South Dakota saw “approximately twelve objects flying a tightdiamond-shaped formation.” The objects were elliptical-shaped, silent, andglowed yellow-white. The official air force evaluation: birds. On August 19, inTwin Falls, Idaho (near the sighting six days earlier), residents and police sawa group of twelve strange objects “flying in formation over the city ... atterrific speed.” The air force explained this, too, as birds.43[index_split_256.html#filepos1435602]Within the higher levels of the military, there was—Ruppelt again—“confusion tothe point of panic.” A few senior officers in the Pentagon probably knew whatwas going on at ATIC. Overall, “the UFO security lid was down tight.”44[index_split_256.html#filepos1435760]General Schulgen was not one of those officers in the know, but wanted to beone. At the end of July he decided to make a direct request to the Air MaterialCommand, which housed the labs and resources best able to identify the flyingsaucers. He prepared an “Estimate of the Situation” (not the famous Estimate of1948), which concluded that the discs were mechanical aerial objects, andprobably part of a highly classified U.S. project. Schulgen then sat on thisdocument for a month. He sent it to Twining’s office at AMC in late August,along with a request for information about flying saucers.45[index_split_256.html#filepos1435900] Before we consider Twining’s response, wemust review the Maury Island affair."},{"pageContent":"THE MAURY ISLAND SAGA The Maury Island affair shows a singular interest by U.S. intelligence agenciesin flying saucers. The most complete account about it came from Kenneth Arnold,who investigated the events and wrote about them at length in his 1952 book, TheComing of the Saucers.46 [index_split_256.html#filepos1436040] The air forcestated the case was a hoax, and Ruppelt concurred in his book. In the 1990s,however, several researchers began revising their conclusions about the case,based on a careful reading of Arnold’s account and renewed investigations.The incident was said to have occurred on June 21, 1947. Harold A. Dahl, a logsalvager on Maury Island (situated in Puget Sound between Tacoma and Seattle)who helped the local Harbor Patrol Association, was out on the bay with his son,dog, and two crewmen. He saw six large, metallic, doughnut-shaped aircraft,about one hundred feet in diameter and two thousand feet overhead. Five objectscircled around one that seemed to be in trouble and losing altitude. Dahl heardno sound, and saw no motors, propellers, or means of propulsion. The objects hadlarge, round portholes on the outside and a dark, continuous, “observation”window toward the bottom and inside. As Dahl took three or four photographs, onecraft moved toward the center, apparently to help the troubled craft. A dullexplosion followed, and the troubled craft ejected a stream of light metal which“seemed like thousands of newspapers,” then ejected a heavier and darker type ofmetal, similar to lava rock. After this, the craft lifted slowly and drifted outover the Pacific Ocean, disappearing from sight. Dahl said the heavy materialdamaged his boat, killed his dog, and injured the arm of his son, requiring atrip to the hospital. He described the event to a man he described as hissupervisor, Fred L. Crisman, estimating that twenty tons of material had fallen.Actually, Fred Crisman was an intelligence agent, formerly of the OSS and soonto be of the CIA, who specialized in internal “disruption” activities. This factwas unknown for many years, then suspected, then finally proven with thediscovery of certain CIA documents. More on that in a moment.Dahl also claimed that the next morning an ordinary-looking man in a black suitarrived at his house and invited him to breakfast. This was not as unusual as itmight seem. Many lumber buyers called on people in Dahl’s business to buysalvaged logs. Dahl followed him to a diner, ordered breakfast, and listened inastonishment as the man related Dahl’s entire experience from the day before,all in precise detail. “What I have said is proof to you,” said the man, “that Iknow a great deal more about this experience of yours than you will want tobelieve.” He warned Dahl not to discuss the experience. Dahl considered the manto be a crackpot and mailed some fragments to Raymond Palmer, a Chicagopublisher of the paranormal.Around July 22, 1947, Palmer wrote to Kenneth Arnold, mentioning the MauryIsland case, and asked whether Arnold would look into it and send back somefragments. Arnold did not think Palmer was especially “cranked up.” He hadmerely asked Arnold to check into it during one of his routine flights to thearea. On July 25, two representatives of military intelligence of the Fourth AirForce, Lt. Frank M. Brown and Capt. William Davidson, visited Arnold, and toldhim to contact them “if anything of an unusual nature” came to his attention.Despite his growing interest, Arnold wavered on Maury Island until Palmer wiredhim two hundred dollars through Western Union on the twenty-seventh. It shouldbe remembered that army intelligence was then using Western Union as part ofOperation Shamrock.On Tuesday, July 29, 1947, Arnold took off from a private cow pasture in Boise,headed for Tacoma. Only his wife knew of his exact plans. A few of his friendsknew he was going but not when, and he did not file a flight plan. En route, hehad another, lesser known, UFO sighting, of about twenty small objects moving ata “terrific rate of speed.” Arnold took movie pictures of them, which turned outpoorly, then landed at La Grande Airfield, Oregon, where he phoned aviationeditor Dave Johnson about the sighting, and mentioned it to some Eastern AirLines crew members. By dusk, he reached Tacoma and phoned around for a room. Heassumed this would be difficult, as Tacoma’s housing shortage made hotel roomsscarce. When he called the city’s most prominent hotel, the Winthrop, he learnedto his surprise that a room and bath were already reserved for “Kenneth Arnold.”Who had known about his arrival, he wondered, and how?Arnold arrived at the hotel that night and found Harold A. Dahl in the phonebook. After some determined prodding by Arnold, Dahl visited Arnold that night,then took Arnold to his “secretary’s” home to see some fragments, one of whichserved as an ashtray. Arnold said it looked like simple lava rock. No, saidDahl, this was the stuff that hit his boat, and Crisman had a box of it in hisgarage. The next morning, Arnold met with Dahl and Crisman, who claimed to havehad an independent flying saucer sighting. Arnold asked Dahl for the photographsand Crisman for the fragments. Feeling that something was wrong but distrustinghis ability to evaluate the situation, Arnold then called his friend, pilot E.J. Smith (“Smithy”) who had also witnessed a flying saucer. Smith arrived thatday, cross-examined Dahl and Crisman, but could not trip them up. The twoinvestigators then decided that Smith would stay in Arnold’s room, and that theywould see everything the next morning, including Maury Island.That evening, Arnold received a telephone call from Ted Morello of United Press,who informed him that some “crackpot” had been calling his office, telling himeverything that had happened in Arnold’s hotel room the entire day. Arnold wasstunned. He initially suspected Dahl or Crisman of leaking information, untilMorello quoted conversations Arnold had had with Smith when they were alone. Thetwo spent the next hour looking for a microphone in their room.On the morning of Thursday, July 31, Crisman and Dahl brought heavy fragmentsand some white metal. The lava-like pieces were unusually heavy, smooth on oneside, and slightly curved. On the other side they looked as though they had beensubjected to extreme heat. The white metal had square rivets as opposed to thestandard round ones, but seemed normal otherwise. It did not match Dahl’soriginal description. Regarding the photographs, Dahl said he had given thecamera with its film to Crisman, who now could not find it, but would try in theafternoon.Although Arnold smelled a hoax, he decided to call his acquaintances Brown andDavidson from Hamilton Air Force Base. Perhaps the Communists were involved, hethought. It struck Arnold as odd that Brown refused to take his call on base,and called back from an off-base phone. The two officers quickly left forTacoma. Before their arrival, Ted Morello phoned again. His informant had beencalling from a pay telephone, for about fifteen to twenty seconds each time,with the latest news that Brown and Davidson were on their way in a B-25. Dahland Crisman were both present at the time of this call, and Morello said thevoice had not changed. That would seem to rule them out as the caller. By now,Arnold and Smith were “at a point of nervous tension.” Brown and Davidsonarrived in the late afternoon, and the five men (Dahl had left) talked until 11P.M., at which time Crisman offered to go home and retrieve another box offragments. No thanks, said the officers, they were no longer interested. Anyway,they had to return for Air Force Day the next morning. Every plane on the base,including their newly overhauled B-25, had to be ready for maneuvers. Crisman,undeterred, still left to get his fragments.One might wonder why on earth Crisman left to get more fragments when manypieces of both types were lying on the hotel room floor. He returned just intime with his new fragments, stuffed into a large cereal box, and put them intothe army vehicle. Arnold thought they appeared rockier and less metallic thanthe other fragments, but he no longer cared. He had gotten the matter to thecompetent military authorities and wanted out. After Brown and Davidson left,Ted Morello called again, revealing everything that had taken place in Arnold’sroom, courtesy of the informant.At 1:30 A.M., Brown and Davidson’s plane exploded and crashed, some twentyminutes after taking off. Also aboard were an army hitchhiker and engineer whosurvived. According to their account, the two officers had loaded a heavycardboard box. Shortly after takeoff, the left engine caught fire, the emergencyfire-fighting system failed, and Brown ordered the two men to parachute. For thenext ten minutes, they watched the burning plane continue to fly. The armyblamed the crash on the loss of an exhaust collector ring on the left engine,but could not answer why Brown and Davidson failed to signal distress or bailout.Arnold and Smith learned the news the next morning. Arnold called Palmer(speaking to him for the first time), and offered to refund his money. Keep themoney, said Palmer, but mail me some fragments. After a visit to Morello, whowarned them to leave town, the pilot-investigators took a trip to see Dahl’sdamaged boat and talk again with Crisman, who said “I don’t know what could havehappened to those pictures.”They gave up on seeing Maury Island and talked briefly with reporter Paul Lancein their hotel lobby. Lance’s article appeared later that day in the TacomaTimes titled, “Sabotage Hinted in Crash of Army Bomber at Kelso,” with thesub-headline, “Plane May Hold Flying Disc Secret.” Lance wrote that the Times’smysterious informant had said the plane was sabotaged or shot down to preventthe shipment of flying disc fragments to Hamilton Field, California. Twelvehours before the army released the official identification, the informantcorrectly identified Davidson and Brown.Dahl told Arnold and Smith that Crisman had left and would be gone “for a fewdays.” Morello then called. His informant said that Crisman boarded an Armybomber and was flying to Alaska. It turned out that an army flight was leavingfrom Tacoma’s McChord Field to Alaska, but no passenger list was available.Morello said his paper’s normally excellent channels of obtaining data “drew ablank” with McChord, as did attempts to trace the informant’s calls. He didconfirm that the B-25 had been under military guard “every minute it was at thefield.” Morello told Arnold and Smith, “you’re involved in something that isbeyond our power here to find out anything about.... I’m just giving you somesound advice. Get out of this town until whatever it is blows over.” Yet theyremained, mistakenly assuming that military intelligence would want to speakwith them. They spent the next day sitting around “like a couple of dead ducks.”Finally, on August 3, Smith reached a Major Sander of army intelligence atMcChord Field. Sander came and said he was “positive” they had been victims of ahoax. Even so, he took the fragments for analysis—just to be thorough—leavingnone for Arnold or Smith. Sander made the empty promise that they would know theofficial evaluation in two weeks. He then drove the two to a smelting lot.Arnold thought it odd that Sander knew just which road to take, and that hestopped exactly at pieces of slag similar to their own. Arnold “thought [Sander]must have been there before.” From inside the car, it initially appeared thatSander had been right. But after examining the pieces, Arnold believed theylooked like the material Crisman gave Davidson and Brown, not like the originalfragments. Unfortunately, Sander did not allow Arnold or Smith to take out anyoriginal fragments from the truck for comparison. Thus, while Crisman and Dahl’sstory “did not ring completely true ... for some reason we couldn’t convinceourselves it was all as simple as the Major put it.”Still, the two pilots were relieved to be done. They checked out of the HotelWinthrop, trying but failing to find Dahl’s house one last time. Arnold thenflew home to Boise and continued his efforts to reach Dahl, but could not trackhim down.On August 7, 1947, the Seattle FBI office interrogated Crisman and Dahl, andsoon announced the affair had been a hoax, and that the two had also been themysterious informants. They supposedly offered Palmer their exclusive story formoney—something Palmer vehemently denied. The fragments mailed by Dahl, said theFBI, were not from a flying saucer. Palmer, by the way, claimed that thefragments were stolen from his office shortly thereafter. Before they werestolen, he had sent them out for analysis. The results, he said, indicated theywere neither slag nor natural rock. One may ask, why would someone break intohis office to steal some slag samples, anyway?47[index_split_256.html#filepos1436470]Behind the scenes, the matter was not so clearly settled. J. Edgar Hoover wrotethe following week: “It would also appear that Dahl and Crisman did not admitthe hoax to the army officers....” In response, the FBI special agent in chargefrom Seattle answered:> Please be advised that Dahl did not admit to Brown that his story was a hoax> but only stated that if questioned by authorities he was going to say it was a> hoax because he did not want any further trouble over the matter.48> [index_split_256.html#filepos1436610] Crisman is the key to this event. We now know a great deal about him, little ofwhich was available to the early researchers. Crisman, for instance, was amember of the OSS during the war, flew fighter planes over the Pacific, andserved as a liaison officer with the British RAF. Later, he wrote to Palmer’smagazine that he had been hit by a “ray gun” in a cave in Burma. After the war,Crisman was supposedly discharged from the military, but actually entered aspecial Internal Security School. There is evidence linking him to ProjectPaperclip shortly before the Maury Island affair. Then, sometime around theMaury Island incident, he was brought to the newly formed CIA as an “extendedagent” specializing in internal disruption activities. During the Korean War, hesent secret reports to the CIA regarding military officers, and later did thesame regarding company officials while working for Boeing. New Orleans DistrictAttorney Jim Garrison, while reinvestigating the Kennedy assassination,subpoenaed Crisman (who denied to a grand jury that he was any kind of agent).Crisman was closely connected to Clay Shaw, Garrison’s main target. Shaw, likeCrisman, was a member of the OSS and had many ties to the murky world ofintelligence and crime. It was later suggested—in the 95th Congress at theHearings Before the Select Committee on Assassinations—that Crisman was one ofthe three tramps at Dealy Plaza.49 [index_split_256.html#filepos1436850]UFO researchers from Ruppelt to Jacobs to Clark have dismissed the Maury Islandincident as a hoax. The standard line is that Crisman and Dahl, underinterrogation, had confessed that they made up the whole story in hopes ofselling it to Palmer.50 [index_split_256.html#filepos1437782] But this is basedprimarily on statements obtained by the FBI which show all the signs of havingbeen coerced (or otherwise strongly encouraged). Moreover, this assessment doesnot take into account Crisman’s history with the CIA.That a CIA agent was pulling some strings regarding the Maury Island incidentchanges the complexion of the case entirely. Note that Crisman ended up withnearly all the material Dahl found, that he switched it with old scrap topresent to Brown and Davidson, and that he obfuscated during the entire timeArnold was in Tacoma. If this were a hoax, what kind of hoax was he pulling, andwhy would a CIA agent be doing it? Might it be more probable that Crisman’s jobwas to maintain control over a real event?In addition to focusing on Crisman, we are bound to ask other questions. First,who was spying on Kenneth Arnold? Several organizations could have done this,but the one with the easiest means to do so was the Army Signal Security Agency(the precursor to the National Security Agency). Shamrock was already in placeand theoretically could have been used to follow Arnold through a combination oftelephone taps, bugs, and personal surveillance. The FBI is another candidate.It had, after all, interviewed both Arnold and Smith in mid-July, and alsoengaged in the necessary illegal activities.Who was the mysterious informant? If we believe Morello, that the voice neverchanged, then Crisman and Dahl must be ruled out. The informant immediately knewabout the flight of Brown and Davidson to Tacoma. How could this have been Dahlor Crisman, when both were with Arnold during the call from Morello? And how didthe informant know about the particulars of Brown and Davidson’s death? Amilitary informant, perhaps someone from within McChord, seems most likely.The Maury Island incident shows all signs of being investigated by multipleagencies (CIA, FBI, army, and private individuals) with competing motives. PoorBrown and Davidson stumbled into this mess and never made it out. Paul Lance mayalso have been a victim. Almost immediately after writing the key article onMaury Island, he died in mid-August 1947. Arnold stated years later that “thecause of his death was not clear. It was laid to meningitis, but this shouldhave been easy to establish. However, he lay on a slab in the morgue for aboutthirty-six hours while the pathologists apparently hemmed and hawed.”51[index_split_256.html#filepos1437939] Arnold himself described what appeared tobe dangerous tinkering with his aircraft upon leaving Maury Island for home. Hadhe not noticed this, he said, he could easily have crashed.Two more interesting facts bear comment. First, an internal FBI memo datedAugust 6, 1947, referred to one of the men who died in the B-25 crash as a “CICAgent.” That is, Counter Intelligence Corps, the job of which was to examine andcounter enemy (or possible enemy) intelligence. Recall that Brown and Davidsonhad visited Arnold a week earlier, asking him to send along any new UFOinformation he collected. Thus, someone charged the CIC with collecting UFOreports. Right from the beginning, UFOs were handled within the classifiedworld—quite logically, one might add—as potentially hostile.52[index_split_256.html#filepos1438082]Second, the executive summary of the 1994 air force report on Roswell divulgessomething with possible relevance to this case. The air force author wasrefuting Vandenberg’s involvement in the Roswell crash by referring toallegations that he was near Roswell on July 7. In fact, claimed the air force,Vandenberg was involved in a “flying disc” incident at that time, but not atRoswell. (Air Force General Nathan Twining, of course, was near Roswell, a factdiscussed earlier in this book.) Rather, he was busy with an incident that“involved Ellington Field, Texas, and the Spokane (Washington) Depot.”Vandenberg, in other words, was checking into an event that had presumablyoccurred earlier, and involved the state of Washington (albeit on the other sideof the state). This might be a reference to a different event, but the nextremark is suggestive of official comments concerning Maury Island: “after muchdiscussion and information gathering on this incident, it was learned to be ahoax.” At the very least, Vandenberg’s role as a secret investigator of UFOreports speaks volumes about the perceived importance of this topic to thepeople at the top.53 [index_split_256.html#filepos1438235]Unfortunately, Kenneth Arnold was out of his depth in this investigation. He wasan honest and intelligent man (he later was a candidate for lieutenant governorof Idaho). But Arnold failed to check into the basic starting points of inquiry,such as Maury Island itself, the alleged witnesses who accompanied Dahl, Dahl’sson, the doctor who allegedly treated his arm, or the story about Dahl’s dog.Arnold’s preoccupation with finding the boat blinded him from pursuing morefruitful avenues of investigation.Arnold distrusted Fred Crisman (a sign of good instincts), but he seems to havebelieved Dahl to be sincere, if slow-witted and phlegmatic. Could Dahl have beentelling the truth? The description Dahl gave to Arnold of his sighting at MauryIsland happens to coincide with the description of a UFO event that took placein Brazil in the 1950s. Such a similarity does not automatically validate thesighting, but it remains possible that Harold Dahl saw what he claimed to see.For many years after, Dahl lived in the state of Washington as a “self-employedsurplus dealer,” quietly out of the public view. According to 1990s Maury Islandresearcher Ken Thomas, he maintained to the end that the event had been real.Harold Dahl died in 1982 at the age of seventy.54[index_split_256.html#filepos1438371]"},{"pageContent":"NATIONAL SECURITY REORGANIZATION Amid the flying saucer mayhem, the U.S. government passed the National SecurityAct on July 26, 1947. This created a unified National Military Establishment(NME), a National Security Council (NSC) and a Central Intelligence Agency(CIA). The reorganization had been in the making for several years. Theinvestment of time was not wasted—at least from the perspective of thepolicymaking elite—as the Act was, by far, the century’s most significantoverhaul of the country’s national security apparatus. It unified the armedservices under the authority of a Secretary of Defense, and scrapped the old,more honest, title of Secretary of War. James Vincent Forrestal, formerSecretary of the Navy, became the nation’s first SecDef.Forrestal himself had done much to sabotage the authority of the new position.As navy secretary, he favored continued independence of that service. Largelydue to his efforts, each service secretary—the army, the navy, and the newlyestablished air force—gained the right to appeal to the president regardingcrucial issues, such as budget allotments. The Act therefore exacerbatedinterservice rivalries. Forrestal wanted a coordinating, not executive, role forthe position of Secretary of Defense. To his eventual chagrin, he now acquiredit.55 [index_split_256.html#filepos1438509]The National Security Act also established a Central Intelligence Agency. Itprohibited the CIA from any “internal security functions,” that is, from spyingoperations in the United States. But it contained a huge loophole (written byfuture DCI Allen Dulles) enabling the CIA “to perform such other functions andduties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the NationalSecurity Council may from time to time direct.” This quickly translated intocarte blanche to carry out nearly any mission it wished, wherever it wanted,without scrutiny from Congress or, when necessary, the president.Although the CIA still had no operational spending authority, this was quicklyovercome through a variety of subterranean enterprises conducted globally.Intelligence agencies need money, and lots of it. If one wishes to raise privatearmies for secret wars around the world, or remove intractable national leadersdetermined to forge policies independent of U.S. wishes, then huge amounts ofmoney become a necessity. Initially, much of the CIA’s money seems to have comefrom wealthy Americans. (As future CIA Operations Chief Frank Wisner put it, inobtaining money for secret ventures “it is essential to secure the overtcooperation of people with conspicuous access to wealth in their own right,” inother words, people who are rich.)56 [index_split_256.html#filepos1438663] Soon,however, the CIA’s money came from two basic sources: Congress (e.g., legitimatetaxes, classified amounts of which were distributed to the agency) and itsever-growing number of private ventures, not all of which, to put the mattermildly, were legal."},{"pageContent":"THE TWINING LETTER By this time, Schulgen’s letter had reached the desk of Gen. Nathan Twining,head of Air Material Command (AMC). On September 23, 1947, Twining wrote aclassified, now famous, letter regarding the flying discs. He noted that thediscs were “real and not visionary or fictitious.” They may possibly be naturalphenomena, he wrote, such as meteors. But:> the reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb,> maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered> evasive when sighted ... lend belief to the possibility that some of the> objects are controlled either manually, automatically, or remotely.> > > > > > He went on to list the common descriptions of the objects:> > > (1) Metallic or light-reflecting surface; (2) Absence of trail, except in a> few instances when the object apparently was operating under high performance> conditions; (3) Circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on> top; (4) Several reports of well-kept formation flights varying from three to> nine objects; (5) Normally no associated sound, except in three instances a> substantial rumbling roar was noted; (6) Level flight speeds normally above> 300 knots are estimated.57 [index_split_256.html#filepos1438803]> > > Twining recommended that Air Force Headquarters “issue a directive assigning a> priority, security classification and code name for a detailed study of this> matter.” He also ordered that the best UFO reports be sent to the following> places: the Joint Research and Development Board; the Office of Scientific> Research and Development; the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics; and> the Atomic Energy Commission. Each of these offices had strong links with> Vannevar Bush.Twining’s letter stated that no wreckage of a flying disc had been recovered.This point has been used by some skeptics as evidence against the reality of theRoswell crash. Here was Twining, head of an organization that would be in aposition to know, and who was right next door to Roswell in early July, sayingit did not happen. This is one possibility, although it contains its ownproblems. It assumes that the branches of the American military, the Americanintelligence community, and the American government somehow acted seamlesslytogether toward a common goal. Frequently, they did not. Twining may not havetold Schulgen all he knew. If, for example, a UFO had been recovered, Twiningwould have had good cause to state exactly the opposite. Any project to gatherUFO data would have to function on a need-to-know basis. Writing about crasheddiscs would not exactly help the cause of secrecy, and therefore control overthe problem. Twining might have been telling all he knew, or not. The researchermust decide which alternative is more likely, based upon the available facts.Twining did state that UFOs were not secret American craft. This came as asurprise to Schulgen, who expected the reply that there was nothing to theaffair, that everything was under control. Instead, Twining wrote that thephenomenon was unexplained and warranted further study. Again, one might askwhether he was hiding the fact that UFOs really were U.S. experimental craft.Fifty years later, the answer clearly is no. The U.S. had no craft in 1947,experimental or otherwise, that could duplicate the reported maneuvers of flyingsaucers. When Twining wrote his letter, Chuck Yeager had not yet broken thesound barrier (he did it the next month at Muroc Field). Why would Twining tellSchulgen to keep studying flying saucers if they were simply classified Americancraft? If there were good reasons for doing so, none have emerged.58[index_split_256.html#filepos1439031]Twining’s letter, a crucial document in UFO policy, received no officialacknowledgment for twenty years. Yet, because of it, the air force soon createdits first formal UFO investigatory body, Project Sign."},{"pageContent":"MJ-12: YES OR NO? We now enter a topic as rancorous and disputed as the Roswell controversy. InDecember 1984, filmmaker Jaime Shandera received an unmarked package in themail, containing an undeveloped roll of film. Along with his friend, UFOresearcher William Moore, the two had the film developed. The photographs wereof documents that looked like a secret briefing paper for then-president-electDwight Eisenhower, dated November 18, 1952.The documents stated that flying saucers were the product of an extraterrestrialcivilization, that several flying saucers had crashed (including at Roswell) andcome into the possession of the U.S. government, and that the U.S. had one ofthe aliens in custody for some time before it died. The documents claimed thatPresident Truman had established a top secret control group to deal with the UFOproblem, called MJ-12, on September 24, 1947. The group’s original members wereCIA Director Adm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Secretary of DefenseJames Forrestal, Gen. Nathan Twining, Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, Dr. Detlev Bronk,Dr. Jerome Hunsaker, Sidney Souers, Gordon Gray, Dr. Donald Menzel, Gen. RobertMontague, and Dr. Lloyd Berkner. Included was a memorandum from PresidentTruman, addressed to James Forrestal, which established the group. It was datedSeptember 24, 1947, and stamped “TOP SECRET” and “EYES ONLY.” It read asfollows:> Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense> > > > > > Dear Secretary Forrestal:> > > As per our recent conversation on this matter, you are hereby authorized to> proceed with all due speed and caution upon your undertaking. Hereafter this> matter shall be referred to only as Operation Majestic Twelve.> > > It continues to be my feeling that any future considerations relative to the> ultimate disposition of this matter should rest solely with the Office of the> President following appropriate discussions with yourself, Dr. Bush, and the> Director of Central Intelligence.> > > [signed] Harry TrumanIt is not known with certainty who sent the film, but the strongest evidencepoints to members of the U.S. intelligence community, specifically ten or soindividuals from the air force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) atKirtland AFB. In his UFO research, William Moore had already been in contactwith several intelligence people at the base, including Master Sergeant RichardDoty, a special agent with OSI. This group informed Moore that they opposed UFOsecrecy, and would assist him in his research by leading him to key documents.Unfortunately, the group members were skilled disinformation and psy-opsspecialists, a fact that throws the legitimacy of the documents into doubt.Few have denied that the documents look impressive. They looked authentic enoughto get the attention of many who would be in a position to know. Former CIAChief of Operations Richard Bissell, for example, commented, “The documentcertainly looks authentic. On the basis of the material you have sent me, Ipersonally have little doubt that it is authentic.” Others who seem to concurare former Truman administrative assistant David Stowe and former NationalSecurity Council planning and board member Robert R. Bowie.59[index_split_256.html#filepos1439226] Even Roswell debunker Kal Korff wassurprisingly easygoing on the MJ-12 documents. At best, he said, there was onlycircumstantial evidence supporting their authenticity. Not a ringingendorsement, but certainly not a definitive refutation, either.60[index_split_256.html#filepos1439384]Research on the documents proved very interesting. Moore enlisted the help ofStanton Friedman, who spent many hours at the Truman and Eisenhower libraries,checking dates and other relevant information. Friedman learned quite a lot.First, that the Truman library archives confirmed that September 24, 1947,happened to be the only day that Truman and Vannevar Bush met between May andDecember. Forrestal was also present at the meeting, and had met with Bush for ahalf hour beforehand (Friedman believed this was when the two prepared thememorandum.) As for the meeting with Truman, there were “no indications in thearchives to say what was discussed.” Friedman also found supporting informationfor the other key date, November 18, 1952. On that day, Eisenhower received aforty-three-minute national security briefing on matters that are stillclassified, during which Gen. Nathan Twining was present.61[index_split_256.html#filepos1439524]The Eisenhower briefing documents appear to have been prepared on an R. C. Allenmachine, which was manufactured in the 1940s. The typewriter and typeface usedfor the Truman memorandum is a matter of dispute. Friedman argued that it wasprepared on a Remington P4 from the 1940s, a machine also used by Bush for hismemoranda. This reinforced Friedman’s belief that Bush prepared the memorandum.Other typewriter experts have suggested the memorandum was prepared using eithera Ransmayer and Rodrian 664 (no manufacture dates offered) or an Underwood UP3A,which was manufactured from 1933 until 1946. Kevin Randle, who arguedstrenuously against the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, spoke to an expertwho believed the memo typeface was most consistent with a Smith Corona P102 (a“slam dunk,” said the expert), which was used on typewriters only after 1966.Randle challenged Friedman, Moore, and Shandera to produce their experts, whichthey did not do, and which led him to charge that the experts probably neverexisted.62 [index_split_256.html#filepos1439677]An especially controversial point about the document was its mention of Harvardastronomer Donald Menzel as a member of MJ-12. For decades, Menzel was theworld’s leading UFO debunker. Could Menzel really have belonged to a group likeMJ-12? It seemed like a bad joke. To the surprise of all, however, Friedman soonlearned that Menzel was closely tied to the American intelligence community as acryptologist, and had a long-standing association with the National SecurityAgency (NSA). A 1960 letter from Menzel to President-elect John F. Kennedymentioned his Top Secret clearance and “some association” with the CIA. In the1970s Menzel wrote that he “was a consultant with Top Secret Ultra Clearance tothe National Security Agency.”63 [index_split_256.html#filepos1439814] Menzeland Vannevar Bush were also friends from the early days of the war. Randleargued that these discoveries proved nothing, as “almost any scientist who wasalive and working during the early 1940s was probably involved in some sort ofwork for the government.” But this misses Friedman’s point that Menzel was atthe top of that power pyramid.Many people, including UFO debunker Philip Klass, criticized the dating style ofthe documents, such as “07 July, 1947,” which was never a standard militaryformat. Neither the comma nor the initial zero should have been included, andcertainly not for a presidential briefing paper to a five-star general. Klassalso discovered that the style of dating happened to be a type used by Moorehimself in several letters to Klass! That would seem to clinch it, except that(a) Moore also used several other dating styles, and (b) Friedman found a widerange of dating styles in the archives, including the day, month, comma, yearformat. Moreover, the format was common in France, where Hillenkoetter hadserved for some time. Friedman also emphasized that dating formats of the timewere not set in stone. His opponents, such as Joe Nickell and John F. Fischer,countered that no one has found any other documents, whether from Hillenkoetteror anyone else, containing the extra zero combined with the anomalous comma.64[index_split_256.html#filepos1439952]Friedman brought the MJ-12 documents, along with about twenty other documentswritten by Hillenkoetter, to a notable linguist, Dr. Roger W Wescott of DrewUniversity. Wescott said there was no compelling reason to regard any of thesecommunications as fraudulent or to believe that any of them were written byanyone other than Hillenkoetter himself. That statement holds for thecontroversial presidential briefing memorandum of November 18, 1952.Randle countered that Wescott’s expertise was in linguistics, not in theexamination of questioned documents. Indeed, Wescott later realized he hadstepped into “a hornet’s nest” and stated that, while he thought its fraudulenceunproved, he “could equally well have maintained that its authenticity isunproved.”65 [index_split_256.html#filepos1440118]The main argument against the documents’ authenticity, and the one which swayedmost UFO researchers, concerned Truman’s signature. Klass found that it matcheda letter in the Truman archives: a xeroxed letter written by Truman to Bush onOctober 1, 1947. Thus, it appeared that the forger simply tacked a realsignature on to a fake letter. The discovery of tampering was enough to turnmost seasoned researchers away.Surprisingly, not everyone was persuaded that this meant the documents werefaked. In the first place, the identical signature was found on a copy of adocument addressed to, of all people, Vannevar Bush. A careful study of thesignatures shows the MJ-12 signature to be much stronger than the copy itsupposedly came from (the signature on Truman’s letter to Bush is thin andbroken in places). If the MJ-12 signature was forged or copied, how could ithave come from the document found by Klass (the original of which, incidentally,has never been found)? It may be that both signatures are from the same missingsource.Where could the original signature be? If the MJ-12 memorandum were legitimate,it would have gone to Forrestal, to whom it was addressed. It is plausible thatBush, as the other person attending the meeting, had an unsigned copy of thememorandum. By the time of the 1952 briefing, however, Forrestal was long dead,and the original memorandum might have been unavailable. Bush might have beenasked to submit his copy, along with an original signature of Truman’s. He couldlogically have used his letter of October 1, 1947.66[index_split_256.html#filepos1440289]If the above scenario seems far-fetched, consider the hoax alternative. In alllikelihood the hoaxer, such as Doty or others at AFOSI, would have had to haveaccess to the original signature of the 10/1/47 letter from Truman to Bush,either in Bush’s possession or elsewhere. No evidence to that effect has everturned up. The hoaxer would also have had to know about the precise schedules ofForrestal, Bush, and Truman, or else have made some very lucky guesses.Friedman, whatever else one could say about him, was a man who did his homework.He countered that the signature on the Truman memorandum was not an exact matchwith the one on the document addressed to Vannevar Bush. The height-width ratiosof the letters are (ever so) slightly different. Also, was it realistic toexpect that Truman, who signed thousands upon thousands of documents, should notbe found to have many close matches? With these and other counterarguments, thedebate continued.After such a prolonged controversy, most UFO researchers have concluded theMJ-12 documents are fake. There is no provenance for the documents, they containmany questionable elements, and the likely sources (Moore, Doty, AFOSI) do notinspire confidence. Assuming this is true, it still remains unclear how someonenot from Truman’s inner circle of power would have known some of the informationcontained within the documents. And of course it is worth asking, why fake them?For profit? (If so, whose?) Dissimulation? A joke?Regardless of the veracity of the MJ-12 documents themselves, evidence hassurfaced to justify the belief that an organization something like MJ-12 didexist. Such evidence is presented at various points in this book.A brief word about another document in the MJ-12 controversy: the Cutler-TwiningMemo. In 1985, Friedman learned about the impending declassification of somematerials of possible interest at the Modern Military Branch of the NationalArchives. He soon found several Top Secret UFO documents, including one dealingwith the 1955 sighting by Sen. Richard Russell. He notified Moore and Shanderaabout the archives, and they flew to Washington. Recently, the two had beenreceiving odd postcards, one of which included the return address of “Box 189,Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.” Within a few days, they had gone through over a hundredboxes and found about seventy-five pages that looked worthwhile. Shandera thenfound a piece of paper between two files in Box 189. The document was a July 14,1954, memo from Robert Cutler, special assistant to President Eisenhower,addressed to Gen. Nathan Twining. It read:> Memorandum for General Twining. Subject: NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project.> The President has decided that the MJ-12 SSP briefing should take place during> the already scheduled White House meeting of July 16, rather than following it> as previously intended. More precise arrangements will be explained to you> upon arrival. Please alter your plans accordingly. Your concurrence in the> above change of arrangements is assumed. Robert Cutler, Special Assistant to> the President. The memo was a carbon copy in blue ink on old onionskin, watermarked paper. Ithad a red pencil mark through the security marking in the upper right corner.The watermark of the paper indicated the company name, Fox Paper, which (it waslearned) manufactured this type of paper only between 1953 and the early 1970s.Moreover, the paper was not available by retail, but sold only to majorcustomers, in particular, the government. Regarding the memo itself, thelanguage, style, format, and typeface closely matched with other memos byCutler.Critics pointed out several problems. First, the document was unsigned,prompting UFO researcher Barry Greenwood to argue that the memo could have beenfaked, then planted in the newly available archives. The hoaxer could then haveordered a copy of the document from the National Archives, which would carry theofficial declassification stamp. Friedman said this was an impossibility, “givenhow archives operate.” Besides, he said, it was discovered that Cutler was inEurope at the time of the memo, and therefore obviously could not sign it. As towhy he might allow an unsigned memo to leave his desk, Cutler had left explicitinstructions prior to his departure to Europe to James Lay (executive secretaryof the NSC) and Lay’s associate, J. Patrick Coyne, to “keep things moving out ofmy basket.”67 [index_split_256.html#filepos1440447]Another problem was that the pica typeface seemed wrong. UFO debunker PhilipKlass actually challenged Friedman to produce authentic White House letters ormemos by Cutler or Lay between 1953 and 1955 which used a typeface identical insize and style to the Cutler-Twining memo. Klass offered Friedman $100 for eachverified document, to a maximum of $1,000. Friedman immediately found and mailedtwenty, then another fourteen the following month. He received his $1,000.For most researchers, the clincher was the statement by the Military ArchivesDivision, which issued a ten-point list of problems with the memo in an officialletter dated July 22, 1987. Some of these points were closely related, butessentially they were: the document was not correctly filed; no governmentresearcher was able to find any other information on MJ-12; the classification“Top Secret Restricted Information” (marked on the document) did not come intouse at the NSC until the Nixon administration; the memo did not bear an officialgovernment letterhead or watermark, nor did it match the paper Cutler used atthe time; no records were found of an NSC meeting on July 16, 1954; a search ofNSC Meeting Minutes from July 1954 did not uncover any mention of MJ-12 orMajestic; another memo was found which indicated that NSC members would becalled to a civil defense exercise on July 16, 1954; the Eisenhower Libraryfound no entry in President Eisenhower’s appointment books containing an entryfor a special meeting on that date which might have included a briefing onMJ-12.68 [index_split_256.html#filepos1440617]Friedman had answers to these, as well. For example, the statement that thememo’s watermark and paper differed from what Cutler used, he argued, was basedon a limited sampling. After Friedman pointed out a number of copies done ononionskin paper with differing watermarks, the Division changed its statement.Regarding the assertion that there were no NSC meetings on July 16, 1954,Friedman replied that the memo did not specify that the briefing would takeplace during an NSC meeting, but an “already scheduled meeting.” And so on.69[index_split_256.html#filepos1441004]Despite the attacks from what might be called “mainstream” ufology, Friedman hasretained many loyal defenders. For years, the situation has been reminiscent ofa disputed boxing title, with both groups claiming to be the legitimate arbiterof evidence. No definitive resolution appears likely soon, regarding eitherMJ-12 or the Cutler-Twining memo."},{"pageContent":"SOVIET OR SOMETHING ELSE? By late fall of 1947, the question “do UFOs exist?” was not at issue to analystsat ATIC. Nor were they expecting natural phenomena to explain the mystery. Itwas clear that objects were being seen, that they appeared to be of exceptionaltechnological sophistication, and that their movements indicated intelligentcontrol. The question was, “who do they belong to?”As if to reinforce the immediacy of the problem, two cigar-shaped UFOs were seennear Dayton, Ohio, on October 20—very close to Wright-Patterson AFB and ATIC,where the air force’s UFO investigation was centered. The air force comments onthe sighting were as follows:> Impossible to draw definite conclusions. Extremely unlikely they were> fireballs, but if one were to stretch the description to its very limits and> make allowances for untrained observers, he could say the cigarlike shape> might have been an illusion caused by rapid motion.... This investigator does> not prefer that interpretation, and it should be resorted to only if all other> possible explanations fail.70 [index_split_256.html#filepos1441146] That became the official explanation.On October 28, Brigadier General Schulgen, chief of the air force’s AirIntelligence Requirements Division wrote a five-page report based on a summaryof flying saucer characteristics supplied him by Twining’s letter from theprevious month. Schulgen’s report, titled “Draft of Collection Memorandum,”listed what he called the “current intelligence requirements in the field offlying saucer type aircraft.” Taken together with Twining’s letter and the restof the year’s documentation, it shows that America’s military leaders consideredUFOs to be something extraordinary and a matter of great national security.71[index_split_256.html#filepos1441286]The memo revealed many details about UFOs as seen by military personnel. Itnoted that “flying saucer” type aircraft had been reported “by many observersfrom widely scattered places, such as the United States, Alaska, Canada,Hungary, the Island of Guam, and Japan. This object has been reported by manycompetent observers, including USAF rated officers. Sightings have been madefrom the ground as well as from the air.” The performance characteristics weredescribed much as Twining described them in September, only in much greaterdetail:> (a) Relatively flat bottom with extreme light-reflecting ability; (b) absence> of sound except for an occasional roar when operating under superperformance> conditions; (c) extreme maneuverability and apparent ability to almost hover;> (d) a plan form approximating that of an oval or disc with a dome shape on the> top surface; (e) the absence of an exhaust trail except in a few instances> when it was reported to have a bluish color, like a diesel exhaust, which> persisted for approximately one hour.

Only one> incident indicated this phenomenon. Schulgen’s memo, which surfaced in 1985, contained a paragraph implying credencein the extraterrestrial hypothesis:> While there remains a possibility of Russian manufacture, based upon the> perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans, it is the> considered opinion of some elements that the object may in fact represent an> interplanetary craft of some kind.... The presence of an unconventional or> unusual type of propulsion system cannot be ruled out and should be considered> of great interest. During the late 1990s, UFO researcher Robert Todd obtained a fresh copy of theSchulgen memo which did not contain the above paragraph. Instead, that passageread as follows:> This strange object, or phenomenon, may be considered, in view of certain> observations, as long-range aircraft capable of a high rate of climb, high> cruising speed (possibly subsonic at all times) and highly maneuverable and> capable of being flown in very tight formation. For the purpose of analysis> and evaluation of the so-called “flying saucer” phenomenon, the object sighted> is being assumed to be a manned aircraft, of Russian origin, and based on the> perspective thinking and actual accomplishments of the Germans. Rather different from considering the ET hypothesis, leading the UFO researchcommunity to declare the original to be a fake. The authentic memo, while notconsidering the extraterrestrial hypothesis, gives great detail about theobjects seen, and leaves no doubt that they were truly extraordinary, as thisdescription shows:> Construction> (a) Type of material, whether metal, ferrous, non-ferrous or nonmetallic; (b)> Composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metals,> metallic foils, plastics, and perhaps balsa wood or similar material; (c)> Unusual fabrication methods to achieve extreme light weight and structural> stability.> Arrangement> (a) Special provisions such as retractable domes to provide unusual> observation for the pilot and crew members; (b) Unusual features or provisions> regarding the opening and closing of doors.> Landing Gear> (a) Indicate type of landing gear—whether conventional, tricycle, multiple> wheel, etc. or of an unconventional type such as tripod or skid.> Powerplant> (a) (3) Nuclear propulsion (atomic energy).

Aircraft> would be characterized by lack of fuel systems and fuel storage space. (b) The> powerplant would likely be an integral part of the aircraft and possibly not> distinguishable as an item separate from the aircraft. Schulgen’s thinking was that the Soviets could well be behind the UFO mystery.He analyzed at great length the possibilities of Soviet manufacture of a Germanflying wing design from the recent war, in particular, the work of the Hortenbrothers, whose work was under contract to the Luftwaffe. Immediately followingthe memo, American military investigators followed up to check on the Hortenbrothers and any other European leads that might point to the Soviet manufactureof flying saucers. By December, both brothers were found, along with a number ofother leading-edge German aviation experts, but after extensive questioning, theAmericans found nothing to connect the Soviets—or anyone else, for thatmatter—to the flying saucer phenomenon. Schulgen’s speculations had seeminglyreached a dead end.72 [index_split_256.html#filepos1441431]The same dead end appears to have been reached at ATIC, which was studyingrecent German aeronautical research, assisted in large measure by the presenceof German aviation experts at Wright Field. The aerodynamicists at ATIC, WrightField’s Aircraft Laboratory, and the Aeromedical Laboratory of the air forceconcluded that (1) no known aircraft could do what UFOs were reported to bedoing; (2) even if such an aircraft could be built, the human body could notsurvive the violent maneuvers that were reported; and (3) no known materialcould withstand the loads of the reported maneuvers, nor the heat caused by thehigh speeds. For this reason, a certain significant number of analysts (we donot know how many) believed it probable that flying saucers were interplanetary.The evidence seemed to rule out everything else. A memo from this period asked,“Why couldn’t these people, whoever they might be, stand these horrible maneuverforces? Why judge them by earthly standards?”73[index_split_256.html#filepos1441608]"},{"pageContent":"ESTABLISHING PROJECT SIGN By the end of 1947, ATIC had received 156 UFO reports and was settling down to aroutine of studying reports of flying saucers. On December 30, 1947, the airforce established the Project Sign. Known to the public as Project Saucer,Sign’s role was to serve as the official air force investigation of UFOs. As wehave seen, investigating such things was not a new activity, but Sign gaveflying saucers an official status within the military bureaucracy. Studiescontinued to be centered at Wright Field under the auspices of ATIC. The projectcarried a 2A restricted classification (1A being the highest), but thememorandum creating Sign stated that, when necessary, higher securityclassifications could be applied. Sign’s function was to:> collect, collate, evaluate, and distribute to interested government agencies> and contractors all information concerning sightings and phenomena in the> atmosphere which can be construed to be of concern to the national security.74> [index_split_256.html#filepos1441756] Throughout these first few years of ATIC’s investigation of UFOs, percentages ofunknowns remained fairly high, usually between 15 and 20 percent. In lateryears, as we shall see, the air force systematically cooked the books, reducingunidentifieds by explanatory methods that were absurd. In the early period, someanalysts took their task more seriously. Ruppelt explained the standards thatwould qualify a sighting as unknown:> the observer was not affected by any determinable psychological quirks and> that after an exhaustive investigation the object that was reported could not> be identified. To be classed as an unknown, a UFO report also had to be> “good,” meaning that it had to come from a competent observer and had to> contain a reasonable amount of data.75 [index_split_256.html#filepos1441935] The rigorous screening of reports helped to account for the relatively highpercentage of unknowns, despite the many official “explanations” that strainedthe limits of credulity. And with such a high percentage, it is small wonderthat military secrecy and deception were paramount to handling the UFO problem.But the investigation of flying saucers did not begin and end at ATIC. The armyand navy were both receiving UFO reports; by no means did all of them end up forstudy at Wright Field. Where were the reports going? At least some UFO reportswere going into CIA files as early as 1948. Years later, Hillenkoetter toldDonald Keyhoe that the CIA began at this time to keep “a close watch” on the UFOproblem, and even on the air force investigation.76[index_split_256.html#filepos1442076]Publicly, talk about flying saucers was in the opposite vein. Air forceofficials continued to deny any serious interest in flying saucers. Academia andthe media helped out. In late December 1947, astronomer C. C. Wylie, at an AAASconference, suggested that flying saucers were an example of national masshysteria. Press ridicule of UFOs remained intense, and newspaper articles thatprinted UFO reports were scarce. Yet, it often happened that when a reporterwent out to interview someone who had seen a UFO, military intelligence agentshad been there first and gotten the story, complete with sketches. Many peoplehad apparently been warned not to talk too much.77[index_split_256.html#filepos1442216]By the end of 1947, the discrepancy between truth and official truth in thematter of UFOs had already become a wide gulf.

Many of the reported objects were domed discsor cigar-shaped, maneuvered in formation, accelerated swiftly, and madereversals in flight. The Sign team, however, never agreed fully on the nature ofthese reports. Factions existed, variously believing UFOs to be nonsense,foreign technology, interplanetary spaceships, public psychosis, or a fadspawned by postwar nerves. The idea that this might derive from Germantechnology had not died out, based on an army memorandum dated January 21, 1948,which essentially repeated the thesis and verbiage of the Schulgen memo, andstressed the need to continue investigating leads that flying saucers might beSoviet in origin.1 [index_split_257.html#filepos1442487]On January 7, 1948, one of the earliest and most controversial UFO casesoccurred in the history of the U.S. military, and ended in the death of anexperienced fighter pilot. At 1:20 P.M., a large object was seen by thecommanding officer and others at Godman AFB, Kentucky. Personnel described italternatively as a bright disc-shaped object, round, and cone-shaped. The objectwas still visible at 2:30 P.M., when a flight of P-51s flew by the base. Capt.Thomas Mantell, the flight commander, was asked to look into it, if his missionallowed. Accompanied by two other planes, he tried to intercept the object.After climbing to fifteen thousand feet, his fellow pilots turned back becausethey were not equipped with oxygen. Nor was Mantell. Known to others as acautious man, he nevertheless kept going.At about 2:45 P.M., Mantell reported, “I have the object in sight above andahead of me, and it appears to be moving at about half my speed or approximately180 miles an hour.” When asked to describe it, he replied, “It appears to be ametallic object, and it is of tremendous size.” At about 3:15 P.M., or aboutthirty minutes after he first sighted the object, Mantell made his last contactwith the base: “Directly ahead of me and slightly above, and is now moving atabout my speed or better. I am trying to close in for a better look.” He toldone of the pilots that he would climb to twenty thousand feet and if no closerwould abandon chase. Mantell’s plane soon went into a downward spiral andcrashed, almost certainly after he lost consciousness from lack of oxygen.Mantell’s description of the object was not fully declassified until 1985. Thus,the air force explanation that he had mistakenly chased the planet Venusinitially went unchallenged, despite the seeming implausibility of the answer.No one in the air force seems to have believed it. The encounter, for instance,had been in the midafternoon, several hours before sunset. Also, Mantel hadobviously not described a celestial object. A review of the case in late 1948concluded, “It is apparent ... that the object sighted ... was not the planetVenus. Therefore, this sighting must be considered as unexplained.” Note thatMantell’s description of the object as a “metallic object” of “tremendous size”came well before his crash, thus presumably before a lack of oxygen would haveimpaired his judgment.In 1952, the air force, under continuing media pressure about the incident,ordered Blue Book chief Edward Ruppelt to reopen the case. Ruppelt learned thatbeginning in late 1947, the navy had secretly been launching high-altitudephotographic reconnaissance Skyhook balloons from Clinton County Air Field, inWilmington, Ohio. The balloons were large, with a diameter of about one hundredfeet, and could move along jet streams at the speeds indicated by Mantell, andoften flew at sixty thousand feet or higher. Ruppelt noted that on the same dayas Mantell’s sighting, many witnesses in Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky hadreported an object that could have been a balloon. He checked the weather andwind patterns for the day and concluded that Mantell’s object could also havebeen a Skyhook balloon. That was good enough for the air force, which announcedthe balloon explanation to the public. The only nagging problem was that Ruppeltwas unable definitely to establish that a balloon launch was made that day.It is possible that the object was a Skyhook balloon, but the case has certainfeatures which leave one wondering. Years after Ruppelt left the air force, BlueBook files indicated there were still no Skyhook plots available, although bythen such plots should have long since been declassified.Clifford Stone, a twenty-year U.S. Army veteran, has informed me that a navycolleague of his checked the Office of Naval Research for Skyhook balloon plots.The man said that ONR records indicated there was definitely no launch of aSkyhook balloon from at least January 6 to January 8, 1948, but also thatprobably none had been launched since late December 1947. No reason was givenfor the lack of precision in this matter. If true, however, it throws doubt on alikely Skyhook launch of January 7. Of course, the matter cannot be settleduntil someone publishes the actual records.It is also intriguing or coincidental that one of the other UFO sightings ofJanuary 7, 1948 came from none other than Clinton Army Air Field, where Skyhookballoons were launched. From 7:20 P.M. to 7:55 P.M., base personnel with fieldglasses studied an object that initially looked like an aircraft in trouble. It“seemed to be pretty high in the air,” appeared to change color from white tored, to hover and then move “with great speed.” During rapid descents, itappeared in the form of a cone or upside-down triangle. When it climbed, itseemed to turn itself right side up. A “green mist” was seen following theobject, which headed southwest rapidly and disappeared at about 7:55 p.m. It sohappened that Venus did set in the southwest that evening at about that time,and the air force therefore concluded that this had caused the confusion. Seenthrough the Earth’s lower atmosphere, Venus can create odd illusory effects.Moreover, while all of the personnel explicitly stated that the object was toobright to be a star, none of them mentioned the possibility of Venus in theirreport, or seemed aware of its presence. Still, the heading of Venus (245degrees) was not exactly where the personnel placed the object (210 degrees).The precision with which base personnel noted the object’s location and behaviorleave just enough doubt that some other explanation might be the answer. Onething seems clear: it was not a Skyhook balloon. If nothing else, the sightingshows how complex analyzing a typical UFO report can be.2[index_split_257.html#filepos1442688]During February and March, there was talk within Air Material Command aboutauthorizing a comprehensive plan to intercept UFOs. Indeed, Col. Howard M.McCoy, chief of intelligence for AMC, sent a proposal to Air Force Headquartersto station fighter aircraft at all bases on a continuous alert status for justthis purpose. The proposal was rejected on March 3 as not feasible. In the firstplace, said Headquarters, the outlay of aircraft and personnel would be toogreat. Second, proper interception was not considered possible, “except byaccident,” without complete radar coverage, which was beyond the capability ofthe air force. Finally, Headquarters doubted the ability of air force pilots tofollow up effectively from the many civilian reports that would be expected fromsuch a scenario.3 [index_split_257.html#filepos1443086]On March 17 and 18, the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board met at the Pentagonfor briefing and conference. Colonel McCoy was present and spoke briefly on thesubject of UFOs:> This can’t be laughed off. We have over three hundred reports which haven’t> been publicized in the papers from very competent personnel, in many> instances. ... We are running down every report. I can’t even tell you how> much we would give to have one of those crash in an area so that we could> recover whatever they are.4 [index_split_257.html#filepos1443230] McCoy’s statement contains two main points of interest. First, that the subjectof UFOs was serious, despite public statements to the contrary. There can be noquestion that McCoy was speaking the truth in this matter. Second, that no crashdebris had been recovered. An interesting statement, especially considering thatit was at Wright Field where alien bodies were supposedly kept, according tosome defenders of the crashed disc theory. As chief of intelligence at WrightField, McCoy would seem to be in a position to know whether or not such notionswere true. Recall Gen. Arthur Exon’s statements that rumors of alien bodiescirculated throughout Wright Field immediately following the Roswell crash. Allone can say is that McCoy told members at this meeting that nothing had beenfound. The statement may or may not have been truthful, and may or may not havebeen based on good information. We simply do not know.Shortly after this meeting, on April 5, another important incident occurred overWhite Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico. A team of navy missile trackers and ascientist tracked a UFO for several minutes as it streaked across the afternoonsky in a series of steep climbs and incredible maneuvers. The object appeared tobe disc- or oval-shaped, and about one-fifth the apparent size of the full moon.Most amazing was the object’s speed, which theodolites measured to be as fast as18,000 mph.As a result, Dr. Joseph Kaplan, a member of the Air Force Scientific AdvisoryPanel, secretly visited the area on April 27 and 28. Kaplan was charged withreviewing the UFO situation and, if necessary, recommending appropriatescientific measures. He spoke with people at the Kirtland AFB Office of SpecialInvestigations, AEC’s Sandia Base, Dr. Lincoln La Paz, and “several securitypersonnel at Los Alamos.” He decided that UFOs were “of extreme importance andshould be investigated scientifically.”5 [index_split_257.html#filepos1443384]"},{"pageContent":"THE SUMMER CRISIS OF 1948 As spring became summer, sightings increased and the situation reached adramatic climax. Sometime in the summer of 1948 (exact date unknown), thereoccurred a remarkable UFO encounter by the U.S. and Canadian air forces at GooseBay, Labrador. The account was later reported to NICAP by Air Force Maj. EdwinA. Jerome (Ret.), a former command pilot and air provost marshal for eightyears. A high-ranking inspection team that included several generals wasvisiting the base radar facilities when a radar operator picked up a target onhis scope moving at the incomprehensible speed of 9,000 mph. The generalsassumed that the American equipment was way off calibration. But nearby Canadianfacilities had obtained the same radar return. The inspecting officers were“appalled” over such a coincidence and attributed the sighting to a meteor.Jerome, involved in writing the intelligence report, discounted this because ofthe object’s altitude (a constant sixty thousand feet) and speed. The followingday, both radars reported an object hovering over the base at forty-fivethousand feet moving at 10 mph. The official explanation was that they wereprobably “high-flying seagulls.”6 [index_split_257.html#filepos1443598]In late July came two sightings of a brilliant, rocket-like object which shookthe analysts at Project Sign. On July 20, the Netherlands government reported tothe USAF that a wingless, cigar-shaped object with two decks of windows was seenflying rapidly on four separate occasions at The Hague. 7[index_split_257.html#filepos1443738] Then, on July 24, at 2:45 A.M, an EasternAir Lines DC-3 had a near-collision with an object of the same description nearMontgomery, Alabama. The pilots, C. S. Chiles and J. B. Whitted, as well as onepassenger, said the object rushed straight at them, then veered to the right ofthe airliner, emitted a long gust of red exhaust, and either shot up into theclouds or vanished. The pilots were adamant that the object was not a meteor. Anhour before, a similar object was seen by a ground maintenance crewman at RobinsAFB in Georgia, who was certain the object was no meteor.The Pentagon showed little outward interest, identifying the object as a weatherballoon. Behind the public facade, the air force took a strong interest. Ruppeltsaid it disturbed the Project Sign team more than the Mantell incident had. Theofficial explanation soon became “unknown,” but the members of the Project Signteam believed they identified this one—as extraterrestrial. The qualificationsof the witnesses, the incredible description of what they saw, and theup-close-and-personal nature of the sighting itself led them to endorse theextraterrestrial hypothesis as the most logical for the existence of UFOs.Allen Hynek conceded the faint possibility that the object seen might have beena fireball, but candidly called this “far-fetched.” Within a few years, however,the air force took this reed for its explanation. The pilots never agreed withit. Years later, they spoke at length with UFO researcher Dr. James McDonald,who was impressed by the detail they gave so many years after the fact. Hynekhimself doubted the fireball explanation. Throughout his career, he believedthat the sighting had no apparent astronomical explanation. 8[index_split_257.html#filepos1443894]"},{"pageContent":"“THE ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION” After the dramatic Chiles-Whitted sighting, the members of Project Sign preparedan “Estimate of the Situation.” No copy of this has ever surfaced. Throughoutthe 1950s and 1960s, the air force flatly denied its existence. However, Ruppeltclaimed to see one of the 1948 originals, as did Air Force Maj. Dewey Fournet,who prepared an affidavit in the late 1950s that confirmed the document’sexistence. Several researchers have looked for this document. UFO researcher JanAldrich, who searched Directorate of Intelligence and ATIC documents at theNational Archives II, estimated that perhaps 40 percent of the material waswithdrawn at its time of declassification in 1987. “Everyone had a say onwithdrawal,” he wrote, “CIA, DOD, USN, British Government, etc.”Regarding the Estimate itself, Ruppelt wrote:> The situation was the UFOs; the estimate was that they were interplanetary!> When the estimate was completed, typed, and approved, it started up through> channels to higher-command echelons. It drew considerable comment but no one> stopped it on its way up. The Top Secret Estimate then reached Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Hoyt S.Vandenberg, who rejected it. A group from ATIC went to see Vandenberg toreinforce their argument, but to no avail. Ruppelt said that some months laterthe report was completely declassified and “all but a few copies” were burned.Aldrich wrote that Ruppelt’s stated method for the destruction of thedocuments—declassification and burning—is incorrect procedure, and why he saidit, “a mystery.”The report was also said to have concluded that aliens were making a full-scaleobservation of the Earth, but that attack did not seem imminent. Officialsdecided to maintain secrecy until they gathered more information. Ruppelt toldKeyhoe privately, “The general said it would cause a stampede. ... How could weconvince the public the aliens weren’t hostile when we didn’t know itourselves?”A policy change ensued. At Project Sign, the ET hypothesis lost prestige.Everyone involved in writing the report was reassigned. Flying saucers were nowto be explained in a more “down to earth” fashion.9[index_split_257.html#filepos1444210]All indications show that the team at Sign was level-headed and serious aboutthe problem of UFOs. It is reasonable to suppose, then, that other prominentfigures also took the Chiles-Whitted sighting seriously—and by extension theentire UFO phenomenon. If so, then Vandenberg’s conclusion would have beenexactly what Keyhoe said it was: a means to keep the low-level investigation atProject Sign from straying into highly classified territory. In such asituation, Vandenberg would certainly not want his staffers to know very much.While the Estimate of the Situation was being prepared, Gen. Charles P. Cabell,head of the USAF Directorate of Intelligence, ordered Air Force IntelligenceHeadquarters to prepare its own analysis of the UFO situation. This document,completed in December, was prepared jointly with the Office of NavalIntelligence, and titled “Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the UnitedStates.” Some have referred to it as the “Ghost of the Estimate,” as a kind ofwatered-down version of the Estimate, but the two documents are independent.Indeed, as the Analysis was prepared by USAF Intelligence, which superseded theauthority of ATIC, the Analysis also superseded the Estimate.10[index_split_257.html#filepos1444500]Meanwhile, still in the immediate aftermath of the Eastern Air Lines UFOsighting, President Truman began receiving formal UFO briefings."},{"pageContent":"TRUMAN, LANDRY, AND UFOS Col. Robert B. Landry was President Harry S. Truman’s air force aide, serving asliaison with the air force for administrative and policy functions.

On October 1, 1948, an Air NationalGuard F-51 pilot in Fargo, North Dakota, named Thomas Gorman had a dogfight witha small, flat, circular UFO. While flying, Gorman saw a light about eight inchesin diameter displaying incredible movements. He repeatedly gave chase, each timeoutmaneuvered by the object. It eventually departed upward at high speed. Gormansaid he “had the distinct impression that its maneuvers were controlled bythought or reason.” Others witnessed this bizarre encounter. The light was seennear the aircraft by control tower operators and people from other locations atall angles. All gave consistent descriptions of what they saw. The air force,nevertheless, said that Gorman and the other witnesses had seen a lightedballoon. UFO researcher Jerome Clark agreed, calling this case greatlyoverrated. Others disagreed. Jacques Vallee put the matter this way:“twenty-minute ball lightning would be more surprising to the physicists thanflying saucers piloted by vegetable men.” James McDonald years laterreinvestigated the sighting, concluding that it was indeed valid, and somethingextraordinary.12 [index_split_257.html#filepos1444771]Two weeks later, on October 16, came a remarkable UFO sighting in Cache, Japan.This was an encounter of an F-61 Black Widow aircraft with an indeterminatenumber of UFOs. While on night patrol, the pilot and his crew picked up anobject on radar at about 200 mph. As he closed to intercept, the object speededup to 1,200 mph, then slowed down again. Six times the crew tried to close onthe UFO; each time, the object accelerated out of reach. On one pass the crewsaw the object’s silhouette, which looked “like a rifle bullet” twenty to thirtyfeet long. Intelligence reports indicated the UFO carried radar warningequipment, because it “seemed cognizant of the whereabouts of the F-61 at alltimes.” The sighting certainly impressed itself upon the pilot, who stated that“in my opinion, we were shown a new type of aircraft by some agency unknown tous.”13 [index_split_257.html#filepos1444989]More radar sightings occurred in early November at Goose Bay, Labrador, andJapan. During the night of November 18, near Andrews AFB in Maryland, a strangechase took place by a USAF Reserve pilot in pursuit of an oval-shaped UFO thatappeared as something like a ball of light (reminiscent of the Gorman case).14[index_split_257.html#filepos1445187] Then, on November 23, the first documentedsimultaneous visual and radar sighting of an unidentified flying object tookplace at Fursten-Felbruck AFB near Munich. An object was detected circlingrapidly at twenty-seven thousand feet. An F-80 pilot sent to intercept describedit as bright red. While he was moving to intercept, the object abruptly climbedto fifty thousand feet—at 900 mph, far beyond the capability of any knownaircraft. A second F-80 pilot verified the report. According to the air forceintelligence officers investigating the encounter, the object was not a balloon,and there were no reported aircraft in the area. The object, in fact, was“nothing we know of.” To the investigator, there remained a slim possibilitythat the object was some kind of experimental aircraft, except for the problemthat such craft were “not in Germany, can [not] climb twenty-three thousand feetin a matter of minutes, [nor] travel 900 miles per hour.” The sighting was neverofficially solved.15 [index_split_257.html#filepos1445363]"},{"pageContent":"THE GREEN FIREBALLS At 9:27 P.M. on December 5, 1948, an air force C-47 pilot at eighteen thousandfeet near Albuquerque observed a huge green fireball arch upward, then level offto horizontal trajectory. Seven minutes later, a Pioneer Airlines pilot saw alarge orange object approach in a flat trajectory, become green, then dodge tothe side and fall away toward the ground. Thus began the mystery of the greenfireballs, which the U.S. defense establishment in the Southwest studiedintensely.According to Ruppelt, “everyone, including the intelligence officers at KirtlandAFB, Air Defense Command people, Dr. La Paz, and some of the most distinguishedscientists at Los Alamos had seen at least one.” That is, all the people Kaplanhad spoken to the previous April following the White Sands sighting. No onecould figure it out. From December 1948 through April 1949, at least thirty-ninereports of green fireballs were sent to Air Material Command. Afterwards, theywere seen sporadically in the area for years.La Paz saw his first green fireball on December 12, 1948. He tracked theobject’s path and decided it was distinctly possible that it had flown over LosAlamos. Even more startling, however, was that the object maintained ahorizontal path at the extremely low altitude (for a meteorite) of eight to tenmiles. Moreover, it moved too slowly to be a meteor, and was completely silent.In a confidential memo dated December 20, 1948, La Paz argued that it was nometeor or fireball; if so, it was certainly no type he had ever studied. Helater told Ruppelt that he did not believe it was a natural phenomenon.By December 20, the interest in fireballs inspired the creation of an informalgroup called the Los Alamos Astrophysical Association. Its members, allscientists and engineers with security clearances, gained permission to examineseveral of Project Sign’s classified reports on the green fireballs. They agreedwith La Paz that the objects were not meteors. Some wondered whether the objectswere missiles being fired into the Earth’s atmosphere. But if so, how was such athing possible, and who would do it? Naturally, the question allowed for nosatisfactory answer.16 [index_split_257.html#filepos1445556]"},{"pageContent":"TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS By the end of 1948, Project Sign had received several hundred UFO reports, ofwhich 167 had been saved as “good.” Of these, about three dozen were classifiedas “unknown.” Ironically, as UFO reports became better and more numerous, theencouragement to study them waned. Elsewhere, however, people were thinkingabout the UFO problem. On December 10, 1948, air intelligence completed itstop-secret, nineteen-page “Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.” Thedocument did not suggest that UFOs might be extraterrestrial. But it did statethat the objects seen were real and baffling:> The frequency of reported sightings, the similarity in many of the> characteristics attributed to the observed objects, and the quality of> observers considered as a whole support the contention that some type of> flying object has been observed. ...

This document remained classified until 1985. While its conclusion may be lessincendiary than those claimed for the Estimate of the Situation, the reportshows continued concern about UFOs, continued speculation about the possibilityof their Soviet origins, and a continued lack of evidence to support such abelief.17 [index_split_257.html#filepos1445779]The matter of extraterrestrial origins, on the other hand, was studiouslyavoided. If one accepts the existence of the Estimate of the Situation, and theaccount from Ruppelt and others about how the air force leadership responded toit, then the tenor of the analysis is readily understandable: an ET explanationwas off-limits, and analysts naturally considered the remaining possibilities.However, even if the estimate were merely a figment of Ruppelt’s imagination,the conclusions of the analysis leave us with the distinct impression of the EThypothesis as the elephant in the dining room that no one would acknowledge.On December 16, 1948, General Putt changed the name of Project Sign to ProjectGrudge; the official switch occurred in February 1949. It signified a moreserious debunking and dismissal of UFOs. Grudge’s methods were twofold: explainevery UFO report, then tell the public how it had solved all sightings. Thechange was so pronounced that Ruppelt even wondered whether there was a hiddenreason. “Was it actually an attempt to go underground—to make the project moresecretive?” On the basis of what the record reveals, and especially in light ofthe recent Analysis, the answer is yes.18 [index_split_257.html#filepos1445958]"},{"pageContent":"1949: GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS In 1949, crashed disc stories circulated within the military. A Los Angeles UFOresearcher, Max Miller, later wrote about a story he heard in 1949 concerning aflying saucer crash somewhere in the Southwest. The saucer had supposedly beenretrieved and brought to an unnamed air force base; several tourists nearby eventook photos. Miller’s source for the story was an unnamed army sergeant. Laterthat year, variety columnist Frank Scully reported that the U.S. government hadrecovered spaceships that had crashed somewhere in the southwestern desert. Thisarticle served as the basis for Scully’s book published in 1950, Behind theFlying Saucers.Another rumor making the rounds in 1949 was the military’s determination tocapture a flying saucer. U.S. Air Force Capt. Edward Stone later told DonaldKeyhoe that the air force was ordered to “get” a flying saucer “by any possiblemeans.” Keyhoe tried to substantiate the story and claimed that an intelligencemajor named Jere Boggs admitted to him that it was true.

Yet, it is noteworthy that they were circulating throughthe military as early as 1949.19 [index_split_257.html#filepos1446139]The CIA’s Office of Scientific Intelligence continued to maintain an interest inUFOs at this time, according to a 1952 CIA memorandum (Good 1988, 330). Aninteresting sidelight to CIA activities of 1949, which indirectly concerns UFOs,featured the country of Albania. That year, the CIA took over the ambitiousBritish effort to build a sizable resistance movement there. Frank Wisnerorganized and manned the operation. His first choice was a young man namedRobert Low. Low became infamous twenty years later for his manipulation andsabotage of the University of Colorado project to investigate UFOs, known as theCondon Committee. But can we be sure this was the same Robert Low working forthe CIA in Albania? In his study of the Condon Committee, David Saundersmentioned in passing that Low had been a combat intelligence officer aboard adestroyer during the war, was honorably discharged in 1946, and earned amaster’s degree from Columbia University in 1948. The least we can say is thateverything seems to fit.

The pattern continued to emerge: Air Material Command and ATIC stonewalledon UFOs to their colleagues.On January 13, 1949, a U.S. Army Intelligence memo to the Pentagon expressedgreat concern over the green fireballs. The memo discussed the possibility ofSoviet mischief, but considered it more likely that “the United States may becarrying on some top secret experiments.... It is felt that these incidents areof such great importance, especially as they are occurring in the vicinity ofsensitive installations, that a scientific board be sent to this locality....”22[index_split_257.html#filepos1446629]On January 30, hundreds of New Mexico residents saw a spectacular greenfireball. Kirtland AFB immediately notified Washington and organized aninvestigation. La Paz managed a rough triangulation of the object, and estimatedits speed at between 25,000 and 50,000 mph. This should have caused an“ear-shattering” sonic boom. Instead, the object was totally silent. Thesighting gave La Paz more ammunition: he subsequently told Air Force Office ofSpecial Investigations Agent Paul Ryan that the objects were “surelyartificial.” Of course, that begs the question: to whom did they belong?23[index_split_257.html#filepos1446768]On January 31, the FBI issued a memo on UFOs, titled “Protection of VitalInstallations.” The classified document was sent to Hoover, the Army’s G-2, theOffice of Naval Intelligence, the Office of Special Investigations, andmentioned a meeting among these groups concerning UFOs. The key statement of thedocument:> Army intelligence has recently said that “the matter of ‘Unidentified> Aircraft’ or ‘Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,’ otherwise known as ‘Flying> Discs,’ ‘Flying Saucers,’ and ‘Balls of Fire,’ is considered top secret by> intelligence officers of both the army and the air forces.”24> [index_split_257.html#filepos1446908] On February 16, 1949, a secret conference was held at the Los Alamos ScientificLaboratory to discuss green fireballs and flying saucers in general. La Paz wasthere, as was Edward Teller, the inventor of the fuse for the atomic bomb, and anumber of military and scientific personnel. There were no representatives,however, from ATIC’s Project Sign/Grudge—an accurate signifier of how irrelevantATIC’s project really was. Even then, the air force’s investigation of flyingsaucers was not the only game in town, nor, it is clear, the most serious. A fewmatters about the conference are known. La Paz told attendees of Kaplan’sassurance that the green fireballs could not be explained by any secret trainingexercises. Teller thought the objects might not be solid, but perhaps some kindof electro-optic phenomenon. The panel recommended that the government ormilitary set up a series of stations to photograph and analyze the fireballs.AFOSI in fact sent this recommendation to AMC, which did nothing.25[index_split_257.html#filepos1447118]That month, Project Sign issued a final report on UFOs. Of the 237 UFO cases itcontained, forty-eight (or 20 percent) were unexplained, not including anadditional 13 percent where the “lack of evidence preclude[d] an explanation.”Many of the explanations themselves were, in Hynek’s words, “force-fits.”Despite the huge unexplained rate, the report concluded that there was toolittle evidence to prove or disprove an objective existence of flying saucers.It recommended closing the project when the air force determined the sightingsdid not represent a security threat to the nation. The report conceded that UFOscould not yet be dismissed as a security threat, and it rejected the likelihoodthat UFOs were Soviet. What, then, was the source of the threat? Implied, butnot stated, was that the threat would have to be coming from somewhere.26[index_split_257.html#filepos1447295]Opinions in the classified world diverged on UFOs. A March 15 CIA memo on UFOsfrom the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) dismissed the idea of UFOs asforeign aircraft, and suggested the possibility that they weremisidentifications of other phenomena. On March 25, an FBI memo sent to a largenumber of offices and officials stated the opposite conclusion, that they were“believed to be man-made missiles rather than natural phenomenon.” The memo alsostated that the Soviets had been developing an “unknown type of flying disc”since 1945, although this statement has never been substantiated.27[index_split_257.html#filepos1447468] On March 31, another CIA memorandum onProject Sign and UFOs stated the belief that UFOs “will turn out another ‘seaserpent.’ However, since there is even a remote possibility that they may beinterplanetary or foreign aircraft, it is necessary to investigate eachsighting.” 28 [index_split_257.html#filepos1447654] On April 19, the Air ForceOffice of Special Investigations at Kirtland AFB sent a list of fireball reportsto Air Force Headquarters.

Moore, whose name appeared inthe air force’s explanation of the Roswell incident of 1947. Moore launched theballoon at 10:20 A.M. and observed it through a theodolite with an assistant.Accompanying him were five others, including navy men and balloon personnel fromGeneral Mills. At 10:30, someone saw a whitish-silver, elliptical object inanother part of the sky, and everyone turned to observe and track it with thetheodolite, where it filled the scope. The object was “plainly visible.” The menruled out the possibility of another balloon, having just checked the directionof the wind. They computed the altitude of the object when they initially saw itat fifty-six miles and its initial speed at seven miles per second, or over25,000 miles per hour (although its estimated speed for the duration of thesighting was 18,000 mph). They judged the object’s size to be forty feet wide byone hundred feet long, but it moved too fast for anyone to identify surfacedetails. The object moved along its major axis and covered the entire sky inabout one minute. While in view, the object rapidly dropped its angle ofelevation, then shot upward out of sight. It made no sound. The case wasreported in detail in True a year later (March 1950).The air force failed to follow up in a way that inspired the confidence of theobservers, who ended up “disgusted” with the lack of a thorough investigationinto the matter. But the CIA seems to have been interested in the case. A reportin its files stated that the object> was not a balloon and was some distance away ... the flight would have> probably gone over the White Sands Proving Ground, Holloman AFB, and Los> Alamos....

Although the data andconclusions were a weak fit, journalists did not read the actual data, butinstead took their cue from the report’s conclusions and the air force’s publicstatement. On the heels of this came Sydney Shallett’s dismissive “What You CanBelieve About Flying Saucers” in the April 30 edition of the Saturday EveningPost. Air force intelligence had helped Shallett to prepare the article, whichwas widely interpreted to be official policy. Indeed, according to True magazineeditor Ken Purdy, Shallett “had Forrestal’s backing.” In all essentials, Purdywas right. Since November 1948, the air force had known, with some alarm, aboutShallett’s project. An intelligence memo stated the position that “publicity ofthis nature is undesirable but, if such articles are written, they will be lessharmful to the national interest if a degree of guidance in their preparation isexercised by the Directorate of Intelligence.” A memorandum was also drawn upfor Secretary of Defense James Forrestal but, according to UFO researcher JanAldrich, was probably never sent. Small wonder, as Forrestal was then havingproblems of his own. Still, the tenor of the letter spelled out the air forceattitude well enough:> It appears that articles of this nature would be less harmful to national> interests if the Department of the Air Force were authorised to assist the> Press in the preparation of such articles as they insist upon writing. It is> recommended that the Department of the Air Force be authorised to assist the> Press, upon request, in preparing such articles as they insist upon writing. In effect, the air force was saying, if you insist upon writing about UFOs,allow us to guide you. It personally took care of Shallett’s visit, withpredictable results.31 [index_split_257.html#filepos1448743]On May 9, Purdy asked Donald Keyhoe to investigate the flying saucer mystery forTrue, and warned him to “watch out for fake tips” at the Pentagon. At thispoint, Keyhoe thought that UFOs would probably turn out to be either American orSoviet missiles, and did not seriously entertain the idea ofextraterrestrials.32 [index_split_257.html#filepos1448942] His opinion changedafter speaking with several of his old friends who were now prominent within thenavy, including Adm. Delmar Fahrney, a leader in the navy’s guided missileprogram, and Adm. Calvin Bolster, who later became the director of the Office ofNaval Research (ONR). In 1949, Bolster was in charge of the special designsection of the Bureau of Aeronautics. He told Keyhoe:> Don, I swear it’s nothing the U.S. is doing. I’m in on all the special weapons> programs and I’m sure I would know. Our big cosmic-ray research balloons may> have caused a few “saucer” reports, but they don’t explain all the> sightings—especially those by experienced service and airline pilots. I> honestly don’t know the answer. Fahrney told Keyhoe that “we’re years from anything like the saucers’performance. And if we ever do match them, nobody’d be crazy enough to test thethings near cities or along airways.”33 [index_split_257.html#filepos1449091]In early May 1949, while the air force debunked, the 4th U.S. Army approachedAFOSI in San Antonio to offer assistance in investigating the green fireballs.The army actually insisted on participating, even after the initial response wasno. On May 5, the 4th Army arranged a meeting with personnel from AFOSI, ONI,Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC), the FBI, and the Armed Forces SpecialWeapons Project (AFSWP). The meeting took place at Camp Hood, and was the firstof a planned series of weekly meetings to discuss the fireballs. At thatmeeting, army and navy representatives agreed that they remained unexplained andwere a legitimate source of “grave concern.” AFSWP people believed the fireballsto be natural phenomena; AFOSI and FBI gave no opinion. The 4th Army pressed fora formal observation system, and in fact had just created one secretly.34[index_split_257.html#filepos1449234]The attitude taken publicly by the air force about UFOs continued to be theopposite of the private attitudes prevalent in every other service. FollowingShallett’s article, and amid the near-complete inactivity of Project Grudge, UFOsightings suddenly jumped sharply. Air Force Headquarters claimed that therecent publicity was to blame and issued a press release saying that UFOs werenothing but mass hysteria and misidentification of natural phenomena.35[index_split_257.html#filepos1449378]"},{"pageContent":"THE DEATH OF JAMES FORRESTAL The decline and death of James Forrestal remains an unresolved problem ofhistory. That Forrestal suffered from a spectacular mental breakdown through1948 and 1949 is undisputed. The reasons are less clear, but with possiblerelevance to this study.Throughout 1948, Forrestal locked horns with Air Force Secretary StuartSymington over defense spending. Truman demanded an impossibly balanced budget,and Forrestal’s job was to keep the services in line. He could not do this and,to some degree, would not. The result was the erosion of Truman’s confidence. Itmay not have mattered to Forrestal: like most of the country, he assumedTruman’s political career was over and that by the end of the year a Republican,probably Thomas Dewey, would be in the White House.But Forrestal, not Truman, was the doomed man. His relationship with Symingtonwent from bad to worse. For reasons still unclear, Symington “embarked upon akind of personal guerrilla warfare” against the Secretary of Defense. Throughoutthe fall and winter of 1948, Forrestal’s mental health, physical condition, andauthority as Secretary of Defense deteriorated. When Truman shocked the world inNovember by winning the presidential election, Forrestal had still not obtaineda budget consensus from the Joint Chiefs. Friends commented on his growingparanoia. He was convinced that “foreign-looking men” were following him andthat Symington was spying on him. Forrestal’s belief eventually came to theattention of Truman and Secret Service Chief U. E. Baughman, who decided thatForrestal was suffering from “a total psychotic breakdown.”On January 11, 1949, Truman informed Forrestal that Louis Johnson would soon bereplacing him as Secretary of Defense. By now, Symington and Attorney GeneralTom Clark were feeding stories to journalist Drew Pearson, in particular thatForrestal complained of “being followed by Jews or Zionist agents.” Forrestalaccused Clark of having the FBI shadow him, which Clark denied, but which couldwell have been true. Forrestal finally left office in a formal ceremony on March28, his last public appearance.What followed after the ceremony remains mysterious. “There is something I wouldlike to talk to you about,” Symington told Forrestal, and accompanied himprivately during the ride back to the Pentagon. What Symington said is notknown, but Forrestal emerged from the ride deeply upset, even traumatized, uponarrival at his office. Friends of Forrestal implied that Symington saidsomething that “shattered Forrestal’s last remaining defenses.” When someoneentered Forrestal’s office several hours later, the former Secretary of Defensedid not notice. Instead, he sat rigidly at his desk, staring at the bare wall,incoherent, repeating the sentence, “you are a loyal fellow,” for several hours.Forrestal was taken home, but within a day the air force flew him to Hobe Sound,Florida, home of Bob Lovett (a future Secretary of Defense). Forrestal’s firstwords were “Bob, they’re after me.” He met with Dr. William Menninger, of theMenninger Foundation, and a consultant to the surgeon general of the army. Capt.George N. Raines, chief psychologist at the U.S. Naval Hospital at Bethesda,soon arrived. It is not exactly clear what transpired during Forrestal’s briefstay in Florida. One story from Pearson was that Forrestal had severalhysterical episodes and made at least one suicide attempt, certain that theCommunists were planning an imminent invasion. Menninger, however, explicitlydenied that Forrestal had attempted suicide while in Florida. Forrestal did tellhim that on the day before Menninger’s arrival, he had “placed a belt around hisneck with the intention of hanging himself, but the belt broke.” Menninger,however, saw no marks on Forrestal’s neck or body. Nor did anyone find brokenbelts of any kind. Menninger considered it all a nightmare.On April 2, 1949, “for security reasons,” Forrestal’s coterie flew him toBethesda. During the trip from the air field to the hospital, Forrestal madeseveral attempts to leave the moving vehicle and was forcibly restrained. Hetalked of suicide, of being a bad Catholic, and several times of those “who aretrying to get me.” He was admitted to Bethesda under care of Raines, whodiagnosed Forrestal’s illness as involutional melancholia, a depressivecondition sometimes seen in people reaching middle age, often who saw their lifeas a failure. Upon arrival at Bethesda, Forrestal declared that he did notexpect to leave the place alive. In a highly unusual decision for a possiblysuicidal patient, Forrestal’s doctor was instructed by “the people downtown”(e.g., national security) to place him in the VIP sixteenth-floor suite.Meanwhile, Forrestal’s personal diaries, consisting of fifteen loose-leafbinders totaling three thousand pages, were removed from his former office andbrought to the White House, where they remained for the next year. The WhiteHouse later claimed that Forrestal had requested Truman to take custody of thediaries. Such a claim, frankly, is preposterous. Throughout 1948, Forrestal hadbecome increasingly alienated from Truman. Prior to the election, he had evenmet privately with leading Republicans to help insure his future with the Deweyadministration. Truman then abruptly fired him and replaced him with a man noteven remotely qualified for the job. Forrestal’s diaries contained verysensitive information that Truman’s people wanted to know about. Presumably theyhad ample time to review them during the seven weeks of Forrestal’shospitalization.During Forrestal’s first week in Bethesda, he received a treatment callednarcosis, essentially sedatives and tranquilizers. Throughout Forrestal’s timeat the hospital, access to him was severely restricted. His wife (with whom hewas not close), his two sons, Sidney Souers, Louis Johnson, Truman, andCongressman Lyndon Johnson each visited him once. Menninger visited twice.However, Forrestal was not permitted to see the several people he repeatedlycalled for: his brother, a friend, and two priests. Henry Forrestal, forexample, had repeatedly tried to see his brother but was refused until hethreatened to tell the newspapers and sue the hospital. He then visited hisbrother four times. Henry told Raines and the hospital’s commandant, Capt. B. W.Hogan, that James wanted to talk with a close friend, Monsignor Maurice Sheehy.Hogan acknowledged that the patient had requested this several times but said hestill would not allow it. Indeed, Sheehy had tried seven times to see Forrestal,each time told his timing was “not opportune.” Sheehan, a former navy chaplain,argued several times with Raines and received the impression that Raines wasacting under orders. Another priest, Father Paul McNally of GeorgetownUniversity, was also barred from seeing Forrestal, as was at least one otherfriend of the former Secretary.By mid-May, observers and visitors agreed that Forrestal was improving. Henrysaid that his brother was “acting and talking as sanely and intelligently as anyman I’ve ever known.” On May 14, 1949, Raines decided that he would leaveWashington in four days to attend a meeting of the American PsychiatricAssociation. After their last meeting on the morning of the eighteenth, Raineswrote that Forrestal was “somewhat better than on the corresponding day of thepreceding week.” Forrestal continued in good spirits throughout all of thetwentieth and twenty-first. He showed no signs of depression, was well dressed,shaved, and in good appetite.The official account of Forrestal’s death runs as follows. During the night ofMay 21-22, Forrestal was awake at 1:45 A.M., copying a chorus from Sophocles’sAjax from a book of world literature. A navy corpsman guarding Forrestal’s roomchecked in, as was his job every fifteen minutes. Forrestal told the corpsmanthat he did not want a sedative, as he intended to stay up late and read. (Avariation of this story appeared in the New York Times, which reported thatForrestal had been asleep at 1:30, then awake at 1:45.) The corpsman reportedForrestal’s refusal to the psychiatrist—Raines’s assistant—sleeping next door.They returned five minutes later to an empty room. The assistant later claimedthat Forrestal had sent the corpsman out on a “brief errand.” During this time,Forrestal walked to the diet kitchen across the hall, tied one end of hisbathrobe cord to the radiator, the other end around his neck, removed a flimsyscreen, and jumped from the sixteenth floor. The cord came untied, and he fellto his death after hitting part of the building on the way down.Forrestal’s most recent biographers discounted the possibility of murder,calling the Secretary’s death “a series of chance events.” Yet, thediscrepancies in the official suicide story were never clearly resolved, andseveral people close to Forrestal did not believe it. An early biographer ofForrestal, writing in the 1960s, noted that “even now... certain details havenot been made public,” and that some believed Forrestal’s death to be “very muchdesired by individuals and groups who, in 1949, held great power in the UnitedStates.” Others went further and maintained that Forrestal was murdered. HenryForrestal, for one, believed strongly that “they” murdered his brother—theybeing either Communists or Jews within the government. (Forrestal’s geopoliticsgave him a pro-Arab disposition.) Indeed, Henry later said that the more hethought about his brother being shut up at Bethesda and denied the right to seeFather Sheehy, the more it bothered him. He decided he was going to take hisbrother to the country to complete his recovery, and made train reservations toreturn to Washington on May 22. He also reserved a room at the Mayflower Hotelfor that day, then phoned the hospital to announce that he would arrive on May22 to take custody of his brother.Father Sheehy had reason to suspect murder. When he arrived at Bethesda NavalHospital after learning of Forrestal’s death, an experienced-looking hospitalcorpsman approached him through the crowd. In a low, tense voice he said,“Father, you know Mr. Forrestal didn’t kill himself, don’t you?” Before Sheehycould respond or ask his name, others in the crowd pressed close, and the manquickly departed.There are several odd elements concerning Forrestal’s final moments. First, thecorpsman guarding Forrestal was a new man, a young man named Robert WayneHarrison, Jr., someone Forrestal had never seen before. The regular guard duringthe midnight shift was absent without leave and, the story goes, had gottendrunk the night before. Harrison was the only person to have had direct contactwith Forrestal in the moments before his death, and it was on his word only thatthe official account rested.Also, Forrestal never finished writing the chorus from Sophocles, and in factstopped in the middle of a word. Quite possibly, Forrestal had not even writtenthe fragment that evening, especially if he had been asleep at 1:30 A.M. Howreasonable is it to suppose that, sometime between 1:30 A.M. and 1:45 A.M., hewoke up, got out some writing material, located a gloomy poem within a hugeanthology, copied out seventeen lines, put on his robe, crossed the hall to thediet kitchen, where he tightly wrapped and knotted his bathrobe cord around hisneck and presumably tied the loose end to the radiator under the window; thenclimbed up on the window sill and jumped.There is also an odd juxtaposition of a tightly knotted bathrobe cord aroundForrestal’s neck and the assumption that he tied the other end so loosely to aradiator that it immediately came untied and allowed him to fall to his death.This radiator was a rather improbable gallows: it was about two feet long, thetop was six inches below the sill, and it was attached to the wall with its basea good fifteen inches above the floor. But there was no evidence that thebathrobe cord had ever been tied to the small radiator in the first place. Ifthe cord had snapped under Forrestal’s weight, one end would have been foundstill fastened to the radiator. The cord did not break, however, and there wasnot a mark on the radiator to indicate it had ever been tied there. Moreover, ifForrestal wanted to hang himself, why choose a tiny window by anchoring himselfto a radiator when he much more easily could have done the job from a door orsturdy fixture, such as the shower curtain rod in his own bathroom? On the otherhand, if Forrestal wanted to go out the window, why bother with a cord? Why notsimply jump, a far easier proposition? In sum, we do not know that the cord wasever tied to the radiator, but we do know is it was tied tightly to Forrestal’sneck.Later inspection found heavy scuff marks outside the window sill and cementwork. Proponents of the suicide theory claim these were made by Forrestal’s feetwhile he was hanging by the neck from the radiator, and perhaps that hebelatedly changed his mind and tried to climb back in. But the scuff marks couldjust as easily have been made by his struggle with someone pushing him out thewindow.There are many other suspicious elements to this story, such as the decision toplace Forrestal on the sixteenth floor, which was exactly opposite what medicalopinion desired (the bottom floor of a nearby annex had been the first choice ofhis caretakers), but was pressed by unnamed individuals in Washington. Also, theofficial investigation of Forrestal’s death was as much of a sham as that ofPresident Kennedy would be fourteen years later. The hospital labeled his deatha suicide before any investigation; the county coroner hurried over to confirmthe hospital statements. In cases where there is even a slight possibility ofmurder, it is normal for a coroner to delay signing a death certificate until athorough investigation, an autopsy, and an inquest have been made. This did nothappen. Since the death occurred on a U.S. naval reservation, local police didnot investigate. Instead, the head of the naval board of inquiry immediatelyannounced he was “absolutely certain” that Forrestal’s death “could be nothingelse than suicide.”36 [index_split_257.html#filepos1449539]Why discuss the death of James Forrestal in a book about UFOs? Given thedefinite possibility that he was murdered, the UFO connection becomesintriguing. In the first place, Forrestal’s position within the defensecommunity made him de facto a key player in the formulation of UFO policy. Theproblem was of great importance to people high up the national security foodchain: we can infer that Forrestal, too, had an interest, even though theofficial records and biographers of Forrestal are silent about UFOs.Forrestal’s concern about being followed by “foreign-looking men” is a commondescription of the legendary-to-the-point-of-cliché Men in Black. He neverstated clearly just who he believed to be following him, at least notconsistently. Others assumed that he was talking about Communists, Jews, andWashington insiders, but they could only assume. Then there is the disconcertingrelationship with Air Force Secretary Symington. True, Symington consideredForrestal to be an enemy. But why, in the moment of Forrestal’s departure frompolitics, amid a spectacular psychological collapse, did Symington take it uponhimself to have a secret conversation with Forrestal that left him utterlyincoherent? This goes beyond mere conventional political maneuvering: what didSymington say—or do—to Forrestal?If for the sake of argument we speculate that Forrestal was murdered, we mustask why. What could have prompted someone in the national security apparatus toplan the death of the former Secretary of Defense? The budget issue? Hardly;that was settled by then. One proponent of the murder theory blamed Communistswithin the U.S. government, or perhaps even the KGB. The reason, it was claimed,had to do with Forrestal’s diaries and plans for a book after his release fromthe hospital. Forrestal certainly was an inveterate anti-Communist and mighthave been perceived as problematic for agents of the Soviets. It is also truethat the Soviets were no strangers to the art of staged suicides. But neitherwere the Americans, a fact unremarked by proponents of the “communist murder”thesis.UFOs, on the other hand, constitute the great hole of contemporary history. Weknow, at the very least, that this was a topic of great concern to those at thetop of American national security policy, despite the near-complete absence ofpublic references to it. An explanation centering on the UFO phenomenon accountsbetter than most for the complete unhinging of a successful and brilliantindividual, and more importantly, the need to silence someone who could nolonger be trusted. Did Forrestal learn a truth about UFOs that contributed tohis breakdown?Perhaps Forrestal’s psychological state was such that he did commit suicide. Thefacts of his death do not point toward this conclusion, but we do not havedefinitive knowledge. But consider the case of American journalist George Polk.A year before, Polk had been investigating corruption in the Greek militaryregime, elements of which then murdered him. The Communists were promptlyblamed, while America’s intelligence and media communities knowingly went alongwith the charade. Or, just a few years later, in 1953, when American biologicalweapons expert Frank Olsen “fell” from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel inNew York City, after he had a very bad LSD trip, courtesy of the CIA, and hadbecome a security risk. Hiding unpleasant realities from the public was nothingnew."},{"pageContent":"SUMMER AND FALL 1949 The U.S. military recorded several intriguing UFO encounters during the latespring of 1949, most of which Project Grudge wrote off brazenly as conventionalobjects. On May 21, the last day of Forrestal’s life, an F-82 fighter took offfrom Moses Lake AFB, near Hanford, Washington, to intercept a flying disc seenvisually and by radar over restricted airspace at twenty thousand feet. Beforethe F-82 became airborne, the disc veered south at a speed greater than a jetfighter. The pilot took off in pursuit, instructed to “intercept it in hopesthat it might be a disc.” But the object was long gone.37[index_split_257.html#filepos1449855]The key UFO sighting of the season was once again at White Sands, duringnavy-conducted upper-atmosphere missile tests. On June 10, 1949, observers sawtwo round white UFOs suddenly enter their field of vision and maneuver around amissile traveling at over 1,300 mph. The objects paced the missile on eitherside, then one object passed through the missile’s exhaust and joined the other.The now-unified object accelerated upward and left the missile behind. Accordingto Navy Capt. R. B. McLaughlin, five separate observation posts saw theincident. McLaughlin later reported the sighting, adding that “many times I haveseen flying discs following and overtaking missiles in flight at theexperimental base at White Sands....”38 [index_split_257.html#filepos1449995]In August 1949, a mere six months after Project Grudge commenced, it issued itsclassified final report, firmly debunking flying saucers. No evidence, itargued, showed the objects to be the product of a foreign government with asuperior technology, or were of any danger to American security:> All evidence and analysis indicates that reports of unidentified flying> objects are the result of: (1) misinterpretation of various conventional> objects; (2) a mild form of mass-hysteria and war nerves; (3) individuals who> fabricate such reports to perpetuate a hoax or to seek publicity; (4)> psychopathological persons. Thus, UFO witnesses were either ignorant (unable to identify conventionalobjects), hysterical with “war nerves,” liars and hoaxers, or crazy. “[F]urtherstudy along present lines,” the report added, “would only confirm the findingspresented herein.” Considering such a categorical conclusion, fifty-five of theProject’s 244 cases were unidentified, or 23 percent.The report suggested downscaling the investigation and study of UFO reports “toreflect the contemplated change of policy,” while at the same time keeping aheavy lid over them. In a key foreshadowing of the Robertson Panel more thanthree years later, the memo recommended that press releases should be created to“aid in dispelling public apprehension.”Allen Hynek helped to write the reports of Projects Sign and Grudge but latercriticized them. He complained about “the lackadaisical and irresponsible mannerin which many of the UFO reports were treated,” and contended that “[o]ver theyears, the Pentagon played loosely with statistics to support their positionthat all UFOs are misidentifications of natural phenomena—or outright hoaxes.Often statistical information was not fairly presented.” In the case of theGrudge Report, this complaint surely hits home. Throughout the entire history ofair force public reporting of UFOs, less than 2 percent of UFO sightings turnedout to be hoaxes or “psychological.” And yet the air force emphasized preciselythat element of reports.39 [index_split_257.html#filepos1450183]One remarkable thing about the Grudge Report is how opposite its tone was fromthe “Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.,” which, after all, hadbeen finalized only the previous December. That report had recognized thereality of UFOs, assumed the sighted objects were craft of some sort, and gavestrong consideration that the Soviets were behind it. What had happened in amere eight months to overthrow this assessment? The phenomenon had not goneaway. If anything, it had become more serious, and a wider group within theclassified world was now concerned. Nor had the Grudge team suddenly solved theUFO phenomenon. This was 1949, the height of the cold war. American defenseanalysts were continuing to harden their policy toward the Soviets, which by thespring of 1950 would culminate in NSC-68, an alarmist statement that in effectwarned Truman that the United States was losing the cold war. Within such acontext of unexplained airspace violations, of agitation and bewildermentexpressed by nearly every sector of the defense establishment, during the verymonth that the Soviet Union exploded its first nuclear device, what is one tomake of this cavalier disregard of unexplained objects in American skies knownas the Grudge Report? With everything known about the nature of the UFO problemin 1949 and the overall context of the cold war, one must conclude that theGrudge Report flies in the face of defense logic. It does, however, complyentirely with the needs of the defense community to manage the UFO problem froma public relations standpoint. The Grudge Report had no scientific value, butwas of supreme value as a management tool. In the twenty-first century, alongwith various statements about UFOs by the air force, CIA, NSA, NASA, and otherorganizations, it continues to retain this value as part of the officialexplanatory structure, as a way to manage the intractable problem of UFOs.So much for the famed Grudge Report. By the late summer of 1949, AMC stated thatthe green fireball phenomena would no longer be included in its UFO reports.Does this mean that the fireballs were officially discounted as unidentifiedflying objects? Not exactly. AMC simply handed the fireball problem to the airforce’s Cambridge Research Laboratory, which established what became known asProject Twinkle. The plan was to triangulate and photograph the fireballsthrough three cinetheodolite stations. Dr. Lincoln La Paz directed the effort.By mid-September of 1949, Hoyt Vandenberg ordered the new AMC commander, Lt.Gen. Benjamin Chidlaw, to have his Boston labs evaluate the New Mexico and Texassightings, and to consider the creation of an instrument network.40[index_split_257.html#filepos1450636]Meanwhile, the Los Alamos meetings continued. On October 14, 1949, sixteenrepresentatives from the U.S. 4th Army, Armed Forces Special Weapons Project,FBI, AEC, Geophysical Research Division of Air Material Command, and the AirForce Office of Special Investigations met to discuss the green fireballs. Inthe words of an AFOSI confidential memo, “... the continued occurrence ofunexplained phenomena of this nature in the vicinity of sensitive installationsis cause for concern.” The debate was not whether the phenomenon was real, butwhether it was natural or artificial. UFO researcher Jerome Clark later pointedout that if the fireballs were all natural phenomena, why would they belocalized in New Mexico, and why so recently? The meeting attendees probablywondered the same thing.41 [index_split_257.html#filepos1450819]Sometime during the fall of 1949 there occurred a UFO sighting over “a keyatomic base,” possibly in New Mexico, involving a high-ranking air force officerand the tracking by radar of five apparently metallic UFOs. The objects flewover the base “at tremendous speed and great height.” Radar tracked them at upto one hundred thousand feet, moving three hundred miles in less than fourminutes (about 4,500 mph). The incident is one of many missing from the archivedBlue Book files but was reported in a 1952 Life magazine article. According toUFO researcher Richard Hall, there is “no doubt about its authenticity,” eventhough the case eludes complete documentation.42[index_split_257.html#filepos1450986]"},{"pageContent":"“THE FLYING SAUCERS ARE REAL!” In late December 1949, Donald Keyhoe’s article “The Flying Saucers are Real”appeared in True Magazine. Keyhoe argued that the higher-ups in the military,primarily the air force, knew that flying saucers were real, were of alienorigin, and were covering up the information from the public in order to avoidpanic. The edition was True’s best-selling ever, and the air force found itselfburied under letters, telegrams, and phone calls demanding information about theflying saucers.The air force responded by releasing the six-hundred-page Grudge Report(completed the previous August) on December 27, 1949, and announced theproject’s termination. It strongly implied that it would no longer investigatereports of unidentified flying objects, and repeated the thesis that UFO reportswere “the result of: (1) misinterpretation of various conventional objects; (2)a mild form of mass hysteria; or (3) hoaxes.”43[index_split_257.html#filepos1451140]Press coverage was either sympathetic or apathetic, but in any case uncritical.The media failed to pick up on the significance of a 23 percent unexplainedratio. Instead, it acted as a nearly single entity in accepting the air force’s“final word” on the subject, that there was nothing to the UFO phenomenon. TheGrudge Report therefore received minimal publicity. History repeated itselftwenty years later, when the deeply flawed Colorado University study of UFOsencountered a similarly compliant media that read introductions instead of data."},{"pageContent":"UFO SECRECY AND PUBLICITY IN EARLY 1950 On the night of January 22-23, 1950, near the Bering Sea at Kodiak, Alaska, navypatrol pilot Lieutenant Smith made a routine security flight. At 2:40 A.M., heobtained a radar reading of an object twenty miles north, which quicklyvanished. Eight minutes later, he picked up either the same or a differentobject. He radioed Kodiak to learn that no known aircraft were in the area. TheKodiak radar officer then reported that he was receiving interference, the likesof which he had never experienced.At about 3 A.M., the USS Tillamock was south of Kodiak when one of the men ondeck saw “a very fast-moving red glow light, which appeared to be of exhaustnature.” The object came from the southeast, moved clockwise in a large circlearound Kodiak, and returned to the southeast. Another officer came out to look,saw it in view for thirty seconds, and described it as like “a large ball oforange fire.” No sound came from the source of the light.At 4:40 A.M., Lieutenant Smith, still on airborne patrol and experiencing noradar problems, now picked up another blip on his radar—so fast that it left atrail on his screen. Smith called his crew, who immediately saw the object closea five mile gap in ten seconds, an apparent speed of 1,800 mph. He tried topursue the object, but it was too maneuverable. Witnesses described two orangelights that rotated around a common center. At some point the object made asharp turn and headed directly toward Smith’s plane. He “considered this to be ahighly threatening gesture” and turned off his lights. The UFO flew by anddisappeared.At least thirty-six copies of the navy’s detailed report were sent to varioussecurity agencies, including the CIA, FBI, air force intelligence, and theDepartment of State. None of these copies were ever released or published,although a truncated FBI copy surfaced in the 1970s as the result of a Freedomof Information Act request. The document’s explanation: “the objects must beregarded as phenomena ... the exact nature of which could not be determined. ”44[index_split_257.html#filepos1451452]And yet publicly, the air force had stopped investigating UFOs! Ruppelt claimedthat UFO investigations at this time rated “minimum effort.” The old ProjectGrudge files, he said, had been “chucked into an old storage case,” and manyreports were missing when he sifted through them a few years later. What, then,of the Kodiak case? We do not know the military’s response to this, but Ruppeltnoted that early in 1950, the director of air force intelligence (one of therecipients of the Kodiak report) sent a letter to ATIC indicating that he hadnever issued any order to end Project Grudge. ATIC replied weakly that it hadnot actually disbanded Grudge but merely transferred its project functions andno longer considered it a special project. It is possible that the Kodiakincident sparked this exchange.45 [index_split_257.html#filepos1451644]Throughout the early part of 1950, bizarre accounts of alien crashes and bodiespersisted. Time’s January 9 issue reported rumors about crashed saucers andsmall humanoid bodies in New Mexico. A January 16 air force intelligence memo toheadquarters reported that stories of crashed saucers in the Southwest weremaking the rounds in Denver, and were reported in a Kansas City newspaper. Thebodies were said to be three feet tall, and the recovered metals defiedanalysis.46 [index_split_257.html#filepos1451793]In March, J. Edgar Hoover himself wrote a memo: “Just what are the facts re‘flying saucers’? A short memo as to whether or not it is true or just what airforce, etc., think of them.” The air force replied with the standard“misidentifications” and “weather balloons” routine. We do not know whatHoover’s response was.47 [index_split_257.html#filepos1451934] On March 18, theair force publicly denied that UFOs were secret missiles or space-explorationdevices.48 [index_split_257.html#filepos1452106]More controversial is a March 22, 1950, memo addressed to Hoover by FBI AgentGuy Hottel of the Washington Field Office. It was titled “FlyingSaucers—Information Concerning.” According to the memo:> An investigator for the air forces stated that three so-called flying saucers> had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in> shape with raised centers, approximately fifty feet in diameter. Each one was> occupied by three bodies of human shape but only three feet tall, dressed in> metallic cloth of very fine texture.... 49> [index_split_257.html#filepos1452246] UFOs continued to vex American pilots. One January night on theSeattle-Anchorage route, an air freighter was paced for five minutes by anunidentified flying object. The pilots decided to close on the object, whichthen zoomed away. The airline head was later questioned by intelligence officersfor four hours. In his words: “From their questions, I could tell they had agood idea of what the saucers are. One officer admitted they did, but hewouldn’t say any more.”50 [index_split_257.html#filepos1452434] NearDavis-Monthan AFB on February 1, 1950, a bomber pilot chased a UFO which left asmoke trail. The head of the University of Arizona Department of Astronomy wascertain the object was no meteor or other natural phenomenon. At Key West,Florida, on February 22, navy pilots and others saw two glowing UFOs, confirmedby radar, above the Boca Chica Naval Air Station. A plane was sent up toinvestigate, but was “hopelessly outdistanced.” Radar men tracked the objects asthey momentarily hovered at an extreme altitude. After a few seconds, theobjects rapidly sped away.51 [index_split_257.html#filepos1452574]Meanwhile, the interest in flying saucers that had been raised by Keyhoe’sarticle continued into the spring. In March of 1950, True published, “HowScientists Tracked Flying Saucers,” by Cmdr. R. B. McLaughlin, which describedthe events at White Sands from the previous year. The navy cleared his story,even though it directly contradicted every air force press release on thesubject. But the competition between the navy and the air force was intense atthis time, and may well have affected the decision to print the article. The airforce offered no direct comment, except “behind nearly every report tracked downstands a crackpot, a religious crank, a publicity hound, or a maliciouspractical joker.”52 [index_split_257.html#filepos1452743]"},{"pageContent":"SPRING 1950: AN OUTBREAK OF UFOS Despite air force statements, the UFOs kept coming. During the early spring of1950, they made a number of startling appearances over American andinternational skies. Apparently their operators had not read the Grudge Report.An extraordinary encounter took place on March 8, 1950, once again right overATIC in Dayton. In mid-morning, TWA pilot Capt. W H. Kerr reported to the CivilAeronautics Administration (CAA) that he and two other TWA pilots saw a UFOhovering at a high altitude. The pilots were unaware that CAA had received abouttwenty other reports describing a UFO in the area. ATIC control tower operatorssaw the object, and their radar had an unidentified target in the same position.Something was up there.Wright-Patterson AFB sent four F-51 fighters to intercept. Two of the pilots sawthe object, which appeared round and, in the words of one of them, “huge andmetallic.” It appeared to be hiding in a cloud formation, which prevented thepilots from closing on it. They eventually turned back. The master sergeant whotracked the object on radar stated, “The target was a good, solid return ...caused by a good, solid target.” Witnesses reported that the UFO climbedvertically out of sight at high speed.A report was sent to the Civil Aeronautics Authority in Washington, then turnedover to air force intelligence. ATIC’s official answer was that the UFO had beenthe planet Venus. The radar return, they said, was caused by ice-laden clouds.The pilots and radar men vehemently disagreed.53[index_split_257.html#filepos1452957]A variety of military encounters occurred in rapid succession. One was atSelfridge AFB in Michigan, where a lone UFO caused multiple radar sightings andwas tracked at up to 1,500 mph. Another occurred March 16 at the naval airstation in Dallas, when a chief petty officer saw a disc-shaped UFO approach aB-36 from below, hover for a moment, then speed away. The air station commanderconfirmed the sighting.54 [index_split_257.html#filepos1453136]All spring, commercial airline personnel reported UFOs in droves to the airforce. These typically involved objects of disc or circular design, combinedwith exceptional maneuverability and speed. In at least one case, an airportwatch supervisor saw an unidentified light split into two lights which revolvedaround each other, similar to the Kodiak case. Yet another sighting at LosAlamos occurred on April 17, 1950, when more than fifteen people reported seeinga UFO for twenty minutes at two thousand feet on the eastern horizon. Oneobserver, a scientist from the University of California, watched one of thethree objects through a telescope and said the object looked flat, metallic,roughly circular, and about nine feet in diameter. The object moved “faster thanany known conventional aircraft.” It apparently put on quite a show.55[index_split_257.html#filepos1453302]Up to this point, there had been a few photographs taken of UFOs, some of themof reasonably good quality. But the two pictures taken on May 11, 1950,surpassed in quality and credibility anything up to that point, as well as mostphotos since. These were the photographs taken in McMinnville, Oregon, by Mr.and Mrs. Paul Trent, a farming couple who saw a classic flying saucer over theirland early one evening. They took two clear shots of it. Fortunately, betweenpictures, as the object was moving away, the couple also changed their position,therefore allowing a detailed photographic analysis of the object. The Trentsassumed they had seen some type of exotic military aircraft. They did notdevelop the film in their camera until they used it up, and showed the photosonly to a few friends. Eventually it reached the cover of Life, but even thenthe Trents never showed any desire to make money from the photos.In 1968, the Condon Report said of the photos:> This is one of the few UFO cases in which all factors investigated, geometric,> psychological, and physical, appear to be consistent with the assertion that> an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disc-shaped, tens of meters> in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within the sight of two witnesses. In the weeks after their sighting, the Trents were visited by representatives ofthe air force and FBI and were asked many questions. An air force agent demandedand received the pictures and negatives from Bill Powell, who had persuaded theTrents to loan them to him. Although Powell repeatedly requested the photos andnegatives back, the air force never returned them.Over the years, skeptics made several attempts to prove the photos were a hoax.This was the only viable method of debunking them, as the image cannot in anysense be interpreted as something other than a “flying saucer.” Several computerenhancement tests, however, proved conclusively that the object was not a modelsuspended on a string—the only seemingly possible hoax method. The Trentsthemselves have been universally judged to be low-key, honest individuals. Aslate as 1990, they stood by their story, and the photographs remain a majorpiece of UFO evidence.56 [index_split_257.html#filepos1453498]"},{"pageContent":"KEEPING THE LID DOWN The sightings of the spring of 1950 were the most significant wave since 1947.Ironically, they occurred on the heels of the “final” word by the air force onthe subject of flying saucers. So far as the public was concerned, the matterwas supposed to be dead, and had appeared to be manageable. But by the middle of1950, it did not necessarily appear so.The outbreak of war in Korea on June 23 monopolized American attention andprovided the impetus for quadrupling the U.S. military budget. Meanwhile,concern persisted for keeping the lid over UFOs. A July 6 air force memorandumexpressed strong interest to acquire motion pictures of a UFO taken by acivilian, but not in a way to arouse suspicion of air force interest.57[index_split_257.html#filepos1453698] Another memorandum dated July 19, from thechief of the Intelligence Technical Analysis Division, stated that too much timewas being spent in investigating flying saucer reports. “Excessive contacts canonly serve to keep our interest in these matters a subject of discussion by morepeople than we would like.”58 [index_split_257.html#filepos1453840]The air force was not the only service investigating UFOs. Navy pilots reportedmany. On June 24, a cigar-shaped UFO paced a United Airlines plane for twentyminutes about one hundred miles northeast of Los Angeles. The object was seen bythe plane’s crew, as well as the crews of another commercial airliner and a navytransport plane. The navy pilot saw the UFO for three minutes. He described itas dark gray and giving the appearance of a faint, shimmering, heat radiation atthe tail end. He estimated the object’s altitude at between fifty thousand andone hundred thousand feet, and moving at 1,000 to 1,500 mph. The object changeddirection while he had it in view. The crews of the three planes discussed thematter with two CAA ground stations. Another navy sighting occurred July 11. Twonavy aircraft crews near Osceola, Arkansas, saw a domed, disc-shaped object passbefore them; the sighting was confirmed by airborne radar. The object firstappeared to be a round ball ahead and to the left of their plane. It crossedtheir flight path and looked like “a shiny, shallow bowl turned upside down.”Around this time, Keyhoe’s friend Adm. Delmar Fahrney told him privately, “Therehave been too many convincing reports, and if the flying saucers do exist theymust be interplanetary. Certainly neither we nor the Russians have anythingremotely like them.”59 [index_split_257.html#filepos1453979]The U.S. Army was also interested in UFOs. A July 30 memorandum from Maj. U. G.Carlan stated that objects from this date were being seen over the HanfordAtomic Energy Commission Plant. Air force fighter squadrons and the FBI werealerted to the matter. AEC stated that “the investigation is continuing, andcomplete details will be forwarded later.”60[index_split_257.html#filepos1454139]The FBI and CIA continued their interest. An August memo received by FBIHeadquarters was titled, “Summary of Aerial Phenomena in New Mexico.” The memodiscussed the ongoing green fireball phenomena and noted that OSI was concernedwith the continued appearance of unexplained phenomena in the vicinity ofsensitive installations in New Mexico. The memo reiterated that Lincoln La Pazdid not believe the objects to be meteors.61[index_split_257.html#filepos1454288]Meanwhile, the CIA was collecting reports about UFOs overseas. An August 4report described a sighting from a ship in the north Atlantic en route from NovaScotia to an eastern U.S. port. The object was fifty to one hundred feet abovethe water, initially moving at about 25 mph, appeared to be about ten feet indiameter, of a shiny aluminum color, and cylindrical-shaped. It made no noiseand wobbled slightly, disappeared over the horizon, then reappeared. The ship’scaptain was among the three witnesses and observed the object at about a mileaway through binoculars for ninety seconds. He described it as “the like ofwhich I have never seen before.” Shortly after the men sighted the object, itrapidly accelerated and traveled away at a “tremendous rate of speed.” One ofthe other witnesses described the sighting as “one of the most frighteningexperiences I have ever had.” The CIA report concluded that> it is quite evident to the intelligence officers who interviewed these men> that they had certainly seen some very unusual object which they could not> identify but was just as certainly not any conventional type of aircraft.62> [index_split_257.html#filepos1454459] "},{"pageContent":"THE MONTANA FILM The year 1950 was not only the year of a first-rate photograph of a UFO(actually two, by the Trents), but of a startling sighting caught on 16 mm moviecamera film. The man operating the camera was Nicholas “Nick” Mariana, generalmanager of a local baseball team in Great Falls, Montana. The exact date of thesighting is unclear, the main candidate being August 5, although severalresearchers lean toward the fifteenth. While inspecting a baseball field priorto a game, Mariana saw two odd, bright lights. He retrieved his movie camera andbegan to film the objects, which were now moving. He captured them passingbehind a water tower, which provided a frame of reference for measuringdistance, size, altitude, azimuth, and approximate speed.Excited by what he had captured on film, Mariana sent it out immediately fordevelopment. He showed the film to various civic groups during September andOctober, and met with an air force officer in October, who took it for analysis.Upon returning his film, the air force said that two jet interceptors had beenin the area when the film was taken and might have been responsible for thesighting. Mariana disagreed, as he (and his secretary, who was with him duringthe filming) claimed to see the jets in another part of the sky.In 1952, officers at Wright-Patterson AFB asked Mariana if they could review hisfilm again, and he sent it to them. The navy also appears to have reviewed it.Once again, air force records showed that two F-94 fighters had landed at thelocal air force base at the time of the alleged UFO sighting. Several problemsemerged, however. First, analysis showed that Mariana had been mistaken in hisclaimed time of observation, judging by the particular reflections given off bythe objects. Second, Mariana still claimed to have seen the air force jets inanother part of the sky. Third, a photogrammetric analysis by Dr. Robert Bakerof Douglas Aircraft concluded that the air force explanation—that the imageswere reflections off jet aircraft—was “quite strained.”Identifying the sighting as “possible aircraft,” the air force once againreturned the film to Mariana. This time, Mariana claimed that the film wasmissing the thirty-five best frames, which had shown the objects more clearly asdisc-shaped. The air force responded that it had removed a single, damaged,frame and had said so in a letter to Mariana. Mariana claimed that the air forcehad sent him a letter that would prove his accusation, but he never produced it.One final problem associated with the date of the film. The air force consideredboth August 5 and 15 as the two possibilities. Later examination showed that theGreat Falls baseball team had no home games between August 9 and 18, which wouldappear to eliminate August 15 as a candidate. If this is so, then the airforce’s “possible aircraft” explanation is no longer tenable, as records did notshow any aircraft on the fifth in the correct location at the time of thefilming. (Of course, Mariana claimed to see those jets.) Seemingly supportingMariana’s claim is the statement of Edward Ruppelt, who also reinvestigated thiscase. Ruppelt determined to his satisfaction that the two jets were nowhere nearwhere the UFOs had been.All studies of the Montana film agree that it was not faked, that the objectsappeared to be disc-shaped. The Condon committee analysis of the film in the1960s said that the evidence eliminated the possibility of the objects beingbirds, balloons, mirages, or meteors, and considered it unlikely, although notimpossible, that the objects were jets.63 [index_split_257.html#filepos1454649]"},{"pageContent":"SCULLY, SARBACHER, SMITH, AND KEYHOE In early September, the first book on UFOs was published, Frank Scully’s Behindthe Flying Saucers. It is best known for its tale of dead humanoid aliens andcaptured flying saucers in the American Southwest, beginning in 1948. Almostuniversally, the book was panned. His main source for this information was anoil prospector named Silas Newton and a mysterious “Dr. Gee,” later identifiedas Leo GeBauer, a con man with a long arrest record. In 1952, True commissionedJ. P. Cahn to check Scully’s story, which Cahn exposed as a hoax in his article“The Flying Saucers and the Mysterious Little Men.” The story, wrote Cahn, was aploy to gain the attention of potential investors in a bogus oil detectionscheme allegedly linked to ET technology. UFO researcher Jerome Clark calledScully “naive” and wrote that “there seems no doubt that Scully was a victim,not a perpetrator, of the hoax.” Most UFO researchers agree with thisassessment.64 [index_split_257.html#filepos1454889]Not all, however. Jim and Coral Lorenzen analyzed claims of occupant sightingsmore thoroughly than any other researchers during the early years. In 1975, theywrote that Scully was either telling the truth or was “a prophet.” Smallhumanoids generally answering his description had been seen a number of times,they said. But the approval of the Lorenzens never overcame the effect of Cahn’sarticle.65 [index_split_257.html#filepos1455025]Scully may have been duped. Nevertheless, his book received serious attentionfrom some people in the Pentagon. This should not be surprising, as secretUFO-related conversations had been taking place all summer long amonggovernment, military, and intelligence people. On September 15, Canadiangovernment official and engineer Wilbert Smith came to the U.S. with severalcolleagues and met in the office of Robert Sarbacher, a physicist with the U.S.Defense Department Research and Development Board. During this meeting, Smithand Sarbacher discussed Scully’s book and UFO secrecy in general. Sarbacher toldSmith that “the facts reported in [Scully’s] book are substantially correct.” ToSmith’s question as to whether saucers exist, Sarbacher replied, “Yes, theyexist,” and “we have not been able to duplicate their performance.” He also toldSmith that the UFO subject was “classified two points higher even than theH-bomb. In fact, it is the most highly classified subject in the U.S. governmentat the present time.” As for the reason for the classification, Sarbacherreplied, “You may ask, but I can’t tell you.”Both men confirmed the reality of this conversation. A handwritten transcript ofthe conversation was found among Smith’s papers after he died. Sarbacherconfirmed its truth in 1983, a few years before his own death. Sarbacher alsoconfirmed that debris recovered from an alien vessel was “extremely light andvery tough” and described the debris in a manner consistent with descriptions ofthe Roswell wreckage.66 [index_split_257.html#filepos1455194]Smith found Scully’s theory of UFO magnetic propulsion to be of interest, as itcoincided with his own thoughts on the matter. He was also interested inKeyhoe’s thoughts on UFOs (Keyhoe himself was about to publish his first UFObook). While in the U.S., he met Keyhoe for the first time, discussed UFOquestions, and began a long friendship. Smith mentioned the Canadiangovernment’s plans for “Project Magnet,” which was designed to track UFOs, butdoes not appear to have told Keyhoe of the conversation with Sarbacher.Regarding UFOs, Smith said the Canadians have> weighed three possibilities. One, they’re interplanetary. Second, they’re a> United States secret device. Third, they’re Russian. The last two don’t stand> up. From the weight of evidence I believe the saucers come from outer space.> And I think their appearance is what suddenly increased your government’s> interest in space travel and an artificial satellite.

On November 21, 1950, Smith wrote a Top Secret memo mentioningflying saucers:> I made discreet enquiries through the Canadian embassy staff in Washington,> who were able to obtain for me the following information: (a) the matter is> the most highly classified subject in the United States government, rating> higher even than the H-bomb; (b) flying saucers exist; (c) their modus> operandi is unknown, but concentrated effort is being made by a small group> headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush; (d) the entire matter is considered by the United> States authorities to be of tremendous significance.68> [index_split_257.html#filepos1455815] If Smith knew what he was writing about, and he appears to have, then here isyet more evidence of the sham nature of the moribund Project Grudge."},{"pageContent":"ANOTHER CRASH? Military encounters with UFOs continued at a brisk rate for the remainder of theyear. Beginning on October 12, a substantial wave of UFO sightings began againover restricted airspace in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. For the next three weeks, nofewer than sixteen UFO incidents there were recorded in an FBI memo andcontinued into late December.69 [index_split_257.html#filepos1456017]The FBI wrote another UFO memo (author unknown) on December 3, 1950, advisingarmy intelligence in Richmond, Virginia, “very confidentially” that they havebeen put “on immediate high alert for any data whatsoever concerning flyingsaucers.” It stated, “CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) advises data strictlyconfidential and should not be disseminated.”70[index_split_257.html#filepos1456232]It is possible that a UFO crashed near Laredo or Del Rio, Texas, on December 6,1950, although less is known about it than the event at Roswell. Col. RobertWillingham signed an affidavit in 1977 stating that while F-94s were beingtested at Dyess AFB, radar caught a UFO on a high-speed intercept course withthe planes. Some of the personnel saw the object shortly afterward, whichWillingham claimed was not a missile. The object “played around a bit” and evenmade ninety-degree turns at high speed. North American Air Defense (NORAD)tracked it, and the object was said to have crashed near the Mexican border.Willingham said that he and a copilot took a light aircraft to the site but wereimmediately escorted away. On his way back, he saw what looked like part of thecrash field and picked up a small piece of metal, possibly debris, from theground. Willingham claimed that, like the Roswell debris, this metal “justwouldn’t melt.” He took it to a Marine Corps metallurgy lab in Hagerstown,Maryland, for analysis, never saw the metal again, and was even told that theman he asked for had never worked at the lab, nor did anyone there know anythingabout it. He claimed he was later told never to discuss the matter.71[index_split_257.html#filepos1456399]One noteworthy feature of Willingham’s affidavit is the year he gave it: 1977, afull year before Stanton Friedman spoke with Maj. Jesse Marcel, and well beforethe development of the Roswell lore."},{"pageContent":"1950 TO 1951 Thanks largely to Keyhoe, and despite all efforts by the air force and even theWhite House, UFOs became an important media issue for the first time in threeyears. The year 1950 was also a year of significant sightings by many trainedairline personnel. It featured one of the best-ever photographs taken of a UFO,and the most striking motion footage to date. It was a year of continued, andseemingly unharassed, violations by UFOs over restricted military airspace,including Air Force Headquarters and several key scientific sites. During thesummer, intelligence personnel in the air force, navy, and army, as well as FBIand CIA staffers, were involved to some extent in the investigation of UFOs,while at the same time diligently hiding this fact from the public. Throughoutthe year, rumors of crashed discs and dead aliens pervaded the air force,reached the FBI, and even spilled over into the media. It was a year of severalhigh-level conversations confirming interest and secrecy about UFOs, of variousplans by the American and Canadian governments to track UFOs, and may havefeatured a crash and recovery of one.A measure of control over the UFO problem slipped away from the air force during1950. Other branches of the military and government showed greaterbehind-the-scenes interest, and the public showed nascent signs of independentthinking on the subject. Still, the problem appeared manageable, at least from apublic relations point of view. The beliefs of people like Keyhoe and Scullywere still a small minority, and during these years after the Second World Warand the peak of the cold war, most Americans held an almost worshipful attitudetoward their military. But even a reverential and compliant public could only goalong with the program as long as the UFOs themselves—whatever theywere—remained in the background, as they had more or less done in 1948 and 1949.If 1951 proved to be as active as 1950 had been, things could be difficult forthose managing the problem.Fortunately for those people, 1951 was a less active year for UFOs. During thefirst half of the year, activity was modest, and it seemed possible that the airforce had buried the flying saucer. During April, May, and June, for example,AMC received a mere seventeen UFO reports. But the problem did not exactly go tosleep. Several UFO encounters were spectacular, and not all of them official. OnJune 1, 1951, one of these occurred directly over Wright-Patterson AFB inDayton, Ohio. An official at the base saw a disc make a turn too sharply for anyknown aircraft. He described it as a “clearly defined outline similar to astubby cigar” and moving “faster than an airplane, slower than a meteor.” Yearslater, when he reported the sighting to NICAP, he requested confidentialitybecause of his position.72 [index_split_257.html#filepos1456594] Anotherinteresting encounter took place on July 9, 1951, over Dearing, Georgia. Whileflying an F-51, Air Force Lt. George Kinmon saw a white, disc-shaped object“completely round and spinning in a clockwise direction” making a head-on passat his aircraft. The air force intelligence report noted that the object was> described as flat on top and bottom and appearing from a front view to have> round edges and slightly beveled.... No vapor trails or exhaust or visible> means of propulsion. Described as traveling at tremendous speed....

One tracker watching a B-29 through binoculars saw a largeUFO near the bomber. Simultaneously, another observer with a movie camera shottwo hundred feet of film of the object, which supposedly showed a round, brightspot. Unfortunately, the film disappeared and has not been seen since.74[index_split_257.html#filepos1456917]Project Grudge could hardly be expected to investigate even this minimalactivity: by the summer of 1951, it had a single person serving as investigatorof flying saucer reports.75 [index_split_257.html#filepos1457097]"},{"pageContent":"THE LUBBOCK LIGHTS The air force containment of the UFO problem depended first and foremost uponthe cooperation of the UFOs themselves. As the pace of good sightings increasedduring the latter half of 1951, the air force had to decide whether it needed tomanage the problem differently. The problem started with the Lubbock Lights.On August 25, 1951, three college professors relaxing in a backyard in Lubbock,Texas, saw a formation of about twenty to thirty soft, glowing, bluish-greenlights silently pass over them. They saw a similar group of lights a few hourslater. The lights seemed to move “exactly” together. During the next two months,they saw at least ten more. Other people also noticed the odd lights. On theevening of the thirtieth, a young man named Carl Hart took five photographs ofthem in his backyard. The lights were visible only a few seconds each time Hartsaw them, but they appeared to be at a high altitude. Ruppelt, who was latersent to investigate the incident, said of them, “In each photograph, theindividual lights in the formation shifted position according to a definitepattern.” The photo labs at ATIC studying Hart’s photos commented:> [T]he two rows of spots behaved differently. One row shows only slight> variation from a precise “V” formation throughout, whereas the other row> appears to pass from above the first row, through it to a position below. The objects in the photographs were never identified, and no evidence everemerged to suggest that Hart’s photographs were hoaxes.Dr. Donald Menzel of Harvard tried to discredit the Lubbock Lights incident inLook and Time magazines and in his book Flying Saucers, with the theory that theprofessors were merely looking at refracted city lights. ATIC eventually labeledthe Lubbock Lights sighting as light reflecting from birds (plover), though theidea of birds reflecting blue-green light fails to convince many people. Also,the photographs of the lights show a symmetrical and rigid formation, quiteunlike a formation of plover.While the Lubbock Lights bewildered the people of Texas, a low-flying V-shapedobject appeared over Sandia AFB, a key atomic base in New Mexico. The objectlooked larger than a B-26, was silvery in color, had six or eight lights groupedin pairs, and flew at 400 mph. Like the lights in Lubbock, it was silent, but inthis case reflected the city lights as it flew over. Ruppelt wondered whetherthe two seemingly distinct objects could be the same.76[index_split_257.html#filepos1457253]As intriguing as the sightings themselves was Ruppelt’s description of whostudied the reports. He noted that access to the information regarding theLubbock Lights was restricted to two groups: (1) ATIC’s UFO investigative bodyand (2) another, unnamed group of people who, “due to their associations withthe government, had complete access to our files.” These people> were scientists—rocket experts, nuclear physicists, and intelligence experts.> They had banded together to study our UFO reports because they were convinced> that some of the UFOs that were being reported were interplanetary spaceships,> and the Lubbock series was one of these reports.77> [index_split_257.html#filepos1457541] Ruppelt could not have stated the matter any clearer. He described anextragovernmental group with preponderant influence within the government (howelse could they have complete access to ATIC’s UFO files?) who believed thatUFOs were extraterrestrial. Whatever the truth about the MJ-12 documents,Ruppelt described perfectly a group fitting the description of MJ- 12. Theirevident goal was to manage the UFO problem, and they appeared to supersede theauthority of ATIC."},{"pageContent":"THE REAL CONTROLLERS? At Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, on the morning of September 10, a student radaroperator, giving a demonstration for top military officials, caught an object“going faster than a jet.” His audience was incredulous. Twenty-five minuteslater, however, a pilot and major aboard a T-33 jet trainer out of Dover AFB inMaryland saw a “dull, silver, disclike object” far below them. They obtained aradar fix on the object, which was traveling as fast as 900 mph. As the pilotdescended rapidly to get a better view, the object hovered, then sped off andvanished out toward the sea.A few hours later, Fort Monmouth Army Signal Center received an “almost franticcall” from headquarters to pick up a target high and to the north in the samearea where the earlier UFO had been spotted. Another unidentified object was onthe screen, traveling very slowly at the incredible altitude of eighteen miles.Visually, the object was discernible as a silver speck. The next morning, tworadar sets picked up a target that performed nearly vertical climbs and dives,leveled off for a while, then performed more acrobatics.The next day, on September 12, 1951, a three-foot-long teletype arrived atWright-Patterson AFB from Fort Monmouth, a copy of which went to Washington,D.C. Almost immediately, ATIC’s new chief, Col. Frank Dunn, received a phonecall from the office of the director of air force intelligence, Maj. Gen.Charles Cabell. Cabell wanted somebody from ATIC to get down to New Jersey andfind out what was going on. Dunn sent Lt. Jerry Cummings (head of what remainedof Project Grudge) and Lt. Col. N. R. Rosengarten. A few days later, the twoofficers briefed Cabell at a meeting that included his entire staff “and aspecial representative from Republic Aircraft Corporation.” Ruppelt’s words onthis matter once again hint toward the existence of some kind of MJ-12 group:> The man from Republic supposedly represented a group of top U.S.> industrialists and scientists who thought that there should be a lot more> sensible answers coming from the air force regarding the UFOs. The man was at> the meeting at the personal request of a general officer.> > > > > > According to Ruppelt,> > > every word of the two-hour meeting was recorded on a wire recorder. The> recording was so hot that it was later destroyed, but not before I heard it> several times. I can’t tell everything that was said but, to be conservative,> it didn’t exactly follow the tone of the official air force releases.Cabell supposedly learned at this meeting that Grudge had effectively been deadfor some time. He demanded to know “who in hell has been giving me these reportsthat every decent flying saucer report is being investigated?” He ordered themen to get moving and report to him when a new project was ready to go.78[index_split_257.html#filepos1457696]As a result, Ruppelt was placed in charge of the “new” Project Grudge. He soonappointed Hynek (already an air force consultant in astronomy) as chiefscientific consultant. But Grudge continued to lack funds to do seriousinvestigating. Just how important could the new and improved Project Grudge havebeen to a national security establishment that had undertaken the ManhattanProject, won the Second World War, and was fighting communism in Korea, when iteven lacked a routine way of getting fresh UFO reports? UFOs were violatingrestricted and sensitive American airspace with complete impunity practicallyevery month, and the air force continued to dole out the fiction that Grudge’spathetic operation was the vehicle for meeting that threat.There was an undeniable discrepancy between the public and real policy regardingUFO reporting. The official and public version had all reports going to ATIC;the real policy was that each branch of military reported UFOs, but many ofthose reports never made it to ATIC. JANAP 146(B), authorized in August 1949,made it clear that all important reports went elsewhere: to Air Defense Command,the Secretary of Defense, the CIA, and “other appropriate agencies.” Could onesuch “agency” be the group of “scientists and industrialists” described byRuppelt? Since they had unlimited access to ATIC files, it is at least plausiblethat they had comparable access to navy and army files, and possibly CIA or FBIfiles. Whoever comprised this nebulous and powerful group, they are the bestcandidates for being managers of the “real” investigation, of which ATIC’scontribution was merely a share.Why, then, did Cabell get so angry over the dilapidated state of what he had toknow was a fiction of an organization? As director of air force intelligence,Cabell knew that the UFO problem was being monitored at levels higher than ATIC,as indicated by the presence of the “man from Republic” in his office. The mostprobable scenario is that from the summer of 1948 onward—that is, followingVandenberg’s rejection of the Estimate of the Situation—the main policy was tokeep Project Sign/Grudge in the dark. Most likely, the main contours of the UFOproblem were evident enough to those at the top that it seemed counterproductiveto continue stirring the pot at the lower levels, when the result would not benew information about UFOs but simply heightened interest by those who did notneed to know. This would be especially important regarding Grudge, since it waspublicly known to be the military’s UFO investigative body, and as such, was thekey to the Pentagon’s public relations on the subject. The last thing desirablewould be to have your most visible office actually believe in UFOs. The best wayto avoid this would be to strangle the flow of good information going into ATIC,as much as could reasonably be done.Cabell had never entirely agreed with Grudge policy. For several years, he hadwanted to augment its reporting capabilities, although his efforts met withfailure. Perhaps he thought that the last two months presented him with thechance to drive home his point that better UFO reporting was needed, that thenew wave of activity warranted a new approach. Maybe not everything was knownabout the UFOs."},{"pageContent":"ATTEMPTED INTERCEPTS AND NEAR MISSES While Ruppelt busied himself reactivating Project Grudge, the UFO partycontinued. On September 23 at March AFB near Long Beach, California, two F-86jets tried to intercept an object in controlled orbit at around fifty-fivethousand feet, but they ran low on fuel and had to land. Two more F-86s werescrambled, with the same results. Three of the pilots reported seeing a “silverairplane with highly swept-back wings,” although one of them said the UFO lookedround and silver. Regardless, in 1951 the U.S. had no plane that could flyhigher than the F-86.79 [index_split_257.html#filepos1457939] Encounterscontinued during October and November. In Korea, fourteen American ships trackedan object on radar as it circled the fleet, then departed at over 1,000 mph.80[index_split_257.html#filepos1458126]Amid this renewed surge of sightings, the new Project Grudge was officiallyestablished on October 27. Before reporting directly to General Cabell on hismethod of operation, Ruppelt decided to try out his ideas on some “well-knownscientists and engineers” who regularly visited ATIC. He learned that “UFOs werebeing freely and seriously discussed in scientific circles.” On or aroundDecember 11, Ruppelt traveled with ATIC Chief Frank Dunn to the Pentagon. Maj.Gen. John A. Samford had replaced Cabell as air force director of intelligencebut seemed “familiar with the general aspects of the problem.” Samford’s aide,Gen. W M. Garland, told the two that ATIC had the sole authorization to carryout UFO investigations for the entire U.S. military—a statement that Garland inno way could have meant to be true. He also told Ruppelt and Dunn unequivocallythat the United States had no secret aircraft, or other device, which was beingreported as a UFO.

True,by 1951 that interference was greater than it had been in 1948, but thankslargely to an acquiescent media, it still posed little of a problem. The UFOsthemselves were more intractable. While many in the military honestly believedthem to be nonsense, many others—usually expressing their opinionsdiscreetly—did not. A large number of UFO sightings lent credence to theirexistence as real objects, and the American military seemed helpless to preventthem from doing as they pleased, such as violating sensitive airspace andappearing over areas where multiple witnesses could see them.This period also provided scattered evidence that a select group of men fromscientific, military, and intelligence circles supervised or monitored theactivities at ATIC. It is not known whether this group answered to the presidentor another individual. It does seem clear, however, that they took the UFOproblem more seriously than official pronouncements at ATIC indicated.

In the UnitedStates, the number of good sightings reached a still-unmatched peak. Even ATIC’snew and improved Project Grudge (renamed Blue Book in early spring), with anenlarged staff of about a dozen people, could not keep up with the reports. Bythe middle of the year, the situation was in crisis. First of all, the publicdebate about UFOs threatened to go completely beyond the control of thePentagon, where it had firmly resided for five years. Second, the sheer numberof unidentified objects, including over the White House for two consecutiveweekends, posed a substantial threat of unknown dimensions.As a result, national security measures were taken to push UFOs deeper undercover. Not only was the air force involved in this, but so was the CIA. Thepolicy met with some resistance behind closed doors, but by early 1953 it wasclear that secrecy prevailed. The measures undertaken in 1952 created a policythat remained relatively unchanged for more than ten years—until the nationwideUFO wave of the mid-1960s."},{"pageContent":"BASE SIGHTINGS The crescendo of UFO sightings that began in August 1951 continued onward. Onthe very first day of the new year, an object circled and maneuvered for eightminutes over a Royal Canadian Air Force Base at North Bay. It appeared to bevery large and traveled at supersonic speed. On January 20 at Fairchild AFB nearSpokane, two intelligence specialists saw a large, bluish-white, sphericalobject approaching, which they later determined to be moving at 1,400 mph. Thenext day, a U.S. Navy pilot chased a white dome-shaped object over Mitchell AFBon Long Island; the UFO simply accelerated and pulled away. The case stumpedRuppelt.1 [index_split_258.html#filepos1458590]On the following evening, a UFO once again violated restricted airspace. At anorthern Alaska outpost on January 22, 1952, radar captured an object traveling1,500 mph at twenty-three thousand feet. When an F-94 was sent to intercept, thetarget slowed down, stopped, reversed course, and headed directly for the radarstation. It came to within thirty miles of the station, then disappeared fromthe screen. The F-94 headed back to refuel, and a second F-94 was scrambled.This pilot obtained a strong and distinct radar return. At first, the object wasalmost stationary, but then it dived suddenly, at which point ground radarpicked it up again. A third F-94 was scrambled, also obtained the object onradar, and closed to within two hundred yards. At this point, the pilot pulledaway for fear of collision, as the UFO was nearly immobile in the air. Sincenone of the pilots obtained a visual of the object, the air force concluded thatthe radar returns were weather-related, although the people involved in theincident strongly disputed this.2 [index_split_258.html#filepos1458773]In Korea on January 29, a bright, disc-shaped orange object, also described as a“huge ball of fire,” paced two B-29s on the same night, eighty miles from eachother in the towns of Wonsan and Sunchon. This incident received some mediaattention in mid-February, and added to the growing interest in Washington."},{"pageContent":"GRUDGE BECOMES BLUE BOOK Under Ruppelt’s leadership, Project Grudge became respectable. In earlyFebruary, Ruppelt met with the commander of Air Defense Command, Gen. BenjaminChidlaw, who issued a directive to all units explaining procedures in UFOsituations. This began a period of cooperation between Project Grudge and ADC.The 4602nd AISS was also activated under ADC’s command. Originally intended toobtain air combat intelligence, by mid-1953 the unit actually supplanted thestaff at Dayton in the UFO arena.3 [index_split_258.html#filepos1458934]For now, however, Grudge was busy. After his meeting with Chidlaw, Ruppelt metwith two Royal Canadian air force officers who brought their own UFO reports andwanted to know how Grudge operated. By March 1952, Project Grudge went frombeing a mere project within a group to a separate organization under the titleAerial Phenomena Group. By the end of the month, its name became Blue Book.4[index_split_258.html#filepos1459109]On April 3, the air force announced that it had not stopped investigating andevaluating UFO reports, as it had previously stated. This may have been news tothe public, but was common knowledge to those following the matter. On April 5,the secretary of the air force signed Air Force Letter 200-5, which stated thatUFOs were not a joke, that Blue Book was making a serious study of them, anddirected intelligence officers on every air force base throughout the world toreport UFOs immediately to ATIC and all major air force commands, then to send amore detailed report later to ATIC (with copies to the air force director ofintelligence). AFR 200-5 enabled Blue Book staff to communicate directly withany air force base or unit without going through the normal chain of command.AFR 200-5 noted that “reports should not be classified higher than ‘Restricted’unless inclusion of data required ... mandates a higher classification.”5[index_split_258.html#filepos1459280]On the heels of the announcement came an air force-sponsored article in Lifetitled, “Have We Visitors from Space?” Life’s answer: Maybe. The article cameclose to advocating the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), and gave it moreserious consideration than any other major publication hitherto. Although theNew York Times criticized the article, its main source was clearly the air forceitself. Ruppelt knew that “very high-ranking” Pentagon officers, “so high thattheir personal opinion was almost policy,” had unofficially inspired thearticle, and that one of these men had given his opinions to reporter RobertGinna. Why was the air force (or elements within) giving apparent support to theETH?6 [index_split_258.html#filepos1459499]Perhaps because UFOs were everywhere that spring, with many sightings by themilitary. Just before the press conference, a remarkable incident had takenplace, on March 29, near Misawa, Japan. The day was bright and clear, and an airforce pilot was flying a T-6 target plane on a practice intercept mission fortwo F-84s. The first F-84 overtook him at six thousand feet when the T-6 pilotnoticed a small, shiny disc-shaped object gaining on the interceptor. The UFOcurved toward the F-84, rapidly decelerated, then flipped on edge in aninety-degree bank. It flew between the two aircraft, pulled away, flippedagain, passed the F-84, crossed in front, and accelerated out of sight in a nearvertical climb. Both pilots noticed the object, which came to within thirty tofifty feet of the T-6; the pilot estimated it to be a mere eight inches indiameter. Although he saw no exhaust, he reported a ripple around its edge.7[index_split_258.html#filepos1459715]In April, Blue Book received ninety-nine reports, a busy month. Many werebaffling, such as this incident from San Jose, California, on April 25, when twoformerly skeptical scientists saw “a small metallic-appearing disc rotating andwobbling on its axis.” Years later, James McDonald interviewed the two men, whosaid they saw> overhead a large, black circular object joined by two similar objects that> dropped out of an overcast. The small disc accelerated upwards and one of the> larger black objects, perhaps one hundred feet in diameter, took off after it> on a seemingly converging course; both then vanished in the overcast. One of the two remaining black objects then took off to the north. Thescientists concluded that they had seen something extraterrestrial, using “somepropulsion method not in the physics books.” Despite the quality of theirsighting, they told only a few colleagues, for fear of ridicule.8[index_split_258.html#filepos1459874]Many sighting reports never made it to Dayton. Keyhoe’s navy connections gavehim one involving the Secretary of the Navy, Dan Kimball, and Adm. ArthurRadford during April 1952. While flying to Hawaii, Kimball saw two disc-shapedobjects moving at about 1,500 mph. The UFOs circled his plane twice, then headedto another navy plane, which was carrying Radford, fifty miles east. The objectscircled Radford’s plane and zoomed up out of sight. Upon landing, Kimball sent areport of the encounter to the air force. But despite repeated inquiries, hereceived no information on his case. Instead, he learned the air force wasaggressively demanding all copies of UFO reports from navy and Marine Corpswitnesses, even before preliminary navy investigations had been made. Kimballtherefore decided to initiate naval intelligence reports on UFOs—independentfrom Blue Book. He told the Office of Naval Research to start a specialinvestigation “to be kept separate from the air force project.” Keyhoe receivedthis information from his old friend Adm. Calvin Bolster, chief of ONR, as wellas from Kimball himself. According to them, the air force squawked at the newsof a formal, independent navy body to investigate UFOs, and ONR eventuallystopped its official investigation. Kimball never made his own sighting public,although mentioning it to Keyhoe amounted to the same thing.9[index_split_258.html#filepos1460021]"},{"pageContent":"THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY 1952 Blue Book received seventy-nine UFO reports in May. Press coverage of UFOs wason the rise, an interest which was surpassed, in Ruppelt’s words, “only by theinterest of the Pentagon.” He was in a good position to know. Throughout thespring and summer, he gave an average of one briefing in Washington, D.C., everytwo weeks, “and there was always a full house.”10[index_split_258.html#filepos1460183]The first day of the month set the tone, involving a classic case nearDavis-Montham AFB, later investigated by Dr. James McDonald, in which an airintelligence officer, a B-36 crew, and an airman witnessed two shiny, roundobjects overtake their plane. The objects slowed down to match the plane’s speedand remained in formation with them for about twenty seconds. At that point,they made a very sharp no-radius turn away from the B-36, flew away a bit, thenone of the objects stopped and hovered. Both objects were silent. The Blue Bookteam dismissed the case as “aircraft.” On the same day at George AFB inCalifornia, five independent witnesses saw a group of five daylight discs. Theobjects appeared to be very maneuverable, and seemed almost to collide, thenbreak away. Blue Book labeled this as unidentified.11[index_split_258.html#filepos1460325]Ruppelt also mentioned a remarkable UFO sighting in May by “one of the toppeople” in the CIA while he gave a lawn party at his home near Alexandria,Virginia. A silent object performed a nearly vertical climb, then dove straightdown, leveled off, and zoomed away. “A number of notable personages” inattendance also saw it. They made some phone calls that night, and “the mentionof their names on a telephone got quick results.” The news reached GeneralSamford, who phoned ATIC chief Dunn. Dunn in turn told Ruppelt to get toWashington on the double. Ruppelt quickly arrived to interview the host andlearn what he could, but the object remained unknown.12[index_split_258.html#filepos1460474]On May 8, Air Force Secretary Thomas Finletter and his staff received a secretone-hour briefing on UFOs from Ruppelt and Lt. Col. R. J. Taylor, covering thefive-year ATIC investigation. Not much is known about the meeting. According toRuppelt, Finletter listened intently and asked several questions about specificsightings when the briefing was finished. His only other comment was, “You’redoing a fine job, Captain. It must be interesting. Thank you.” An interestingsidelight to the matter: Finletter’s special assistant, Joseph Bryan III. In aletter to Ruppelt in 1956, Bryan wrote that while he served under Finletter, hehad tried “to have him prepare a statement for release when communication wasestablished with a saucer.” According to Bryan, Finletter declined to do so.Bryan, supposedly a mere special assistant, was a CIA man who had directed theagency’s psychological warfare unit. (This was completely unknown until the1970s but is well known now. The letter to Ruppelt was only published in 2000.)In 1960, Bryan joined the board of directors of NICAP, then the world’s majorcivilian UFO organization.13 [index_split_258.html#filepos1460616]The latter part of May had its share of intriguing UFO sightings and lameexplanations. Consider the following event from Chorwon, Korea, on the last dayof the month. Several U.S. soldiers saw a bright UFO that looked like a fallingstar, except that it stopped falling and began to climb again. It then movednortheast at about 150 mph, reversed course twice, then climbed at aforty-five-degree angle and faded from sight. One guard reported a pulsatingsound from the object. An air intelligence information report stated that anF-94 attempted to intercept this object. The pilot described it as round, ofunknown size, “brilliant white,” and leaving no exhaust. It undertook clearlyevasive maneuvers and pulled away from the F-94 at thirty thousand feet.According to the intelligence report, “the object possessed a superior speed,superior climbing ability, and was able to turn equally as well as the F-94”Blue Book’s evaluation: ”balloon with flare.“14[index_split_258.html#filepos1460808]"},{"pageContent":"THE PACE QUICKENS May had been a busy month for Blue Book; the pace doubled in June. That month,Ruppelt’s staff received 149 sighting reports. He later described the month as“one big swirl of UFO reports.” The air force, he believed, was taking the UFOproblem seriously, partly because of the good reports coming from Korea. By now,Ruppelt had four officers, two airmen, and two civilians on his permanent staff.In addition, a number of scientists, including Hynek, were working in asignificant capacity for the team. In the Pentagon, Maj. Dewey Fournet was afull-time Blue Book liaison. In terms of staffing and prestige within the airforce, Blue Book was at its peak. It appeared that, through the Blue Book officeat ATIC, the air force was serious about studying the UFO problem. Even so, theBlue Book staff was overwhelmed with reports.15[index_split_258.html#filepos1460969]Amid the crush of sightings, discussion and activity about UFOs increased,within official circles and beyond. On June 4, Air Force Secretary Finletterpublicized his recent UFO briefing, noting that the evidence remainedinconclusive but warranted investigation. A few days later, Donald Menzel wrotein Time that most UFO sightings were light reflections caused by ice crystals inclouds, refraction, or temperature inversion. His theory soon became theofficial—and wrong—air force explanation for the Washington, D.C., sightings ofJuly. Later that month, with air force help, Look printed “Hunt for the FlyingSaucer.” It featured the declaration by Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg that “we cannotafford to be complacent” about UFOs. According to Keyhoe, the article upset thePentagon “silence group.” Of course, if that were true, what group wasVandenberg in?16 [index_split_258.html#filepos1461133]The most serious discussions occurred behind closed doors. In the middle ofJune, Ruppelt briefed General Samford and his staff. Two navy captains from theOffice of Naval Intelligence and (in Ruppelt’s words) “some people I can’t name”also attended. The meeting was tense and contentious. One of Samford’s staffmembers, a colonel, argued that Blue Book’s investigation was biased against theinterplanetary thesis. After this statement, “you could almost hear the coloneladd, ‘O.K., so now I’ve said it.’” This started an emotional debate with nothingaccomplished. Blue Book was directed simply to “take further steps to obtainpositive identification” of UFOs.17 [index_split_258.html#filepos1461330]The military encounters continued. On June 18, 1952, a UFO paced a B- 25 inCalifornia for thirty minutes. On the nineteenth, at Goose Bay Air Base inLabrador, members of the ground crew saw a strange, red-lighted object approachthe field, climb steeply, then disappear; radar crews also tracked the object.On the twenty-first, just before 11 P.M., an unidentified object trespassed,once again, the restricted airspace at the AEC’s Oak Ridge facility inTennessee. The craft was observed visually, tracked on radar, and pursued by thepilot of an F-47 on combat patrol. During the ensuing aerial dogfight, the UFOevidently attempted to ram the F-47 several times before leaving the area.18[index_split_258.html#filepos1461497]"},{"pageContent":"THE JULY CRISIS From Ruppelt’s perspective, the split in opinions about what to do about UFOswidened every day. One group was “dead serious about the situation.” They wanted(1) a policy of starting from the assumption that UFOs were interplanetary, and(2) a clampdown on the release of information. According to Ruppelt, this groupthought that the security classification of the project should go up to TopSecret. He wrote that their enthusiasm “took a firm hold in the Pentagon” andmany other agencies throughout the government. By the end of the month, eventsforced a public confrontation and a behind-the-scenes decision on the matter ofUFOs. Small wonder, since ATIC received a whopping 536 reports that month, withunknowns running at 40 percent.19 [index_split_258.html#filepos1461679]One of the key UFO sightings of the month, and indeed of the modern era, tookplace in Tremonton, Utah, on July 2. Delbert C. Newhouse was a warrant officerand veteran naval aviation photographer who owned a 16mm Bell & Howell moviecamera. While out driving with his family, he noticed unusual objects in the skyand got out of the vehicle with his camera, which had a telephoto lens. Theobjects were originally at close range, “large, disc-shaped, and brightlylighted,” and “shaped like two saucers, one inverted on top of the other.” Bythe time he had the camera ready, they were directly overhead but had recededquite a bit from their original position. He shot about seventy-five seconds’worth of color film that captured what seemed to be twelve to fourteen shinypoints of light maneuvering at high speed. He claimed steadfastly that he heldhis camera steady.The film went to ATIC and Blue Book. Ruppelt told Fournet in Washington aboutit, and Fournet arranged for the original film to be shown to a group ofhigh-ranking intelligence officers. It then arrived at the air force’s photoreconnaissance laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. A few weeks later, this labtold Ruppelt that “we don’t know what they are, but they aren’t airplanes orballoons, and we don’t think they are birds.” The complete air forceinvestigation of the Utah film lasted for months. Although the analysts tried toidentify the objects as something conventional, they were unable to do so,except to suggest “possible birds.”The navy soon asked for the Utah film. Specialists at the U.S. Navy photographiclaboratory in Anacosta, Maryland, spent two months and nearly one thousandman-hours studying it frame by frame. They determined that if the objects wereas much as five miles distant, they would have been moving at around 3,780 mph;if only one mile distant, then 472 mph. They ruled out natural phenomena andconcluded that the objects were not reflecting sunlight, but instead wereinternally lighted spheres. Moreover, the lab concluded that “changes in thelight’s intensity, among other things, eliminates the possibility that theimages were aircraft or birds.” The objects, they said, were intelligentlycontrolled vehicles of some kind—“unknown objects under intelligent control.”This clearly implied, but did not explicitly state (who would?) a nonhuman,extraterrestrial answer. Newhouse’s film became a featured piece of UFO evidencefor the CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel of January 1953.20[index_split_258.html#filepos1461865]But Newhouse’s sighting was merely one of many that month. On July 5, twoFlorida pilots reported seeing a flying saucer hover above the AEC’s Hanfordatomic plant in Richlands, Washington. Like the plant at Oak Ridge, the Hanfordplant was a sensitive AEC nuclear installation that had been the scene ofrepeated UFO airspace violations. The UFO was said to be round and flat; itgained speed, reversed course, then quickly disappeared. The next day, theDayton Daily News ran the headline, “Flyers Report Saucers Near Atomic Plant.”The press contacted ATIC for comment, but received no reply. Ruppelt called themthe next day to say that all he knew about the sighting was what he had read inthe papers. No surprise, since Ruppelt and Blue Book were out of the loop.Shortly after these calls, ATIC instructed Blue Book officers to “stall” off thepress “with a no-comment answer.” The plant was again visited by UFOs on thetwelfth, this time two yellow globes with a fiery appearance; air forceinvestigators confirmed the sighting.21 [index_split_258.html#filepos1462096]At 3 A.M. on the thirteenth, during an evening of excellent visibility, aNational Airlines pilot about sixty miles southwest of Washington, D.C., radioedCAA that a blue-white light was approaching him. It came to within two miles ofhis plane, then paced him off his left wing. Willing to try anything, the pilotturned on all of his lights, and the UFO took off “up and away like a star” atan estimated speed of 1,000 mph.22 [index_split_258.html#filepos1462294]ATIC received an “extremely accurate” report describing a UFO from the eveningof the fourteenth by two Pan Am pilots near Langley AFB, Virginia. Theywitnessed a formation of six illuminated disc-like objects, appearing to beabout one hundred feet in diameter, making incredible maneuvers at unbelievablespeeds. One of the objects made a sharp turn below the airliner and was joinedby two more discs. The objects accelerated away at a speed calculated by thepilots to be two hundred miles per minute (12,000 mph).23[index_split_258.html#filepos1462444]The sheer quantity of good reports, preceded by a steady buildup throughout thespring, gave the military more than just something to think about. Ruppeltdescribed rumors that in mid-July, the air force was braced for an invasion byflying saucers. “Had these rumormongers been at ATIC in mid-July they would havethought the invasion was already in full swing.”24[index_split_258.html#filepos1462608]Around this time, Ruppelt talked for two hours about the buildup of UFO reportsalong the east coast of the United States with “a scientist, from an agency thatI can’t name.” The scientist said to Ruppelt that they were “sitting right ontop of a big keg full of loaded flying saucers.” He predicted that “within thenext few days, they’re going to blow up and you’re going to have the granddaddyof all UFO sightings. The sightings will occur in Washington or New York,probably Washington.” What was this man’s agency? How did he obtain thisinformation? Did his remarks mean that UFOs were part of some secret militaryorganization? Or that he knew the alien agenda? Or that he was a lucky guesser?Ruppelt did not answer these questions, nor has anyone else.25[index_split_258.html#filepos1462750]"},{"pageContent":"THE WASHINGTON, D.C. SIGHTINGS Washington, D.C. had already been the scene of UFO activity. But what happenedfor the next two weekends went far beyond anything up to that point. TheWashington sightings were among the most compelling and dramatic UFO sightingsin modern American history, and remain—despite any official pretense to thecontrary—unsolved.26 [index_split_258.html#filepos1462896]At 11:40 P.M. on July 19, radar at Washington National Airport picked up aformation of seven objects near Andrews AFB, moving along at a leisurely pace of100 to 130 mph. Before long, two of the targets suddenly accelerated andvanished off the scope within seconds. One of them apparently reached 7,000 mph.This got the attention of several controllers, especially when they learned thata second radar at the airport, as well as the radar at Andrews AFB, also pickedup the objects. For six hours, between eight and ten UFOs were tracked on radar.The senior air traffic controller for the CAA, Harry G. Barnes, “knewimmediately that a very strange situation existed.” In his opinion:> ... [The] movements were completely radical compared to those of ordinary> aircraft. They followed no set course [and] were not in any formation, and we> only seemed to be able to track them for about three miles at a time.... [F]or> six hours ... there were at least ten unidentifiable objects moving above> Washington. They were not ordinary aircraft.... I can safely deduce that they> performed gyrations which no known aircraft could perform. Several times, at least two of the radar stations displayed the same targetssimultaneously. But the phenomenon was not restricted to radar tracking. SeveralCapitol Airlines pilots saw the objects visually as orange lights in the samearea that radar indicated they should be. Just where were they? Over the WhiteHouse and Capitol!A radar-visual sighting of eight to ten UFOs over such highly restrictedairspace is certainly cause to send a few jet interceptors, and this is exactlywhat happened. But by the time the interceptors arrived, shortly before dawn, itwas too late. The objects were gone.The sighting made headlines the next day. And yet, according to Ruppelt, “nobodybothered to tell air force intelligence about the sighting.” At least nobodybothered to tell ATIC, which by now was receiving about thirty UFO reports perday. When Ruppelt arrived in Washington to investigate, he learned thatPresident Truman was personally interested in the affair and wanted a fullinvestigation. Good news for Ruppelt, except that all the while he was inWashington, Ruppelt could not obtain a military vehicle, and had to use a bus.Who, then, did Truman want to do this full investigation? Clearly not Blue Book.In the week that followed, sightings continued at an intense pace throughout thecountry. Several occurred over military bases. According to the Washington,D.C., Daily News, the Defense Department ordered jets to shoot down UFOs whichrefused to land when ordered to do so. Meanwhile, senior air force officersurged Intelligence to hold a press conference to relieve public tension.Dozens of new reports reached Blue Book every day. Near Boston on July 23, abluish-green object easily evaded a pursuing F-94 that tracked it on radar. Onthe same day in Culver City, California, several aircraft-plant workers saw anelliptical-shaped object through binoculars. The object stopped and hovered, andthey saw two smaller discs emerge from it, circle, rejoin the “mother” ship,then vanish at tremendous speed. 27 [index_split_258.html#filepos1463186] OnJuly 24, two air force colonels flying a B-25 over the Sierra Nevada saw three“bright silver, delta wing craft with no tails and no pilot’s canopies.” Theyestimated its speed at 1,000 mph, and believed it came to within four hundred toeight hundred yards of their plane.28 [index_split_258.html#filepos1463342]But, somehow, flying over the nation’s Capitol was different, and on July 26,the UFOs returned there. At 8:15 P.M., the pilot and stewardess of a NationalAirlines flight saw several objects resembling the glow of a cigarette highabove them. The lights moved slowly, perhaps at 100 mph. Before long, WashingtonNational Airport and Andrews AFB were tracking a dozen UFOs throughout most ofthe sky, all traveling between 90 and 100 mph. Andrews alerted Newcastle AFBshortly after 9 P.M. Finally, by midnight, two F-94s were scrambled tointercept. Meanwhile, the press had been dismissed from the air traffic controltower on the grounds that the procedures used to intercept were classified.Ruppelt called this reason absurd; rather,> not a few people in the radar room were positive that this night would be the> big night in UFO history—the night when a pilot would close in on and get a> good look at a UFO—and they didn’t want the press to be in on it. The objects had been tracked continuously for nearly two hours—an importantpoint, as this appeared to rule out atmospheric phenomena. But as the F-94sapproached, they disappeared from the radarscopes. Visibility was excellent, butthe pilots saw nothing. As the pilots returned to their base, the targetsreturned to the area.Near Newport News, Virginia, reports were reaching Langley AFB about odd,rotating lights that gave off alternating colors. Tower operators saw theselights. Another F-94 was scrambled, obtained a radar lock, and the target spedaway.Back at Washington National, the objects reappeared shortly before dawn, and twomore F-94s were scrambled. The pilots obtained radar locks and moved toward thetargets. Again, the objects sped away. Eventually, one appeared to stay put, andan F-94 moved to intercept. The target then disappeared.Dewey Fournet was in the Washington National tower throughout the night. He saidthat everyone in the radar room believed the targets were “very probably causedby solid metallic objects.” One of the F-94 pilots, William Patterson,commented, “I saw several bright lights. I was at my maximum speed, but eventhen I had no closing speed.” An air force intelligence report, classified until1985, stated that the entire radar crew was emphatic that the returns weresolid, and not temperature inversions or other atmospheric phenomena. Yearslater, Dewey Fournet and Al Chop restated this belief.Everyone, even the anti-UFO New York Times, reported air force efforts tointercept objects over Washington. At 10 A.M. on the morning of thetwenty-seventh, President Harry Truman told his air force liaison, Robert B.Landry, to find out what was going on. Landry called ATIC in Dayton, where hereached Ruppelt. Ruppelt told Landry that weather might have caused the radartargets, but there was no proof. He later learned that Truman was listening tothe conversation.29 [index_split_258.html#filepos1463528] Across the ocean,British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote to his Secretary of State forAir: “What does all this stuff about flying saucers amount to? What can it mean?What is the truth?”30 [index_split_258.html#filepos1463796]On July 28, Blue Book received the astonishing total of fifty UFO reports in asingle day. UFO inquiries were jamming the Pentagon’s telephone circuits. Evenskeptical air force generals and CIA officials conceded there was a problem, ifonly because the Soviet Union might take advantage of the situation through somekind of psychological warfare or even by launching an attack.31[index_split_258.html#filepos1463938]There is an uncorroborated claim that the air force shot down a UFO during theJuly crisis. The source is Canadian government official and UFO researcherWilbert Smith. In an interview conducted almost ten years later, Smith claimedto have shown his friend, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral H. B. Knowles, “a piece whichhad been shot from a small flying saucer near Washinton in July [1952].” Smithtold the interviewers:> I showed it to the admiral. It was a piece of metal about twice the size of> your thumb which had been loaned to me for a very short time by your air> force.... As a general thing they differ only in that they are much harder> than our materials. [It was] in reality a matrix of magnesium orthosilicate.> The matrix had great numbers—thousands—of 15-micron spheres scattered through> it. When asked if he returned the piece to the air force, Smith replied, “Not theair force. Much higher than that.” Was it the CIA? Smith chuckled and said, “I’msorry, gentlemen, but I don’t care to go beyond that point. I can say to youthat it went into the hands of a highly classified group. You will have to solvethat problem, their identity, for yourselves.”32[index_split_258.html#filepos1464099]"},{"pageContent":"THE PRESS CONFERENCE In Washington, D.C., at 4 P.M. on July 29, 1952, the air force held its largestand longest press conference since the end of WWII. Maj. Gen. John Samford,Director of Air Force Intelligence, led the press conference. He was accompaniedby Gen. Roger Ramey, the man who five years earlier had ended speculation aboutthe Roswell crash. Relying on Donald Menzel’s theory of temperature inversion,Samford explained the recent UFO sightings over Washington as caused by “weatherphenomena.” The atmospheric condition caused the radar beams to bend and pick upobjects on the ground.Samford was no scientist, and would not answer many questions. His assistant,Capt. Roy James, a radar specialist from ATIC, provided more technicalexplanations. James actually knew little of the incidents and had arrived inWashington only that morning. Attending but silent were three men who had beenin the Air Route Traffic Control radar room at Washington National Airportduring the affair: Maj. Dewey J. Fournet, Jr., public relations officer AlbertChop, and Lieutenant Holcomb, a navy electronics expert assigned to the airforce. These three rejected the temperature inversion explanation.Despite the inversion theory, Samford acknowledged that> there have remained a percentage of this total [of all UFO reports received by> the air force], about 20 percent of the reports, that have come from credible> observers of relatively incredible things. We keep on being concerned about> them.... Our present course of action is to continue on this problem with the> best of our ability, giving it the attention that we feel it very definitely> warrants. We will give it adequate attention, but not frantic attention. Few realized how weak the air force explanation was, and most newspapersaccepted the temperature inversion theory without reservation. According toRuppelt “somehow out of this chaotic situation came exactly the result that wasintended—the press got off our backs.”33 [index_split_258.html#filepos1464243]Was the temperature inversion explanation valid, or not? Fifteen years later,Condon Committee member Gordon Thayer concurred with it. He believed the visualsightings were caused by meteors and scintillating stars. Atmospheric physicistJames McDonald disagreed and argued that Thayer’s data did not support thatconclusion. Michael Wertheimer, a psychologist with the Condon Committee, laterinterviewed many of the radar operators. Nearly all disagreed with thetemperature inversion explanation. They maintained that experienced operatorshad no trouble identifying such inversions. Ironically, years later, an officialair force scientific report discredited the “temperature inversion” explanation,but this received no publicity.34 [index_split_258.html#filepos1464405]Apparently there were no complaints with Samford’s handling of the job. A fewyears later, he became head of the National Security Agency."},{"pageContent":"SIGHTINGS CONTINUE Public debunking of UFOs did not affect sightings themselves, which continued ata torrid pace. On July 29, the day of Samford’s briefing, ATIC received moreremarkable UFO reports. One described a sighting over Los Alamos, which includedseveral pilots and a guard who saw a fast, metallic-looking UFO with yellowlights. At some point, it hovered over the base, made a 360-degree turn behindthe fighters trying to intercept it, and streaked away. In Albuquerque, an airforce reserve colonel saw an ellipse-shaped light moving rapidly. Nearby, anunidentified sighting occurred at Walker (formerly Roswell) AFB, involving abase weather officer and three other weather observers, who saw several flyingdiscs through a theodolite. The object moved much faster than any conventionalaircraft. The field intelligence officer wrote “indicates an actual appearanceof ‘unidentified flying objects.’” Another ATIC report from that day described asighting at an aircraft and warning station in Michigan in which a UFO wastracked on radar at over 600 mph. Several F-94s pursued the object; one pilotobtained a radar lock while seeing a bright flashing light in that location. InMiami, movie film was taken of a high-speed UFO, submitted to the air force, andnever released.35 [index_split_258.html#filepos1464685]These, and many other sightings, all occurred on the day of Samford’s briefing.None of them received any press.And so it went into August. On August 1, 1952, an Air Defense Command radarstation outside of Yaak, Montana, picked up a UFO. It was daytime, and thestation crew saw a “dark, cigar-shaped object” right where the radar indicated.On the same day, a UFO was seen near Wright-Patterson AFB, in Bellefontaine,Ohio. This was another radar-visual case, in which people on the ground saw anobject that was also being tracked on radar. Two F-86s moved to intercept. Asthey reached thirty thousand feet, the pilots saw a bright, round, glowingobject maneuvering above them. They took several feet of film using a guncamera, but the object quickly accelerated and disappeared. 36[index_split_258.html#filepos1464870]An ATIC report from August 3 described a sighting near Hamilton AFB inCalifornia. Two huge silvery discs, observed visually and tracked on radar,circled the base at 4:15 P.M. After F-86s were dispatched to intercept, six morediscs appeared, took up a diamond formation, and quickly accelerated out ofsight. Two days later, at Haneda AFB in Japan, a UFO was observed visually andtracked on radar. The object was seen as a bright light that hovered over thebase, then swiftly accelerated away at 400 mph. As it did so, it appeared todivide into three units.37 [index_split_258.html#filepos1465046]On August 20 at Congeree AFB in South Carolina, Air Defense Command radartracked a UFO at 4,000 mph. On the twenty-second, air force jets chased apulsating yellow light over Elgin, Illinois. On the twenty-fourth, an air forcepilot in an F-84 saw two round, disc-shaped, silvery objects over Hermanas, NewMexico, and then again at El Paso, Texas. The objects displayed extrememaneuverability and acceleration.38 [index_split_258.html#filepos1465259]"},{"pageContent":"THE CIA ACTS The public explanation is always one thing. What the explainers actually believeis another. Ruppelt wrote that “several groups in Washington were following theUFO situation very closely,” and available documents from a variety of agenciessupport this claim.39 [index_split_258.html#filepos1465441]The research and development board noted in a classified memo that the air forcehad made “very little progress in learning what the phenomena or objects are andwhat causes them.”40 [index_split_258.html#filepos1465583] Air Defense Command,trying to keep current with all UFO reports, maintained records on the ATICevaluation while undertaking its own preliminary evaluation, separate from BlueBook.41 [index_split_258.html#filepos1465741] An FBI memorandum from July 29discussed a classified briefing about UFOs by Cmdr. Randall Boyd of the AirIntelligence Estimates Division. According to the memo, the air force had“failed to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion” regarding UFOs. He noted thatreports were being received from all parts of the United States as well asdistant parts of the world. Boyd stated that, while it was possible there couldbe some as yet unknown natural phenomenon causing these UFO sightings, heconsidered the extraterrestrial explanation as possible. He suggested that, “theobjects sighted may possibly be from another planet ... [but] that at thepresent time there is nothing to substantiate this theory but the possibility isnot being overlooked.” He stated that “air intelligence is fairly certain thatthese objects are not ships or missiles from another nation in this world.”42[index_split_258.html#filepos1465878]Boyd also confirmed that the air force was indeed sending jet interceptors afterUFOs, but each time a pilot approached such an object, it invariably faded fromview.Boyd’s remarks were significant. In the first place, one would think that evenstating the extraterrestrial thesis as a possibility before a group ofintelligence officers would take some strong beliefs. Boyd also confirmed thatair intelligence had essentially ruled out foreign (e.g., Soviet) technology asan explanation for UFOs. Just a few years prior, several American generals hadconsidered the likelihood that the Soviets were behind all this. They had nodoubt that real, technological objects were being seen, and looked into thepossibility of Soviet manufacture. Rather quickly, that path appeared to reach adead end, and Boyd’s statement confirmed this. Note that Boyd, althoughconceding the possibility of natural phenomena as the explanation for UFOs,stated that there was as yet no known natural explanation.Thus, after more than five years of UFOs, the Americans offered no known naturalexplanation, the Soviets were ruled out, and the ET hypothesis was beingseriously discussed.We must remember that in the highly compartmentalized world of intelligence,various solutions might be considered, based on the available knowledge. Severalpossibilities present themselves. (1) Boyd had complete access to all relevantinformation, and was in effect speaking on behalf of the highest officialposition, which would mean that UFOs continued to present a real mystery tothose running America’s military, and possibly indicated an alien presence; and(2) Boyd did not have all the available answers, but, as a man several rungsremoved from the top levels of power, he struggled to formulate his conclusionsbased on his best-available data.If the first possibility were true, it would mean that the U.S. military failedfor more than five years to arrive even at a working assumption about apotential threat of a technological and intelligent source (during some of thecold war’s darkest days). This would certainly be an alarming prospect, but alsounlikely, unless natural phenomena, after all, were the explanation. Such anatural phenomenon, however, would somehow have to look like metallic craft.The second scenario, that Boyd did not have all the answers, appears far moreplausible. This leaves very few follow-up options. One is that an alien presencehad been known in secret for some time; another is that some secret Americantechnology was causing the UFO phenomenon. A naturalistic explanation does notfit here. In the first place, the most difficult UFO cases do not admit of anaturalistic solution. More to the point: there would be no reason to hide suchan explanation from one’s own military (whereas there would be very good reasonsin the case of secret American technology or an alien presence).In other words, by 1952, the historical documentation, as well as the logic ofthe situation, pointed to one of two possibilities. UFOs were either American,or they were alien. They were not Soviet, nor natural. Within the military andintelligence community, many understood this. Boyd, in his presentation, did notexamine the possibility that UFOs were a domestic project. But could they havebeen? Certainly, the door is open, but there are major problems with thisexplanation. First, there is no documentation linking UFOs to Americantechnology. Second, there is no evidence in the history of technology. That is,the known American technology from the 1940s through at least the 1960s does notsuggest UFO reports.43 [index_split_258.html#filepos1466065] Third, the behaviorof UFOs, including airspace violations and repeated attempts at intercept, doesnot suggest a domestic project. Nor does the history of American warfare.American military personnel who had to confront this issue were placed into anexceedingly difficult position, one in which they could almost never speakcandidly. The obvious possibilities—alien or American origin—were usuallyignored or talked around, while other explanations, e.g., natural phenomena,were not allowed to die.At the CIA, the most important discussions about UFOs were taking place. Indeed,the agency had been monitoring a separate wave of UFOs all summer long in Europeand Africa. Algeria, Morocco, and Spain, in particular, were the scene of manylow-flying, agile, fast, and oval-shaped objects, often seen by many people. Inmany cases, the objects made “impossible” no-radius turns, and were silent.44[index_split_258.html#filepos1466572] One CIA report even cited an allegedencounter between short humanoid aliens and a German man and his eleven-year-olddaughter. While in a wooded area, the two got close to a landed craft thatlooked like a “huge frying pan ... [with] two rolls of holes along the periphery... on top of this metal object was a black conical tower about three metershigh.” Short beings were nearby, examining the ground; they wore silvery suits,and one had a flashing box. When the beings realized they were being watched,they entered the craft and left at high speed. One of the most fascinating ofthe CIA reports concerned two “flying saucers” over uranium mines in the BelgianCongo. This was seen by many ground witnesses and reported in extreme detail.The objects glided in “elegant curves,” changed position several times, hovered,moved in a unique zigzag pattern, and made a “penetrating hissing and buzzingsound.” A fighter plane was sent to intercept, and the pilot came to withinabout three hundred feet of the objects. He described them as saucer shaped,about fifty feet in diameter. “The inner core remained absolutely still, and aknob coming out from the center and several small openings could plainly beseen. The outer rim was completely veiled in fire and must have had an enormousspeed of rotation.... Changes in elevation from eight hundred to one thousandmeters could be accomplished in a few seconds.” Both objects left in a straightline at more than 1,000 mph. The officer was regarded as “a dependable officerand a zealous flyer.”45 [index_split_258.html#filepos1466732]In the case of this last incident, it is ludicrous to ascribe the sighting tosome as yet misunderstood natural phenomenon. It seems clear that the objectsseen in the Belgian Congo were craft of some sort. But the CIA report studiouslyavoided discussing any implications of the incident.While the air force press conference may have bought some time as far as thepublic was concerned, elements within the CIA believed that much more needed tobe done, not necessarily from the vantage point of solving the UFO riddle, butfrom the more pragmatic position of managing the flow and release of data. OnJuly 29, Ralph L. Clark, acting assistant director for the CIA’s Office ofScientific Intelligence, sent a memorandum to the Deputy Director ofIntelligence indicating that, despite the air force explanation, the agencywould be looking into matters a little more thoroughly:> Although this office has maintained a continuing review of such reported> sightings during the past three years, a special study group has been formed> to review this subject to date. O/CI will participate in this study with O/SI,> and a report should be ready about 15 August. 46> [index_split_258.html#filepos1467299] Clark’s memorandum is also noteworthy for stating that the CIA “has maintained acontinuing review of such reported sightings during the past three years,” thatis, since 1949.On August 1, an informal CIA memo was sent by Edward Tauss, acting chief ofWeapons and Equipment Division at the Office of Scientific Intelligence, to thedeputy assistant director of OSI. Tauss listed the four main possibleexplanations: secret American technology (which was “denied at the highestlevel”), secret Soviet technology (which he said was not rational and supportedby no evidence), alien technology (which had “no shred of evidence”), andmisinterpretation of natural, “as yet little understood,” phenomena. Taussbelieved the last was true, although he acknowledged that “interplanetaryaspects and alien origin [were] not being thoroughly excluded fromconsideration.” The main thing, however, was to keep all this under control. Herecommended that the CIA continue surveillance of UFO sightings, “incoordination with proper authorities of primary operational concern at ATIC.” Hestrongly urged that> no indication of CIA interest or concern reach the press or public, in view of> their probable alarmist tendencies to accept such interest as “confirmatory”> of the soundness of “unpublished facts” in the hands of the U.S. government. The CIA initiated a series of informal discussions about UFOs with otheragencies. One of the matters under review was the “clogged channel” problem. CIADirector of Scientific Intelligence H. Marshall Chadwell chaired these meetingsand visited Wright-Patterson AFB on August 8 for a “thorough and comprehensive”briefing about UFOs from Blue Book officers. He was accompanied by CIA officialFrederick Durant and power scientist H. P Robertson.47[index_split_258.html#filepos1467450]On August 14, a newly established CIA special study group from the Office ofScientific Intelligence gave a briefing which referred to an “official queryfrom the White House” regarding UFOs. Once again, secrecy was of greatimportance:> In view of the wide interest within the agency ... it must be mentioned that> outside knowledge of agency interest in flying saucers carries the risk of> making the problem even more serious in the public mind than it already is,> which we and the air force agree must be avoided. The briefing offered an analytical description of UFOs dating to the ghostrocket phenomenon. It grouped radar and visual sightings into variouscategories, described the sightings as “objects” ranging in size from two tothree feet across, to the common one-hundred-foot diameter object, to some aswide as one thousand feet. It described three general levels of speed: hovering,moderate, and “stupendous.” It also noted that “evasion upon approach iscommon.” The report ruled out the possibility of Soviet secret weapons andmentioned “sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, at a timewhen the background radiation count had risen inexplicably.” In this case, wrotethe report’s author, “we run out of even ‘blue yonder’ explanations that mightbe tenable, and we are still left with numbers of incredible reports fromcredible observers.” Despite these many admissions, the report stated there was“no shred of evidence” to support the view that UFOs were caused byextraterrestrials. There was no bother, however, to explain just what could bebehind these reports. Once again, we are in the presence of an elephant in thedining room, never to be discussed.The CIA/OSI study group prepared a six-page document of its findings on August19, 1952. The agency was puzzled that the Russian press had not mentioned asingle report on UFOs, not even a satirical one. They perceived a danger thatthe Soviets might infiltrate American UFO groups:> Air force is aware of this and has investigated a number of the civilian> groups that have sprung up.... AF is watching this organization [Civilian> Saucer Group] because of its power to touch off mass hysteria and panic. More serious was the danger that the Soviets could launch a nuclear attackduring a UFO wave, when Americans might not distinguish Soviet missiles fromUFOs. In the words of the August 19 CIA report, “we will run the increasing riskof false alerts and the even greater danger of tabbing the real as false.”48[index_split_258.html#filepos1467661]Was this the sum total of CIA interest in UFOs? Was there any indication thatthe CIA was interested in understanding the nature of UFOs themselves? Was thereany concern that the country appeared to be under siege by UFOs? It wouldcertainly be surprising if there were none. Certainly there was commonrecognition within the agency that other people and groups were leaning towardan extraterrestrial explanation. Moreover, even as OSI was studying the problem,many CIA-authored UFO reports were coming in from overseas. There is sometangible evidence, as we shall soon see, that ranking CIA officials weregenuinely interested in the UFOs themselves. Nevertheless, whatever OSI’sopinion on the actual nature of UFOs, it supported the air force’s efforts tokeep the matter as far removed from the public as possible.At this time, astronomer Allen Hynek conducted a covert poll for the air force.In early August, he questioned forty-four professional American astronomersregarding UFOs. His results were somewhat surprising: five of them (11 percent)had actually seen a UFO! Seven were indifferent to the subject, more expressedat least some interest, while a few were very interested. Those interested,however, were fearful of publicity.49 [index_split_258.html#filepos1467819]Some intelligence agency, most likely CIA, appears to have surveilled civilianUFO groups at this time. In 1952, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization(APRO) was founded in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, by Coral Lorenzen. It soon becameone of America’s most influential and respected UFO organizations. Months beforethe first appearance of the organization’s periodical, the APRO Bulletin, a manclaiming an intelligence background became an active supporter and attempted tolead the organization into “metaphysical areas of research.” Coral Lorenzen saidshe “gently parried” these attempts. She later discovered light embossing on aletter she received from him, and used a soft pencil to discern what looked likean intelligence report about her. During the summer of 1952, two suspicious menposing as painting contractors called on her and engaged her in conversation.The men did not seem interested in selling any services. After they left, theyparked their car where they had a clear view of the back of her home. These twomen also visited APRO’s treasurer and secretary the same day, but apparently notany other homes in the neighborhood.50 [index_split_258.html#filepos1468003]It is worth mentioning that by 1952, 74 percent of the CIA’s money (and 60percent of personnel) went toward covert operations. Action, not analysis, hadbecome the CIA hallmark. Contrary to the 1947 National Security Act, whichstipulated that the CIA’s activities be confined outside the United States, theagency had already infiltrated and financed many U.S. labor, business, church,university, student, and cultural groups, usually channeling the money throughvarious foundations. In 1952, it began opening the mail through a new programknown as HT Lingual, which targeted correspondence between U.S. citizens andcommunist nations. For twenty-one years, with FBI help, the program photographedtwo million envelopes and opened 215,000 letters. No one, not even thepresident, was exempt. By 1952, also, the CIA was using unwitting subjects totest the effects of LSD.51 [index_split_258.html#filepos1468179]"},{"pageContent":"A NATO ENCOUNTER UFO reports slowed down somewhat in September, but there seems to have been aminiwave of sightings in the southeastern U.S. One that received much publicitywas the “Flatwoods Monster” case in West Virginia on September 12, 1952.Fireball reports had come from several cities, including Baltimore, before oneappeared to “land” at the small town of Flatwoods. Seven people, mostlychildren, trekked to the sight and claimed to see an enormous creature, over tenfeet tall, with glowing eyes and an overpowering stench. The county sheriff,initially skeptical, encountered the odor at the site and noticed a circulararea of flattened grass. Many visitors came by, including UFO researchers IvanSanderson and Gray Barker, as well as members of the air force. Sandersoninterviewed quite a few people from the area and concluded that “a flight ofintelligently controlled objects flew over West Virginia.” The air forceconcluded that people had seen a meteor, the glowing eyes of an owl, and hadjust gotten hysterical. The Flatwoods case is certainly odd, but even skepticsruled out a hoax.52 [index_split_258.html#filepos1468357]Not far from Flatwoods, an interesting report came from Camp Drum, near Fairfax,Virginia, on September 22. For thirty minutes, several soldiers watched anorange-red UFO circling and hovering over their camp, while they heard adistinct hum from the craft.53 [index_split_258.html#filepos1468602] But themost significant series of UFO sightings that month took place during NATO navalexercises in the North Sea near Britain, known as Operation Mainbrace. At leastfour sightings occurred. At 10:52 A.M. on September 19, 1952, a silver andspherical UFO appeared above Topcliffe Airfield in North Yorkshire. Severalground crew members and civilians saw the object. An RAF Meteor jet wasscrambled, and the pilot got close enough to describe the object as rotatingaround its vertical axis and wobbling slightly. The UFO moved in a zigzagfashion and then flew off. The British Air Ministry set up an investigation intothe report.The next day during Mainbrace exercises, a silvery disc, similar to the objectseen the day before, was observed following a Meteor jet, then descended with apendulum motion. Once again, there was no shortage of competent observers, whonoticed the object flying “extremely fast behind the naval fleet.” An Americanphotographer aboard the U.S. aircraft carrier Franklin Roosevelt took threephotos. The object was determined not to be a balloon, but no photos were everreleased.The Mainbrace “wave” continued the next day, when six RAF jets over the NorthSea saw a spherical object heading towards them. They tracked it, lost it, andfound it as it appeared directly behind them. One Meteor pilot tried tointercept the object, but it easily outpaced him. UFO researcher Jenny Randlespointed out that this was precisely the behavior displayed by the objects seenover the Capitol in Washington, D.C. The last Mainbrace sighting occurred threedays later, on September 24, when a Meteor fighter came close to a silveryspherical UFO revolving around its axis. The object flew away before the pilotgot too close.Ruppelt followed the Mainbrace sightings and learned from an RAF exchangeintelligence officer in the Pentagon that the reports “caused the RAF toofficially recognize the UFO.” Of course, official differs from public, and theBritish government has been as silent on UFOs as the American.54[index_split_258.html#filepos1468744]During the Mainbrace sightings, UFOs continued to be seen throughout Europe andNorth Africa. On September 21, Morocco was flooded with reports throughout thecountry. On the twenty-sixth, ATIC reported strange green lights approaching theAzores, observed by U.S. Air Force personnel. On the twenty-ninth, a largecigar-shaped craft was seen over Denmark, flying with several smaller disclikeobjects, and was reported throughout the country.55[index_split_258.html#filepos1468950]"},{"pageContent":"CHADWELL AND UFOS On September 24, 1952, the final day of the Mainbrace UFO sightings, H. MarshallChadwell wrote a letter to CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith, stating that since1947 unexplained sightings were running at 20 percent, and that for 1952 theywere at 28 percent. Chadwell wrote:> I consider this problem to be of such importance that it should be brought to> the attention of the National Security Council in order that a community-wide> coordinated effort toward its solution may be initiated.56> [index_split_258.html#filepos1469109] Chadwell played the familiar themes of mass hysteria and the potential forSoviet mischief. Parts of the letter showed concern about the UFOs themselvesand the need to identify them. His memo did not indicate any interest in thepossibility that UFOs represented alien intelligence. Rather, the CIAconsultants he spoke with> stated that these solutions would probably be found on the margins or just> beyond the frontiers of our present knowledge in the fields of atmospheric,> ionospheric, and extraterrestrial phenomena, with the added possibility that> the present dispersal of nuclear waste products might also be a factor. By extraterrestrial, Chadwell did not mean alien life-forms, but any phenomenaoriginating from space. Overall, he strongly suggested the conclusions laterarrived at by the Robertson Panel: to keep the profile of UFOs as low aspossible while the real investigation and activity could continue. At all cost,mass hysteria and panic must be avoided.Ruppelt, meanwhile, continued to give standing-room-only lectures on UFOs formilitary and scientific groups. Interest in this subject remained high. Aroundthe time of Chadwell’s letter, Ruppelt briefed General Chidlaw and his staff atAir Defense Command on the past few months of UFO activity. One of the attendeeswas Maj. Verne Sadowski, the ADC Intelligence’s liaison officer with ProjectBlue Book. During an informal exchange, Ruppelt encountered a great deal ofskepticism, not regarding UFOs, but of Project Blue Book’s honesty in analyzingUFOs. Sadowski said that no one “can understand why Intelligence is so hesitantto accept the fact that something we just don’t know about is flying around inour skies, unless you are trying to cover up something big.”57[index_split_258.html#filepos1469345]During the fall, the Navy delivered its evaluation of the Tremonton, Utah, filmto the air force. The navy’s conclusion: “Unknown objects under intelligentcontrol.” As if this were not bad enough, the navy study had an impressiveamount of technical support. Clearly, the air force efforts to dismiss UFOs hadnot yet succeeded. Navy Secretary Dan Kimball appeared to be moving towardacknowledging UFOs. However, on November 5, 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower waselected to the presidency of the United States, which meant that Kimball andmany others would soon be out of a job.58 [index_split_258.html#filepos1469513]November 18 is the alleged date of the MJ-12 briefing papers that RoscoeHillenkoetter, late of the CIA, was to have presented to Ike. As discussedearlier, the documents may have been faked, although they are not as easilydismissed as some writers on the subject would have it. But even if the nationalsecurity state was not preparing Eisenhower for UFOs, it was preparing the UFOproblem for the Eisenhower administration.The most significant event of late 1952 was the creation of the NationalSecurity Agency. On October 24, 1952, President Truman signed National SecurityCouncil Directive 6, a seven-page document that eliminated the first attempt atuniting all military signal intelligence (SIGINT) operations, and now replacedit with the NSA. Directive 6 remains classified to this day. The U.S. GovernmentManual says only, “The National Security Agency performs highly specializedtechnical and coordinating functions relating to the national security.” Itwould be many years before Americans learned about the sprawling apparatus thatlay behind that bland phrase. No public law defined or limited its powers.According to Blank Check author Tim Weiner, the only known mention of the agencyin the public laws of the United States is a 1959 statute: “Nothing in this actor any other law ... shall be construed to require the disclosure of theorganization or any function of the National Security Agency.”59[index_split_258.html#filepos1469653]The NSA describes its main function as planning, coordinating, directing, andperforming foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information security(INFOSEC) functions. That is, to safeguard all American national securityelectronic and signals communication, and to intercept all foreigncommunications. It is widely acknowledged to possess the world’s leadingcryptologic (e.g., code making and breaking) capability. Therefore, it was onlylogical that the newly created organization also inherited responsibility forOperation Shamrock. Only three NSA staff members—the director (DIRNSA), thedeputy director (D/DIRNSA), and one lower-level manager—knew the full extent ofthe project. It is unclear whether Harry Truman knew about Shamrock when hesigned the order creating the NSA.The NSA immediately became involved in UFO reports. Proof of 239 UFO documentswas recovered from NSA through FOIA requests, and 160 of those originated fromwithin NSA itself.60 [index_split_258.html#filepos1469794] This is surely a tinyproportion of actual NSA-UFO documents, but obtaining anything at all from NSAis no easy task. As authors Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett pointed out:> The NSA shreds forty tons of documents per day in its operations, but 239 UFO> documents are saved. Why?

Why?61> [index_split_258.html#filepos1469950] NSA’s collection of UFO reports began no later than 1953, that is, right away.This is further evidence of the serious nature of the UFO phenomenon."},{"pageContent":"THE WAVE SUBSIDES—A BIT While the CIA and ATIC worked toward a “final solution” to the UFO problem, theUFOs themselves were seen just about everywhere. The pace had slowed down fromthe summer, but by no means were unidentified flying objects absent from theskies of America, or for that matter, other nations. Press coverage of flyingsaucers was negligible, so this was a nonissue as far as the public wasconcerned. Still, many unsettling sightings continued to occur over restrictedmilitary areas, and jets continued to pursue unknown objects. Noteworthy eventsincluded a September 30 sighting of two discs at Edwards AFB in California, anOctober 11 domed disc sighting at Newport News, Virginia, an October 13 sightingof a round or elliptical object in Oshima, Japan, by an air force pilot andengineer, and an October 29 report from Hempstead, Long Island, involving asighting by the pilots of two F-94s. The report included a statement by one ofthe pilots:> Based on my experience in fighter tactics, it is my opinion that the object> was controlled by something having visual contact with us. The power and> acceleration were beyond the capability of any known U.S. aircraft. On November 16, 1952, hundreds of people near Landrum, South Carolina, saw alarge disc-shaped object, also seen by an air traffic controller throughbinoculars. On December 4, 1952, an F-51 pilot had a near collision with ablue-lighted UFO moving with “extreme” speed, maneuverability, and rate ofclimb. Intelligence officers questioned the pilot for two hours.62[index_split_258.html#filepos1470106]Another near collision occurred two days later near the Gulf of Mexico between aB-29 and an incredibly fast UFO at eighteen thousand feet, observed visually andon radar. Before converging with an enormous “mother ship,” the object appearedto travel at 5,000 mph. The large object then departed at 9,000 mph. Althoughthe speeds appeared simply unbelievable, the radar operators checked andrechecked, and were confident their results were accurate. When the NationalSecurity Council learned that this information had reached Keyhoe, “there wasimmediate consternation.” Apparently, the air force told Ruppelt to “find outhow Keyhoe got those reports!” Ruppelt then told a surprised colonel that Keyhoehad already been cleared for them.63 [index_split_258.html#filepos1470275]The CIA continued to report an intense wave of UFO sightings in Algeria, France,Equatorial Africa, and elsewhere for the remainder of the year.64[index_split_258.html#filepos1470454] ATIC received reports from abroad, too,including defense radar trackings of two UFOs over the Panama Canal Zone duringthe night of November 25-26, 1952. Later on the twenty-sixth, an F-94 chased adisc-shaped UFO near Goose Bay AFB in Labrador. Two crews at the base tracked asimilar object again on December 15. A detailed UFO report came from Americanair force personnel in Japan from December 29, 1952. This case included groundand airborne radar, as well as visual confirmation involving the officers andcrews of three aircraft regarding the UFO’s position, movements, and speed.65[index_split_258.html#filepos1470639]On January 6, 1953, UFOs were reported from Dallas and Duncanville, Texas, byweather bureau and CAA personnel. Another Japan sighting occurred on January 9,including radar tracking and an interception attempt by an F-94. On the sameday, B-29 pilots saw bluish-white, rapidly moving UFO lights in formation overSanta Ana, Texas.66 [index_split_258.html#filepos1470800]"},{"pageContent":"THE AIR FORCE GETS READY Thus, despite the drop-off of UFO reports, the air force remained motivated todo something about the UFO problem through the rest of 1952. Of great importancewas the work being coordinated by Air Force Maj. Dewey Fournet, who was leadinga study based on the “top fifty” UFO reports to analyze the objects’ reportedmotions in an attempt to determine whether they were intelligently controlled.The project had originated from the summer following discussions among Ruppelt,Fournet, and two of Fournet’s superiors, Col. Weldon Smith and Col. W A. Adams.The project was active throughout the late summer and autumn. By now, Fournet’sgroup concluded that the movements of UFOs did show intelligent control andindicated they were probably extraterrestrial. Fournet was excited by hisprogress, and he planned a special, surprise press conference that would showthe Tremonton, Utah, film, the navy analysis, and other strong UFO reports. Heplanned to conclude that alien spacecraft were observing the Earth.67[index_split_258.html#filepos1470962]Ruppelt followed the project and said the report “was hot because it wasn’tofficial and the reason it wasn’t official was because it was too hot.” Thereport circulated through high command levels of intelligence and was read withmuch interest. In Ruppelt’s cautious phrasing, its conclusions were accepted bypeople “just a notch below General Samford.” Yet no one was willing to stick hisneck out and officially send it to the top. The CIA wanted to see the report,and Frederick Durant asked Fournet to present his findings to the CIA. The FBIreferred to Fournet’s project in an October 27 memo:> Air intelligence still feels flying saucers are optical illusions or> atmospherical phenomena, but some military officials are seriously considering> the possibility of interplanetary ships.68> [index_split_258.html#filepos1471123] Events at Blue Book and ATIC were reaching a climax. By December, Blue Book wasdown to thirty UFO reports per month, but unknowns were still running at 20percent. Nevertheless, Ruppelt at this time asked for a transfer out of BlueBook, agreeing to stay until the end of February. His book gave no reason forthis request, and mentioned it only in passing. At the very least, his requestseems odd. Although not yet thirty, Ruppelt had managed an air force projectthat had risen to prominence within a year, and which enabled him to travelaround the country and give high-level briefings to senior Pentagon officials ona subject that fascinated millions of people. By all indications, he wasrespected for his work. Why, then, would he request a transfer out? And whywithhold the reason? There are no certain answers, but perhaps Ruppelt hadgotten some indication of the nature of the upcoming CIA-sponsored RobertsonPanel. Or maybe he began to realize that the Blue Book operation was not whatthe air force said it was—the military’s primary UFO investigative unit.Whatever the reason, it appears that Ruppelt had an idea of what was shortly tocome to ATIC.69 [index_split_258.html#filepos1471346]"},{"pageContent":"THE CIA GETS READY On November 21, 1952, an air force review panel met at ATIC for three days andrecommended that a “higher court” be formed to review the case of the UFO. Theytentatively scheduled this to take place in late December or early January.70[index_split_258.html#filepos1471488] On December 2, 1952, H. Marshall Chadwellprepared another secret memo for CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith. Thecontroversial memo stated:> At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something> going on that must have immediate attention.... Sightings of unexplained> objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of> major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not> attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.71> [index_split_258.html#filepos1471643] The fact that Chadwell could write such a statement shows that there werehigh-level people within the CIA who thought the UFO problem was relevant formore than its effect on the cold war. Chadwell clearly was concerned about theUFOs themselves, although he studiously avoided arriving at a conclusion on thematter. A National Security Council memo was attached to this, stating that theUFO problem had “implications for our national security.” It directed the CIA to“formulate, and carry out a program ... to solve the problem of instant,positive identification of unidentified flying objects.”72[index_split_258.html#filepos1471782]Two days after Chadwell’s memo, the Intelligence Advisory Committee gave thego-ahead for the panel. It recommended that the director of Central Intelligence“enlist the services of selected scientists to review and appraise the availableevidence in the light of pertinent scientific theories.” Chadwell was thedriving force and wanted H. P. Robertson to lead the panel. Robertson acceptedit “against his will,” then brought in the other four members.73[index_split_258.html#filepos1471992]A week later, on December 12, another meeting was held at ATIC, attended byrepresentatives from CIA, ATIC, and the Battelle Memorial Institute fromColumbus, Ohio. For some time, a group at Battelle had been studying the UFOproblem, in Hynek’s words, in “very great secrecy.” When members of this grouplearned of the impending CIA-sponsored study, they sent an urgent letter,classified Secret, to the CIA via the Blue Book office. They wanted the upcomingscientific panel postponed until they finished their own study. In January 1953,H. C. Cross, a senior staff member at Battelle, wrote a letter to Miles Coll atWright-Patterson AFB, with attention to Captain Ruppelt. Cross, realizing it wasfutile to delay the impending panel until Battelle could complete its study,argued that “agreement between Project Stork (Battelle) and ATIC should bereached as to what can and what cannot be discussed” at the meeting. He alsosuggested a “controlled experiment” be undertaken by the air force in order toobtain better physical data. This would consist of “observation posts withcomplete visual skywatch, with radar and photographic coverage, plus all otherinstruments necessary or helpful in obtaining positive and reliable data oneverything in the air over the area.” Cross actually suggested that the AirForce release “many different types of aerial activity ... secretly andpurposefully,” presumably in order to generate spurious UFO reports. There is noevidence that any such program occurred. However, while Battelle failed to delaythe timing of the Robertson Panel, it did eventually release its own report,named Blue Book Special Report Number 14, which developed an interesting historyof its own.74 [index_split_258.html#filepos1472150]"},{"pageContent":"THE ROBERTSON PANEL In 1952, concern about UFOs had peaked within the United States military, theintelligence community, and, as far as we can tell, the presidency itself.Chadwell’s December memo, written four months after the public debunking ofUFOs, showed extreme bewilderment about the nature of UFOs, as well as concernover what exotic things were over American skies. The navy and air force bothhad a strong contingent, possibly a majority, that believed UFOs wereextraterrestrial. The FBI continued to report on UFO developments to Hoover.Most importantly, American jets continued their efforts to interceptunidentified craft over their airspace, craft that seemed to be posing greaterdangers to American personnel than they had before. Every indication was thatthe American government was taking this problem very seriously, and that theproblem itself continued in a state of crisis.Moreover, since the summer of 1952, it had been fairly clear that DwightEisenhower would win the presidential election against Democratic opponent AdlaiStevenson. Truman’s staff knew the Republicans gleefully awaited a majorhousecleaning after November. Administration changes, especially party changes,always bring their share of difficult adjustments. Even within the CIA, aRepublican victory would likely mean changes for DCI Walter Bedell Smith. Butwhat about adjustments for a UFO control group? Ever since UFOs had been arecognized problem, Truman had been president. With that prospect ending, surelythose managing the problem wanted to keep it away from the wrong people. Merechanges in the presidency and controlling party could not be permitted to affectthe handling of this all-important problem.At the same time, something else was happening: a nascent “UFO Party” wasforming, within the military (e.g., Fournet and a few higher-ups) and in thecivilian sector (e.g., Keyhoe, Frank Edwards, and the civilian groups). Ofcourse, this had been a problem for some time. Now, in the aftermath of theGreat Wave, and facing the prospect of the uncertainties inherent in a newadministration, this “UFO Party” most assuredly needed to be silenced anddiscredited, posthaste. Otherwise, they might make even bigger waves (andgenerate bigger leaks) within the new administration.The last months of the Truman presidency give reasonable grounds to assert thatleading men in the administration had two basic goals: one for the immediateperiod, and one for the long term. The immediate goal was to silence anddiscredit the UFO party. The long-term goal was to ensure that no major mistakeswould occur by the new people about to take charge. Hence the significance ofthe Robertson Panel, which officially convened from Wednesday, January 14, toSunday, January 18, 1953. This was the last matter of any consequence inTruman’s eight years in the White House. Eisenhower was sworn in as presidenttwo days later, on Tuesday, January 20.Seen in this perspective, the panel’s significance is not that it merely servedto “debunk” UFOs—something all researchers have acknowledged. Rather, it was afinal insurance policy to steer the UFO issue away from the wrong people, tokeep it from being investigated by too many individuals and departments in theEisenhower presidency. The Robertson Panel was the Truman administration’s finalbit of housecleaning.Obviously, this was no job for the National Science Foundation. It is a matterof some importance that the organization entrusted with organizing the panel wasthe same organization involved in mind-control experiments, disinformation,foreign coups (Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954), media manipulation, the secretcollection of UFO reports, and surveillance against American UFO researchers.(Indeed, just days before the panel convened, the CIA had been caught tappingthe phone of the new president of Costa Rica, and continued for some time towage a disinformation campaign against him.) If the job was not to get to thebottom of a scientific question, but rather to control a multiheaded hydra, thenthe CIA was the ideal choice.Thus the setting for the Robertson Panel, held in secrecy and denied until 1958."},{"pageContent":"ROBERTSON PANEL: AGENDA The initial meeting convened at 9:30 A.M. on Wednesday, January 14. Its panelmembers included Dr. H. P Robertson, Dr. Luis Alvarez, Dr. Thornton Page, andDr. Samuel A. Goudsmit. CIA members Philip G. Strong, Lt. Col. Frederick C. E.Oder, David B. Stevenson, and Frederick Durant also attended. A fifth panelmember, Dr. Lloyd V Berkner, was absent until Friday afternoon, when the panelwas almost over.The Wednesday meeting reviewed the CIA interest in the matter, including the OSIstudy from August (authored by Strong, Eng, and Durant), the ATIC November 21meeting, the December 4 IAC decision, the visit to ATIC by Chadwell, Durant, andRobertson, and CIA concern over “potential dangers to national securityindirectly related to these sightings.” The group also saw the Tremonton andMontana films that morning.In the afternoon, Ruppelt, Hynek, and Fournet were present, as were Capt. HarrySmith and Dr. Stephen Possony. Navy analysts Harry Woo and Robert Neasham of theUSN Photo Interpretation Laboratory in Anacosta presented their analysis of bothfilms, which “evoked considerable discussion.” This segment lasted two hours.Ruppelt then spoke for forty minutes on Blue Book’s methods of handling UFOreports. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 P.M.The group met again on Thursday. In addition to panel members and CIA personnel,Ruppelt and Hynek attended. Ruppelt spoke some more about Blue Book; Hynekdescribed the work in progress at Battelle. The CIA also showed a motion picturefilm of seagulls, a clear hint at the conclusions they were seeking to reach.(Why would the CIA obtain motion pictures of seagulls flying, anyway?)Lieutenant Colonel Oder gave a forty-minute presentation on Project Twinkle.That afternoon, General Garland attended and stated his desire to: (1) increasethe use of thoroughly briefed air force intelligence officers to investigate UFOreports, (2) “declassify as many of the reports as possible,” and (3) enlargeBlue Book.Excepting Garland, everyone met again on Friday morning. Hynek and Fournet eachspoke at some length. Fournet gave no indication of his press release plan, butwas confident in his material and assumed the panel would accept his evidenceand agree on the need to prepare the country.75[index_split_258.html#filepos1472304] His description of individual cases evoked“considerable discussion.” After Berkner finally arrived that afternoon,Robertson reviewed the panel’s work and offered “tentative” conclusions.Moreover, “it was agreed” that Robertson would draft the panel report (which hadprimarily been done in advance by Durant). On Saturday morning, the final daythe group met, Robertson presented a “rough draft” of the panel report.Strangely, Berkner had previously reviewed and approved this draft. So didRobertson and Berkner burn the midnight oil on Friday night? Unlikely.Especially since by 11 A.M. CIA Director Walter Bedell Smith was shown thedraft, as was Air Force Director of Intelligence General Samford, both of whomwere favorable to it. Fast work, indeed. The day was spent primarily inreworking the draft (presumably, some of the report had to reflect the week’swork)."},{"pageContent":"ROBERTSON PANEL: CONCLUSIONS The panel report noted “the lack of sound data in the great majority of cases,and concluded that most sightings could be reasonably explained if more datawere available.” Trying to solve every sighting, however, “would be a greatwaste of effort.” The panel concluded that UFOs presented no evidence of adirect threat to national security, despite Chadwell’s memo from the previousmonth which stated otherwise. Toward this end the report indicated that bothRobertson and Alvarez had been involved in investigating foo fighters during theSecond World War [!] and had found them unexplained but harmless.While the panel members seemed uninterested in UFOs themselves, they were quiteconcerned about the public dimension of the UFO problem. It is questionable whya group of scientists would express an opinion on a matter of national security,something wholly outside its collective expertise. At least, it would be ifthese men were functioning as scientists. They decided it was “possiblydangerous in having the military service foster public concern in ‘nocturnalmeandering lights.’” Therefore, it recommended an “educational or trainingprogram” targeted to the public to eliminate “the popular feeling that everysighting, no matter how poor the data, must be explained in detail.” Theeducational program aimed toward “training and debunking”:> The debunking aim would result in reduction in public interest in “flying> saucers” which today evokes a strong psychological reaction. This education> could be accomplished by mass media such as television, motion pictures, and> popular articles. And the problem of gaining influence over the mass media? A foregone conclusion.The panel members were not short on their knowledge of people and channelswithin the media. Despite Hynek’s claim in later years that he was “negativelyimpressed” by the attitude taken by the panel leaders, he “suggested that theamateur astronomers in the U.S. might be a potential source of enthusiastictalent ‘to spread the gospel,’” that is, of debunking UFOs.The Robertson Panel report gives more evidence that, even in this early period,Blue Book did not receive all UFO reports. The report’s text indicated over1,900 UFO reports for 1952, although Blue Book only reported 1,503 for the year.Where were the other reports filed?The Panel also noted the existence of such loose cannons as Civilian FlyingSaucer Investigators (started in 1951) and APRO, and believed the organizationsneeded to be watched—which, of course, they were. “The apparent irresponsibilityand the possible use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept inmind.” Hynek said that APRO was not discussed during the week, other than as apassing reference. Thus, the Lorenzens came to believe, logically enough, thatthe idea was not the product of the panel, but of the CIA itself.76[index_split_258.html#filepos1472444]"},{"pageContent":"THE ROBERTSON PANEL: ANALYSIS Many of the assumptions in the panel’s report were alarmingly uninformed.Thornton Page, for example, considered the extraterrestrial hypothesis “quitepreposterous,” as it was unlikely that intelligent life was elsewhere in thesolar system, and that UFOs should confine themselves to “any one continent.”Could Page really not have known about the global nature of UFOs? If so, one canonly conclude that actual science was absent from this scientific study.The panel also rejected Fournet’s UFO reports as “raw” and “unevaluated,”although it provided no example as to what would not constitute a raw report(presumably one that offered a mundane explanation for a UFO). The Montana filmwas said to portray aircraft. Hundreds of verified UFO reports were ignored.Panel members rejected the navy’s detailed analysis of the Tremonton film andascribed the sighting to the “high reflectivity of seagulls in bright sunlight.”The navy’s mistaken conclusion, argued the panel, was probably due to the“apparent lack of guidance” with UFO reports and explanations. Ruppelt laterpointed out that nobody bothered to obtain witness testimony from DelbertNewhouse himself, the man who shot the Tremonton film. Ruppelt himself only didso later and was much impressed. According to Ruppelt, Newhouse “didn’t thinkthe UFOs were disc-shaped; he knew that they were.”The panel’s conclusions were preordained. Hynek said he discerned the panel’sdebunking mood right from the beginning. Fournet suspected right away that theactual author of the conclusions was not Robertson but Durant, and that he wrotethem late on Friday. Work by UFO researcher and historian Michael Swords pushesthe date further back: “Fournet did not know that the report, in draft form,existed before Friday and possibly before the panel was even convened onWednesday.”Many have questioned whether the CIA could manipulate a group of scientists toreach their desired conclusion. Kevin Randle, for example, doubted that “someonein the government [would be] confident enough in his own abilities tomicromanage the data [and] influence the conclusions....” But micromanaging datais not necessary when the right people are selected. The members of theRobertson Panel were power scientists, strongly connected with the military andnational security state. They were certainly no detached, impartial jury,withholding a decision until an objective review of the evidence. Quite thecontrary.Of later writers about the Robertson Panel, only Ruppelt was misled. He believedthe panel accepted Garland’s recommendation that Blue Book be expanded. He alsomisinterpreted the panel’s education and debunking recommendation, thinking itmeant that “the American public should be told every detail of every phase ofthe UFO investigation.” Others hit closer to home. Keyhoe believed the panel wasa CIA program to bury the UFO. Hynek—years later—stated he was “negativelyimpressed.” The Lorenzens understandably came down hard against the panel. Evenone of the panel members, Dr. Thornton Page, said in 1980 that the panel “tendedto ignore the five percent or ten percent [sic] of UFO reports that are highlyreliable and have not as yet been explained.” Many years later, Page made thematter crystal clear:> H. P. Robertson told us in the first private (no outsiders) session that our> job was to reduce public concern, and show that UFO reports could be explained> by conventional reasoning.77 [index_split_258.html#filepos1472604] Authors Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett called the panel not so much a“scientific” panel as a “propaganda” panel. In their words:> Labeling a twelve-hour roundtable discussion of UFOs a “scientific study” is> ludicrous, especially considering the fact that, in at least one instance, one> thousand man-hours was spent on one case ... by navy analysts, and the> conclusion was unknown. Point well taken. It seems odd, does it not, that following such a grave crisisof well-documented UFO sightings from 1952, the best thescientific-military-intelligence establishment could come up with was ... theRobertson Panel? A study of the problem that was, from a scientific perspective,utterly inadequate and inept? On the face of it, it makes no sense at all.78[index_split_258.html#filepos1472738]After all these years, the Robertson Panel still leaves a bad taste. In part,this is because Nobel-caliber scientists were involved in such scientificallyshallow and deficient work. Berkner showed up just in time to put his name onthe final document. The rest sat around for a few hours—precious time away frombusy calendars—to listen to a few presentations, probably feeling bored with asubject they all believed was nonsense long before they arrived. Would the CIAreally entrust policy-making authority to a group which, prestigious though itcertainly was, was unable to render an informed decision on the subject? Here wearrive at the core meaning of the Robertson Panel: a group that, by its veryprestige, was able to sanction a policy already decided upon. Within theclassified as well as the public world, it is always a good idea to cover yourvulnerable areas. What better way than with a panel composed of Nobel-caliberscientists needed to help defuse the UFO problem, certainly not to figure itout. This is the point that the people at Battelle missed. What the CIA and airforce wanted was not an actual study of the problem—they had enough of thosealready. What was needed, and fast, was adequate justification for a policydecision.The policies that followed as the result of the Robertson Panel, what we maywith justice call the true crackdown against UFO publicity, were not the resultof the Robertson Panel’s decisions. They were the result of the same policy thatcreated the panel itself, and which since the summer of 1952, had determinedthat UFOs were finally and truly going to go to sleep, as far as the public wasconcerned."},{"pageContent":"ROBERTSON PANEL: AFTERMATH On January 20, 1953, Dwight Eisenhower was inaugurated as the thirty-fourth U.S.President. On that day, Robertson wrote a letter to his good friend Chadwell,stating “perhaps that’ll take care of the Forteans for a while.” (This referredto followers of Charles Fort (1874-1932), author and early collector of UFOreports.) Robertson also mentioned a scheduled meeting with the “NSA group” onThursday, February 5. Robertson, clearly, was well plugged in with both the CIAand the NSA, the mere existence of which was unknown to the American public andits elected representatives.79 [index_split_258.html#filepos1473145]The Battelle Report, incidentally, remained secret until the air force deemed ituseful to publish in October 1955. Its conclusion, essentially identical to thatof the Robertson Panel, was that it was “highly improbable” that any UFO reportsindicated technological developments “outside the range of present-dayscientific knowledge.” An interesting difference with the Robertson Panel wasthat the Battelle study actually had data. Unfortunately for the report, thedata contradicted the conclusion by conceding a UFO “unknown” rate of 22 percentfor the period 1947-1952 (434 unknowns of a total of 2,199 reports analyzed). Nowonder the people at Battelle had been unhappy with their data back in December1952. None of this mattered, however, as the negative spin of the 1955 air forcepress release predetermined the media response. For added insurance, the airforce released a paltry one hundred copies of the report, so that no one reallygot a chance to read it anyway. Hynek later called the Battelle Report a“shamefully biased interpretation of statistics to support a preconceivednotion.”80 [index_split_258.html#filepos1473284]On January 24, Ruppelt was off to Ent AFB in Colorado Springs to give a one-hourbriefing for the 4602nd. Something interesting must have occurred, as inFebruary, Benjamin Chidlaw (commander of continental air defenses at Ent AFB)told future UFO researcher Robert Gardner that he had “stacks of reports aboutflying saucers. We take them seriously when you consider we have lost many menand planes trying to intercept them.” On March 5, 1953, General Burgess(commander of Ent AFB) sent a memo to Air Defense Command and the director ofintelligence at Ent AFB. Titled “Utilization of 4602nd AISS Personnel in ProjectBlue Book Field Investigations,” the memo suggested that field teams of 4602ndpersonnel interview UFO witnesses. ADC approved the plan a few weeks later.81[index_split_258.html#filepos1473474]Ruppelt was in Washington on January 29, when the press learned about theTremonton, Utah, film. In addition to Fournet, there were several others, suchas Al Chop of the DoD Office of Public Information and Colonel Teabert ofAFOIN-2, who believed that the movies should be released in accordance with thepromise made the previous summer that no UFO information would be withheld.Ruppelt was still under the idea that the Robertson Panel had recommended fulldisclosure about UFOs. Hence, he agreed to release the Tremonton film for thenewsmen. Ruppelt saw no danger in explaining the film as seagulls, or so heimplied in his book. By February 9, Al Chop had written the press release andhad shown it to Colonel Smith. They decided to release the air force and navyanalyses; otherwise, they thought, the press might suspect a cover-up of “hot”material. They seem to have assumed that the air force analysis (possibleaircraft) would outweigh the navy report (“self-luminous or light sources”).They recommended that the movie be released with air force statement thatalthough positive identification had not yet been made, it was confident thatwith more analysis it would be.82 [index_split_258.html#filepos1473647]Once the press release was ready, it moved on to General Garland of ATIC, whoapproved it. It then went to the Pentagon, which, in Ruppelt’s words, “screamed‘No!’” Suddenly, there would be no movie for the press and no press releasewhatsoever. Ruppelt was ordered into silence. Chop said to Keyhoe:> They [e.g., the CIA] killed the whole program. We’ve been ordered to work up a> national debunking campaign, planting articles in magazines and arranging> broadcasts to make UFO reports sound like poppycock. Ruppelt told Keyhoe:> We’re ordered to hide sightings when possible, but if a strong report does get> out we have to publish a fast explanation—make up something to kill the report> in a hurry, and also ridicule the witness, especially if we can’t figure out a> plausible answer. We even have to discredit our own pilots. It’s a raw deal,> but we can’t buck the CIA. The whole thing makes me sick—I’m thinking of> putting in for inactive. Fournet, already inactive, was ordered not to reveal his UFO conclusion. Hissecret report was bottled up at Air Force Headquarters as an “unfinisheddocument,” although it was quite finished.83[index_split_258.html#filepos1473791]It is impossible to know how straightforward this group was, whether they weregenuinely, albeit mistakenly, trying to implement the recommendations of theRobertson Panel, as Ruppelt implied, or were doing everything possible to getthe word out before the clampdown would take effect. Keyhoe’s opinion—alwaysdramatically expressed—still seems the most plausible. He called this group the“censor fighters” who fought “a last battle to reveal the Utah film.” Certainly,all the main players were soon out of the picture. Fournet was gone, Chop soonresigned in disgust, and Ruppelt was gone soon after. Before long, only Hynekremained of the Blue Book team. As a civilian scientist, he was less of a threatinside the project, and was willing to keep quiet. According to Hynek, “BlueBook was now under direct orders to debunk.”84[index_split_258.html#filepos1473970]At the end of February, Ruppelt left Blue Book for a seven-month assignment inDenver, replaced by Lt. Bob Olsson, whose staff consisted of one airman. Olssonlater told Ruppelt that his five months as head of Blue Book “was like beingpresident of Antarctica on a nonexpedition year.”85[index_split_258.html#filepos1474129]By March, prominent people in defense were privately urging Keyhoe “to tell theUtah film story.”Keyhoe continued to be a magnet for military personnel. Already, rumors reachedhim that the CIA was “slamming the lid down on the saucer stuff.” One sourcetold him:> The air force gave some of their top men a secret briefing. The CIA people> advised them to put out a new report, debunking the saucers the way they did> in ’49—tell the public the project was ended, and then carry it on> underground. It’d probably be top secret. Keyhoe responded, “They’d never get away with it, not with all they’ve let outnow.” But the fight was already over.86 [index_split_258.html#filepos1474310]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY The year 1952 had brought about the most severe UFO crisis yet. The problemthreatened to overwhelm the military in every way: by causing a mass panic, byclogging military communications, by presenting the Soviet Union with anopportunity to make mischief or worse, by causing dissension among the variousservices and within the ranks, by the air force’s continued inability to stopUFOs from trespassing over restricted airspace, and by the sheer number ofobjects in the sky that seemed capable and ready to overwhelm the nation.In such a situation, not everything could be solved. One fixes what one can. Ifthe objects themselves remained beyond control, then at least some things couldbe managed. The Robertson Panel—never intended as a scientific study ofUFOs—gave the sanction to remove the problem not only from the generalpopulation, but from the vast majority of military personnel. Why involve themilitary needlessly when it was incapable of acting and could not provide anynew information on this obviously intractable problem? The matter of controlbecame more urgent than usual, not only because of the new wave of UFO activity,but because the uncertainties of a new administration, however conservative andreliable it might be in some respects, demanded extra insurance of secrecy. From1953 onward, the small control group that managed the UFO problem held the reinsever tighter, if such a thing were possible. For a few years, this policy ofextreme secrecy met with more success than failure."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 5 Shutting the Lid: 1953 to 1956 > I have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the government, and> they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this> time.—Sen.

Prosperity increased and even became slightly less top-heavy.America reigned unchallenged as leader of the free world, and compared to thefollowing decade, the social order was remarkably stable. Below the surface ofAmerica’s “consensus culture,” however, the image of a nation striving fortruth, justice, and the American way was contradicted by events that remainedsubmerged, often for decades.With an official budget exceeding $100 million by 1953, the CIA was an importantpart of America’s subterranean history. DCI Allen Dulles had more resources andmoney than Hitler’s Abwehr, the KGB, or Britain’s secret intelligence service,and none of it was accountable to Congress.1[index_split_259.html#filepos1474565] One burgeoning area within the agency wasits mind control program, renamed MK-Ultra in April 1953, and led by SidneyGottlieb. MK-Ultra was deeply secret and recruited ethically challengedscientists to modify the behavior of people through covert chemical orbiological means. The program is best known for its use of LSD, but it triedmany other ways to harness the human mind, much of which was so sensitive thatdocumentation remains scarce. Very soon, Ewen Cameron would be working forMK-Ultra. In 1953, Cameron was elected president of the American PsychiatricAssociation and eventually became the first president of the World PsychiatricAssociation. One of his goals was to treat schizophrenics by inducing completeamnesia, then to guide the patient to recall only “normal” (or selected)behaviors. He had limited success, then inflated his claims. His grislyexperiments, conducted off American soil, included some that were terminal. Hewas a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein.2 [index_split_259.html#filepos1474704]Meanwhile, the U.S. Army secretly sprayed American cities with biologicalagents. From April through June, the army targeted St. Louis, as it had donepreviously with Minneapolis. This time, however, it tested only the black ghettosections, and arranged for local police surveillance “to minimize thepossibility of loss of equipment.” The burdens of slumming it paid dividends insecrecy. The army reported “much less public interest and curiosity” during thisfield test than in Minneapolis.3 [index_split_259.html#filepos1474893]Meanwhile, it seemed that the UFOs all flew away, at least compared with theyear before. They didn’t, of course, and actually appeared more frequently thanin many prior years, with the exception of 1952. Study of them continued, aswell. In April, Canadian Wilbert Smith wrote to Keyhoe that Project Magnet’sreport was “well along in the draft stages” and had concluded “the saucers areprobably [original emphasis] alien vehicles, since there is no other explanationwhich fits the facts.” Smith doubted that his government would accept hisrecommendation to study the physics and technology of UFOs. He completed theclassified report in August, writing, “We are forced to the conclusion that thevehicles are probably extraterrestrial. In spite of our prejudices to thecontrary.” To his superiors at the Department of Transportation, Smith suggestedsetting up an electronic station to maintain a twenty-four-hour watch for UFOs,in order to learn anything possible about their technology. To Smith’s surprise,his request was approved, and a small station was set up in a DOT-owned hut atShirley’s Bay, near Ottawa. Smith’s project received some press in November, butit appears that the participants worked on their own time, and that for the yearof its operation, only one incident of note (on August 9, 1954) took place. Onthat date, the gravimeter at Shirley’s Bay indicated a greater deflection in thegravitational field than a passing aircraft or other conventional object wouldhave caused. Smith was there at the time and rushed outside to see, but heavyclouds obstructed his view. The station was closed soon after, although thisapparently had been planned some time earlier.4[index_split_259.html#filepos1475030]One controversial incident involved a British airliner that crashed six minutesafter takeoff from Calcutta on May 2. No one survived, and wreckage wasscattered over a wide area. An investigator from the British Ministry of CivilAviation announced that the plane had “collided with a fairly heavy body.”Witnesses saw no other planes when the airliner “seemed to stop short inmidair.” UFO rumors persisted about the crash for over a year. On June 1, 1954,an official of the British Ministry of Civil Aviation told the London Daily Mailthat any UFO connection to the crash was “utter balderdash.”5[index_split_259.html#filepos1475189]On May 21, a UFO may have crashed near Kingman, Arizona. The account derivesfrom Arthur G. Stancil, (known previously under the pseudonym Fritz Werner), anengineer affiliated with the Atomic Energy Commission and the air force whoclaimed to have worked on a retrieval of a crashed alien disc. Stancil claimedhe was taken with other specialists in blacked-out buses to a desert site wherehe saw a thirty-foot-wide saucer embedded in the sand. He claimed to see ahumanoid figure, apparently dead, three to four feet tall inside a guarded tent.Stancil produced diaries indicating he was on a special mission at the time.Researcher Leonard Stringfield also spoke with a naval intelligence officer whotold him of alien bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB, allegedly from Kingman. Tothis day, many UFO researchers believe that a UFO may indeed have crashed atKingman, but follow-up efforts have produced nothing definitive.6[index_split_259.html#filepos1475369]Global sightings continued. The CIA reported an incident from May 18, 1953, inIran, in which a very bright, large, and fast-moving object was seen for twentyminutes over oil areas in Khuzistan. On May 23, South African radar tracked aUFO near the Cape moving at 1,000 mph. On the twenty-sixth, according to CIAfiles, a UFO followed a man driving from Capetown to Uppington. On July 13, aCIA officer clipped the full text of an article in the Stockholm dailynewspaper, The Morgon-Tidningen with the headline, “Danish Authorities Take aSerious View of the Problem of Flying Saucers.”7[index_split_259.html#filepos1475824]"},{"pageContent":"WHO WAS INVESTIGATING? Gen. Charles Cabell became deputy director of the CIA on April 23, 1953. Cabell,it will be recalled, preceded Samford as Air Force Director of Intelligence, andhad demanded better UFO reporting following the Fort Monmouth sighting ofSeptember 1951. Thus, the number two man at CIA was someone not only well versedin UFOs but personally interested in the subject.Meanwhile, Blue Book was disabled as a UFO investigative body, and the 4602ndAISS slowly acquired more responsibility. By July, the 4602nd had taken overnearly all of Blue Book’s UFO field investigations.8[index_split_259.html#filepos1476010] It appears that, rather than going througha single, unified military protocol, UFOs were being reported through variousmilitary channels to the offices deemed most appropriate. Observe how thesethree important UFO sightings of the summer were handled.First came an astounding report that described yet another violation ofrestricted airspace over the Oak Ridge nuclear facility. This one occurred onJuly 19, 1953. Witnesses saw a black object moving out of a high white cloud forabout five minutes. At times, the object appeared to be cigar-shaped, at othertimes round. According to the report:> This object was extremely black in color, having an appearance of a deep black> metal exterior with a fine gloss. It did not leave a vapor trail or were there> any lights of shine noticed. No sound was heard. The object flew east at a> tremendous speed for what appeared to be approximately three miles, where it> stopped. The object was then joined by two more of these same objects. A> formation similar to a spread “V” was formed, and the objects at a tremendous> speed flew in an eastward direction. This report was made by the Atomic Energy Commission, and addressed to theadjutant general in Washington, D.C.9 [index_split_259.html#filepos1476151]Another UFO report was from Perrin AFB on July 26. The top read “Emergency,” andthe text made clear why:> Ground observed seven unidentified flying objects, with one bright red light,> on each object hovering at estimated altitudes from five to eight thousand> feet. Visually observed from Perrin tower and citizens of Denison and Sherman,> Texas. No lateral movement was observed.

No> air-to-air contact made. No radar contact made by Perrin radar. Visual contact> was maintained from 2139C to 2155C. Visibility unlimited with clear sky> condition. This sixteen-minute sighting of seven UFOs in formation was classified as a“Vital Intelligence Sighting” and sent to Air Defense Command, the U.S.Secretary of Defense, and the CIA.10 [index_split_259.html#filepos1476324]The third major sighting of the summer occurred on the night of August 12 or 13,near Rapid City, South Dakota. This time, Blue Book was involved, althoughprobably not solely so. At around 8 P.M., Ground Observer Corps, or GOC, saw anunidentified object. Soon after, radar at Ellsworth AFB tracked a “well-defined,solid, and bright” object. The base scrambled an F- 84, and the pilot saw theUFO. Many witnesses then saw the object accelerate and climb. The F-84 pursued,but reached no closer than three miles. Now low on fuel, the F-84returned—followed by the UFO. Immediately, another F-84 was airborne. Beforelong, the pilot received strong radar returns of an object right in front ofhim. Although the pilot was a combat veteran, fear prevailed, and he broke offthe chase. The UFO went off the scope, traveling northeast toward Bismarck,North Dakota, about two hundred miles away.Reports soon came from Bismarck of a fast-moving, bright bluish object,identical to what had just been encountered in Rapid City. It hovered near anair filter center in Bismarck, seen by many witnesses. After performing variousmaneuvers, it disappeared after midnight. Before it left, three other UFOsappeared and were seen at ten thousand feet for three hours. The air force hadno planes in Bismarck to pursue the objects.Ruppelt personally investigated this case and called it “the best” in the airforce files. Hynek also investigated, but did not say whether he worked withRuppelt. In his report he wrote that “the entire incident ... has too much of anAlice-in-Wonderland flavor for comfort.” Vallee called the encounter “one of themost remarkable events in the history of American sightings.” The official fileof the incident is several hundred pages long, with interviews and accounts frommany military personnel. Yet, Blue Book later removed the case from its list ofunknowns.11 [index_split_259.html#filepos1476467]The air force sought to clarify UFO reporting procedures with the issuance ofAFR 200-2 on August 26, 1953, which superseded AF 200-5 from the previous year.The order tightened UFO reporting and investigating procedures and furtherrestricted the release of UFO information. It directed that all confirmed UFOreports be rushed electronically to air force intelligence. When possible, alltangible evidence would go to ATIC at Dayton.The order also confined UFO investigations to three groups: air forceintelligence at the Pentagon, the 4602nd AISS, and ATIC. However, it stipulatedthat ATIC would only receive UFO reports after they passed through the 4602nd.AFR 200-2 thus formally stripped Blue Book of its investigative function,leaving it little more than a public relations front. Freelance investigatorswere definitely off-limits: even top-ranking air force officers were warned notto probe beyond the first stage of investigating a UFO, which essentially meantsecuring preliminary UFO reports for the three groups based on clearly specifiedquestions to be asked of witnesses. Sightings were to be discussed only with“authorized personnel.”The order further provided that only hoaxes, practical jokes, and erroneous UFOreports could be given to the press. All radar-scope photographs of UFOs werenow classified, and public release of unexplained sightings was forbidden.12[index_split_259.html#filepos1476872]AFR 200-2, a clear implementation of the Robertson Panel recommendations,signified a rapid drop-off in reported sightings by air force personnel.Henceforth, Blue Book cases constituted a distinct minority of compelling UFOsightings. That reality contrasted starkly with Blue Book’s public image as theUFO investigative office. Some good sightings still reached Blue Book, but fewerescaped as “unidentified” than in previous years. For three consecutive nights,for example, from July 29 to August 1, a disc-shaped UFO descended overSequoia-Kings National Park in California. On the final night, a squadron of airforce fighters tried to force it to land, but the craft easily outmaneuvered thejets and soared away.13 [index_split_259.html#filepos1477147] Then, on August 6,at least seventy-five lighted objects appeared between 5 P.M. and midnight nearthe Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor. The objects were seen visually andtracked on radar (both ground and air); some hovered, others moved swiftly.Finally, in Moscow, Idaho, on August 9, several GOC personnel reported a largeglowing disc, and three F-86 fighters tried to close on the object. The discdived toward the three aircraft before speeding away. None of these cases wereBlue Book unknowns.14 [index_split_259.html#filepos1477283]The few sightings Blue Book now classified as unknown were usually less dramaticand more innocuous than the others. This tendency became more pronounced as theyears passed, so that most of the unknowns were of the vague “lights in thenight sky” variety. One of the few unknowns for the second half of 1953, andamong the more interesting, occurred on August 20, near Castle AFB inCalifornia. The crew of a TB-29 bomber/trainer plane saw a greyish oval objectshortly after 9 P.M. The object made four passes at the airplane, then divedvertically as if it were two objects.15 [index_split_259.html#filepos1477445]Only a handful of officially unsolved cases remained for 1953, none of whichwere especially memorable, despite several involving military personnel.16[index_split_259.html#filepos1477593]Of greater interest were the reports that went elsewhere. These came to light invarious ways, through people like Keyhoe, internal documents released throughFOIA, foreign news stories, and so on. A GOC report from San Rafael, California,dated August 28, 1953, is one such case. This report was forwarded to the JointChiefs of Staff, the CIA, and the newly formed National Security Agency. It doesnot appear to have gone through ATIC. The report described:> Fourteen cigar-shaped objects without wings with ... lights on them in loose v> formation. About the size of a bi-motor ... acft. No sound or means of> propulsion observed. One object appeared to be leading the formation at an> estimated speed of 200 mph.... Objects were first observed heading west . . .> through breaks in the clouds. Then objects appeared to turn and head north> disappearing behind clouds ... observer appeared to be reliable and has been> an observer on duty with GOC for sev years during WWII and during postwar> years.17 [index_split_259.html#filepos1477757] The U.S. appears to have been interested in a UFO encounter from Port Moresby,New Guinea, on August 31, 1953. (Vallee gives the date August 23.)18[index_split_259.html#filepos1477917] The deputy director of the CivilianAviation Department in New Guinea took ninety-four frames of motion picture filmthat showed a disc-shaped object come out of a peculiar cloud, make aninety-degree turn, and climb steeply. The former Minister for Air described theman who took the film as a “reliable, credible person.” The Australian FlyingSaucer Review claimed the film was studied by the Royal Australian air forceintelligence and the U.S. Air Force. Little surprise that aviation experts of1953 would want to know how to duplicate that fear.19[index_split_259.html#filepos1478058]Near London, England, on November 11, a huge, white, metallic and “completelycircular” UFO was tracked on radar and observed visually through a telescope bythe 256th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment. Radar picked up a circular object thatremained stationary for a long time, then slowly moved off until it passedbeyond tracking range. An RAF pilot and his navigator in a Vampire fighter attwenty thousand feet saw the object far above them, which seemed like a brightstar. Suddenly, it “buzzed” them, passing over them at tremendous speed. Thepilots were questioned for ninety minutes after landing. The object was observedfor another twenty-five minutes by four aircraft technicians, which theydescribed as “quite definitely not a balloon.” The RAF pilots described theirsighting on British television two days later. On the twenty-fourth, the Britishparliament discussed this incident and others, and the Ministry of Defense saidthat two experimental meteorological balloons had been observed, a comment thatreceived much laughter. One MP called the incident “all ballooney.”20[index_split_259.html#filepos1478197]Probably the most bizarre and controversial UFO case of the year was theNovember 23 incident over Soo Locks, Michigan. Keyhoe and Frank Edwards were themain people involved in ferreting this out. What appears to have happened isthat an Air Defense Command Ground Control Intercept controller was alerted tothe presence of an unidentified and unscheduled target on his radar scope at SooLocks. An F-89, piloted by twenty-six-year-old Felix Montcla and co-piloted byLt. R. R. Wilson, was scrambled to intercept the object. The radar station hadthe F-89 and the UFO on the scope as the two blips merged into one. For a momentthe single blip remained on the scope, then disappeared. No trace of wreckage orthe missing men was ever found. The story was carried briefly on AP, but Keyhoeand Edwards faced continual stonewalling by military brass.The Pentagon’s official explanation was that the unknown radar blip turned outto be a Canadian C-47. The F-89, far from colliding with it, never got closerthan several miles from the aircraft. Montcla’s plane then crashed for unknownreasons, but he may have suffered from vertigo and lost control of his plane.The explanation was weak—no records indicated that he was flying on instruments,and no transcript of his conversations with traffic controllers was everreleased. Furthermore, the Canadian government repeatedly denied any connectionof its aircraft to the incident.A few years later, a script for a production of the Soo Locks case wasdeveloped—and cleared—at Lackland AFB in Texas, promoting a strongly pro-UFOperspective. The script died a quick death, before which it was sent to Keyhoeand Richard Hall. Both believed the script was the creation of UFO enthusiastsacting on their own, not at the direction of Air Force Headquarters. Yearslater, Hall continued to think of the entire incident as “extremely odd.”21[index_split_259.html#filepos1478381]A few noteworthy sightings occurred in December, all outside of Blue Book’spurview. On the seventh, army personnel saw an unidentified object above FortMeade, Maryland, future site of the NSA. On the ninth, the CIA reported anincident from France in which multiple witnesses saw a high, motionless,luminous object suddenly change position and shape, then disappear. On December17, the Swedish Defense High Command ordered a full-scale investigation intosightings of a wingless circular object which had flown rapidly over southernSweden.22 [index_split_259.html#filepos1478602]On the final day of the year, U.S. Marines at Quantico Marine Base, Virginia,claimed to see a flying saucer land for a few minutes near their base, then takeoff. The object was said to be round and emitted red pulsating lights. On fourprevious nights, near the same base, UFOs were seen maneuvering in the air, oneat tree-top height. They seemed to be under intelligent control.23[index_split_259.html#filepos1478814]In addition to the above, there always seemed to be rumors about events that noone recorded. One incident, undated and unconfirmed, is alleged to have occurredduring the summer at Ernest Harmon AFB, near Stevensville, Newfoundland. Baseradar picked up an unknown blip, and two F-94 jets pursued. One pilot saw anobject visually, picked it up on radar, and climbed steeply in pursuit.According to one witness, “The next thing I know was the jet going straight downin a dive. It crashed into a mountain.”24 [index_split_259.html#filepos1478956]"},{"pageContent":"KEYHOE’S ACTIVITIES Donald Keyhoe had an eventful fall of 1953. He learned of AFR 200-2 inSeptember, then he met with Adm. Arthur W Radford, Chairman of the JCS, for anarticle on national defense. Years before, Keyhoe and Radford had trainedtogether, and Keyhoe had served under him in Washington during the war. Duringthis meeting, UFOs were not mentioned, although it will be recalled that Radfordhad his own UFO sighting in 1952. In October, Keyhoe’s Flying Saucers from OuterSpace came out, eventually becoming one of the most widely read books of thedecade. His message: aliens are here, observing our world; the military knowsthis and, in a well-meaning but mistaken notion, is hiding this information fromthe public, mainly to avoid panic. Keyhoe argued that the public would be ableto handle the news, if it were delivered in a calm and straightforward manner.Moreover, the public—at least the American public—had a right to know. Then andlater, Keyhoe’s conspiracy thesis came under attack.25[index_split_259.html#filepos1479102]Probably the most stunning aspect of Keyhoe’s book was that he had been able toget clearance through Ruppelt and Chop for fifty-one classified UFO reports andincluded these in his book. The air force stated that Keyhoe “misrepresented”the official analysis of these reports. Keyhoe took this personally and doggedlyworked to clear himself of the charge. On October 1, he sent a telegram to AirForce Secretary Talbott and General Sory Smith, with copies to the press wireservices. He said that the air force “publicly implied” that he hadmisrepresented their UFO position. “If this is true,” he wrote, “then as aMarine Corps officer I should be subjected to disciplinary action.” The airforce provided “no comment” on the telegram. This would not be the last of theaffair, however.26 [index_split_259.html#filepos1479242]Keyhoe’s book sold very well, but reaction from major media was generallynegative, although it was not universally condemned as Scully’s book had been in1950. The review in Library Journal, for example, stated that he was either“very right or very wrong.” Keyhoe’s most significant critic in the media wasJonathan N. Leonard, the science editor for the New York Times. Leonard reviewedKeyhoe’s book in November, ignored its main strength—the clearance for overfifty UFO classified reports—and attacked it as teeming with “unidentifiableauthorities and anonymous sources.”27 [index_split_259.html#filepos1479382]"},{"pageContent":"ALBERT BENDER AND “THE MEN IN BLACK” Although this incident is not the first alleged case of the infamous “Men inBlack,” it is the first “classic” case and the first to receive any attention.It concerns a young man named Albert K. Bender, who had an interest in UFOs. Inthe fall of 1952, a letter of Bender’s was printed in Ray Palmer’s Other Worldsmagazine, announcing the formation of a new organization, the InternationalFlying Saucer Bureau (IFSB), which welcomed new members. West Virginia residentGray Barker soon offered his help and told Bender what he knew of the Flatwoodscase, which, along with others like Ivan Sanderson, he had investigated. InJanuary 1953, Bender asked Barker to head IFSB’s new “Department ofInvestigation.”In September 1953, Bender told Barker that three men in black suits, members ofthe U.S. government, had threatened him into abandoning his research. Barker wassurprised, as the organization now had representatives in much of the countryand abroad. In early October, Barker and other members interviewed Bender at hishome. To their many questions, Bender said simply, “I can’t answer that.” In thefinal issue of IFSB’s Space Review, Bender wrote that he knew the solution tothe flying saucer mystery but that a “higher source” ordered him not to publishit. The IFSB closed down.Some UFO researchers concluded that Bender had been pressured out of business bygovernment agents. Others, such as Coral Lorenzen, wrote in the APRO Bulletinthat perhaps the IFSB was secretly backed by a pulp magazine publisher (Palmer?)who suddenly withdrew his funds. Bender then cooked up a fantastic story inorder to get out from underneath. Barker, in turn, called this scenario“fantastic.”28 [index_split_259.html#filepos1479598]Albert Bender dropped out of the UFO scene after this. Ten years later, he wrotea book that told a different story. In the late summer of 1953, wrote Bender, hewas visited by three men. But these were not government agents; rather, theywere aliens. They gave him an unusual piece of metal, similar to a coin, to helphim communicate with them. He soon contacted the three beings again and wastransported to a large room, perhaps a flying saucer. A being told himtelepathically that their race would be here only briefly, in order to take “avaluable chemical from your seas.” He told Bender they had infiltrated “numerousplaces about your planet.” The being had initially appeared human to Bender butlater showed its true hideous appearance. It warned Bender against “continuedexperimentation with radioactive material,” which> will undoubtedly have effects upon future generations.

Bender soon found himself alone, lying on his bed. He was met with disbelieffrom a friend on the IFSB executive committee, and realized that he could nottell his story. He decided to tell the committee “part of the truth”: (1) thatcertain individuals had warned him against further investigation of UFOs; (2)they had impressive credentials; (3) they had revealed the secret of thesaucers; (4) the saucer mystery was approaching a solution. After this fantasticstatement, Albert Bender once again dropped out of sight, this time for good.29[index_split_259.html#filepos1479760]Perhaps Coral Lorenzen was right all along. Still, it is true that from late1953 through early 1955, several UFO enthusiasts in Australia, Canada, and NewZealand left the field amid rumors they were silenced by MIBs.30[index_split_259.html#filepos1480044]"},{"pageContent":"SILENCING THE UFO Whatever it was that silenced Albert Bender—aliens, government agents, lack offunds, or his own dementia—certain groups worked toward silencing the UFOproblem. During the latter part of 1953, as the 4602nd AISS assumed greaterresponsibility for investigating UFO reports, the Pentagon and intelligencecommunity continued to monitor the situation for leaks and to take additionalmeasures to tighten the secrecy. Very little appeared to be as it seemedoutwardly. For example, Harvard astronomer and professional UFO debunker DonaldMenzel was in close touch with air force intelligence regarding UFOs. On October16, Menzel wrote to Air Force Director of Intelligence Gen. John Samford that hewas> planning to be in Washington on government business ... October 22 and 23> [1953] ... From various reports I judge that some of my explanations of flying> saucers have been misinterpreted or misunderstood.... I should be delighted to> meet with as many members of ATIC as find it convenient to come.31> [index_split_259.html#filepos1480183] On October 22, Menzel met at the Pentagon with representatives of the Air ForceHeadquarters and ATIC. The details of his meeting are not known. Of course,Keyhoe would undoubtedly have loved to know that Menzel was secretlycorresponding with Samford and meeting with air force intelligence.Two months later, the Air Force Headquarters representative from the meetingwith Menzel wrote to the ADC deputy for intelligence regarding the newresponsibilities of ADC. It was understood that the 4602nd would do the “legwork” of UFO investigations and provide ATIC with its findings. The letter alsoclearly stated how to handle truly unidentified sightings:> ... As you realize, there is a 10 to 20 percent area of unexplained objects in> this program ... we would like to offer you guidance in the publicity angle as> it pertains to your activity ... if they can verify the object as a balloon,> aircraft, helicopter, etc., go ahead and inform interested parties.

If your people get into analyzing the 10 to 20> percent area to the public, every news media across the country will pick up> the story.32 [index_split_259.html#filepos1480337] This was a basic restatement of AFR 200-2, which ordered that no UFO informationof value reach the public.As if AFR 200-2 were not stringent enough, the Joint Chiefs of Staff reissuedJANAP 146 (Joint-Army-Navy-Air-Publication) in December 1953. This made anypublic release of a UFO report a crime under the Espionage Act, punishable by aone- to ten-year prison term or a $10,000 fine. It differed from AFR 200-2primarily in that it applied to anyone who knew of its existence, including allbranches of the military, and even commercial airline pilots. According tohistorian David Jacobs, “this action effectively stopped the flow of informationto the public.” Keyhoe, as usual, was on the ball, and learned of JANAP 146almost immediately. That month, President Eisenhower issued an Executive Order(10501) abolishing the classification of “Restricted.” Keyhoe considered this a“stunning blow” to the silence group, as both JANAP 146 and AFR 200-2 wereRestricted defense documents. But UFO secrecy was unaffected, as meaningfulsightings were simply classified at higher levels.33[index_split_259.html#filepos1480509]On December 4, General Burgess chaired a conference with 4602nd officers andstated that the 4602nd was the agency responsible to ATIC for investigatingUFOs. Captain Cybulski then left for Wright-Patterson AFB to coordinateactivities more closely with ATIC. He reported that the project astronomer(Hynek) was “ready to quit.” The astronomer said:> [P]ut yourself in my position. I am being ridiculed by members of my> profession for chasing those imaginary objects.... I have not been able to get> support from the air force. It seems they all think this is a hot subject, and> they want to drop it.... No one wants to be quoted. Cybulski himself took a hard line against the extraterrestrial hypothesis andstated that “in all but a few cases a satisfactory solution has been reached andthe air force feels that adequate, thorough investigative procedures can solvethe small percentage of unsolved sightings. This is where we come into thepicture.”34 [index_split_259.html#filepos1480987]Blue Book now had scarcely the ability to handle any report it received, sinceits staff consisted of two people. No wonder Cybulski said that AISS would“exhaust all efforts to identify a sighting before turning it over to ATIC.” Asa result, the AISS maintained a complete file on all UFO sightings. Reportswould be unclassified, “unless data included necessitates a higherclassification,” or if “and this I rather doubt ... it happens to be the realthing.” Despite Cybulski’s skepticism, he stated that reports would include suchitems as maneuvers and intercept attempts. This begs the obvious question:maneuvers by what, intercept attempts of what?35[index_split_259.html#filepos1481132]"},{"pageContent":"LSD, MIND CONTROL, AND THE DEATH OF FRANK OLSEN By this time, methods of assassination and neutralization had become quitesophisticated among the world’s leading intelligence organizations. It isbelieved, for example, that the Soviets were delving into the biological effectsof microwaves as early as 1953.36 [index_split_259.html#filepos1481273]Americans were working hard to develop biological and chemical weapons for useagainst large populations and individual targets. One specialist and casualty inthis quest was Frank Olsen, a leading scientist at the army’s Chemical Corps,Special Operations Division (SOD) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The CIA had beenworking with Olsen for some time, as SOD provided the agency with an array ofdeadly chemicals and microbes that were undetectable upon a detailed autopsy.SOD also made various “operational systems” to infect foes with diseases such asanthrax. Only a very few CIA officials knew that the agency was paying SOD$200,000 per year for these services, a relationship that continued at leastuntil 1969, by which time SOD had stockpiled a veritable mountain ofbacteriological agents.Olsen had been duped into meeting with MK-Ultra director Gottlieb and other CIAofficials for a meeting at a secluded cabin on November 19, 1953. That evening,Gottlieb spiked Olsen’s alcoholic drink with LSD. This sort of thing had beengoing on at the agency all year, but principally among CIA staffers. Usually,the trip would last a little while, the unwitting subject would recover, andnotes would be taken on the experience. All good fun. Frank Olsen, however, hada very bad trip. Days later, he still wasn’t right. He was depressed,incoherent, and uncommunicative to friends or family. His CIA handlers took himto a “doctor” in New York City, who prescribed him more alcohol. Olsen thenplunged to his death from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel. According to theCIA man assigned to him, Olsen simply rushed out of his bed and crashed throughthe window. Of course, there were no other witnesses, and Olsen was a securityrisk. Twenty years later, Olsen’s family finally learned the truth, such as itwas revealed, and received $750,000 from Congress in compensation. Throughout,the CIA’s main concern was to maintain plausible deniability.37[index_split_259.html#filepos1481413]In this context, it is useful to recall that the son of American activist PaulRobeson claimed the FBI slipped his father hallucinogenic drugs during the 1950sin order to neutralize him. Many people dismissed these claims as paranoid, butit is true that for three decades the bureau harassed Robeson and spread falserumors about him. The case of Frank Olsen makes the claims of Robeson’s son abit more plausible, whether the actual culprit was the bureau or the agency.38[index_split_259.html#filepos1481577]The most serious work was done in great secrecy. On February 19, 1954, the CIA’sMorris Allen conducted the ultimate hypnosis experiment: the creation of a“Manchurian Candidate,” or programmed assassin. Allen first hypnotized asecretary to remain sleeping until he—and only he—commanded her to awaken. Next,he hypnotized another secretary to try to awaken the first, and if she couldnot, to become so enraged as to kill her. He left an unloaded gun nearby. Notonly did the second woman “shoot” the sleeping woman, but she could not recallthe incident and denied shooting anyone. As significant as this milestone was,researcher John Marks pointed out that most of the CIA’s work on hypnosis isunavailable, but that terminal experiments involving hypnosis and torture couldeasily have been conducted on behalf of the CIA by friendly police in countriessuch as Taiwan or Paraguay. Marks tried, but failed, to obtain more informationabout this.39 [index_split_259.html#filepos1481719]"},{"pageContent":"A BRIEF OUTBREAK OF TRUTH In 1953, an issue of American Magazine featured a one-page article on CoralLorenzen, bringing worldwide publicity for APRO and enabling its membership toclimb. (She soon met with Hynek, who appeared “not deeply engrossed” and“certainly skeptical” of the reality of UFOs.) Stories about Coral Lorenzen weresmall potatoes, however. By the end of 1953, news services had virtually ceasedto carry UFO reports. The few that did were strictly local affairs. Even theSoviet Union provided some help in American censorship efforts. On December 7,1953, Radio Moscow stated that “flying saucers are figments of the imaginationsof western war mongers designed to make taxpayers swallow heavier militarybudgets.”40 [index_split_259.html#filepos1481881]On December 8, the CIA reported that UFO sightings had fallen dramatically fromthe previous year—no doubt, it argued, due to its policies. The reportacknowledged that there were still UFO cases “of possible scientificintelligence value,” but emphasized pursuing these carefully. Otherwise, “afanatical saucer believer” might notice an interest and accuse the government ofa cover-up.41 [index_split_259.html#filepos1482054]There remained a few voices in the United States fighting UFO censorship.Keyhoe’s was probably the most significant, but close behind was that of hisfriend, Mutual Radio broadcaster Frank Edwards. Before Art Bell, there was FrankEdwards, who was one of the key disseminators of UFO information during theearly 1950s. In a 1953 nationwide poll of radio-TV editors by the trade paperRadio Daily, Edwards was named among the top three news broadcasters in thenation, along with Edward R. Murrow and Lowell Thomas. His audience wasestimated at 13 million people every night. On January 13, 1954, Edwards allegedon his show that the wreckage of a flying saucer was being stored at a “westcoast military field.” Journalist Richard Reilly of the Washington Times-Heraldwas another “fanatical saucer believer.” In three articles that began onDecember 26, 1953, Reilly questioned the air force’s professed openness aboutUFOs, as it had become nearly impossible, he wrote, to obtain UFO reports.42[index_split_259.html#filepos1482195]Shortly after Reilly’s article came the scoop (1/4/54) that U.S. Marines atQuantico had seen UFOs for several consecutive nights. The Washington Daily Newseven reported that it “ran into what seems a deliberate attempt to cover upcertain facets of the investigation.” At this time, the Cleveland Press, aScripps-Howard paper, was asking authorities at ATIC for permission to see theTremonton, Utah, film. The Pentagon dragged its feet but finally agreed to let ajournalist see it at Dayton. By the time the reporter was ready to make thetrip, ATIC told him that their only copy had just burned up. No worry, saidATIC, as there was a master copy at the Pentagon. When the reporter spoke withan air force spokesman at the Pentagon, he was told, “we have no copy here, butwe believe there is one at Dayton.” The reporter gave up. The Press ran aJanuary 6 headline, “Brass Curtain Hides Flying Saucers.”43[index_split_259.html#filepos1482354]Isolated segments of the media continued to work this theme. On February 11,1954, several Scripps-Howard papers charged that the air force knew what flyingsaucers were and was hiding the truth for fear of panic. Papers also reportedthat Eisenhower’s executive order abolishing the “Restricted” classification wasdeceptive, as> many military had upgraded documents to “Confidential” or “Secret.” Some> security officers had created a new grade—“for official use only.” By this> device, even declassified information could not be released to the> newspapers.44 [index_split_259.html#filepos1482513] On February 13, Jim G. Lucas of Scripps-Howard reported that representatives ofmajor airlines were planning to meet in Los Angeles with intelligence officersof the Military Air Transport Service. The purpose was to speed up UFO reportingprocedures. Lucas wrote that airline pilots were reporting large numbers of UFOsduring their flights and were now being asked “not to discuss their sightingspublicly or give them to newspapers.” Lucas had accurate information. OnFebruary 17, 1954, officers of the Military Transport Intelligence met withofficials of the Airline Pilots Union at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. Thegoal of the meeting was to implement JANAP 146, specifically to arrange forpilots to radio UFO reports to the nearest airport and make no public statementsabout them. Violations brought prison terms of up to ten years and/or a fine of$10,000.45 [index_split_259.html#filepos1482657]Scripps-Howard papers followed up on February 23 to report that “the nation’s8,500 commercial airline pilots have been seeing a lot of unusual objects whileflying at night, here and overseas.” It confirmed that plans for a detailedreporting system were agreed upon to enable the air force to investigate UFOsquickly. Each airline had an “internal security specialist” to meet with the airforce.46 [index_split_259.html#filepos1482853]Meanwhile, on February 13, 1954, astronomer (and discoverer of Pluto) ClydeTombaugh gave a talk to the Astronomy Society at Las Cruces, New Mexico. To thesurprise of many, he predicted an increase in UFO sightings and told theaudience to keep their eyes open and be ready to report any sighting quickly andprecisely. Two days later, on February 15, 1954, journalist Dorothy Kilgallenwrote: “Flying saucers are regarded as of such vital importance that they willbe the subject of a special hush-hush meeting of world military heads nextsummer.”47 [index_split_259.html#filepos1482992]Also during February 1954, a new civilian UFO organization sprang intoexistence: the Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York (CSI). Its membersincluded Ted Bloecher, Alexander Mebane, Isabel Davis, and others. They soonhelped prepare the books of French UFO research Aimé Michel for the Americanpublic.48 [index_split_259.html#filepos1483148]These direct attacks against UFO secrecy ultimately made it more difficult toobtain information from the Pentagon. Public information officers now refusedall requests to see UFO reports, including even those previously released, andreporters seeking information were banned from Wright-Patterson AFB. The Britishgovernment seems to have been working in concert: on January 25, 1954, theBritish Air Ministry and the British War Office ordered soldiers and airmen totell the public nothing of UFOs.49 [index_split_259.html#filepos1483287]In addition to clamming up, the Pentagon also initiated its own media offensive.This included an article planted by the air force in American Aviation Daily onFebruary 21, that debunked UFOs and “definitely” attributed the latest wave ofsightings to Keyhoe’s latest book, Flying Saucers from Outer Space.50[index_split_259.html#filepos1483467] After the appearance of Keyhoe’s new book,a Yale professor named Thomas B. Eickhoff asked the air force if it had actuallycleared the intelligence reports Keyhoe listed in his book. The answer:No—Keyhoe had not used cleared ATIC sightings. Early in March, Eickhoff informedKeyhoe of this fact. He quoted the air force letter:> [T]he publication to which you have referred was not submitted to the air> force for authentication prior to publication. There is no official> recognition and the air force does not choose to comment upon it.51> [index_split_259.html#filepos1483626] Keyhoe never needed much provocation for a crusade; he now set out to gather hisproof. Ruppelt had just left the air force, succeeded at Blue Book by Capt.Charles Hardin and a total staff of two. Wasting no time, Keyhoe met withRuppelt at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on April 4. They shared UFO accounts,and Ruppelt mentioned an upcoming UFO article he helped to write for True (hisconclusion: if flying saucers were real, they were interplanetary). Ruppeltagreed to write a letter supporting the claim that Keyhoe had used genuine ATICsightings for his book. His letter, dated a week later, also stated: (1) Therequest to clear classified UFO reports for Keyhoe came from air forceintelligence and the Office of Public Information; Ruppelt’s superiors at ATICthen declassified them. (2) Keyhoe had correctly quoted the ATIC material. (3)The analysis of the Utah film was classified, and the press release Ruppelt hadprepared at Dayton had not been made public. (4) A letter by Albert Chop toHenry Holt and Company which attacked “the silence group” was honest and correctin all respects. (5) Except in a very few cases, ATIC rejected Donald Menzel’stheory that UFOs were sun dogs, halos, light refractions, etc. It appearedRuppelt had chosen his side of the battle.52[index_split_259.html#filepos1483767]The stew over Keyhoe’s book continued until November, when General Samforddecided to end the mess. He summoned Col. John O‘Mara from Dayton and directedhim to clear up any misunderstanding about Keyhoe’s use of air force data.O’Mara was directed to write to Eickhoff and explain that he had misunderstoodthe air force, that Keyhoe’s latest book did contain officially released airforce reports—which it did, of course.53 [index_split_259.html#filepos1483962]Meanwhile, another independent UFO organization came into existence. In March1954, Leonard Stringfield formed Civilian Saucer Research, Interplanetary FlyingObjects (CRIFO) out of Cincinnati. Within months, Stringfield gained nationalrecognition after Frank Edwards plugged him on the radio. Stringfield wasswamped with requests for his newsletter—six thousand in one week—andinterviewed with newspapers and radio stations coast to coast.54[index_split_259.html#filepos1484103] Stringfield soon met with UFO contacteesand became suspicious. Some of them, he believed, were “official plants”.55[index_split_259.html#filepos1484248] Stringfield may have been on to something.Covert ops never ceased in the national security state. Later that spring, forexample, Hoover’s FBI gained authority to engage in unrestricted microphonesurveillance, including any illegal trespasses along the way. This neatlycircumvented a Supreme Court decision that bugging was unconstitutional. DavidWise called the order “virtual carte blanche to break and enter, installing bugsand wiretaps.” All this had long been going on; now it was just easier. Theorder remained fully in effect until 1965, when FBI bugs became subject to theAttorney General’s approval. Even then, however, Hoover still did as hepleased.56 [index_split_259.html#filepos1484393]"},{"pageContent":"UFO SIGHTINGS OF EARLY 1954 The outbreak of UFO news occurred, in part, because UFOs themselves appeared insignificant numbers once again. Not all of the reports were verified. Wilkins isthe source of several Australian sightings from early 1954, including two fromAlice Springs. The area is near America’s NSA facility at Pine Gap, one of thelargest and most secretive information-gathering stations in the world.America’s involvement in the area began in the mid-1960s, and the area has beenheavy with UFO rumors for years.57 [index_split_259.html#filepos1484550] The CIAcontinued to monitor flying saucer reports worldwide, especially in France,where UFO sightings were recorded on January 4, January 7, and January 9. Oneinvolved a sighting over an airfield, another described extreme maneuverability,and another was seen by multiple witnesses in several locations. On theeighteenth, the CIA noted a UFO sighting over three towns in Algeria. CIA filesalso noted a March 1 sighting of a UFO over a beach at Montevideo by multiplewitnesses; the object appeared to be a metallic disc emitting yellowishreflections and was stationary for two minutes at a high altitude.Four days later, a much-discussed and certainly authentic photograph of adisc-shaped UFO was taken over Rouen, France, by a French fighter pilot. Closeanalysis showed it to be nearly identical to the object photographed by theTrents in McMinnville, Oregon, back in 1950. Unfortunately, no CIA records havesurfaced regarding this photograph, even though the agency was clearly followingFrench UFO sightings at this time. Incidentally, two Blue Book unknowns occurredin French Morocco during March. At 8 P.M. on March 5, the same day as the Rouenphotograph, crews of USAF KC-97 aerial tanker planes over Nouasseur, FrenchMorocco, saw an object or light make several passes at their aircraft. Anotherunidentified object flew nearby. On March 12, again at Nouasseur, an air forcelieutenant flying an F-86 chased an object at more than 530 mph for thirtyseconds, but was unable to catch it. The object appeared to be the size of afighter plane but had neither tanks nor trails. The CIA recorded more UFOsightings in France through April.58 [index_split_259.html#filepos1484701]The United States had a few interesting reports. At 11 P.M. on February 4, 1954,a UFO sighting occurred over Carswell AFB in Texas. About fifteen miles from thebase, ground control radar detected the object. The “mystery aircraft” thenpassed over the Carswell tower at a little over three thousand feet, wherepersonnel saw it through binoculars. The object was like nothing they had everseen: long fuselage, elliptical wings, some kind of stabilizer, and no visiblemeans of propulsion. The object had a bright light on its nose and tail, twoyellowish lights on the bottom of the fuselage, with possible lights on eachwing tip. No one heard a sound. The report was sent directly to the Joint Chiefsof Staff, the CIA, the NSA, and other leading intelligence groups. This showedagain how little even the official new system of UFO reporting meant withsightings that mattered.59 [index_split_259.html#filepos1484943]The South and West were the main areas of American UFO activity in early 1954.On March 8, a pilot at Laredo AFB in Texas reported a glowing red round objectmoving at tremendous speed, then vanishing. On March 24, a Marine Corps jetpilot in Florida saw a round object streak downward, stop, then speed away afterhe pursued it. Then, on March 29, a CIRVIS report described an “unidentifiedobject glowing bright green” seen in Wyoming by a United Airlines pilot, andconfirmed by another airliner. Recipients of the report included the CIA andDIRNSA.60 [index_split_259.html#filepos1485275]Leaks, rumors, and odd news items continued to appear. In April, Wilkins heardof an alleged visit by Dwight Eisenhower to Edwards AFB in California, where Ikesaw alien bodies and debris. This was said to have occurred from February 17 to20, 1954. The public explanation was that Eisenhower saw a dentist namedPurcell. The story lay dormant for decades, until William Moore (of MJ-12 fame)interviewed the dentist’s widow. While vague about Eisenhower’s dentaltreatment, she provided explicit detail about a presidential reception theyattended during that time. Moore found no evidence at the Eisenhower Librarythat Eisenhower was treated by a dentist at that time. He also found nothank-you messages, although Eisenhower tended to be scrupulous in such matters.On the other hand, Eisenhower’s secretary did mention the event in a diary.61[index_split_259.html#filepos1485462]Few UFO stories received any media attention, although several interesting casestook place. Late on April 14, a United Airlines plane over Long Beach,California, narrowly missed a collision with an unknown object that came “out ofnowhere” at five thousand feet. The captain turned the wheel hard and broughtthe plane up so fast passengers were thrown to the floor, and a stewardess andone passenger sustained broken legs and ankles. On April 22 at San NicholasIsland in California, American servicemen saw a gray cigar-shaped objectdescend. Smoke rose where it landed, but a search yielded no results. On thetwenty-third, two Pan Am airliners, about two hundred miles apart, each sighteda UFO between Puerto Rico and New York. The object pulsated an orange-greenishlight and streaked past both planes. On the twenty-ninth, three members of theSecond Army Radio Station at Fort Meade, Maryland, saw an unidentified round,brilliant, blinking object, three or four times the size of a large star, movingacross the sky in a straight path. As it arrived above Fort Meade, itdisappeared by shooting straight up. Eastern Air Defense Command and armyintelligence were notified of this sighting.62[index_split_259.html#filepos1485606]At midnight on May 1 came a terrific explosion from Logan City, Utah. Severalpeople saw a brilliant object, like a glowing ball, plunge rapidly in the skyjust before the explosion. A man driving on the highway was terrified to see a“dazzling red half-globe come out of the ground, ahead of his auto, and to theleft.” Less than ten seconds later, according to the man, a violent blast shookhis vehicle and apparently threw open doors over 250 square miles. Othereyewitnesses also claimed to see a flash at ground level. Researchers the nextmorning found a crater sixteen feet wide and six feet deep. La Paz was on thescene, heading the investigation and assisted by Utah state geologists. On theassumption that the object was a meteor, his crew drilled to a depth oftwenty-five feet, but found no meteoric debris. The crater also seemed too smallfor the shock wave recorded. A Geiger counter reading showed no unusualradiation, and an artesian well appeared in the crater.La Paz was mystified. “If it’s a meteorite,” he told reporters, “it must havebeen a whopper.” Excavation at the site continued for five days. La Paz thenissued the following statement:> In the region from Clarkston to Paradise, numerous persons saw or heard the> explosive phenomenon at midnight on May 1. The testimony thus obtained, and> material evidence recovered as a result of subsurface investigation, has> disclosed that the crater was not produced by a conventional meteorite fall.> For these reasons, operations have been discontinued. La Paz did not say what could have caused the explosion, and was silent on whathe found. Keyhoe checked his Washington sources, but came up empty.63[index_split_259.html#filepos1485822]"},{"pageContent":"WASHINGTON SIGHTINGS, REVISITED Shortly after midnight on May 6, Washington, D.C. radar once again tracked UFOs,causing an Air Defense alert. Each time Air Defense fighters approached, theUFOs vanished. Then, on May 13—a week later—two major UFO sightings occurred inthe city. The first involved multiple radar and visual tracking of an objectthat appeared to be 250 feet in diameter and fifteen miles above the city, oreighty thousand feet. In another year, the U-2 aircraft would be operational andcapable of such altitudes. In 1954, however, no aircraft could reach thatheight. Moreover, the object moved in a way impossible for any aircraft, frompoint to point in a rectangular pattern at about 200 mph. After three hours ofbeing tracked by several governmental radar installations, the objectdisappeared. At the same time, two police officers at the Washington NationalAirport saw two large, glowing, oval objects approach the airport and maneuverover that part of the city. Military Air Transport confirmed its presence, andthe object was seen for over an hour. An air force spokesman in the Pentagoneven told reporters it was an “Unidentified Flying Object.”Frank Edwards carried both UFO stories that evening on Mutual Network Radio.Only the second of the reports made it to the press—a single edition of theWashington Post. In Edwards’s words: “The lid was on.” Not surprising, judgingby what had happened in Washington, D.C., less than two years earlier.64[index_split_259.html#filepos1485995]Gen. Nathan Twining, by now the air force’s Chief of Staff, made the news afterspeaking at an Armed Forces Day dinner at Amarillo AFB on May 14, 1954. Twiningsaid “the air force has the best brains in the country working on the flyingsaucer problem.” Twining gave while he took away. He claimed 90 percent ofreports were “pure imagination,” but 10 percent could not be explained. (By now,it was commonplace for officials to concede a 10 percent unexplained rate,although the number had been running at 20 percent for years.) The author of thethen-still-secret 1947 memo claimed “no facts” had shown that there was anythingto substantiate flying saucers, although “some very reliable persons havereported flying objects that can’t be identified.” Keyhoe reached Twining’spress officer about this but was told Twining was “talking off the cuff.”65[index_split_259.html#filepos1486170]In an event that was presumably not pure imagination, four veteran NationalGuard pilots engaged in “high-altitude tag” over Dallas with sixteen UFOs beforebeing outmaneuvered and outdistanced. This was reported in the May 25 DallasHerald, but nowhere else. Another nonimagined event occurred on May 24 andincluded a photograph of a UFO from an RB-29 aircraft that left Wright Field.The photo was overexposed. On May 31, an AP story described a glowing disc seenby a pilot, an air traffic controller, police, and residents from Spokane toPortland. The next day, a TWA pilot saw a large, bright disc-like object as hisplane approached Boston; eight airport personnel also saw it.66[index_split_259.html#filepos1486327]"},{"pageContent":"A RUCKUS AT WRIGHT-PAT On June 2, the air force reported eighty-seven UFO sightings for the first fourmonths of the year, a rather low total. Shortly afterward, however, Col. JohnO‘Mara, deputy commander of intelligence at ATIC, told Stringfield something alittle different: that the air force was receiving an average of seven hundredsighting reports per week! Soon, Frank Edwards announced the news to the wholecountry. Stringfield was becoming quite a nuisance. Then, on June 9, Col. FrankMilani, Director of Civil Defense in Baltimore, publicly attacked air force UFOsecrecy. The air force denied any UFO secrecy or censorship and restated its1954 UFO statistics. Back in Dayton, however, O’Mara said over one thousandscientists were working on the UFO problem. The air force PIO denied O’Mara saidthis. Finally, Blue Book chief Capt. Charles Hardin told the press:> Colonel O’Mara’s words were misinterpreted. What he meant to say was that if> all the sightings were reported to the air force, they would total about seven> hundred per week.67 [index_split_259.html#filepos1486525] A rather weak correction, and not enough to stop UFO news. On June 12, BaltimoreGOC members spotted a UFO shortly before midnight. Soon after, Ground ObserverCorps (GOC) radar in Delaware tracked a very large object that stopped andhovered near the Capitol. Jets located it, but could not climb high enough. Twodays later, a large UFO returned to the Washington-Baltimore area. Again, AirDefense Command scrambled jets, and again the jets could not reach the object.68[index_split_259.html#filepos1486706]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMER 1954—ONCE AGAIN, MATTERS GET OUT OF CONTROL To make sense of the past, historians must do more than record events. The sheerquantity of data forces us to select carefully and to shape an interpretationthat makes the most sense. The process is never neat, it always involves errorsin judgment that can only be seen at a distance, and it must always undergorevision. The summer of 1954 illustrates these problems. A typical history ofUFOs focuses on the events of 1947, early air force interest, the periods ofSign and Grudge, the Great Wave of 1952, and the Robertson Panel. Then, it wouldseem, not much happened until the 1960s. Certainly this is a reasonableconclusion from reviewing the Blue Book files—the typical approach. From overtwo hundred Blue Book unknowns in 1952, there were only thirty-two in 1953,forty-six in 1954, and a mere twenty in 1955.There was a drop in UFO activity during these years and, to an extent, the restof the 1950s. Yet, the drop-off was less significant than official dataindicate. As we have seen, Blue Book became a marginal operation after 1953. Allthese years later, we still do not know the true number of UFO reports that weremade by U.S. government agencies during the 1950s, nor any other era. Sometimesa researcher’s doggedness pays off, and a new report surfaces. How many eludeus? All we can say with confidence is that many UFO reports were not part of anofficial, public system, and undoubtedly there are many we will never see.As we have seen many times by now, Blue Book did not receive many of the bestUFO reports. Despite so-called CIA disbelief in UFOs, the agency monitored themworldwide. A June 18, 1954, report from French Equatorial Africa described aluminous globe suddenly stop, rise, drop, stop, gyrate, and shake. Some noisepreviously heard stopped. The center appeared dark, but rays of light emanatedout. After fifteen minutes of observation, the object shot away.69[index_split_259.html#filepos1486847]That the CIA’s reports escaped Blue Book is understandable, due to the agency’sworldwide scope. But many cases within the United States continued to remainoutside of Blue Book. Consider a dramatic UFO chase that took place on June 23,1954, was obtained by Keyhoe, and confirmed by an air traffic controller beforethe military forced him into silence. Just after 8 P.M., Lt. Harry L. Roe, Jr.,was flying an F-51 Mustang fighter from Columbus to Dayton, Ohio. He saw a“brilliant white light” race down and pace him. Roe swerved left, then right,then slowed down suddenly. Each time, the light stayed with him. As heapproached Dayton, he radioed the CAA tower at Vandalia Airport and asked thetraffic controller, George Barnes, if he could see it. The light was too brightfor either man to see the actual object, but both saw it pace Roe’s aircraftprecisely, no matter what maneuver Roe attempted. Finally, the UFO passed theF-51 and vanished toward the southeast.Barnes’s report quickly reached Intelligence at Wright-Patterson, and Roe wastold not to discuss his encounter. However, enough people already knew thestory, and it leaked to AP. Barnes confirmed the report when he assumed the airforce had released it, and Roe admitted it as well, adding that he had beensilenced by the air force.70 [index_split_259.html#filepos1487003]Just as this story was making news, another startling event occurred over anAtomic Energy Commission plant in eastern Idaho. After midnight on June 26,witnesses saw “a blinding glow, like an enormous floodlight,” overhead. Thesource remained motionless for a few seconds, illuminating the ground forseveral miles around. Then, rising at a tremendous speed, the light vanished.This story received coverage in the local newspaper and eventually reached AP.Later the same day, Air Defense radar picked up a UFO over Ohio. A commercialaircraft, including the plane’s sixty passengers, saw the object near Columbus.The story made the papers about a week later. But like the Roe story, it wasabsent from the Blue Book files.71 [index_split_259.html#filepos1487148]On the twenty-ninth occurred a sighting that did make it to Blue Book and alsoreceived a good deal of media attention. It involved a BOAC (now BritishAirways) commercial airliner flying from New York to London. Former RAF pilotJames Howard was in command, Lee Boyd was the first officer, Capt. H. McDonnellthe navigator. The plane was crossing Goose Bay, Labrador, in the early eveningwhen Howard saw a large cigar shape and six smaller black ovals about five milesaway. The six smaller objects followed the “mother ship” upward into a thinlayer of cloud. Howard’s crew saw the same thing and found no reasonable answer.The objects appeared to be following and tracking the airliner, and the crewinformed Goose Bay of their “escort.” As they sent their message, the six miniUFOs entered the larger craft, and the object shot away. Goose Bay had theobject on radar and sent a jet. When the BOAC landed at Labrador to refuel,Canadian and American intelligence officers hustled Howard and Boyd off for adebriefing, causing the takeoff to be delayed. McDonnell said that USAFpersonnel took the flight logs without authorization. After reaching London,Howard and Boyd were called into the Air Ministry, which then explained to thepress that the crew and passengers had seen a solar eclipse. An eclipse didoccur, but not until 7 A.M. the next morning, about twelve hours after thesighting. Some months later, McDonnell met up with Howard and asked what hadhappened at the Air Ministry. Howard’s response: “Sorry, I can’t say. You knowthe score.”Years later, Condon investigator Gordon Thayer maintained the sighting was amirage. He admitted there were problems with his explanation and added this“natural phenomenon” was “so rare that it apparently has never been reportedbefore or since.” He made this statement without irony. James McDonaldcountered: “No meteorological-optical phenomenon ... could reasonably accountfor the reported phenomenon.” Thayer’s review of the case was a perfect exampleof the sterile analysis that occurs when “official culture” collides with theworld of the UFO. No attempt was made to confront the social context of theproblem, in this case, the pressure placed on the British pilots. The essence ofthe living fact, as Tolstoy once wrote, was left aside, and the argument wasconstructed in such a way as to “shut out the possibility of that essence beingdiscovered.”72 [index_split_259.html#filepos1487293]The BOAC case made clear that the American military could silence not only itsown military and commercial pilots but also British commercial pilots. Even now,however, reports continued to leak out. On June 30, a UFO was observed visuallyand tracked on radar at Brookley AFB in Mobile, Alabama. The next day, a tragedyoccurred near Utica, New York. Griffis AFB radar had tracked a UFO; soon an F-94was in pursuit and, sure enough, the pilot saw a disc-shaped object. As heclosed, a furnace-like heat filled his cockpit, forcing him and his radar man toeject. The plane crashed into the town of Walesville, killing four people andinjuring five others. The pilot told reporters about the strange heat, butquickly recanted this position under air force pressure. The story was now thatengine trouble caused the disaster.73 [index_split_259.html#filepos1487590]Two sightings of green UFOs took place on July 3. Near Albuquerque, nine greenspheres were seen visually and tracked on radar. On the same day, the captain,officers, and 463 passengers on a Dutch ocean liner saw a single“greenish-colored, saucer-shaped object about half the size of a full moon” asit sped across the sky and disappeared into high clouds. On July 8, a Britishastronomer in Lancashire saw a silvery object with fifteen to twenty smallersatellite objects. More UFO news came from the Washington-Baltimore-Wilmingtonarea. On July 9, the Wilmington Morning News ran the headline, “100 FlyingObjects Spotted Here.” The article reported over one hundred UFO sightings byGOC personnel, including forty during the first five months of 1954. Allreports, it stated, were studied by the air force.74[index_split_259.html#filepos1487796]Early in August, Ruppelt wrote a scathing attack on Blue Book’s current methodsof analysis in a letter to Keyhoe. He described an officer in the Air ForceDirectorate of Intelligence as “taking the old ostrich approach to keeping hishead in the sand, thinking they [UFOs] will go away. He is wrong.” The air forceclaimed they had gotten unknowns down to 10 percent, wrote Ruppelt> but from what I saw this is just due to a more skeptical attitude. The reports> are just as good as the ones we got, and their analysis procedures are a hell> of a lot worse.75 [index_split_259.html#filepos1487972] One wonders what the attitude must have been of the CIA personnel who handledthe agency’s UFO reports. On July 25, the CIA reported a twenty-minute sightingof six UFOs, almost immobile, in southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) by a policemanand others. On August 4 came another CIA report from The Hague, Netherlands. Inthis instance, ten firemen and their chief saw two UFOs between 11 P.M. andmidnight. It was a clear night, and the object was at a high altitude. Itdisplayed “incredible speed, [and] at times remained motionless for as long asthirty seconds.” It appeared as a light-colored, flat oval, and in the opinionof the observers could not have been aircraft or balloons.76[index_split_259.html#filepos1488112]Another UFO incident came from the Netherlands a few days later. Dutchnewspapers reported that on August 7, Capt. Jan P. Bos of the SS Groote Beer sawa strange, flat, “moonlike” object rise out of the ocean, eighty or ninety mileseast of Cape Cod. Through binoculars, he saw clearly illuminated ports on therim. The object then moved at a “fantastic” speed. On August 6, people in SantaFe, New Mexico, saw another fireball for fifteen minutes, a brilliant white ballin the sky that left a luminous trail. It apparently shot up and away. LincolnLa Paz said it was not a meteorite.77 [index_split_259.html#filepos1488278]Frank Edwards had announced UFO reports all year on his nationwide radioprogram. On August 11, 1954, his primary sponsor, the American Federation ofLabor, fired him. According to AFL President George Meany, he failed todifferentiate between news and his opinion. According to Edwards, Meany said,“because he talked too much about flying saucers.” Edwards said he had broadcastonly seventeen “brief” UFO reports in all of 1954. Soon after, the Pentagonoffered Edwards a job at $18,500, on the condition he be sworn to secrecy overthe things he encountered. Edwards declined. His departure from nationalbroadcasting was a serious blow to the cause of antisecrecy.78[index_split_259.html#filepos1488440]"},{"pageContent":"AFR 200-2 DECLASSIFIED On July 23, probably under air force pressure, the navy issued a new UFOdirective which ordered immediate reporting of UFOs, using the code word“Flyobrpt.” Reports were to be phoned or teletyped to the followingdestinations: Director of Air Force Intelligence, ATIC, Commanding Officer ofAir Defense Command, Commanding Officer of Eastern Air Defense Command, Directorof Naval Intelligence, Commanding Officer of the Eastern Sea Frontier, and theCommandant of the Potomac River Naval Command. The directive cited JANAP 146,AFR 200-2, and two previous navy orders, OPNAV 3820 and Directive 3820.2 by theCommander of the Eastern Sea Frontier. It was intended to plug the leaks thatwere coming from navy and marine personnel. Although the directive wasunpublicized, it was also unclassified. It thus threatened disclosure of AFR200-2, which was still classified. As a result, the air force began work on anew version of AFR 200-2, one without the “restricted” label.79[index_split_259.html#filepos1488621]Then, on the heels of the Edwards firing, Air Force Chief of Staff NathanTwining declassified AFR 200-2 on August 12. Pentagon rumors had the navyforcing Twining’s hand. The public, to the extent that it cared, could now learnthat Air Defense Command—not Blue Book—was responsible for UFO fieldinvestigations, and that Blue Book did not even get all the reports. Moreover,the air force admitted to legitimate interest in UFOs, which were “any airborneobject which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features,does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or whichcannot be positively identified as a familiar object.” The document stated that> interest in unidentified flying objects is twofold: first as a possible threat> to the security of the United States and its forces, and second, to determine> the technical aspects involved. Just what were the “technical aspects involved”? The public would never know, asthe air force would release information only about objects that were “positivelyidentified as a familiar object.” Anything truly unconventional would not bediscussed with the public.80 [index_split_259.html#filepos1488814]The day AFR 200-2 was declassified, an incredible CIRVIS report describing a UFOwas sent to the DIRNSA. It was headed “Emergency,” from the flight servicecenter at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, to the Commander of Air Defense Command at EntAFB, Colorado Springs. The report described the entry into airspace of a“strange stationary object variable in brilliance” which moved rapidly, thenreturned to its original position. The base sent a helicopter to investigate;“definitely not a star,” said the pilot. The object began receiving a great dealof attention. A number of people watched it from the tower, and Columbus CAAradioed in that they had it in sight. The object soon became dimmer, showed aslight red glow, and disappeared. According to the report:> pilot of helicopter wished to stress fact that object was of a saucer-like> nature, was stationary at 2000 ft. And would be glad to be called upon to> verify any statements and act as witness.81> [index_split_259.html#filepos1489212] Although sightings trailed off by the end of summer, on August 28, a formationof fifteen UFOs approached Oklahoma City, tracked on radar. Jets were sent tointercept them, and the objects quickly vanished out of sight. Hundreds of cityresidents watched the chase. Tinker Field officers nevertheless refused to admitthe sighting.82 [index_split_259.html#filepos1489369]"},{"pageContent":"THE HUMANOID SIGHTINGS What follows constitutes one of the most bizarre and baffling UFO events ever.Between September and December 1954, a heavy concentration of UFO reports—attimes dozens per day—came from France, Italy, Britain, Germany, North Africa,the Middle East, and South America. People were seeing more than objects in thesky: they claimed to see landings of UFOs and short humanoid beings. In France,the first area of intense activity, UFO researchers Raymond Veillith and AiméMichel did the brunt of rounding up newspaper accounts and interviewingwitnesses. Without their work, this wave might well have been forgotten by thepublic. It is noteworthy that the Lorenzens had collected a few humanoidsighting reports from South America during 1953 and early 1954, which closelymatch the events of this autumn.83 [index_split_259.html#filepos1489528]Press coverage was mostly local, and many witnesses did not know that a UFO wavewas taking place. Most of them described beings between three and four feettall, some of which were human-looking, others “almost” human-looking, otherswore “diving suits,” others were hairy, gray, or even shorter than two feet.None of the sightings included descriptions of what are now called “Grays,” thesmall, thin creatures with big, dark eyes, made famous from the cover of WhitleyStrieber’s Communion. (The first definite description of such entities did notoccur until the Hill abduction of 1961, although a few possible descriptionsoccurred during the mid-1950s.)The response to all this was uneven. Several governments followed eventscarefully and even created special sections for gathering and studying UFOreports. Some American UFO organizations, such as CSI and APRO, were alsoimpressed. Others, such as NICAP (formed in 1956) dismissed the reports as tooclosely resembling “crackpot” cases. Scientists ridiculed the events. “Suchfantastic stories,” one French scientist said, “could only come from derangedminds,” to which Michel responded, “what would these people have said if I hadpublished all the data!”84 [index_split_259.html#filepos1489716] The CIA,despite collecting many European UFO reports from this period, has offered nonepertaining to humanoid beings.France had been the scene of steady UFO activity throughout 1954.Multiple-witness sightings occurred in France and Tunisia in late August andearly September. CIA files recorded a UFO encounter from the French town ofAisne, near the Belgian border on September 7. At 3 A.M., a husband, wife, andher father were driving when they saw a luminous red-orange disc stop across theroad about one thousand feet up. The object rose and took off at high speed.85[index_split_259.html#filepos1489872]The first sighting of a UFO occupant in France occurred three days later, notfar from the previous sighting. On September 10, near the Belgian border inValenciennes, Marius Dewilde, a thirty-four-year-old metal worker, was readingat home at 10:30 P.M. His wife and children were in bed. His dog barked, andDewilde took a flashlight outside in time to see his dog whining and crawling onits belly. He heard hurried footsteps to his right. His dog barked again.Shining his flashlight, he saw two creatures just beyond his fence, walking insingle file toward a dark mass at the railway tracks. The creatures were aboutthree and one-half feet tall with very wide shoulders, short legs, and helmetscovering what seemed to be enormous heads. Dewilde could not make out any arms.Recovering from his initial shock, he ran to cut them off and got to within sixfeet of them. At that point, a powerful orange light came from a square openingin the dark mass, blinding him. Dewilde felt paralyzed; his legs would not move.He saw the creatures continue toward the tracks, the dark object rise and hover,and a door close. The object rose to about one hundred feet, turned east, anddisappeared.After recovering use of his legs, Dewilde woke his wife and a neighbor, and toldthe police, who thought he was crazy. Dewilde would not be put off. He spoke tothe police commissioner, who was impressed by his determination and sentinvestigators to the area, which included local police and the French air policefrom Paris. They found five places on three wooden railroad ties with identicalimpressions, each about one and one-half inches square. The marks were fresh anddeep. Engineers later calculated the weight needed to produce these cuts to havebeen about thirty tons. The Dewilde case received some international pressnotice. Naturally, the local police had no explanation and were shut out of theair police investigation.86 [index_split_259.html#filepos1490071]Throughout France, UFO activity was heavy. A few days after the Dewilde case, onSeptember 14, a daytime UFO sighting occurred before “hundreds of witnesses,”about 250 miles southwest of Paris. Another sighting on the nineteenth involveda flat, gray, circular object which slowed, stopped, hovered motionless forthirty seconds, swayed, and took off.87 [index_split_259.html#filepos1490278]Then, on the afternoon of September 26, in the town of Valence, a woman alsoclaimed to see a humanoid being while she was gathering mushrooms in the woods.Her dog barked, and she saw a short being wearing a translucent helmet and suit;she saw large eyes looking at her through the helmet. The being approached her,moving awkwardly; she screamed and ran. When she turned around, she saw a largecircular and flattened metallic object rise from behind the trees and departrapidly, gaining altitude all the time. Other people, including her husband,were nearby, and they soon arrived to see a circular area about ten feet indiameter. Inside the circle, shrubs and bushes were crushed; tree branches werebroken as if from above. Some of the people claimed to hear a whistling soundwhen the craft departed, and the police were struck by her state of nervousshock.88 [index_split_259.html#filepos1490435]Yet another humanoid encounter took place two nights later in the town ofBouzais. A man had noticed that someone had stolen grapes from his vineyard anddecided to stay up late and catch the thief. At about 10:30 P.M., he saw aluminous object descend and three figures emerge. He was then paralyzed and lostconsciousness. There was no sign of anything when he regained consciousness. Onthe thirtieth, eight construction workers near Marcilly-sur-Vienne saw adisc-shaped object on the ground, and a small helmeted being standing nearby.89[index_split_259.html#filepos1490595]"},{"pageContent":"THE “INVASION” OF FRANCE: OCTOBER 1954 By the end of September, about 250 people throughout France had recently claimedto have seen flying saucers and humanoids.90[index_split_259.html#filepos1490791] October was just as surreal, and evenbusier.

But strange activity was going oneverywhere. A hovering disc was photographed in Nelson, New Zealand, onSeptember 9. The CIA noted a seven-second, multiple-witness sighting in Helsinkion September 14 of an intensely bright circular object that left a trail ofreddish smoke. On the fifteenth, in Bihar, India, a disc-shaped UFO set off apanic, as it descended to five hundred feet and hovered over an American AECmine. Eight hundred people fled to their homes. After apparent close-rangeobservation, the craft swiftly ascended vertically. On September 17, thousandsof people in Rome, Italy, watched a disc-like object that was tracked by Italianair force radar. On the eighteenth, green fireballs made another appearance inthe American Southwest (Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas), and were againinvestigated by Lincoln La Paz. The next day, in the French West Africa town ofDanane, officials saw an oval UFO with a dome and searchlights. Apparently therewas activity of UFOs in Eastern Europe. On October 1, Romanian newspapers blamedthe U.S. for launching a drive to induce a “flying saucer psychosis” in theircountry. In Yugoslavia, an especially dense wave of UFO sightings occurredbetween October 15 and 25. In the words of two investigators, flying saucerswere seen “all over that country.” Thousands of witnesses near Belgrade,Sarajevo, and Lubljana described low-flying discs as well as large cigar-shapedobjects at high altitudes. All this activity hardly reached the press in theland of Tito; the little that did was ridiculed.104[index_split_259.html#filepos1493039]Worldwide, UFO sightings occurred briskly through October.

Later that day in Morocco, a French engineer saw a small being insilver clothing enter an object which quickly took off.106[index_split_259.html#filepos1493417]Another Iranian sighting occurred on the fourteenth, in Shamsabad. A man leavinghis house in the early morning saw a bright object almost twenty feet long. A“short young man” was standing nearby on a circular piece of metal, laughing atthe man’s frightened expression. Evidently the craft departed at incrediblespeed. A UFO was seen in Kenya on October 14, by a lieutenant colonel of theBritish army and his wife. The two saw a light green object moving at tremendousspeed. A humanoid sighting took place in Tripoli, Libya, on October 23. Ataround 3 A.M., a farmer saw a flying object descend to ground level about 150feet away, making a sound like that of a compressor. It appeared to be an ovalmachine with six wheels and complex machinery. The top half was transparent andfilled with bright white light. Six human-looking men were aboard wearingprotective masks and yellowish coveralls. The witness touched part of the craftand felt a strong electric shock. One of the occupants motioned for him to stayaway. For the next twenty minutes, the witness was able to watch the six men,apparently busy with instruments. According to Vallee,107[index_split_259.html#filepos1493615] reliable investigations were made of thisencounter. The following day, another humanoid sighting occurred in Algeria, inthe town of Ain-el-Turck.108 [index_split_259.html#filepos1493762]In Europe, some high-quality UFO sightings occurred not only in France, butBritain, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Holland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia,and elsewhere. Several governments took action on the UFO problem. On October 1,the Swedish Defense Ministry ordered a new secret inquiry into UFOs. The nextday, the French Air Ministry ordered an official investigation. On the seventh,the Italian Air Ministry ordered day and night vigilance at detection posts by“saucer spotters.” On October 10, the Royal Belgian observatory at Liege openeda file on UFOs and asked for public reports of sightings.109[index_split_259.html#filepos1493905]The concern was for good reason. It seemed like the United States from thesummer of 1952, with a twist. The traditional sightings by military pilotscontinued, such as an October 4 incident in which a “saturn-shaped” UFO buzzedan RAF Meteor jet. But increasingly, people with no apparent reason to lie wereclaiming to have seen, for lack of a better word, aliens. A man named WilliHoge, from Munster, Germany, had one such experience on the evening of October9. Returning from work, he saw a blue light and thought an airplane had made anemergency landing. As he approached, he saw four small beings with short legs,very large chests, and oversized heads. They wore some sort of coveralls andwere working on a cigar-shaped craft about 250 feet off the road. Anotherlanding and humanoid report came from Castelibranco, Portugal, on October 13. Inthis case, the beings were seen picking flowers, twigs, and shrubs, “as ifgathering data.”110 [index_split_259.html#filepos1494056]Another startling encounter with a UFO by an RAF pilot came on October 14, 1954.A pilot flying a Meteor jet over Southend at sixteen thousand feet saw twocircular objects streak between two other Meteor planes high above him. Turningto look through his windscreen, he saw a similar object coming towards him. Inhis words, “it was silvery in color, had a bun-shaped top, a flange like twosaucers in the middle and a bun underneath, and could not have been far offbecause it overlapped my windscreen!” The object passed around him at“tremendous speed.”111 [index_split_259.html#filepos1494270]The next day, an English woman in Southend named Pat Hennessey claimed to see aUFO landing. With much common sense, she ran away. When she turned around tolook again, it had vanished without a sound. On October 21, a woman from Ranton,Great Britain, and her two children saw a disc-shaped metallic object hoveringabove their house. Like the case from Teheran, they also claimed to seeoccupants through “transparent” panels—in this case, two men with white skin,hair to their shoulders, very high foreheads, transparent helmets, andturquoise-blue clothing that resembled ski suits. The craft hovered at a tiltedangle while the two beings looked at the scene “sternly, not in an unkindfashion, but almost sadly, compassionately.”112[index_split_259.html#filepos1494456]"},{"pageContent":"NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1954: WORLD SIGHTINGS CONTINUE By mid-October, the main area of humanoid sightings shifted from France toItaly; by November it was in South America. Many of the Italian cases involvedthe theft of plants or small farm animals, reports of witness paralysis, andalleged guttural or unintelligible sounds coming from the short aliens. Severalof them also received investigations by law enforcement officials.One case from the night of October 20, near the town of Como, involvedthirty-seven-year-old Renzo Pugina. He had just parked his car when he saw,standing near a tree, a four-foot being wearing a “scaly” luminous suit. Thebeing paralyzed Pugina with a beam from an instrument. It didn’t work fully:Pugina made a motion when clenching his fist that seemed to free him. He thenrushed at the being, who fled to a craft and took off. An oily spot was found atthe site. Pugina, known locally as a trustworthy person, arrived home in shockand went to bed with a high fever. Italian police investigated the sighting. Thenext night, in Melito, Italy, a man walking in a field heard a rustling noiseand saw a strange craft land. As he got closer, he saw a being wearing a divingsuit coming out of the craft, which emitted rays of light that flooded thecountryside (claims of intensely bright light have appeared in many militaryreports of UFOs, including those from the United States). The witness wasparalyzed. A dog barking in the distance may have prompted the being to re-enterthe craft and depart.113 [index_split_259.html#filepos1494637]A multiple-witness sighting of a landed craft and humanoid occupants occurred inMilan on October 28. The story has several dubious elements, but on the samenight, U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Clare Booth Luce, saw a UFO over Rome.Meanwhile, across the Adriatic Sea, the Yugoslav government ordered its ownsecret inquiry into UFOs on October 27.114 [index_split_259.html#filepos1494790]Another typically strange Italian case occurred on November 14 in the northerntown of Isola. A farmer saw a cigar-shaped craft land nearby and hid to watchit. Three very short creatures emerged, dressed in metallic diving suits. Theybecame interested in his caged rabbits, a step that caused the man to reach forhis rifle. When he tried to shoot, however, the rifle not only failed to workbut became so heavy that he dropped it. The beings took his rabbits, enteredtheir craft and departed silently, leaving a bright trail. Interviewersconsidered the man to be reliable.115 [index_split_259.html#filepos1494975]Across the Atlantic Ocean, reports coming from South America were equallystrange. To be sure, there was no shortage of traditional UFO reports. OnOctober 24, for five hours in the afternoon, Brazilian air force officers andmen, as well as airline personnel and civilians, saw a formation of apparentlymechanical devices moving at tremendous speeds over Porto Alegre AFB. Accordingto a local press release, the phenomenon was reported immediately to the airministry in Rio De Janeiro with a request for investigation. The base commandstated that “it was impossible to calculate the altitude or velocity at whichthe objects moved, but the speed was greater than any of which the base hasknowledge. Their general shape was circular, silver-colored, and shimmering.” Astartling incident involving a Brazilian airliner occurred on November 21. Theplane was bound for Rio de Janeiro flying at eight thousand feet when itencountered a formation of nineteen glowing UFOs, each more than one hundredfeet in diameter. Thirteen passengers stampeded the plane, including onescreaming woman who ran into the pilot’s compartment. The objects flew by at atremendous speed, and the story made the Brazilian press. The next evening, inSanta Maria, Brazil, a radio operator at a local air base saw a dark objectabout one hundred feet in diameter hovering at treetop height. Accompanied byfour other people, he watched it for several hours. It glowed at times andoccasionally came close to the ground.116 [index_split_259.html#filepos1495170]However, people in Brazil also claimed to be seeing aliens. In Pontal on thenight of November 4, a man fishing in the Pardo River saw a wobbling craftdescend and land. It looked like two washbowls placed together and was perhapstwenty feet in diameter. Too terrified to move, he saw three small men, dressedin white and wearing tight-fitting skull caps, exit the craft. They gatheredvegetables and water, then flew away. In Curitiba, at 3:30 A.M. on November 13,a witness saw a disc-shaped object on the railroad tracks, and three dwarfsnearby wearing tight-fitting suits. The object took off when the manapproached.117 [index_split_259.html#filepos1495335]By late November, strange sightings had come to Venezuela. An incredible talecame from Caracas on November 28. At 2 A.M., two truck drivers claimed to see aluminous spherical object hovering six feet off the ground, blocking their way.They stopped the truck and one of them investigated. He saw a hairy,three-foot-tall being with claws and glowing eyes, who knocked him about fifteenfeet. The man drew a knife and struck the creature, but it glanced off as thoughhe had hit steel. Another creature shone a light which blinded the man, and hisassailant entered the craft while two other beings, carrying various samples,also got in. The craft then swiftly took off. The man was hospitalized for adeep scratch on his side, and both men received sedatives. Authorities whoinvestigated considered them reliable.118 [index_split_259.html#filepos1495482]Three bizarre events were reported in Venezuela on December 10, all of whichinvolved close-up sightings of landed or low-hovering UFOs, encounters withsmall beings (most of them covered with hair), two of which involved physicalencounters and attempted kidnappings which left bruises on the witnesses.119[index_split_259.html#filepos1495661] On December 16, three young men driving inthe suburbs of San Carlos pulled over so that one of them could relieve himself.The man screamed; his friends found him unconscious and saw a small hairycreature enter a shiny disc hovering off the ground, then take off with adeafening buzzing sound. The man was taken to a hospital in a state of shock,and all three were interviewed by authorities.120[index_split_259.html#filepos1495840]Back in Europe, close encounters were reported in Belgium, Spain, Germany, andFrance (including another “paralysis” case in late December); but aside fromItaly, the wave of alien sightings declined after mid-November, and more so inDecember. In November, the Hungarian government announced that UFOs did notexist, since all flying saucer reports came from bourgeois countries. OnDecember 15, a Royal Australian Navy pilot was paced by two UFOs. The incidentwas confirmed on radar and kept out of the press for sev eral months.121[index_split_259.html#filepos1496042]Around this time, Melbourne University scientist Harry Turner wrote a report onflying saucers for the Royal Australian Air Force, which remained classifieduntil 1982. Turner stated:> The evidence presented by the reports held by [the Australian air force] tend> to support the ... conclusion ... that certain strange aircraft have been> observed to behave in a manner suggestive of extraterrestrial origin. It would be interesting to see the reports that Turner analyzed. The RAAF,however, seems to have dismissed his report. A key reason was that Turnerincluded references to Keyhoe’s book, Flying Saucers from Outer Space. Accordingto Australian UFO researcher Bill Chalker,122[index_split_259.html#filepos1496242] the Australian Director of Air ForceIntelligence inquired of the Americans about Keyhoe. The Australians were toldthat Keyhoe’s books deceptively conveyed the impression that they were based onofficial documents (they didn’t, the Pentagon implied), made “improper use ofinformation,” and that “a dim view” was taken officially of Keyhoe and hisworks. Thus, Turner’s findings and recommendations (which included greaterofficial interest) were dropped.123 [index_split_259.html#filepos1496387]"},{"pageContent":"AMERICA DEBUNKS While bedlam swept through Europe and South America, the U.S. Air Force releaseda statement through the Chicago Tribune Press on October 9 under the headline:“Finds Saucers Exist Solely in Imagination.” The article stated:> The air force said today that after seven years of exhaustive investigation by> its Air Technical Intelligence Center at Dayton, Ohio, it has failed to> uncover any proof that flying saucers exist except in the imagination of> observers. . . .124 [index_split_259.html#filepos1496529] UFOs were not prominent in America at the time. Why, then, would the air forceissue such a statement? Keyhoe pointed to the crazy stories from France andelsewhere which, while “obviously inspired by excitement or hysteria,”nevertheless had sown “the seeds of panic” in most of the world.That may be, but the American military continued to encounter UFOs and expressvarying levels of concern about them. The 4602nd AISS noted in a September 1954memo that it was receiving about fifteen reports per week, a bit busier than itsaverage pace of one per day during the latter half of 1954. From mid-Augustthrough the end of the year, the 4602nd received 112 raw reports and conductedtwenty-five field investigations. Thirty-five cases (31 percent) were unsolvedand went on to ATIC/Blue Book, which recorded twenty-two unsolved cases for thatperiod. In November, members of the 4602nd met with Blue Book representativesCapt. Charles Hardin and Allen Hynek, who were to release the “rule of thumb”criteria to evaluate UFOs. Hynek was better qualified than Hardin to do this,and probably helped the 4602nd to compile its own detailed UFO Guide, which itwas then doing.125 [index_split_259.html#filepos1496671]In September, Air Defense Command in Columbus, Ohio, asked Leonard Stringfieldif he would help screen GOC reports from southwestern Ohio. It wanted the localGround Observer Corps to forward UFO reports to him, which he would evaluate andthe best of which he would pass to ADC. ADC asked only that Stringfield not askany questions; he agreed. He later learned that air force jets were scrambledseveral times on the basis of his reports. Once again, the evidence is that ADC,not ATIC, was doing the serious work on UFOs. Stringfield served for two yearsin this capacity and gathered that the air force private and public activitiesregarding UFOs were very different.126 [index_split_259.html#filepos1496842]On October 14, Keyhoe learned of a “Crashed Object” program at the 4602nd AISS,which someone within the unit had leaked to his friend Lou Corbin. According tothe informant, the program was known as the “investigation of unidentifiedcrashed objects.” Corbin told Keyhoe that he “got the impression they’drecovered some kind of ‘objects’—probably something dropped from a saucer.”Corbin also related a recent encounter he had had with an air force captain whohad just returned from Alaska. When Corbin asked why the air force was sosecretive about flying saucers, the captain angrily blurted out, “What goodwould it do you if you did know the truth?”127[index_split_259.html#filepos1497041]In the wake of the global rush of up-close-and-personal UFO sightings, oneobvious question was, how much did the U.S. authorities know about it?Certainly, Keyhoe had known of it, and even Blue Book contained a report fromthat period describing a UFO occupant. The incident occurred in the AzoresIslands on September 21, 1954. An airport guard reported a ten-foot-widemetallic blue object with a clear glass or plastic nose. It made a hummingsound, hovered, and landed vertically about fifty feet from the witness. Anormal-sized blond man emerged from the object, spoke in an unknown language,and patted the witness on the shoulder. The strange man returned to the craft,attached a harness, pressed a button, and ascended vertically. The totalencounter lasted three minutes. This incident was listed in the Blue Book filesnot as a hoax, but as an unknown! Other Blue Book unknowns in late 1954 occurredin the Philippines, Japan, Iceland, Greenland, Morocco, and South Africa—inaddition to a rash of quality sightings within the American Midwest. Thesefacts, combined with the knowledge that America had close military relationshipswith most of the countries experiencing UFO sightings, give us strong reason tobelieve that American authorities had a very good, if not total, awareness ofwhat was going on.One thing we know for certain: no one can ascribe these UFO encounters toAmerica’s secret U-2 spy plane—a favorite recourse from the CIA’s officialhistorian, Gerald Haines. On December 1, 1954, the CIA’s Richard Bissell, inconjunction with the Pentagon, initiated the development of the U- 2. It wouldnot fly until August 1955.128 [index_split_259.html#filepos1497187]At a press conference on December 16, President Eisenhower was asked aboutflying saucers and the recent attention they had been getting from Europeangovernments. Eisenhower repeated the air force statement that such thingsexisted “only in the imaginations of the viewers.” When asked whether hebelieved they were extraterrestrial, Eisenhower gave a good example ofcircumlocution. The last time he talked on this subject, he said, an air forceofficial whom he trusted had told him that, as far as he knew, it was“inaccurate” to believe that the objects were coming from another planet. Theair force supported Eisenhower by stating there was “no evidence that we arebeing observed by machines from outer space, or by a foreign power.”129[index_split_259.html#filepos1497354]It is unclear whether Eisenhower actually believed what he said. Immediatelyafter the press conference, he asked the air force for a full briefing on thelatest UFO developments. Air Force Secretary Harold Talbott admitted as much ina talk at the National Press Club.130 [index_split_259.html#filepos1497576]By the end of 1954, two things were all too clear. First, UFO sightings andlandings were worldwide, and completely beyond the ability of the United Statesto affect. If one accepts the witness reports, several types of aliens appearedto be examining the world’s life-forms-including human life—and conducting somesort of global survey. These aliens did not always care whether humans observedthem but they did not want people pestering them, and showed no desire tointeract or “make their presence known” to humans in any official way.Second, the American government, in conjunction with several other nations,seemed to have succeeded in discrediting UFOs. Edwards lost his job in mid-1954,effectively silencing the last national voice in the media that opposed UFOsecrecy. In the aftermath of such an intense global wave of UFO sightings, thepublic dimension of the problem still remained under control. Now, throughoutthe country, belief in UFOs became truly a marginal affair, something onlycrackpots took seriously. This was a great success for policymakers who, since1952, had deemed it essential to end public speculation on this matter once andfor all.Throughout 1955, 1956, and most of 1957, UFOs faded from public view. Someexcellent-quality reports came out during this period, but they punctuated longperiods of apparent inactivity and general media silence."},{"pageContent":"INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT? NAH Two commissions studied the American intelligence community in 1955. The firstof these was the (Second) Hoover Commission, charged with recommending ways “topromote economy, efficiency, and improved service” in the executive branch ofthe federal government. Headed by former President Herbert Hoover, it gave itsfinal report to Congress on June 29, 1955. Gen. Mark Clark headed thecommission’s task force on intelligence—he noted the CIA’s lack ofaccountability and recommended establishing an intelligence oversightcommittee.131 [index_split_259.html#filepos1497718]Not surprisingly, this flopped at Langley and the White House. Eisenhowerimmediately commissioned another study headed by Gen. James Doolittle, whichfocused on clandestine and covert operations. Doolittle submitted his report onSeptember 30, 1955. Declassified in 1976, it laid out America’s prevailing coldwar consensus:> There are no rules in such a game.... We must develop effective espionage and> counterespionage services and must learn to subvert, sabotage and destroy our> enemies by more clever, more sophisticated, and more effective methods than> those used against us.132 [index_split_259.html#filepos1498730] Doolittle’s report negated the Hoover Commission recommendations on intelligenceoversight. Instead, the National Security Council established a new committee,known as the 5412 Committee, to approve important covert operations.Eisenhower’s first representative on it was Gordon Gray, who changed its workingname to the Special Group. Henceforth, all proposals passed through the SpecialGroup on their way to the desk of Richard Helms, the CIA’s Director of Plans,and the man responsible for clandestine and covert operations.133[index_split_259.html#filepos1498876]Protected from oversight, CIA and army behavioral experiments accelerated.During 1955, an MK-Ultra experiment took place in which an army “volunteer” wassealed in a sensory deprivation box for forty consecutive hours. In panic andterror, he kicked his way out, and wept uncontrollably for a day. This resultedin a change of policy: the box was strengthened. Around this time, Dr. MaitlandBaldwin told Morris Allen of MK-Ultra that he could do terminal experiments insensory deprivation, as long as the CIA provided the cover and the subjects.This was too grisly even for the CIA at this point, and it was shot down asmorally reprehensible. In time, however, the CIA had complete access to EwenCameron, who gladly used his own patients for precisely this purpose. Cameronactually left one woman in sensory deprivation for thirty-five days,irreversibly scrambling her mind. The foundation for Cameron’s work was laid in1955 by the incorporation of the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology,a CIA-funded group that secretly supported mind control research.134[index_split_259.html#filepos1499017]In March 1955, the CIA obtained quantities of Hemophilus pertussis, thewhooping-cough bacteria, from Fort Detrick. It then field tested it alongFlorida’s gulf coast. According to Florida state medical records, the incidenceof whooping cough in Florida tripled that year (339 cases and one death in 1954;1080 cases and twelve deaths in 1955). Unfortunately, the CIA’s role remainedunknown until 1979.135 [index_split_259.html#filepos1499163]In 1955, the air force began promoting its influential myth about a bomber gap.The Soviet Union, intent on world domination at any cost, was supposed to havefive hundred bombers with which to blow the U.S. into the next millennium. Threeyears later, after Sputnik, the air force invented a missile gap. These weresheer fabrications, created, in the words of one historian, as “scare tactics todistort information to further its weapons buildup.” By 1961, CIA photointerpretation experts, using data derived from U-2 overflights, learned thatthe Russians had in fact only four missiles capable of launching a first-strikeattack on the U.S.136 [index_split_259.html#filepos1499302]"},{"pageContent":"BLUE BOOK COOKS ITS BOOKS Disinformation also prevailed in the world of UFOs. A January 7, 1955, Air ForceInformation Services Letter ordered silence over UFOs. Air force publicrelations officers began issuing UFO fact sheets containing a few (occasionallymathematically impossible) statistics and reaffirmations that the smallpercentage of undetermined unknowns were harmless. The ATIC UFOB Guide was readyby mid-January and sent to the 4602nd AISS. It contained guidelines forfollow-up investigations and examples for identifying UFOs. Despite the newguide, a month later (February 15), ATIC sent a memo to 4602nd officer MajorCybulski. The high number of unknowns recorded by the 4602nd was unacceptable.Instead:> ... it is necessary that both the 4602nd AISS and the ATIC strive to reach as> many case solutions as possible, thereby reducing the percentage of unknowns> to a bare minimum.137 [index_split_259.html#filepos1499455] The message: solve as many cases as possible before sending them to ATIC. Thesesolutions did not need to be strictly scientific. That is because most UFOBcases, according to the memo, “when sufficient information is contained, willfit to some extent [emphasis added] one of the hypotheses contained in the Guideand, therefore, may be considered as solved.” The memo encouraged the 4602nd touse such terms as “possible,” “probable,” and “definite” in identifying UFOs.The implication was clear: ATIC would then conflate them all as identified. Inall subsequent air force press releases and Blue Book statistics, “probable” and“possible” subcategories disappeared.138 [index_split_259.html#filepos1499630]A month later, the air force revised the UFOB Guide again, orderinginvestigators to use “common sense” in identifying UFOs. This ruled out thepossibility that the witness saw anything truly extraordinary. The policyworked: unknowns for 1955 became a mere 5.9 percent and remained low for years.Interestingly, the AISS Squadron Guide of March 15 mentioned that ATIC wasdissatisfied over not receiving UFO reports quickly, or even at all in a numberof cases.139 [index_split_259.html#filepos1499776]What was Blue Book in 1955? It was an organization that (1) claimed to be thesole repository of military UFO reports, but was not; (2) was under orders touse any means necessary to identify UFOs as conventional objects, regardless ofhow strained the explanation became; (3) intentionally misled the public withmeaningless and even fictitious statistics; and (4) had a barely breathinginvestigative capability. The conclusion is self-evident: Blue Book was the maskworn by the air force for public viewing. Its UFO reports andevaluations—intellectually dishonest in the extreme—can therefore have noscientific value whatsoever. The fact that the U.S. military and other officialsources continue to use them tells us more about the organizations than it doesabout UFOs.Much of the foregoing also applies to the 4602nd, which was determined to keepall UFO explanations conventional, no matter how strained. In late May 1955, atthe Fifth AISS Commanders’ Conference, on the subject of UFOs, it was statedthat the “general public [was] not qualified to evaluate material propounded inscience fiction.” Such “absurd and fantastic theories” as spacemen were “givencredence solely on the basis of ignorance.” An investigator had to be careful inevaluating UFO reports, depending on what the witness believed about thesighting:> Abnormal predisposition to attach belief to the more fanciful aspects of> UFOBs, e.g. “Flying Saucers” would tend to negate the source’s reliability as> a factual observer. Thus, never believe anyone who believed in the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Theapproach had limited effect on reducing the percentage of unidentifieds. By June30, the 4602nd AISS reported that of its 194 preliminary UFO reports for 1955,it had made twenty-three field investigations and had twenty-five unsolvedreports—an unknown rate of 13 percent. Going back to August 12, 1954, andremoving cases of insufficient evidence, the percentage of unknowns was lower:twenty-three unknowns from 306 reports, or about 7.5 percent. In reality,however, none of these numbers mean very much; they reflect little more than thecreativity, and at times audacity, of the explainers at ADC and ATIC.140[index_split_259.html#filepos1499939]"},{"pageContent":"VOICES IN THE DARK AGES The period of the mid- to late-1950s may with some justice be viewed as the DarkAges of the UFO. Effectively marginalized from the mainstream, the littlepublicity it received was almost all negative. The Soviet Union once againdebunked UFOs, declaring on April 30, 1955, that they did not exist.141[index_split_259.html#filepos1500085]In 1955, Thomas Eickhoff (who had recently corresponded with Keyhoe and the airforce) tried to force the U.S. government into suing UFO contactee GeorgeAdamski for an act of fraud involving the U.S. mail system. The pretext :Adamski claimed to be in contact with beings from Venus and was using the U.S.postal service to help sell his books. Eickhoff’s efforts reached Allen Dulles,whose attorney advised that the government did have a case against Adamski. Theproblem was that Adamski would himself be able to “prevent anyone fromtestifying in court concerning this book because maximum security existsconcerning the subject of UFOs.” The phrase is worth repeating: maximumsecurity. Dulles’ lawyer said the government “would be left high and dry andwould be open for countersuit.” They dropped the case.142[index_split_259.html#filepos1500228]Somewhat beleaguered, UFO researchers continued to plug away. In January 1955,the first edition of the British publication Flying Saucer Review appeared underthe editorship of former RAF pilot and aviation journalist Derek Dempster.Editorship soon passed to the honorable Brinsley le Poer Trench (later the Earlof Clancarty), and in 1959 to Waveney Girvan.Several well-known people made waves regarding UFOs. During the summer of 1954,the British Air Marshal Lord Dowding, the leader of the Battle of Britain,stated his belief in June that UFOs were interplanetary. During early 1955, thelegendary American inventor William P. Lear (1902-1978) also made his opinionspublic. Although remembered primarily as inventor of the Lear Jet, Lear had alsoinvented a car radio that was responsible for launching Motorola. RCA hadpurchased one of his radio amplifiers for use in their entire product line.During the Second World War, his corporations filled more than $100 million indefense orders. He was a 1949 recipient of the prestigious Collier Award givenannually for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America.During the 1960s, Lear designed the eight-track player as well as navigationalaids for aircraft. In 1981 he was posthumously inducted into the InternationalAeronautics Hall of Fame.On February 2, 1955, Lear gave a press conference in Bogota, Columbia, statinghis belief that “flying saucers come from outer space and are piloted by beingsof superior intelligence.” He gave four main reasons:> (1) Numerous manifestations over a long period of time. (2) Many observations> come simultaneously, and from reliable observers. (3) There are great> possibilities linked with the theory of gravitational fields. (4) There are> now serious efforts in progress to prove the existence of antigravitational> forces and to convert atomic energy directly to electricity. Lear’s prominence ensured wide press coverage. On February 10, back in GrandRapids, Michigan, Lear told reporters that he had seen a flying saucer twomonths earlier, while flying near Palm Springs, California. He also disclosedthat “an American aviation company” was conducting gravitational-field research.Lear himself certainly got the antigravity bug. A New York Herald-Tribunearticle from November 1955 quoted him as believing it was possible to create“artificial electro-gravitational fields whose huge polarity can be controlledto cancel out gravity.” According to the article, Lear for several months hadbeen “going over new developments and theories relating to gravity with hischief scientists and engineers.”143 [index_split_259.html#filepos1500379]Shortly after the Herald-Tribune article, the Miami Herald gave a rare glimpseof the state of 1950s gravity research in a three-part series. Work was underway at many of America’s elite universities and laboratories: the Institute forAdvanced Studies at Princeton, New Jersey; Princeton University; the Universityof Indiana’s School of Advanced Mathematical Studies; the Purdue UniversityResearch Foundation; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and theUniversity of North Carolina. The last had the approval of Dr. Gordon Gray,then-president of the university (and alleged member of MJ-12). Most ofAmerica’s major aircraft firms were also either directly involved or “activelyinterested” in gravity. Among those mentioned in the article were Martin,Convair, Bell Aircraft, United Aircraft, Lear, Clarke Electronics, andSperry-Rand Corp.The article stressed that antigravity research was no rarefied theoreticalendeavor. Many of the scientists believed its implications were farther reachingthan atomic energy, perhaps providing mankind a nearly unlimited source ofpower. Space ships based upon electromagnetic principles that created their owngravitational field “would be a reality,” able to accelerate to many thousandsof miles per hour within seconds, and make sudden turns without subjecting theirpassengers to the g-forces caused by gravity’s pull. Several theoretical studieshad been made of round or saucer-shaped vehicles “for travel into outer space.”Lest the connection was lost, a cartoon image of a flying saucer accompanied thearticle.Most research, noted the article, had come from unnamed private funds andcorporations. Although leaders of the military had been periodically briefed onthe progress, their attitude was described as “call us when you get somehardware that works.” No tangible breakthroughs were known to have taken place,and many of the scientists refused to predict when any might occur. However, thehead of the advanced design division of Martin Aircraft, George Trimble,declared, “I know that if Washington decides it will be vital to our nationalsurvival ... we’d find the answer rapidly.”144[index_split_259.html#filepos1500756]One of the pioneers in gravitational theory, and a man whose career alsointersected with the UFO, was Thomas Townsend Brown. Born in 1905, he studiedphysics at Caltech and Denison University. In 1930, he joined the navy andconducted advanced research in electromagnetism, radiation, field physics,spectroscopy, gravitation, and more. After joining the reserves, he worked forGlenn L. Martin, then returned to active service in 1939. With the rank oflieutenant commander, he was assigned to the National Defense Research Committee(NDRC) and later its successor, the Office of Scientific Research, headed byVannevar Bush. For several years, Brown also served under Adm. Arthur Radford.In 1944, following an illness and discharge from military service, he worked asa radar consultant for the advanced design section of Lockheed-Vega AircraftCorporation in California.Since the 1930s, Brown had also worked on his own to create a localizedgravitational field and invented a machine called a “Gravitator.” In 1952 and1953, he devised a series of experiments involving disc-shaped objects tetheredby a wire to an electrically charged pole. Essentially, Brown concentratedextreme electrostatic charges along the leading edge of a disc to createpropulsion. His discs achieved speeds of eleven miles per hour and higher, butBrown believed that he could ultimately produce an aircraft capable of Mach 3,well beyond the fastest aircraft speeds of the day. Despite the success of hisexperiments in many respects, Brown did not create an independent gravitationalfield. One researcher maintained that it was more convenient to think of Brown’sresult as “electrostatic propulsion which has its own niche in aviation,”something which deserved follow-up in its own right.145[index_split_259.html#filepos1500894] Indeed, while neither the Pentagon nor theworld of science expressed interest in Brown’s theories, one of his follow-upexperiments was allegedly classified. (However, I have been unable to confirmthis.)In 1955, Brown went to England and France, hoping for better sponsorship. InFrance, under the auspices of the La Société National de ConstructionAeronautique Sud Ouest (SNCASO), he flew his discs in a high vacuum withexcellent results. Despite his French colleagues’ initial excitement, the plansfor supporting his work fell through. He returned to America.146[index_split_259.html#filepos1501050]Not surprisingly, Brown was interested in the phenomenon of flying saucers andbelieved that an extraterrestrial intelligence was probably responsible forthem. Before long, he would delve into that topic more systematically.Meanwhile, around the time of the Lear publicity, Keyhoe received a letter fromHermann Oberth in response to an inquiry. Oberth was even more prominent thanWilliam Lear in the history of aviation and aeronautics. He is generallyconsidered to be the most brilliant and visionary of the three pioneers ofmodern rocketry (along with American Robert Goddard and Russian KonstantinTsiolkovsky). In 1922, Oberth’s doctoral thesis on rocketry was rejected. A yearlater, he earned worldwide acclaim when he published it as Die Rakete zu denPlanetenraumen (The Rocket into Planetary Space), followed by a longer versionin 1929. Oberth argued that it was feasible for rockets to be “built sopowerfully that they could be capable of carrying a man aloft,” even above theEarth’s atmosphere. This book provided much of the mathematical foundation forspace travel. During the 1930s, Oberth took on the young Wernher von Braun as anassistant in his rocketry research, and during the war assisted von Braun on theV-2 rocket. During the early 1950s, Oberth designed anti-aircraft missiles forthe Italian navy. Around 1953 or 1954, according to Frank Edwards, the WestGerman government hired him to head a commission studying UFOs. As a result ofthis study, Oberth had made a statement, during the summer of 1954, that UFOswere “conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. Theyprobably do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not even in our galaxy.”Like William Lear, Townsend Brown, and Wilbert Smith, Oberth decided that UFOswere “propelled by distorting the gravitational field, converting gravity intouseable energy.”147 [index_split_259.html#filepos1501384]In a letter to Keyhoe, Oberth explained his electromagnetic propulsion theorywhich he believed was the true explanation for UFO propulsion. With the abilityto create their own gravitational fields, UFOs would be able to do all thethings witnesses had attributed to them: hover motionless above the earth,accelerate at tremendous speed, and make violent turns that would cause ordinaryaircraft to disintegrate. Within the year, Keyhoe published these thoughts inhis next book.148 [index_split_259.html#filepos1501550]Oberth’s views did not hinder him from being hired in July 1955, under aPaperclip contract, to work for the army in Huntsville, Alabama, where he joinedmuch of the old Peenemünde crew. It is hard to say just what Oberth did atHuntsville. According to the definitive study of the origins of space travel byFrederick I. Ordway III and Mitchell R. Sharpe (1979), Oberth worked on “anumber of complex projects” dealing with “advanced space studies,” mostlyclassified secret. He prepared several analyses of the stability of satelliteorbits, and seems to have done some work on designing a prototype of a lunarmodule. Oberth’s own book, Man into Space, written in 1957 during his Huntsvilleyears, reads like a layout of the Apollo program and beyond, with discussions ofsatellite rockets, “the spaceman’s equipment,” designs for space stations, a“moon car,” and other interesting topics. He remained in the U.S. until 1959.Writers and biographers of Oberth politely ignore his unfortunate interest inflying saucers. A 1962 biography gave passing mention of his beliefs on thesubject. None of the dozens of biographies and homages to him on the World WideWeb today mention it, either.149 [index_split_259.html#filepos1501692]UFO-related news continued to seep out in 1955. The Los Angeles Examiner ran apiece by Dorothy Kilgallen on May 22, in which she reported from London thatBritish scientists and airmen had examined the wreckage of a “mysterious flyingship.” These investigators were convinced that UFOs were not optical illusionsor Soviet inventions, but extraterrestrial. Kilgallen wrote that her source was“a British official of cabinet rank who prefers to remain unidentified.” Still,the informant told her:> We believe on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucers were> staffed by small men—probably under four feet tall.... It’s frightening but> there is no denying the flying saucers come from another planet. Kilgallen’s account was soon reprinted in several journals and books, includingthe New York Journal American, Flying Saucer Review, Morris Jessup’s UFOCasebook of 1956, and other books through the years.150[index_split_259.html#filepos1501835]Jerome Clark emphasized that Kilgallen’s statement has never been substantiated.It depends on one’s perspective of the problem. In May or June, one of HaroldWilkins’ legion of informers wrote to him on UFOs and the British government.According to Wilkins’ seemingly well-placed source:> I can get no British naval or air officer to pass any comment on ufos.... One> thing I can tell you: every time I mention the phenomenon, or speak of ufos to> one particular naval officer-friend of mine, I come against a wall of silence.> He turns the subject aside, and won’t say a word. I am sure the subject of> ufos is definitely taboo in naval and air circles. Wilkins himself wrote of “a conspiracy of silence” at this time among the pressand world governments.151 [index_split_259.html#filepos1502021]Frank Edwards, out of a job at Mutual Broadcasting, tried to keep busy. On June13, 1955, he traveled with a TV film producer to the navy department and askedfor some unclassified navy pictures of rockets. This appeared to be no problemuntil the navy learned that Edwards intended to show them on television during apanel discussion on UFOs. Suddenly, the Navy informed Edwards it would notcooperate on any publicity connected with flying saucers.152[index_split_259.html#filepos1502164]Keyhoe remained the most visible and dangerous opponent of UFO secrecy. In thelatter half of 1955, his third book on the subject, The Flying SaucerConspiracy, appeared. Keyhoe maintained his knack for writing about all thethings the military was trying to keep low-key. From over three hundred sources,he presented accurate descriptions of the UFO cover-up by analyzing suchdocuments as JANAP 146 and AFR 200-2, the air force’s attempts to discredit him,as well as many well-researched and vividly described UFO encounters. As in thepast, critical reviews were mixed. Jonathon Leonard of the New York Times calledit a “repetitious and unconvincing attack on the major’s great enemy: the airforce ‘silence group.”’ Library Journal, on the other hand, conceded thatKeyhoe’s conclusions were “less fantastic than those of other writers in thisfield, and it must be admitted that the book makes fascinating reading.”153[index_split_259.html#filepos1502306]His book directly resulted in the publication of the Battelle Report, also knownas Blue Book Special Report #14. The air force had declassified it in May, thenwaited until a press conference on October 25, 1955, to release it to thegeneral public. The report dismissed UFOs as a significant scientific ornational security problem and claimed that all but a few UFOs were explainable.Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles added that (1) no one had reason to believeflying saucers have flown over the U.S.; (2) the three percent unknowns for 1954would be identifiable if more data were available; and (3) the air force hadrecently tested a new circular vertical takeoff jet, built by the AV Roe companyin Canada, known as the AVRO disc. Quarles said this would probably cause UFOsightings in the future (it did not, as it was soon scrapped). He also statedthat the report found “no evidence of the existence of the popularly termed‘flying saucers.’” Quarles implied that the fictitious three percent unknownfigure for 1954 applied for the 1947—1952 period—which it did not.Like so many official reports before and since, the Battelle Report’sconclusions did not match its data. The report’s unexplained rate was 20percent, which rose to 22 percent when removing cases lacking sufficient data.It also indicated that the better rated the witness, the better quality thesighting. Ruppelt’s opinion of the report was succinct: “worthless.” In hisview, Blue Book had been founded not to solve the overall UFO problem, but tolearn of new technological developments. “This is not a good study.” The majormedia, however, such as the New York Times, accepted Quarles without reservationand lauded the report as the final word on UFOs.154[index_split_259.html#filepos1502497]"},{"pageContent":"1955 SIGHTINGS: MORE HUMANOIDS The lid may have been down, but UFOs continued to appear worldwide. Many of thereports are unofficial in that they are not Blue Book reports, some were notmilitary related, and some—not investigated thoroughly—remain just stories. OnJanuary 1, 1955, a formation of five UFOs was seen over Lima, Peru, by manywitnesses. The objects hovered over the city and gave off an intense silverylight. In San Sebastian, Spain, on January 5, a red circular object about tenfeet wide was seen to land and take off again. On January 14, an unknown objecthit the wing of a B-47 jet bomber in California; the plane landed safely. OnFebruary 2, a veteran airline pilot and copilot in Venezuela had a clear view ofa UFO with lights and portholes. Their receiver went dead, and the object spedaway. More green fireballs were observed over Texas on February 14.155[index_split_259.html#filepos1502755]A humanoid sighting is said to have occurred during the spring of 1955 inLoveland, Ohio. A businessman saw three short beings by the side of the road at4 A.M., believed he lost consciousness, and found himself driving to the policestation without remembering what had taken place. This odd incident wasinvestigated by researchers Ted Bloecher and Leonard Stringfield. On July 3,near Stockton, Georgia, a woman was driving when she saw four beings near theroad that looked similar to later descriptions of Grays. She said they weresmall, with thin arms, pointed chins, no visible mouths, and “bug eyes.” Twowere turned away from her, while one was bent over with something like a stickin its hand; and the fourth one faced her with its right arm raised. InBradford, England, on August 16, a man and his teenaged son claimed to see afour-foot-tall being in skin-tight black clothes. On its chest was a silver discperforated with holes, and it seemed to walk by jumping. The witnesses were tooamazed to follow it.156 [index_split_259.html#filepos1502940]The best-known humanoid sighting of the year occurred near Hopkinsville,Kentucky, by the Sutton family on the night of August 21-22. A man in his yardsaw a “spaceship” in a nearby field and ran inside to tell the others. Withinminutes, several creatures were roaming the area. They were about three feethigh with a roundish head, elephantine ears, a slit-like mouth extending fromear to ear, no visible neck, long arms ending in clawed hands, and wore glowingsilver clothing. Their eyes were huge and wide-set. When running, the beingsdropped to all fours. When one of them approached the house, a man fired hisshotgun through the screen door, scoring a direct hit. The creature was knockedover, but got back up and scuttled off. Another man walked out the door, and oneof the creatures reached for his head. According to the family, this kind ofactivity continued for the greater part of the night, and included heavy gunfireat times. At one point, one of the entities was knocked down from the roof by abullet and “floated down.” Running out of ammunition, the Suttons musteredenough courage to scramble into their car and head for the police station. Theybrought back the deputy sheriff, who saw a fast-moving lighted object in thesky, but nothing else unusual.Not surprisingly, the story received nationwide ridicule, and many assumed itwas a hoax. Still, later researchers found the family credible, and many wereinclined to believe the story. Even the chief of police agreed that “somethingscared those people—something beyond reason—nothing ordinary.” Strange as it mayseem, the Hopkinsville incident to this day has its defenders among UFOresearchers.157 [index_split_259.html#filepos1503127]"},{"pageContent":"MILITARY UFO ENCOUNTERS AND THE U-2 On June 4, 1955, an RB-47 aircraft of the Air Force Special Security Service(the air arm of the NSA) tracked an unknown aircraft visually and by radar fornine minutes near Melville Sound, in the Canadian Northwest Territories. Thecrew chief described what he saw as “glistening silver metallic.” The crewobtained gun camera film, but of poor quality. Three days later, another RB-47en route to Eielson AFB, Alaska, registered electronic contact southeast ofBank’s Island at thirty-five hundred yards. The plane’s radar was jammed,apparently by the UFO. This was a matter of serious concern, since the purposeof the RB-47 was quick penetration of Soviet airspace to trigger radar alertsand thereby determine operating frequencies.158[index_split_259.html#filepos1503352]On July 12, a memorandum from Todos M. Odarenko, the CIA/OSI Chief of thePhysics and Electronics Division, cited a radar-visual UFO report from PepperellAFB, Newfoundland. According to the memo, the pilot maintained visual contactwith the UFO and noted “direction changes [which] correlated exactly with thosepainted on scope by controller.” The object was “observed by radar, at least,for forty-nine minutes,” a rather long time. Odarenko sent the memo to the CIA’sacting assistant director for scientific intelligence. “It is reasonable tobelieve,” he wrote, “that more information will become available on this whencomplete report . . . is issued.”159 [index_split_259.html#filepos1503496]On August 6, 1955, the U-2 spy plane took its maiden flight, which occurred overthe remote, and newly developed, region known as Area 51 in Nevada. In thedebate over which organization was more powerful, the air force or the CIA, itis noteworthy here that the U-2 program was CIA all the way, despite the strongwishes of Air Force General and SAC Commander Curtis LeMay. Instead, the airforce had to provide the muscle and equipment to serve on the agency’s latestand greatest black project.160 [index_split_259.html#filepos1503655]On August 23, 1955, a military UFO encounter took place over Cincinnati, Ohio.Personnel at the GOC tower in Hamilton County noticed three white spheresbetween Columbus and Cincinnati. Tracking the objects on radar, they notifiedStrategic Air Command at Lockbourne AFB, which scrambled jets to investigate.The UFO soon approached the tower and hovered in pendulum-like motions directlyabove it. The interceptors then swooped in and gave chase, but the craftdisappeared at “incredible speed.” Meanwhile, UFO reports were coming in fromthroughout the region to Leonard Stringfield’s filter center in Cincinnati. TheGreater Cincinnati Airport also tracked unidentified blips on radar. To hissurprise, Stringfield obtained clearance to write about the sightings in hisnewsletter. A mistake or a big change in policy, he thought. But when he triedto get the story to the press, “the Cincinnati newspapers weren’t interested.” Aspokesman at Wright-Patterson not only denied the incident to a newspaper, butclaimed to know nothing of Stringfield’s relationship with Air Defense Command.Stringfield was bewildered.161 [index_split_259.html#filepos1503822]Stringfield remained in touch with the air force during the late summer and intothe autumn. One air force officer on active duty broke the law and toldStringfield privately, “What bothers me is what’s happening to our aircraft.” Hethen described a crash of a U.S. jet while it chased a UFO in Iceland. “Wecouldn’t explain the crash.” Officially, the men died during a routine trainingmission. The officer gave Stringfield the impression that this kind of event wasnot unusual.162 [index_split_259.html#filepos1503987]Other interesting UFO sightings occurred sporadically during the summer of 1955.One was a multiple-witness sighting of a long silvery object emerging from thewater in Santa Maria, California. Another involved a brilliant round object witha long trail approaching National Airport in Washington, D.C. The objectstopped, oscillated, and moved off at high speed. The airport ceiling lightswent out when it approached, and turned on when it left. Other close-rangesightings were reported in America and England.163[index_split_259.html#filepos1504138]"},{"pageContent":"SENATOR RICHARD RUSSELL SEES A UFO One of the key UFO sightings of the year involved U.S. Senator Richard Russell(D-Georgia), head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, during a trip to theSoviet Union on October 4, 1955. Russell was on a Soviet train from Kiev andpassing through the Transcaucasus region. He was accompanied by Armed ServicesCommittee consultant Ruben Efron and Lt. Col. E. U. Hathaway. Shortly after 7P.M., Russell looked out his window to see a disc-shaped object slowly ascendingvertically. Its outer surface revolved slowly to the right, and a spark or flameemanated from the bottom. It reached an altitude of about six thousand feet,then headed north at a very fast speed. Russell rushed over to tell his twocompanions. Hathaway looked quickly enough to see the UFO; Efron missed it. Toeveryone’s astonishment, a second disc then appeared about two minutes later andperformed exactly the same maneuver as the first. This time all three men sawit. A distraught Soviet trainman then closed the curtains of the car, anddirected the three not to look outside.The report went past Blue Book to much higher levels, and someone leaked it tothe Los Angeles Examiner in late 1955 or early 1956. Aviation reporter TomTowers tried to get the details from Russell, but received no response. AfterTowers tried again, Russell replied on January 17, 1956:> I have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the government, and> they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this> time. The matter was classified Top Secret until 1959 and remained Secret until 1985when Stanton Friedman was able to get it declassified following a FOIA request.Interview notes about the sighting stated:> [T]here were two lights toward the inside of the disc, which remained> stationary as the outer surface went around.... The lights sat near the top of> the disc. If a line representing the diameter of the disc were divided into> three segments, the lights would have been located at the two points of> division between the middle segment and the two outside segments.... The> aircraft was circular. The aircraft was round, resembled a flying saucer. There can be no doubt that Sen. Richard Russell saw something extraordinary. Letus assume that, just as he described, he did see a flying saucer. Could it havebeen what it appeared to be, a Soviet flying saucer? If so, it would mean thathuman beings have had flying saucer technology for a long time. It would be asecret as amazing as that of aliens themselves. But of course, the leap to sucha revolutionary method of aerodynamics and propulsion seems impossible. Contrastthe image of a WWII-styled propeller-driven aircraft with a multi-Mach, silent,exceptionally maneuverable disc-shaped craft. The issue had been raised back in1947 and 1948 at Wright-Patterson AFB: could the Soviets, Germans, Americans, oranyone else, have created the kind of breakthrough in aerodynamics that UFOsappeared to represent? The answer at that time was no. If, therefore, theSoviets (and presumably the Americans) did achieve such a breakthrough, all hasbeen silent in the public domain, as well as on the field of battle.Russell did see a craft. If it was not of human design, then the onlyalternative is that it was of alien design, and that both the Soviet andAmerican governments knew this.This much is certain: the Soviet government was deeply secretive about UFOs inits territory, and the American government—at the height of the coldwar—cooperated in this secrecy.164 [index_split_259.html#filepos1504320]Although the Russell sighting remained well submerged within the media, a NewYork Times article from October 8, 1955, printed a cryptic remark from GeneralDouglas MacArthur that world nations would have to unite against enemies fromouter space. He refused any further explanation. Two days later, the air forcereleased a statement from Fort Worth, Texas, to explain that any flashing lightsseen for the next two months across the U.S. would be wind-driven experimentalplastic balloons that might travel as fast as 110 mph.165[index_split_259.html#filepos1504484]Presumably, it was not an experimental balloon or U-2 spy plane that hit a B-47near Lovington, New Mexico, in October. According to the sole survivor,something solid definitely hit the plane. No other planes were in the area. Onewitness claimed a “ball of fire” appeared near the plane just before the crash.Several weeks later, another such incident occurred in Texas.166[index_split_259.html#filepos1504636]On November 20, two shiny, elliptical UFOs, “like two dirigibles,” traveled overthe restricted area at Oak Ridge. On December 11, navy jets engaged in adogfight with a round, reddish UFO near Jacksonville, Florida. The object hadbeen reported by the crews of two airliners, as well as by people on the ground.Two navy jets were in the area on a night practice mission and were directed tothe area by the Jacksonville Naval Air Station. The jets located the object andattempted to close in on it. At that moment, the object shot up to thirtythousand feet, then dived back, circling and buzzing the jets. All the while,Naval Air Station officers and tower controllers watched on radar. In this case,as with so many others, it is reasonable to ask: if this UFO was anexperimental, classified American project, what might account for this type ofbehavior—to say nothing of the performance of the object itself?167[index_split_259.html#filepos1504776]"},{"pageContent":"GOVERNMENT OUT OF CONTROL By the mid-1950s, more signs emerged that the executive office, even headed by awar hero, was losing control of its military. Throughout the year, PresidentEisenhower and Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining tried to get some kind ofinformation from Curtis LeMay at SAC as to what his actual strategic bombingplan was. In October 1955, LeMay finally briefed the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Theshocked attending members learned that LeMay’s plan called for the instantaneousdestruction of 645 military targets, 118 cities, and 60 million people in theSoviet Union. LeMay had not drawn up his plan as defensive, in accordance withthe official U.S. policy of massive retaliation. A firm believer in firststrike, LeMay said, “I’m going to knock the shit out of them before they get offthe ground.”168 [index_split_259.html#filepos1504916]For other branches of the national security state, it was business as usual. InAugust 1956, the FBI began running Cointelpro (counter-intelligence program).These various programs were deployed against American dissidents and theirorganizations; the first one targeted the American Communist Party. TypicalCointelpro methods were anonymous or fictitious letters, false defamatory orthreatening information, forged signatures, and other methods of disinformationto disrupt an organization. The FBI blackmailed insiders to spread false rumorsor promote factionalism. It created bogus organizations to attack or disrupt abona fide group, and instigated hostile actions through third parties such asemployers, elected officials, and the media. It enabled the FBI to investigateany political organization on the pretext of checking for Communists, includingthe NAACP, women’s rights groups, and gay rights groups. Cointelpro and relatedprograms prompted nearly 330,000 FBI investigations and created a Security Indexof over 200,000 dangerous Americans to be detained in the event of war.The FBI programs were also noteworthy in that documents relating to them weremarked “Do Not File.” This meant they were withheld from the FBI filing system,offering no clues that they even existed. (The cover was blown after activistsbroke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, in 1971.) The relevance forUFO-related information is obvious, but to spell it out: regarding mattersconnected with “national security,” there appears to be a wealth of informationthat does not exist officially. Thus, a request to find such documents through aFreedom of Information Act request would be in vain. Add to this the likelihoodthat perhaps the most sensitive information regarding UFOs may not even exist indocument form (“the first rule in keeping secrets is nothing on paper,” RichardHelms), and one can appreciate the difficulty that an honest UFO researcher hasin ferreting out the truth.169 [index_split_259.html#filepos1505057]"},{"pageContent":"SILENCING POLICIES OF 1956 Throughout 1956, UFOs all but disappeared from the news. The air force keptmatters low-key, answering queries with a fact sheet referring people to SpecialReport 14. Unknowns for the year were officially listed at 0.4 percent.According to the air force, the much higher percentages of prior years weresimply “from inadequate data and poor reporting.” Ironically, from this pointonward, no one within ATIC seriously questioned the air force’s investigative oranalytical methods. This included J. Allen Hynek. It must be remembered that theair force still denied the existence of Twining’s 1947 letter, the 1948 Estimateof the Situation, Dewey Fournet’s 1952 study of UFO maneuverability, and theexistence of the Robertson Panel.170 [index_split_259.html#filepos1505222]One sharp note of discord against the harmony of Blue Book’s efforts to debunkUFOs came from Capt. Edward Ruppelt. In January 1956, his Report on UnidentifiedFlying Objects was published. It possessed an alarming candor for its day andcontradicted much of the current air force position. The Estimate of theSituation did exist, wrote Ruppelt, because he had personally seen it. He alsoconfirmed the existence of Fournet’s study and provided the basic contours ofthe Robertson Panel. What truly characterized the book was its clarity anddetail, a potent combination. Ruppelt, Chop, and Fournet also assisted in theproduction of Clarence Greene’s semidocumentary motion picture, UFOs, releasedin May 1956. The group was able to obtain copies of the Montana and Utah films.The air force carefully monitored the film’s reception and readied itself tocounter the film’s impact. It seemed that Ruppelt could become a formidableobstacle against the official position on UFOs. In the end, he did not. By 1959,he printed a second edition of his book that essentially debunked his first, andwas dead a year later.Meanwhile, Jonathan Leonard of the New York Times sought to discredit Ruppelt’sbook. In the same article that reviewed Keyhoe’s Flying Saucer Conspiracy,Leonard described Ruppelt’s work as “cultist,” and “the longest and dullest ofthe current crop of saucer books.” This was not merely grossly unfair, it wasexactly the opposite of the truth.171 [index_split_259.html#filepos1505393]Recent books notwithstanding, UFO secrecy generally prevailed. Ruppelt himselfhad said nothing about the CIA’s ongoing interest in UFOs. On January 9, 1956,the CIA’s Applied Science Division (ASD), within OSI, took on the job of holdingUFO reports. One month later, a CIA memo titled “Responsibility for UnidentifiedFlying Objects” indicated that ASD would retain UFO reports that might provideinformation on foreign weapons research and development. All other reports wereto go to the fundamental sciences area for review of information on foreignscience developments. Researchers Fawcett and Greenwood remarked that “thisgroup could have been a clearinghouse for genuinely mysterious reports of UFOswhich contained much detail but could not be linked to a foreign government.”The memo went on to state that ASD was trying hard to avoid collecting trivialUFO reports and recommended destroying unimportant reports.172[index_split_259.html#filepos1505545]UFO secrecy was the norm everywhere. On February 18, Leonard Stringfieldreceived a letter from the British Lord Dowding that stated, “I am sorry that Icannot tell you anything about the British official attitude to UFOs. I don’tthink there is one.” On March 16, 1956, Stringfield received a letter from Gen.John Samford, still director of air force intelligence, ending Stringfield’saffiliation with Air Defense Command. In April, Capt. George T. Gregory, ahard-line UFO debunker, succeeded Charles Hardin as director of Project BlueBook. A typical statement of the period came from Air Force General Joe Kelly ina letter to Sen. Harry Byrd on May 1, 1956: “There is a total lack of evidencethat they [UFOs] are interplanetary vehicles.”173[index_split_259.html#filepos1505702]"},{"pageContent":"UFOS DURING A PERIOD OF SILENCE Just what was the UFO evidence for 1956? The year offered about the same qualityof reports as in previous years, but less quantity. One noteworthy case was the“washtub” incident off Pusan, Korea, on January 15. Townspeople saw an objectabout fifty yards offshore “about the size of a large washtub and emitting ablue-gray glow.” The sighting lasted for about ninety minutes, the objectglowing all the time, until it “apparently sank into the sea.” Meanwhile, theKorean military police arrived and alerted U.S. military police. An AmericanM.P. saw the object floating in the water for almost an hour. He described theglow as similar to flames from burning alcohol or benzene.174[index_split_259.html#filepos1505872]Very few UFOs were reported during the early months of 1956. The spring broughtmore of interest. First came the Ryan Case of April 8. American Airlines CaptainRaymond E. Ryan was en route from New York to Buffalo by way of Albany,Syracuse, and Rochester. At 10:20 P.M., near Schenectady, Ryan and his FirstOfficer William Neff saw a peculiar and very bright glow to his right, far toobright, they agreed, to be another plane. Ryan decided to veer away somewhatfrom the light, just to be safe. Instantly the object performed a ninety-degreeturn and shot ahead of them. Ryan estimated the speed at 900 mph. The objectthen paced the airliner, remaining slightly ahead. Ryan radioed Griffis AFB nearRome, New York. The base confirmed that they tracked the object, too, andscrambled two jets. By now, the plane’s passengers saw the strange light andwere uneasy.What followed was most unusual: Griffis ordered the pilots to change course andfollow the UFO. Civil aeronautic regulations did not allow for military controlof an airliner, but Ryan obeyed nonetheless. He turned his plane away fromSyracuse toward the object, which was heading northwest. Flying in the black ofnight miles off course, Ryan waited for the jets. As the object led him to theedge of Lake Ontario, it began to accelerate. Ryan wisely decided to turn backtoward Syracuse. As he approached the city, the CAA operators told him they hadno word on the jets, but that Albany and Water-town CAA operators had alsosighted the UFO. Normally, Ryan and his crew would not have been permitted toreveal their UFO chase, but since he filed no CIRVIS report, no restrictionsapplied. Thus, when the plane landed in Buffalo, Ryan and Neff spoke with aBuffalo Evening News reporter who had been tipped off. The story ran on April10, stating that the military had directed the American Airlines flight tofollow a UFO.Although no one else picked up the story, Keyhoe was onto it quickly. He triedto get an air force comment. No luck. Ryan failed to return Keyhoe’s messages,and the CAA was silent. The incident faded away for a year, until Keyhoeobtained a copy of the CAA report with a statement from Ryan in which headmitted to seeing an object but “did not deviate” from his course “at anytime.” Keyhoe’s conclusion: Ryan had been forced to lie. After more CAAstonewalling, he contacted the Buffalo Evening News, which backed the originalstory “one hundred percent.” Keyhoe threatened to take the matter to the Senate:perhaps elected representatives would question why the CAA allowed airliners tochase UFOs. After more digging, Keyhoe received a flight log from the air force,but this also stated Ryan did not deviate from his prescribed course. InKeyhoe’s thinking, “if the Ryan interview was true, there was only one answer.The Convair’s flight log had been deliberately falsified.”But was it? The answer would have remained unknown had Keyhoe not then receiveda taped recording of an interview with Ryan and Neff from April 16, 1956, a weekafter the encounter, on the show Meet the Millers. On the tape, Ryan and Neffwere crystal clear about the events. Griffis AFB, they said:> asked us our next point of landing and to identify the aircraft. I told them> Syracuse and identified the flight number. Then they told us: “Abandon that> next landing temporarily. Maintain your course and altitude. We’re sending two> jets to intercept the object.” Of the UFO, Ryan said, “This was absolutely real. I’m convinced there wassomething fantastic up there.” The ensuing detail given by the two pilots leftno doubt. Keyhoe believed that “if the Ryan story were played up, the air forcecould be accused of deliberately exposing the Convair passengers and crew” todanger. Keyhoe later tried to use the incident as a wedge to open congressionalinvestigations on UFOs, but ultimately the case fizzled out.175[index_split_259.html#filepos1506016]Reports continued to trickle out showing ongoing navy interest in the matter ofUFOs. A June 26, 1956, article from the News Tribune from Fullerton, California,reported that the navy ordered its pilots to engage UFOs in combat if theobjects appeared hostile. The navy refused to discuss the matter withjournalists, however.176 [index_split_259.html#filepos1506178]UFO sightings picked up slightly during the summer. On July 19, in Hutchinson,Kansas, a naval air station tracked “a moving unidentified object” on radar. Thestate police observed it visually as a teardrop-shaped light source. The objectmoved horizontally and vertically over much of the sky. A humanoid sighting wasreported from Panorama City, California, on July 20, by three independentwitnesses who claimed to see ordinary-looking humans with long blond hair andtight green suits. The beings were near a large ball-shaped object. Two dayslater, Air Force Major Mervin Stenvers was flying at sixteen thousand feet overPixley, California. Before he was silenced by the military, he told reportersthat his C-131-D was suddenly staggered and knocked to the right by a terrificblow of some sort. He radioed that his plane had been “struck by a flyingsaucer,” and made an emergency landing at the Bakersfield Airport.177[index_split_259.html#filepos1506318]On August 13, 1956, one of the best-documented encounters between the militaryand UFOs took place at the NATO bases of Bentwaters and Lakenheath in England.At 9:30 P.M., radar personnel at Bentwaters picked up an object moving towardthem at the astonishing speed of between 4,000 and 9,000 mph. It moved in astraight line to a position about fifteen miles northwest of Bentwaters. Withina few minutes, about a dozen normal targets were spotted eight miles southwestof Bentwaters, moving northeast at about 100 mph. In front of the targets werethree objects in a triangular formation, about one thousand feet apart.Something odd then occurred: all the targets appeared to converge into oneextremely large target, which then remained stationary for almost fifteenminutes. It resumed moving to the northeast, then stopped for a few minutes,then resumed, and was lost to radar. The entire sighting up to this point tooktwenty-five minutes.Five minutes later, another solid target appeared, flying at 4,000 mph, or more,and vanished when it moved out of range. At 10:55 P.M., another target waspicked up thirty miles to the east, traveling west at 2,000 to 4,000 mph. Itpassed directly overhead and was seen visually by both air and ground observers.Bentwaters notified Lakenheath AFB of what was going on, and Lakenheathpersonnel saw a luminous object stop, then zoom off to the east. Apparently, twowhite lights were seen joining from different directions, which were tracked ontwo radar screens at Lakenheath.At midnight, Lakenheath notified the RAF station at Neatishead, Norfolk, that astrange object was buzzing the base. A Venom night fighter, with four highlytechnically trained personnel, was scrambled. All four soon found the object onradar and saw it as a bright white light, which then disappeared. The crew foundthe target north of Cambridge; the navigator said it was the “clearest target Ihave ever seen on radar.” The object, however, was behind the plane, and stayedthere for some time, despite climbs, dives, and circling. Ground radar operatorssaid the object was glued right behind the Venom fighter. After ten minutes, thefighter headed back. The UFO followed briefly, then stopped and hovered. AnotherVenom was scrambled but experienced equipment malfunctions and aborted itsmission. The object was tracked on two radars leaving the area at 600 mph.The encounter was classified until 1969, when it was analyzed in the Universityof Colorado UFO Project, also known as the Condon Committee. It was listed asunknown and indeed as one of the most compelling of all cases. Physicist GordonDavid Thayer, who studied the incident for the project, called it “the mostpuzzling and unusual” of radar/visual cases. He suggested that “the apparentlyrational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device ofunknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting.”178[index_split_259.html#filepos1506537]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY The year 1953 had started with the Robertson Panel and a defeated faction thatopposed secrecy about UFOs. The memory of unidentified objects over the Capitolwas still fresh. Three years later not a single group within the U.S. militaryor intelligence apparatus dared to challenge a policy that became progressivelymore restrictive over divulging UFO information. Fresh outbursts of dissent didcome from outside. Keyhoe continued to be a nuisance, Edward Ruppelt took hisstand, and other big names occasionally supported the idea of UFOs asextraterrestrial. Yet, there can be no mistaking this period as repressiveregarding UFOs.The policy of repression was partly responsible for the relatively low number ofwell-documented sightings during 1955 and 1956. In several cases, civilian andmilitary pilots were muzzled after initially talking, and in the case of Capt.Raymond Ryan, CAA logs may have been falsified. It may well be, however, thatactual UFO activity did decline during those years, and it is unlikely that UFOawareness would have emerged on the strength of things seen during those twoyears. In the context, however, of the years of sightings that had precededthem, some of these remained quite compelling.Through it all, the national security apparatus retained the initiative onmanaging UFO information. Project Blue Book became inconsequential, while AirDefense Command received many of the key UFO reports. The CIA also retained aninterest in UFO reports, both domestically and worldwide, and certainly notbecause of the U-2 program. Citizen groups, meanwhile, were a peripheral andineffective lot. But in late 1956, a civilian group that was led by a core ofAnnapolis boys made a play to challenge the air force on UFOs. What the leadersof this new group, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena(NICAP), did not realize, however, was that the CIA was already on board."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6 The Fight to End Secrecy: 1956 to 1962 > I’m positive they don’t [exist]....

Althoughother civilian UFO groups had emerged in the 1950s, none challenged theauthority of the air force to have the final word. NICAP did. Founded on August29, 1956, by Townsend Brown in Washington, D.C., it soon developed into anorganization dedicated to ending UFO secrecy.Brown’s leadership was brief. As mentioned previously, he had been conductingexperiments in electromagnetism and gravity. In 1956, he joined an informalflying saucer discussion group and immediately envisioned a larger organizationto collect, analyze, and disperse information about UFO reports, and also topromote his own research. He soon appointed an acting treasurer, acquired asecretary, and obtained office space. When NICAP’s corporate charter wasapproved on October 24, 1956, Brown appeared ready for business. However, NICAPquickly ran into financial trouble. At a meeting in January 1957, Brown andNICAP member Donald Keyhoe argued openly about Brown’s leadership, and Brownresigned from the organization. Keyhoe became the new director.From the outset, NICAP was packed with navy men. Brown and Keyhoe both hadstrong navy connections and both recruited board members. As a result, NICAPstarted its existence with three admirals on its board of governors: Rear Adm.Delmar Fahrney, known in the navy as the “father of the guided missile;” ViceAdm. Roscoe Hillenkoetter, better known for having been the first director ofthe CIA; and WWII submarine commander Rear Adm. H. B. Knowles. Other earlygoverning members were Dr. Earl Douglass, Maj. Dewey Fournet, J. B. Hartranft,Col. Robert B. Emerson, Frank Edwards, Prof. Charles A. Maney, Rev. AlbertBaller, Dr. Marcus Bach, and Rev. Leon C. Le Van. Soon after, NICAP added suchpeople as Leonard Stringfield, who served as public relations director until1972, and Delbert Newhouse, of Utah film fame. This board of governors remainedremarkably stable for most of the organization’s existence.Keyhoe, however, was the driving force. Unlike Brown, he was no scientist ; hisinterests were far more political. Under Keyhoe, NICAP continued to defineitself as a collection center of UFO reports, just as Brown had wanted. But thescientific impetus that Brown had given NICAP was now replaced by the force ofKeyhoe’s personality, and the organization took on a new mission: to end UFOsecrecy once and for all.An interesting twist to the history of NICAP was that it was not merely the homeof many former navy men. Unknown to other members, a number of “ex-CIA” peoplewere also involved in the formation of NICAP. Count Nicolas de Rochefort, aRussian immigrant and scriptwriter for the Voice of America, was NICAP’s firstvice-chairman. He was also a member of the CIA’s psychological warfare staff.Bernard J. Carvalho, connected to the Fairway Corporation, one of the CIA’sdummy companies, was another early member; he later chaired NICAP’s membershipcommittee.Links to the agency continued over the years. Rochefort’s boss at CIA was Col.Joseph Bryan, who joined the NICAP Board in 1960. A bit later, former CIAbriefing officer Karl Pflock joined, chairing NICAP’s Washington, D.C.,subcommittee in the 1960s. Over the years, Pflock denied that the CIA ever askedhim for information on either UFOs or NICAP. During NICAP’s decline in the late1960s and early 1970s, more individuals associated with the CIA became involvedin the organization. Several of these were central in replacing Keyhoe asdirector, just as he began to focus on the CIA instead of the air force as thesource of the UFO cover-up.Could it be, as Pflock maintained, that the CIA had no real interest in NICAP,that the participation of these people with longtime agency connections was justa coincidence, based solely on their personal interests? Piercing endless wallsof denial can be fruitless, with the heap of evidence never leading to proof.Yet the guidelines of the Robertson Panel, still secret in 1956, emphasized theneed to monitor civilian UFO organizations. Could the most formidable of thesereally escape CIA notice? As early as 1957, CIA agents coerced NICAP advisorRalph Mayher to give them a movie film depicting a UFO, which they laterreturned with the best frames cut out. NICAP clearly elicited interest from theCIA.1 [index_split_260.html#filepos1506841]CIA infiltration aside, it is not surprising navy men predominated within NICAP,although other military personnel also provided input. In retrospect, this seemslogical. By the late 1950s, the navy was the only military branch without a UFOsecrecy directive, insofar as Keyhoe could determine. Proud navy personnelresented the heavy-handed manner typical of air force investigators. When theboard of governors met to decide NICAP’s fate after Townsend Brown’sresignation, much discussion centered on how to confront the air force. ArmyColonel and physicist Robert Emerson wanted to avoid a fight. Fahrney agreed,but added, “I’m sure many of them don’t like the [secrecy] policy.” This is notto say that NICAP had no support from air force officers; quite a few whodissented from air force policy provided what help they could. But the navy haddeveloped a history of dissenting from the air force’s management of the UFOproblem. Very likely, this was part of the navy’s larger struggle forself-assertion during the still-newly unified military of the 1950s. (The famous“Revolt of the Admirals” of the late 1940s was a fresh memory—when the navyoutspokenly pressed for a supercarrier with nuclear capability, challenging theair force’s claim to have sole possession of The Bomb.)NICAP’s inception came at a time of unquestioned air force dominance over theissue of UFOs. An air force fact sheet of the time claimed a mere 3 percentunexplained ratio, and Blue Book briefings were public relations exercises.Other services participated in clamping down on UFO information. On January 31,1957, U.S. Army Order number 30-13, “Sightings of Unconventional Aircraft,”stipulated that personnel involved in sightings would “not discuss ordisseminate such information to persons or agencies other than their superiorofficer(s) and other personnel authorized by the Acting Chief of Staff, G-2,this headquarters.” The situation appeared to be fairly well in hand, and thepresence of NICAP threatened to disrupt it.2[index_split_260.html#filepos1506980]It happened on January 16, when Admiral Fahrney (who had become chairman of theorganization after Brown’s resignation) gave a press conference to announce thegroup’s formation. “Reliable reports,” he said, “indicate there are objectscoming into our atmosphere at very high speeds and controlled by thinkingintelligences.” Many citizens, he continued, had stopped reporting UFOs to theair force because of frustration over the policy. Press coverage was good, andNICAP quickly developed a network comprised of hundreds of people throughout theU.S.3 [index_split_260.html#filepos1507176]Privately, military personnel may have been interested in working in somecapacity with NICAP. In late March 1957, Stringfield told Keyhoe that he wasworking secretly with the Columbus, Ohio, Air Filter Center at the request (andexpense) of the air force. Stringfield said the officers were “dead serious”about getting UFO reports and wanted sightings “relayed immediately—even if it’s3 A.M.” Stringfield believed the air force would “give a lot to get NICAP’sreports,” if Keyhoe would do it privately. Keyhoe rejected the idea, but NICAPdid offer the air force its cooperation in investigating and solving the UFOriddle. The problem was that NICAP’s eight-point plan was a genuine attempt toget to the bottom of the UFO question, something the Air Force clearly was notinterested in doing—at least not in conjunction with NICAP.4[index_split_260.html#filepos1507426]Publicly, the Pentagon quickly moved to discredit NICAP. In early April, the airforce launched a press attack against NICAP and UFOs. Brig. Gen. Arno Leuhman,director of air force information, told the press that flying saucers were adead issue:> Our Intelligence checks out everything. The funny reflections you see at> night, the lights from the rear end of jets, the meteorological balloons,> everything including the hoaxes. There’s no valid evidence that there are> flying saucers. An unnamed air force spokesman at that time also ridiculed NICAP as an “upstartorganization” and insisted that the air force had explained all but 3 percent ofsightings. The same month, however—on April 8, 1957—Maj. Gen. Joe Kelly, airforce director of legislative liaison, answered a question from Representative(later Senator) Lee Metcalf of Montana. Kelly denied that the air force muzzledpilots or concealed UFO reports. “Answers are provided on any unidentifiedflying objects,” wrote Kelly, “which have attracted national attention.”Surprisingly, Kelly admitted that air force interceptors still pursuedunidentified flying objects “as a matter of security to this country and todetermine the technical aspects involved.” He quickly added that flying objectshad so far “imposed no threat” to U.S. security.5[index_split_260.html#filepos1507572]Not surprisingly, many of NICAP’s early reports came from the navy, somedirectly through Fahrney. One example (of which an identical report was givenindependently in 1958 to NICAP advisor Lou Corbin), concerns an incident thattook place in 1953. According to the report, a squadron of carrier-based NavyAD-3s had been practicing offshore combat maneuvers. As Keyhoe described it,when the planes reformed:> an enormous rocket-shaped machine swooped down over them. Swiftly decelerating> to their speed, it leveled off a thousand feet above the squadron ... the> pilots spread out ... and climbed at full throttle toward the giant spaceship.> The huge craft turned sharply ... and with a tremedous burst of power it shot> into the sky, vanishing in seconds. Three air force intelligence officers were flown to the carrier, and an airforce colonel grilled the navy men. Without consulting the carrier captain, hewarned them “to forget what you saw today! You’re not to discuss it withanyone—not even among yourselves!” However, since no navy order backed up theair force colonel, the report leaked to Fahrney.6[index_split_260.html#filepos1507724]In May, NICAP nearly printed a phony UFO crash story that was said to take placein the Everglades, based on an account it received by AP wire. The crash storystruck Keyhoe as too sensational to be credible, and he checked directly withAP, which acknowledged that, while the wires looked genuine, the story was“definitely fake.” The company traced the story to an AP employee who had been“a former Signal Corps engineer” familiar with teletype systems. The employeeadmitted to faking the stories, refused to give any motive, and stubbornlydenied involvement of anyone else. This was pretty strong stuff when Keyhoepublished the account in 1960. But neither Keyhoe nor anyone else knew at thattime that Shamrock—an operation run by the NSA, formerly by the Signal Corps—wasintercepting electronic transmissions on a daily basis throughout the U.S. andabroad. Evidently, Shamrock was also spreading disinformation relating to UFOs.7[index_split_260.html#filepos1507868]The preceding incident becomes more interesting when we note that in November1956, Air Force Director of Intelligence John Samford succeeded Julian Canine asDIRNSA. Like Cabell, Samford was a general who assumed an even more prominentrole in the world of intelligence after spending time on the UFO problem. WhileCabell was the number two man at the CIA, Samford now became the number one manat the NSA, America’s most secretive intelligence agency. Samford was only oneof three people who knew all the details of Shamrock. Is it simply a coincidencethat NICAP was nearly discredited by a phony AP story, planted by a “former”Signal Corps member, just months after Samford took charge of the NSA? Hardproof of the NSA’s involvement will surely never surface, but considering NSAactivities and capabilities from 1957, a little AP disinformation would havebeen child’s play.8 [index_split_260.html#filepos1508010]"},{"pageContent":"CREATING ZOMBIE ROOMS UFOs, of course, were by no means the only secret of the U.S. government. By1957, the CIA’s MK-Ultra program had moved six drugs into active use. InFebruary, Sid Gottlieb organized field trials of psilocybin (the activeingredient of hallucinogenic—“magic”—mushrooms) for injection into nine blackinmates at the Addiction Center in Lexington, Kentucky. At the end of February,Dulles approved Ewen Cameron’s application for mind-control experiments to beadministered at McGill University in Montreal, funded through the Society forthe Investigation of Human Ecology, a CIA cutout organization. Cameron, the mostprestigious psychiatrist in North America at the time, coined the terms“depatterning” and “psychic driving” to describe what he did to people. He wasalso a leading proponent of “psychic surgery,” that is, lobotomies. Cameronimmediately began serious work on sensory deprivation and created a “sleeproom.” This was a dimly lit dormitory of about twenty beds where patients weredrugged, given electroshock, and lobotomized. The nurses aptly called it “TheZombie Room.” The importance of keeping this grisly work off American soil wasself-evident, hence its location in Canada. The Canadian government, as far asanyone can determine, was unaware of these activities. At the same time, U.S.Army Intelligence, in conjunction with the Army Chemical Corps and the CIA,began using drugs such as LSD and PCP on their subjects (something Cameron wasdoing as well) at the Medical Research Laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal. Thefocus of their testing was on unwitting test reactions.9[index_split_260.html#filepos1508161]At around this time, the Soviets made a noteworthy medical breakthrough, in thiscase better assassination techniques. The new method involved a small metalcanister that contained a firing device which would spray poisons in the form ofthe vapor. Once inhaled, the vapor quickly caused death by contracting the bloodvessels, as in a cardiac arrest. After death, the blood vessels quickly relaxedso that an unsuspecting pathologist would conclude the victim had died of anordinary heart attack.10 [index_split_260.html#filepos1508353]"},{"pageContent":"WORLDWIDE MILITARY AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERS During late 1956, UFOs were tracked on military radar stations around the world.In August and September, Danish radar tracked several moving at 1,800 mph. OnOctober 26, two American jet fighters collided above the sea near Okinawa asthey tried to identify several unknown objects detected by radar. Japanesefishermen rescued one pilot; the other one died.11[index_split_260.html#filepos1508498]An air force cat-and-mouse game with a UFO took place sometime in late 1956 atCastle AFB in California. Control tower personnel spotted a luminous ellipticalobject, and two interceptors closed in. The object eluded them by using cloudcover, but the pilots saw it at various angles and as close as a few hundredyards. It appeared to be a flattened circular shape. Ground radar tracked theobject, and the pilots obtained weak returns before the object accelerated away.Several officers arrived from another base to debrief the pilots and appearedvery knowledgeable of UFOs. They sought “confirmation, not information,” andtold the pilots not to discuss the sighting at all, not even with each other.Citizens who had seen the episode were told that the pilots had been chasingducks or geese. UFO researcher Richard Hall, who reported this incident, addedthat he personally knew of many instances in which military witnesses weredebriefed by officers who displayed detailed knowledge of UFOs.12[index_split_260.html#filepos1508655]On November 21, at the port of Kobe, Japan, a customs official and a maritimesafety station officer heard an explosion as they walked along the pier. Theysaw something resembling fireworks on the bay and two balls of fire, whirlingand then submerging.13 [index_split_260.html#filepos1508794] In “the Far East”in December, two USAF jet pilots obtained strong radar returns from an objecttwenty miles away, “at least as large as a B-29 four engine bomber.” Flying at750 mph, one of the pilots got to within eight miles of the signal and saw it asa round object, about three hundred feet in diameter, exactly where radar showedit to be. Suddenly, strong interference jammed his radar. Using anti-jamprocedures, he reestablished a lock-on and continued to close. The UFO thenaccelerated so quickly that his radar could not read it accurately, though heestimated its speed at 2,000 mph. This report, dated February 1957, went all theway up the chain of the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, and was leaked to NICAPby “a member of air force intelligence.” While it was not officially classified,it remained unknown to the public for about a year. When the United Press ranthe story on October 1, 1957, the air force press desk issued “no comment.”14[index_split_260.html#filepos1508937]Air force jets were also scrambled at least once during a multi-day UFO sightingnear Pierre, South Dakota, from November 24 to 25, and possibly longer. At onepoint during this series of sightings, state police chased the object. OnDecember 13, 1956, a Swedish ship radioed harbor control at La Guaira,Venezuela, that a bright, cone-shaped object had fallen vertically into the seaoff the Venezuelan coast. It gave off “strange glares,” and when it hit thewater, the crewmates heard an explosion, and the sea became brilliantly colored.After the colors subsided, a boiling motion continued to disturb the sea. OnJanuary 21, 1957, shortly before the army UFO secrecy order, army intelligencereported a sighting of a “large shiny metal ball” and other objects over APOArmy base. On March 23, 1957, another object plunged into a Venezuelan body ofwater, Lake Maracaibo.15 [index_split_260.html#filepos1509087]A number of civilian pilots reported UFOs in the coming months. On March 8,1957, a pilot flying near Baudette, Minnesota, saw a luminous circular objectflying against the wind. It was about twenty feet in diameter and flew so lowthat it appeared to suck up the snow. The next day, at 3:30 A.M., a pilot flyinga DC-6 off Florida saw a bright UFO coming toward his plane; he estimated it tobe “at least the size of a DC-3.” His evasive action threw some passengers fromtheir seats, injuring a few, and ambulances met the plane. Other pilots alsoreported the object. Miami Air Traffic Control sent a “Flash” to the CivilAeronautics Board which described the near collision:> Pilot took evasive action, object appeared to have a brilliant greenish-white> center with an outer ring which reflected the glow from the center.... Above> description fits what seven other flights saw.... Miami reports no missile> activity.... Original reports of jet activity discounted. The story received some press coverage, and the CAB, required by federal law toinvestigate, began a thorough check. Without waiting for a CAB opinion, however,the air force quickly explained the object as a shooting star. Although the CABlisted the case as unsolved, it mattered little, as most press accountsmentioned only the air force debunking.16 [index_split_260.html#filepos1509278]In Long Beach, California, on March 23, 1957, large numbers—perhaps thousands—ofpeople, including three Ventura County deputy sheriffs, saw four strange flyingobjects. They appeared to be large, round, and flashing a brilliant red light.CAA radar tracked them, and by midnight, air force personnel at Oxnard AFB alsosaw them. When an F-89 was sent to pursue, the objects climbed and swiftlymaneuvered away. Because there was no CIRVIS report, the incident did not fallunder JANAP restrictions, and news about it quickly leaked out. The toweroperator said the first object> was moving much faster than anything I’d ever seen. About forty miles away, it> came to an abrupt stop and reversed course, all within a period of about three> seconds. Each object was tracked moving thirty miles in thirty seconds, or 3,600 mph.Keyhoe and NICAP tried to get the Oxnard report, and were referred to the 4602ndIntelligence Squadron, which in turn told Keyhoe that only Air ForceHeadquarters could release it. Although NICAP had the tower operator’s report,he was no longer inclined to jeopardize his career by talking.17[index_split_260.html#filepos1509455]Another radar tracking of a UFO occurred on April 4 in Wigtownshire, Scotland,when three radar posts tracked an object which moved across the sky at sixtythousand feet, dived to fourteen thousand feet, circled around, and sped away.On April 19, members of the Kitsukawa Maru, a Japanese fishing boat, saw twometallic silvery objects descend into the sea. They estimated the size to beabout thirty feet long, with no wings of any kind. As the objects hit the water,they created “a violent disturbance.”18 [index_split_260.html#filepos1509614]Sightings of landed UFOs with humanoid occupants were reported in Argentina,Pennsylvania, and France in May 1957. The sightings did not differ in essentialsfrom those of the great wave of 1954. The French sighting of May 10, forexample, involved a man who was riding a bicycle on the Miraumont-Beaucourt roadin France. At 10:45 P.M., he saw a bright light and four human-shapedsilhouettes less than five feet tall. He ran off the road and found a path tothe home of some friends. He arrived in a panic, and four others returned withhim. They all saw a luminous object, pulsing red and white, and threesilhouettes with huge heads. The people watched for twenty minutes, during whichtime they were joined by another person. Finally, a car approached, and thelights went out; after it passed, a light appeared just above the road. It roserapidly and silently at a forty-five-degree angle and was gone.19[index_split_260.html#filepos1509791]"},{"pageContent":"NICAP AND THE U.S. SENATE In July 1957, NICAP learned that the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Investigationswas considering hearings on UFOs and wanted NICAP’s assistance. Keyhoe contactedseveral board members for advice; Hillenkoetter suggested withholding the bestcases, at least initially. “Just give them a good, strong sample of theevidence. There’s nothing wrong in reserving something for the hearings.” Keyhoedecided to ask Ruppelt to join NICAP’s board of directors. Ruppelt was now anengineer with Northrop Aircraft, a major air force contractor, and—some NICAPmembers feared—under pressure to keep quiet. Nevertheless, Keyhoe caught up withRuppelt at a rehearsal for the I’ve Got a Secret television program, whichfeatured an episode about UFOs. Ruppelt said NICAP was doing a fine job, andKeyhoe mentioned the rumors about air force pressure. “It’s not true,” Ruppeltsaid. “Would I be here if it was?” On the show, he stated that 20 percent ofsightings were unsolved while he was on Blue Book. Afterwards, Keyhoe invitedRuppelt to join NICAP’s board. He added, “We won’t load you with work, Ed. Wemainly want your advice and your help in our fight against the censorship.”Ruppelt agreed, and considered it “an honor.” Keyhoe stressed the workload for areason: Ruppelt had recently had a heart attack. Ruppelt wasn’t obese, and wasonly thirty-four at the time. Three years later, he would be dead of a secondheart attack. Did Ruppelt have a pre-existing medical condition that put him atrisk? It would be helpful to learn the reasons for these multiple heart attacksat such a young age, but no researchers have offered any idea.20[index_split_260.html#filepos1510000]In mid-July, Keyhoe met with the Senate Chief Investigator Healey regarding airforce secrecy about UFOs. Keyhoe spoke strongly about the cover-up and the“silence group.” He showed Healey the Grudge Report, released by the air forcein December 1949. Keyhoe appears to have persuaded Healey that most of theanswers to the report’s 244 cases were “sheer speculation” or “deliberatelyfitted.” He also presented Gen. Joe Kelly’s letter to Lee Metcalf, indicatinggenuine air force interest in UFOs and conceding that pursuits of UFOscontinued. There is no question that some senators took UFOs seriously. ArizonaSenator Barry Goldwater wrote to one of his constituents on August 31, 1957,that “I, frankly, feel there is a great deal to this.”21[index_split_260.html#filepos1510143]During the summer of 1957, the Air Defense Command disbanded the 4602nd andreassigned UFO investigating duties to the 1006th Air Intelligence ServiceSquadron (AISS). (Clark has the 4602nd disbanding a year sooner.) Soon after,the air force reduced funds for the 1006th, impairing its investigative ability.Meanwhile, the army reimposed a UFO secrecy order in August, after NICAPprotests had prompted its removal the previous spring.22[index_split_260.html#filepos1510306]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMER 1957: CRASHES, NEAR COLLISIONS, OPENING FIRE, AND SILENCE As NICAP confronted the air force over UFO secrecy, sightings and encountersoccurred worldwide. One of the classic radar-visual UFO cases took place on July17, 1957. A six-man crew, including three electronic warfare officers, wasflying a USAF RB-47, equipped with state-of-the-art electronic intelligencegear. The crew obtained a strange radar signal over Mississippi, at firstthought to be an anomaly. Soon, however, they saw an intense blue light movingtoward them very fast. Before they could take evasive action, the objectstreaked by in front of them. For many hours, the crew continued to see theobject while obtaining multiple air and ground radar signals (including groundradar from an air force unit in Duncanville, Texas). The object’smaneuverability was extraordinary: at one point it stopped suddenly and theRB-47 flew past it; at another point it easily pulled away when the RB-47accelerated to 550 mph; at yet another point it blinked out visually and onradar simultaneously, then reappeared a little later. All instruments werefunctioning perfectly, and the experienced crew was extremely uneasy about theirescort. After accompanying the crew for eight hundred miles, the UFO disappearedover Oklahoma City. Air Defense Command intelligence and Blue Book investigatedthe encounter, although no printed account appeared before the Condon report of1968. Condon Committee investigator Gordon David Thayer declared the caseunexplained, and later described the official air force explanation (“airliner”)as “literally ridiculous.”23 [index_split_260.html#filepos1510482]On the same day as the RB-47 incident, an airliner one hundred miles east of ElPaso nearly collided with a UFO “at least the size of a B-47.” Two passengerswere injured and hospitalized; no known aircraft was near.24[index_split_260.html#filepos1510641]On July 24, it appears, Soviet anti-aircraft batteries on the Kouril Islandsopened fire on UFOs. According to a Reuters news dispatch:> Last night, the batteries of the Kouril Islands have opened fire on UFOs.> Japanese authorities have reported that the whole of the Soviet artillery was> in action and that powerful searchlights were searching the sky. The guns have> fired again in the morning. The U.S. Air Force stated that no American craft flew near Soviet coasts. RadioMoscow quoted the U.S. communique and stated that the objects fired upon wereluminous, flew very fast, and none had been hit. Although the encounter may wellhave happened as indicated, we must recall that the KGB spent immense sums ondisinformation, that no information left the Soviet Union without statesanction; also that the Americans could easily have been lying about notviolating Soviet airspace—U-2s did this all the time. Still, Americans pursuedUFOs, and at times attempted to down them, so why not the Soviets?25[index_split_260.html#filepos1510780]More sightings occurred in Brazil. On August 14, near Joinville, Brazil, a Varigairlines pilot saw a domed disc which affected the aircraft engines. Humanoidreports continued, including a July 25 incident by a professor at the CatholicFaculty of Law in Sao Sebastiao, and a September sighting of a domed disc andthree normal-sized humanoid occupants who collected samples. Then, on September10, 1957 (approximate date), according to an anonymous letter sent to aBrazilian journalist, there occurred another “crash” incident. Near Sao Paulo,in the town of Ubatuba, several people saw a disc dive down and explode,showering the area with flaming fragments. The anonymous correspondent mailedsome small samples, which were soon analyzed by associates of Brazilian APROmember Dr. Olavo T. Fontes. The tests showed the fragments to be of apparentlypure magnesium. The Condon Committee later rejected the fragments as not pureand determined that they “could have been produced by earthly technology knownprior to 1957.” No one explained where the fragments could have come from,however.26 [index_split_260.html#filepos1510974]During the final phase of a U.S. Air Force training flight on September 19-20,1957, an amazing UFO encounter occurred, reminiscent of the RB-47 case from twomonths earlier. Many of the details of this encounter are unavailable, as theincident never made it to the Blue Book files. While in flight, a B-25 crewpracticed locating ground radar and turned on their ECM (electronic countermeasure) equipment. They were surprised to learn that it was being jammed, firston one frequency, then another. Just then, a glowing white UFO was seen from thecockpit and played “tag” with the aircraft for several hundred miles. Groundradar picked up the B-25 and UFO separately, with visual maneuvers matching whatwas seen on radar—both of the plane and on the ground. Upon landing, the entirecrew was questioned by Air Defense Command intelligence personnel, whoconfiscated all ECM equipment and in-flight wire recordings. The story onlysurfaced ten years later, when the University of Colorado, under contract toinvestigate the UFO phenomenon, stumbled across it during a meeting with airforce personnel. One of the attendees happened to be the plane’s pilot (now acolonel); project investigators checked with the copilot and radar operator, whoconfirmed the story.27 [index_split_260.html#filepos1511197]"},{"pageContent":"SPUTNIK AND A BIZARRE GLOBAL WAVE Mankind formally entered the space age on October 4, 1957, when the Soviet Unionlaunched Sputnik, the first man-made satellite. Scientifically and historicallyspeaking, this was an achievement of the first magnitude, and caused a greatcommotion worldwide. In the United States, a better word would be panic.Sputnik also kicked off the first major UFO wave since 1954. Faced with anunexpected barrage of UFO reports, the air force dismissed them as confusion,misidentification, and even hysteria caused by Sputnik. But although the wavebegan in October, it did not reach the United States until November. MostAmericans did not know that this wave of sightings was global.The first incident of the wave is perhaps the most remarkable of all. Itinvolved a series of incidents involving Antonio Villas-Boas, atwenty-three-year-old farmer living near Sao Paulo, Brazil, and culminated inthe first unmistakable alien abduction report. On the night of October 5, in thebedroom he shared with his brother, Boas saw that a bright light from an unknownsource had lit their room. He saw a silvery glow in the yard, but no object. Thelight moved and passed over the house. On October 14, Boas was plowing the fieldat night with his brother. Between 9:30 and 10 P.M, the two saw a light as largeas a “cartwheel,” about three hundred feet above the ground. It shined anextremely bright, pale red light over the field, so bright that it hurt theireyes. Then, suddenly, the light moved “with enormous speed” to the opposite endof the field and stopped. Apparently not in a state of terror, Boas followed it,but the light returned to its original position. Boas said this maneuverhappened at least twenty times. Then, the light simply disappeared “as if it hadbeen turned off.”Boas plowed the field alone the following night—one might wonder why. At 1 A.M.,he noticed a red object in the sky approaching him slowly. Then it moved veryrapidly directly over his position, and hovered at about 150 feet. It gave offblinding light, and Boas was terrified. After a few minutes, the object divedforward to a position about forty feet in front of his tractor, and he discerneda large object with three metal legs, and something on the top that rotatedrapidly. His tractor had been running all the while, but now the engine diedwhen he tried to drive. Boas ran. After a few steps, his arm was caught by asmall being in strange clothes. Boas gave the being a strong push and continuedto run, but was captured and dragged into the craft by three others.Boas later gave an exceptionally detailed description—about eight thousandwords—of the inside of the craft and its occupants, who wore tight, whiteclothing with a light on their belt, white shoes with no heels, large gloves,and opaque helmets with a slit at the level of the eyes. Boas claimed he wasstripped naked and subjected to a medical examination in which one of the beings“spread a liquid all over my skin.” He was led to another room where the beingstook some blood from his chin, then left him alone briefly. He noticed anunpleasant odor, “as if a thick smoke was stifling me,” and he vomited in acorner of the room. After what seemed like an eternity, an alien female enteredthe room, entirely naked. She was beautiful, considering that she was an alien:blond hair that was “nearly white” and parted in the center, large, slanted blueeyes, a well-formed straight nose, small but ordinary ears, high cheekbones, anda pointed chin. Boas described her body as “much more beautiful than any I haveever seen.” Her height was short, but not extremely so, perhaps four-and-a-halffeet. Like the others, the alien woman spoke with unintelligible, “guttural”sounds. She seemed amused by Boas’s look of amazement. She embraced Boas andmade no mistake as to her intention. Boas became “uncontrollably” excited andwondered whether the liquid that had been spread on his body contributed tothis. The two had a normal sexual encounter, considering the circumstances, andthe woman “reacted as any other woman would.” Of course, considering that thewoman was an alien, a few cultural discrepancies presented themselves. Boas saidthat “some of the growls that came from her at certain times nearly spoiledeverything, as they gave me the disagreeable impression of lying with ananimal.” She also never kissed him, but instead bit him softly on the chin. WhenBoas attempted a second act, the woman became uninterested and soon left. Hefelt used, like “a good stallion to improve their stock.” Just before she left,said Boas, she turned to him, pointed to her belly, then pointed to thesouthward sky.He soon received his clothes and dressed, and returned to the room where threecrew members sat in swivel chairs, communicating among themselves. Boas laterdescribed the furnishings and equipment in detail. One of the beings led him outof the craft, and Boas watched the door close and legs retract. The craft roseslowly to about one hundred feet, hovered, and became brighter. It created anincreasingly loud buzzing sound, and the top began to rotate at a terrificspeed. The craft then took off “like a bullet.” As Boas said, “these peoplereally knew their business.” By now, it was about 5:30 A.M., and Boas had beenaboard for over four hours.At first, Boas told only his mother, but soon wrote to a magazine that hadpublished articles on flying saucers. From there the story reached Dr. OlavoFontes, APRO’s man in Brazil, who persuaded Boas to visit him, expecting to triphim up. Instead, Fontes found Boas poised, “perfectly normal,” with no signs ofemotional instability or mystical tendencies, and “extremely intelligent.” Underquestioning, Boas revealed embarrassment over the sexual experience, which hehad not mentioned in his letter to the journalist. Boas also held a “down toearth” view of the aliens themselves:> [He] did not think that the crew were angels, supermen, or demons. He believed> them to be human beings such as we are, only coming from other countries on> some other planet. He declared that because one of the crew . . . pointed to> himself, then to the earth, then to some place in the heavens .... Boas gave descriptions of such detail, and presented his encounter with suchlevelheadedness and plausibility, that Fontes wrote a detailed report to theLorenzens. Initially, they tried to explain the encounter as sexual fantasy butnever quite convinced themselves. Finally, in 1962, they published a truncatedversion of the experience, and then fully in 1965. Boas eventually became alawyer and made no public appearance until 1978. Then, as before, his sincerityseemed beyond argument.28 [index_split_260.html#filepos1511356]More Brazilian encounters were reported throughout October and November,describing sightings of humanoids and landed craft, in one case a reportedhealing of a girl near death from cancer by two short beings dressed in white.29[index_split_260.html#filepos1511596] On the night of November 3-4, the day thatthe Soviets launched Sputnik II, carrying a dog named Laika, another BrazilianVarig plane encountered a UFO, just as one had on the preceding August 14. Thistime, Capt. Jean V de Beyssac and his copilot saw an object zooming in towardtheir plane at 1:30 A.M. It caused several of the plane’s systems to burn out,forcing them to head back.30 [index_split_260.html#filepos1511804]On the next night, a truly remarkable incident occurred, involving Brazilianarmy personnel at Fort Itaipu. A circular, orange-glowing object about onehundred feet in diameter descended silently. With no visible beam, it gave offintense heat at two sentries, and other soldiers saw it quickly ascend out ofsight. The burned soldiers were isolated and hospitalized for weeks with first-and second-degree burns over more than 10 percent of their bodies. The fort wasplaced under martial law, discussion of the encounter was prohibited, and a topsecret report was prepared. The Brazilians contacted the American embassy forhelp in the investigation, and within days, U.S. Army officers appeared in thecompany of Brazilian air force personnel. They questioned the two victims andother witnesses. Amazingly, Olavo Fontes learned of the incident andinvestigated before the month ended. Initially, he found only the two soldiersbut within two years had located other witnesses who corroborated the originalstory in all details.31 [index_split_260.html#filepos1511969]Brazil was not the only country claiming a great deal of UFO activity. Aclose-up sighting of a UFO craft was reported in France on October 31. Severalreports came from Korea and South Africa early in November, including a November1 description of an attempted intercept by a South African air force jet pilotwho climbed to forty-five thousand feet, but was still unable to reach whatappeared to be a hovering machine.32 [index_split_260.html#filepos1512148]In late October or early November—the exact date is unknown—a UFO sighting tookplace in the Australian outback country of Maralinga, not far from AliceSprings. In the late afternoon, following three recent nuclear detonations, aBritish RAF team was preparing to return to the U.K. when, according to DerekMurray (later a Home Office photographer), a man rushed in to report a UFO.Others laughed but went outside to see an object with a flat base and dome ontop, of silvery blue metal. Because they had an extremely clear view, they alsodiscerned several squarish portholes across the center. The object tilted atforty-five degrees and hovered. “It was perched there like a king on his highthrone looking down on his subjects ... it was a magnificent sight.” Thesighting lasted for fifteen minutes, until the object shot up out of sightwithout a sound. The RAF men were astonished. British researcher Jenny Randleswrote:> Murray could, of course, be telling lies, but there is absolutely no reason to> suppose so. He says, “I swear to you as a practicing Christian this was no> dream, no illusion, no fairy story—but a solid craft of metallic> construction.”33 [index_split_260.html#filepos1512307] On the eighth, four Australian government astronomers at Mount StromloObservatory saw a UFO too slow to be a meteor, and neither Sputnik 1 nor 2. Theassistant director, Dr. A. R. Hogg, thought the unknown object could have beencircling the Earth like an artificial satellite. The same day, in Edinburgh,Scotland, fourteen people reported to the police that a disc-shaped objectfollowed their truck, dived toward it, came within sixty feet of them, then lefttoward the sea, leaving a double vapor trail. On November 22, in Gesten,Denmark, a shop owner saw a pyramid-shaped, luminous, transparent object flyrapidly across the road. Although it was over a tenth of a mile distant, heclaimed to see two figures who looked like human beings sitting behind oneanother aboard the craft.34 [index_split_260.html#filepos1512451]"},{"pageContent":"NOVEMBER 1957: A RASH OF AMERICAN SIGHTINGS On October 31, 1957, Donald Keyhoe met with Healey again, who informed him thatthe air force had made “a strong attempt to disprove your claims.” Meanwhile,the UFO wave hit the United States, concentrating mainly in the South andSouthwest, especially Texas. An interesting feature of this rash of sightingswas the widespread reports of electromagnetic (EM) effects on automobiles. Fortwo weeks in particular, newspapers reported many UFO cases that affected carignitions, radios, and lights. Less well known is that various sightings ofaliens or humanoids occurred through December.35[index_split_260.html#filepos1512618]At 3:30 A.M. on November 2, just west of the town of Canadian, Texas, militaryand civilian witnesses reported a red and white submarine-shaped object atground level, two or three times as long as a car and about ten feet high. Afigure and possibly a white flag were near it; when a car stopped nearby, theobject flashed a light, and the headlights failed.36[index_split_260.html#filepos1512759]The best-known sighting of the wave, however, occurred on the night of November2, in Levelland, Texas. Pedro Saucedo and passenger Joe Salav were driving atruck along Highway 116 toward Levelland. An immense, glowing object swept downover their truck and landed on the highway. Their engine died, and they heardfaint clanking or hammering, as well as what sounded like unintelligible voices.The object itself was quite large: about two hundred feet long anddirigible-shaped. After three minutes on the ground, it rose swiftly andnoiselessly, glowing brilliant red, and flew away. Levelland was buzzing withUFO reports all night. Sheriff Weir Clem and his deputy, Pat McCulloch, reportedthe Saucedo-Salav incident to the air force and believed that they saw the sameor a similar object a short time later as they investigated another UFO report,their fourth that night. Other reports from Levelland also described alow-flying object, over two hundred feet long, equipped with a bright light, andwhich interfered with car engines. In some cases, people claimed the objectlanded on the road.37 [index_split_260.html#filepos1512900]Later that night, in White Sands, New Mexico, two men on army patrol in a jeepsaw a bright, controlled object about 150 feet above the ground near the site ofthe first atomic bomb explosion. The object descended to ground level afterabout three minutes and landed a few miles away at the northern end of thetesting grounds.38 [index_split_260.html#filepos1513075]After Levelland, the deluge. In Elmwood Park, Illinois, at 3:15 A.M. on November4, two police officers and a third man were looking for the cause of a headlightfailure. At that moment, a luminous object descended about two hundred feet fromthem. The car headlights functioned properly again, and they drove toward theobject but had to stop at a cemetery wall. They turned off all lights andwatched the object for two more minutes. In Alamogordo, New Mexico, later thatday, White Sands engineer James Stokes watched an elliptical UFO swoop over themountains as his car stalled. Stokes told reporters the object “was at leastfive hundred feet long. As it passed over, I felt a wave of heat.” He estimatedits speed at between 1,500 and 2,500 mph. Because of Stokes’s training and hisposition, the story circulated widely.39 [index_split_260.html#filepos1513216]The wave continued on the fifth. In addition to the many sightings reported bycivilians, one involved the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Sebago. The ship was in theGulf of Mexico when it tracked an object on radar reaching 1,000 mph at onepoint and which stopped in midair. Four crew members saw the object visually asa bright, glowing, circular craft. Before the Pentagon expressed awareness ofthe incident, the story made the press.40 [index_split_260.html#filepos1513391]Sightings were even stranger the next day, and a few included claims of seeinghuman-looking occupants of UFO craft. Late that night in Montville, Ohio, atwenty-eight-year-old plasterer named Olden Moore was driving home when he sawan object that looked like a bright meteor split into two pieces, one of whichwent straight up. The other became larger while its color changed from brightwhite to blue-green. It hovered about two hundred feet above a field and landedwith a soft whirring sound, perhaps five hundred feet away. Moore watchedcautiously for fifteen minutes, then approached. What he saw was unforgettable.The object was shaped like “a covered dish” and fairly large: about fifty feetin diameter, fifteen feet high, with a cone on top about ten feet high. Itpulsated slowly, and a haze surrounded it. Moore reported his flying saucersighting to the sheriff the next morning, and a civil defense directorinvestigated the site. He found high levels of radioactivity, two perfectlyformed deep holes six inches in diameter, and unusual footprints that “came fromnowhere and went nowhere.” In the investigator’s opinion, “a foreign objectlanded in that field.”The Moore sighting was of exceptionally high quality, and the air force noticedit. After his encounter, Moore disappeared for a few days. When he returned, herefused to say where he had been, but eventually told his wife and friends thatthe air force had taken him to Washington, D.C. Much later, to a private UFOinvestigator, Moore stated that on November 10, the sheriff, deputy, and an airforce officer appeared at his house and asked to take him to Youngstown, Ohio,for an interview with the military. Moore agreed, and the group first took himto the field where he saw the UFO, an unsettling experience for him. He thenwent by helicopter to Youngstown. A week later, an air force car with twoofficers returned; this time Moore was flown to Washington, D.C., for extendedquestioning (the flight stopped at Wright-Patterson AFB to exchange an officer).Moore was under constant observation while in Washington, and several groups ofpeople interrogated him. They showed him slides and still photos of UFOs, andeven presented a UFO movie film taken from inside a military aircraft. Moore wastold the objects must be extraterrestrial, and signed a document swearing him tosecrecy. He never tried to make his story public. His interviewer, C. W Fitch,got to know him well as an honest man involved in his church.41[index_split_260.html#filepos1513609]On the morning of November 9, an Eastern Air Lines captain saw a large UFOhovering over Lafayette Airport in Louisiana. In his words, “the Air DefenseCommand in Baton Rouge was on the phone, waiting for our report, when we landedthere.” During the evening of November 10 in Hammond, Indiana, hundreds ofpeople saw a rocket-shaped machine race overhead. The police followed it, andthe captain said a loud beeping sound blocked the radio reception; residentsalso reported radio and television failure as the UFO passed by. On theeleventh, airline passengers near Los Angeles saw an elliptical UFO below theirplane.42 [index_split_260.html#filepos1513787]Another intriguing UFO event of this wave occurred on November 13, when anobject exploded over the State Hospital at Crownsville, Maryland. Burned piecesof metal fell on hospital grounds, were checked for radiation, and confiscatedby army intelligence officers from Fort Meade. The materials were said to berelayed to Air Research and Development in Baltimore, where an ARD colonel toldNICAP member Lou Corbin he had no idea what the metal was. From there, at leastsome of the material was flown to ATIC, although ATIC’s deputy director deniedever hearing about it. Fort Meade was the site of the NSA’s headquarters.43[index_split_260.html#filepos1513973]Despite the density of sightings and nature of the reports, the Blue Bookinvestigation consisted of one man from the 1006th who took two trips toquestion witnesses (ignoring the majority of them), stated incorrectly thatlightning had been in the area at the time, and blamed it all on weather. OnNovember 14, the air force explained the Levelland case as ball lightning, theStoke report as a hoax inspired by the Levelland case, and the Sebago case ascaused by confused radar men who mistook ordinary plane blips for a UFO. Menzelsupported the air force conclusions and added that the wave of sightings was“tied in with the sensitization of people to the Sputniks.” The Levelland casewas a mirage, he said, and the stalled car merely the result of a nervous footon the accelerator. An FBI report from November 12 also adhered to the Sputniktheory, noting the “great increase in the number of flying saucers and otherUFOs” reported by people across the country.44[index_split_260.html#filepos1514124]The air force also issued another fact sheet titled “Air Force’s 10-Year Studyof Unidentified Flying Objects.” This denied the existence of flying saucers,emphasized the absence of a threat to U.S. security, and claimed an unidentifiedrate of 2 to 3 percent.Not everyone lined up to agree with these conclusions. A journalist friend ofKeyhoe read the air force list of explanations of UFOs. When he came to “largeCanadian geese flying low over a city at night, with street lights reflectingfrom their bodies,” he asked, “Don, how dumb do they think people are?” “Youshould see the full list,” Keyhoe answered.45[index_split_260.html#filepos1514375]Edward Ruppelt entered the picture, taking issue with Donald Menzel’sconclusions about Levelland. A mirage, he said, was not the answer. “There issufficient evidence of flying saucer existence to warrant furtherinvestigation,” he told reporters. Moreover, Ruppelt said, Blue Book hadreceived several electrical interference reports when he was chief. He urged theair force to “stop playing mum.” Lincoln La Paz also reversed his judgment ofthe Levelland and Stokes sightings, which he initially said were caused byfireballs. In the midst of the wave, he stated his belief that they were notfireballs or celestial phenomena.46 [index_split_260.html#filepos1514532]The press reported general perceptions not in accord with the air force line. ANovember 7, 1957, article from the Times of El Paso noted:> Some of the nation’s top scientists are “pretty shook up” about the mysterious> flying objects sighted in New Mexico and West Texas skies this week, said> Charles Capen (a scientist at White Sands). “This is something that hasn’t> happened before.”47 [index_split_260.html#filepos1514767] Keyhoe, meanwhile, wanted to dispute the air force conclusions openly. He knew,for example, that the crew of the Sebago had not merely tracked a UFO on radar,but had seen it visually—something not mentioned in the air force summary of theincident. But even though Keyhoe had lined up three Sebago witnesses for publicstatements, each one withdrew his permission to use his name in the Senateinvestigation. One witness, a pilot, told Keyhoe, “I’m sorry, but I’ve got afamily and my job to think about.”48 [index_split_260.html#filepos1514906]UFO sightings dropped off after mid-November. A reported landing occurred onDecember 8 in Woodward, Oklahoma, when a UFO allegedly took complete control ofa car with three passengers. The driver, an employee of an aircraft company,said the object caused his heater, windshield wipers, and radio to fail, and theengine just stopped. Above the car, a disc-shaped object, about fifty feet indiameter with portholes around the edge, emitted hot air and a high-pitchedsound. As it rose, the car started by itself. In a sequence reminiscent of theOlden Moore case, the man spent four hours with two Kirtland AFB officers whotold him of similar observations; but the case was never reported to Blue Book.On December 12, a radar-visual sighting of a multicolored UFO occurred in Tokyo,causing jets to be scrambled. On the eighteenth, Dr. Luis Corrales, of Caracas,Venezuela, made a time exposure on a photographic film to record the passage ofSputnik II. He succeeded and photographed a second trail alongside it, thenveering away, then returning to pace it. Detailed analysis disproved doubleexposure, scratches, internal reflections, or other debunking explanations.49[index_split_260.html#filepos1515051]One last report of note surfaced in 1957. Like the Villas-Boas case, it is oneof the few abduction reports in the pre-Hill era. It also seemed to describe atype of being—the so-called Grays—that became common in later years. The storyis sketchy in the extreme and was reported on December 11, 1957, at least fiveyears after it supposedly took place. A man serving in the U.S. Army in Austriaclaimed to have been paralyzed by a humanoid being, taken inside a UFO, andflown (he believed) to another planet. He saw other humans who did notacknowledge his presence. He was then returned to his base. This report receivedno thorough investigation, and there was no mention of the man’s name.50[index_split_260.html#filepos1515231]The wave did not make a dent in the Blue Book record. Despite the amazingactivity that had occurred, Blue Book acknowledged a mere fourteen unidentifiedsightings for all of 1957, less than 2 percent of the 1,006 reports it received.In truth, for the past two years, AISS had completely taken over ATIC’s job ofanalyzing UFO reports. Moreover, by the end of the year, the wave was all butforgotten by the public.51 [index_split_260.html#filepos1515370]"},{"pageContent":"THE AIR FORCE PARRIES NICAP Although records are never complete, it appears that from 1958 to 1963, AmericanUFO sightings waned significantly. Air force fact sheets became less frequent,and simply restated the position of November 1957. Not everyone took the airforce seriously. On January 16, 1958, a writer for Life magazine stated that“during the ensuing year there will be authenticated sightings of roughly twohundred Unidentified Flying Objects, of which the Pentagon will be able todisprove 210.”52 [index_split_260.html#filepos1515534]NICAP membership grew. By 1958, it reached five thousand, although theorganization was always strapped for cash. Meanwhile, elements within the U.S.Senate pondered the UFO question. In January 1958, the Senate Subcommittee onGovernment Operations (headed by Sen. John McClellan) asked to meet withrepresentatives from the secretary of the Air Force Office of Legislative Action(SAFLA) to discuss the possibility of holding open hearings of the air force UFOprogram. The air force feared “uncontrolled publicity,” but agreed to go along.Very soon, however, Richard Horner, the air force assistant secretary forresearch and development, persuaded the subcommittee chief counsel, DonaldO’Donnell, that hearings were “not in the best interest of the air force,” nornecessary for national security. Blue Book, said Horner, had the situation wellin hand. Horner also told Sen. Barry Goldwater that month that allegations aboutthe air force withholding information about UFOs were “entirely in error.”People who reported UFOs, stated Horner, simply wanted confidentiality, and theair force respected that.53 [index_split_260.html#filepos1515707]"},{"pageContent":"KEYHOE CENSORED ON TELEVISION On January 22, 1958, Donald Keyhoe appeared on the popular CBS television showArmstrong Circle Theater for a program titled “UFO—Enigma of the Skies.” He hadbeen invited as a guest in December, along with Kenneth Arnold, C. S. Chiles,Edward Ruppelt, Donald Menzel, and an air force representative, Col. SpencerWhedon from ATIC. Keyhoe wondered why the air force would subject itself to abarrage of questions so soon after the November sightings. He learned the reasonfrom CBS representative Irve Tunick: the entire event was to be scripted andpreapproved by the station, in conjunction with the air force itself. Would theTremonton, Utah, film be shown? asked Keyhoe. No, said Tunick, the air forceexplained it as seagulls. “You told me,” said Keyhoe, “this wasn’t a censoredprogram.” “It’s not,” replied Tunick, “but we can’t buck them on thosepictures.”Keyhoe’s notes juxtaposed key UFO cases with implausible air force claims andadded statements from William Lear and Hermann Oberth. His main thrust, however,struck at the heart of UFO secrecy: he planned to refer openly to four keydocuments and events still officially denied. These were the 1947 ATIC (Twining)letter, the 1948 Estimate of the Situation, the 1952 air force intelligenceanalysis of UFO maneuvers (led by Dewey Fournet), and the Robertson Panel ofJanuary 1953. Keyhoe submitted his script, expecting “minor editing.” Instead,CBS edited out his key points, with the explanation that the script was toolong. After Keyhoe threatened to bolt from the program, CBS appeared to give inand said he could tighten the script himself, then phone in the changes.When Keyhoe arrived at the studio for rehearsals, he saw that all his effortswere wasted: his changes had not been made, and his statements about hiddendocuments were still absent. He angrily told the show’s producer, RobertCostello, that “the air force is censoring this program!” “No,” said Costello,“but they deny there ever were any such conclusions. If we let you say it,they’ll stand up and deny it.” “Let them,” said Keyhoe. But Costello’s answerremained no. Keyhoe then tried a different tactic: he now wanted to use thecases that the air force had officially cleared for him in 1952. This madeTunick unhappy. “Even if the cases were cleared,” Tunick said, “the air forcewill try to refute them now. We’d never get a final script.” Keyhoe by now wasthoroughly exasperated. He was down to six items CBS agreed to: statements byGoldwater, Oberth, and Lear, plus three UFO cases not involving the U.S. AirForce. One was a 1954 U.S. Marine Corps sighting, another involved the RAF, andthe third was a November 1954 Brazilian airliner case. Now, even these sightingsbecame a problem. Whereas Tunick had earlier agreed to use them, he now shookhis head. It was “too much to cover.” Keyhoe prodded and got the real reasonfrom Tunick: “the Armstrong Company won’t stand for an open battle with the airforce.”Kenneth Arnold was on the set and overheard the exchange. “It’s a raw deal,” hetold Keyhoe. “I’m having trouble too; they won’t let me make any changes.” Twodays later, Arnold pulled out of the program and advised Keyhoe to do the same.“The way it’s rigged,” he said, “the air force will make you look like a fool.”By then, Ruppelt and Chiles had also backed out of the program—in Chiles’s case,specifically due to pressure from his employer, Eastern Air Lines. In Ruppelt’scase, no reason was offered. With all these vacancies opening up, Keyhoe triedto get Hillenkoetter on the show, but the show’s management said no.During the show itself, Colonel Whedon denied air force censorship over UFOs andgave the standard explanations. Keyhoe then presented his piece—“a skeleton of astory,” as he put it later, forcing himself to read the lines of theteleprompter. Suddenly, on the air nationwide, his frustration vented. Hestated, “And now, I’m going to reveal something that has never been disclosedbefore.” That was the end of Keyhoe’s announcement. Without his knowledge, themain microphone switch was turned off. Keyhoe continued:> For the last six months, we have been working with a congressional committee> investigating official secrecy about UFOs. If all the evidence we have given> this committee is made public in open hearings, it will absolutely prove that> the UFOs are real machines under intelligent control. A more distant microphone did transmit this statement, but television listenerscould hear Keyhoe only by turning up their volume controls. Most did not.Minutes after Keyhoe was cut off, Air Force Assistant Secretary Richard Hornerstated on television that> there has been a mistaken belief that the air force has been hiding from the> public information concerning unidentified flying objects. Nothing could be> further from the truth. And I do not qualify this in any way.... There is no> evidence at hand that objects popularly known as “flying saucers” actually> exist. After so crudely silencing the air force’s most determined opponent, Horner’sstatement carried little weight for many viewers. Callers swamped CBS, askingwhy Keyhoe’s sound had been cut.Although he was in an excellent position to exploit the situation, Keyhoeinexplicably declined to do so. He briefly considered giving the deletedparagraph to the media, and of discussing the air force pressure on the program.He “reluctantly gave up the idea,” he said, because it would put the networkproducers on the spot. They were also “victims of official pressure.” Withindays of the program, CBS admitted to air force censorship. In response to acomplaint by a member of NICAP, the CBS director of editing, Herbert A.Carlborg, stated:> This program had been carefully cleared for security reasons. Therefore, it> was the responsibility of this network to insure performance in accordance> with predetermined security standards.... As a consequence, public interest> was served by the action taken in deleting the audio on Major Keyhoe’s speech> at a point where he apparently was about to deviate. It was a sign of the times that even APRO criticized Keyhoe for deviating fromthe script. Yet, the Armstrong Theater program had raised a question that couldnot be erased: if there was nothing secret about UFOs, why did the program haveto be cleared for security, and why was Keyhoe’s audio cut?54[index_split_260.html#filepos1515870]In the aftermath of the program, more official statements were released thatconceded UFO secrecy. On January 23, 1958, Capt. G. H. Oldenburgh, informationservices officer at Langley AFB in Virginia, wrote that “the publicdissemination of data on Unidentified Flying Objects . . . is contrary to airforce policy and regulations.”55 [index_split_260.html#filepos1516056] A fewdays later (1/28/58), Congressman William H. Ayres (R-Ohio) admitted to a NICAPmember that> Congressional investigations have been held and are still being held on the> problem of unidentified flying objects and the problem is one in which there> is quite a bit of interest.... Since most of the material presented to the> committees is classified, the hearings are never printed. When conclusions are> reached, they will be released if possible.56> [index_split_260.html#filepos1516214] Within the military, interest in UFOs remained high. Earlier in January,Lackland AFB in San Antonio had asked for Keyhoe’s permission to use his 1955book, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, to develop a script for closed-circuitbroadcast throughout the base. Keyhoe was surprised and gave his assent.57[index_split_260.html#filepos1516365]"},{"pageContent":"THE SENATE STOPS ITS INVESTIGATION Shortly after the Armstrong Theater program, the air force revised AFR 200-2 andre-created the system of air base commanders conducting initial investigationsof UFO sightings in their areas. It also continued ATIC’s formal UFOresponsibility for analysis and evaluation and stated that “air force activitiesmust reduce the percentage of unidentifieds to the minimum.”58[index_split_260.html#filepos1516506]At the same time, Keyhoe phoned Senate Subcommittee Chief Investigator Healey,whom he told that the Armstrong Circle Theater really had been censored, andcutting Keyhoe’s audio was not just an accident. Healey acknowledged thatseveral congressmen were inquiring about the UFO investigation. When they met afew days later, Healey told Keyhoe the air force was now claiming the ArmstrongTheater program “proved there are no such things as flying saucers.” Keyhoe thengave Healey the facts of the Ryan case of 1956, which strongly pointed totampering with the CAA and CAB reports. By air force order, said Keyhoe, pilotsRyan and Neff did follow a UFO, regardless of what the official documents said.Healey remained incredulous until Keyhoe told him he had the tape to prove it—hehad recently obtained the highly incriminating tape of Ryan and Neff from Meetthe Millers. Keyhoe knew full well that a complete transcript of the Ryan-Neffinterview would be a convincing document. He felt confident about his chancesfor the moment and offered to get a transcript to Healey and McClellan.59[index_split_260.html#filepos1516664]A month later (3/8/58), Keyhoe appeared on a Mike Wallace television interview.Without Keyhoe’s knowledge, the air force gave Wallace key information whichWallace announced on the show. “The air force told us,” said Wallace, “the[Senate] subcommittee members have already talked with them and they show nointerest in any hearings.” That was news to Keyhoe. It must be false, he said.It was true, however. While Keyhoe was angry, Hillenkoetter was philosophical:“What counts is that NICAP is still operating. Losing one battle isn’t fatal.” Afew days later, two letters from the McClellan committee to NICAP membersconfirmed that it did “not intend to investigate the United States Air Force.”60[index_split_260.html#filepos1516818]What had happened? It appears that air force pressure succeeded when argumentsfailed. By late March, NICAP began a new campaign to open another government UFOinvestigation. This time it approached the Department of Justice, the NationalSecurity Council, the CIA, and the U.S. Army. Not surprisingly, it receivedrebuffs and denials.61 [index_split_260.html#filepos1516963]NICAP was stalled, but still trying. The organization obtained a formalstatement in May 1958 from Dewey Fournet that confirmed (1) the 1948 Estimate ofthe Situation and (2) his own 1952 intelligence analysis of UFOs, which arguedthat they exhibited signs of intelligent control. Since the air force had beendenying the existence of both of these documents, this was helpful to NICAP’sarsenal. Keyhoe learned that spring from a source that Gen. Nathan Twining,still chairman of the JCS, was concerned about UFOs, and about what to tell thepublic.62 [index_split_260.html#filepos1517104]There was reason to believe this was true. On April 9, 1958, the air forcefinally released parts of the Robertson Panel report, undoubtedly due in part tothe pressure that Keyhoe’s television appearance had created. Why not seek aninterview with Twining, thought Keyhoe. He wrote a letter to Twining andreceived an answer in May from Executive Officer Col. John Sherrill. Sorry, nointerview, but Sherrill wrote cryptically:> No effective means have been developed for the establishment of communication> by radio or otherwise with unknown aerial objects. The technical obstacles> involved in such an endeavor, I am sure, are quite obvious to you. Keyhoe’s letter to Twining reverberated in the Pentagon. In June, an air forceofficer met secretly with Keyhoe. The officer gave him three UFO reports, thenwarned him that the air force was going to ask him “for certain UFO information.Think it over carefully before you decide.” NICAP could be in trouble, theofficer warned, and NICAP “must have something that has upset the Pentagon.” Twodays later, an air force request did arrive. Keyhoe’s recent letter to Twininghad indicated NICAP had files indicating intelligent maneuver by UFOs, and theair force wanted these cases. Keyhoe wondered, the air force already had manygood cases. Why desire NICAP’s hidden cases? In light of NICAP’s recent tanglewith the air force, there only seemed one reasonable answer: in order todisprove the cases and silence the witnesses. NICAP refused the air forcerequest.63 [index_split_260.html#filepos1517243]In June 1958, Richard Hall joined NICAP as an associate editor. Hall had been inthe air force and, since that time, “had accumulated a large file of verifiedUFO evidence.” He impressed Keyhoe with connections to serious UFO investigatorsand soon established a prominent place for himself in NICAP, eventually asNICAP’s acting director in the 1960s.64 [index_split_260.html#filepos1517411]The Lackland AFB request reached an interesting point in late spring of 1958. OnMay 16, the base’s chief of education planning, Maj. Warren Akin, publiclysuggested that UFOs were spacecraft. Then, in June, Keyhoe finally received wordfrom the base. They had prepared a seventeen-page script based on a verystraightforward interpretation of his book and conclusions. It even included the1953 Kinross case, which involved the loss of an F-89 over Michigan in pursuitof a UFO, and a comment that rehearsals at the base were to begin immediately.The script itself stated that “the most logical explanation is that the saucersare interplanetary. This is the only answer which meets all the known criteria.”Elsewhere, it stated:> Acting in the best interests of the public of the United States of America,> the federal government in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force has carefully> concealed information which was thought to be of danger because of the> impending possibility of hysteria and panic which could result in an economic> collapse and dissipation of our social structure. Once again, Keyhoe was astonished. Why do this? he wondered. Baffled butinterested, he approved the script, then did not hear another word from the basefor six months, when the script was shot down without explanation. 65[index_split_260.html#filepos1517556]"},{"pageContent":"RUPPELT IS TURNED In June 1958, Ohio Representative John E. Henderson, after reading EdwardRuppelt’s Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, sent a list of UFO questions tothe air force. Blue Book responded with a special, comprehensive briefing forHenderson and other interested congressmen. Afterwards, the congressmenexpressed confidence in the air force UFO program and agreed that publicitywould be “unwise . . . particularly in an open or closed formal congressionalhearing.”66 [index_split_260.html#filepos1517701]Ruppelt, however, proved to be a problem to the air force no longer. Already, onMay 6, 1958, he had written to NICAP member George Stockey of his strong supportfor Blue Book:> ... I have visited Project Blue Book since 1953 and am now convinced that the> reports of UFOs are nothing more than reports of balloons, aircraft,> astronomical phenomena, etc. I don’t believe they are anything from outer> space. How could Ruppelt have performed such a swift and complete about-face ? Stockeyoffered his own opinion in a letter he wrote to Keyhoe in early June. Ruppelt,wrote Stockey, “works for an aircraft corporation which has got contracts withthe air force. While they might not order him to reverse his opinion, obviouslythey could make their desires known.” Or, in fact, they might have ordered himto reverse his opinion. Keyhoe concluded sadly that Ruppelt had buckled to airforce pressure. Seen in relation to the strong air force pressure on severalfronts of the UFO problem during 1958, Keyhoe’s conclusion seems correct.Ruppelt’s public statements during the November 1957 wave had beenstraightforward and completely contradictory to the air force position. He hadunquestionably become a serious problem for the air force. The only conclusioncan be that sometime near the airing of the Armstrong Theater program in lateJanuary 1958 someone had gotten to Ruppelt.Researcher Jerome Clark called this interpretation possible but argued that “inabsence of evidence to this effect, it can only be speculative explanation.” Hesuggested an alternate scenario, offered by Ruppelt’s widow, that Ruppelt’sexposure to southern California contactees helped to sour him on the UFOphenomenon. Yet, while direct evidence for air force pressure is lacking, itremains the most probable reason. Could crazy contactees really have souredRuppelt within the two months between November 1957 and January 1958, when hebacked out of the television program?67 [index_split_260.html#filepos1517842]"},{"pageContent":"1958: AMERICA BECOMES A UFO-FREE ZONE Perhaps the subheading overstates the case somewhat, but by 1958, the UnitedStates was generating very few UFO reports. Matters were different elsewhere,where more people reported UFOs at close range, as well as the occasional UFObeing. Australia provided several such reports. On January 13, in Farm Hill, afrightened young man claimed that a dome-shaped craft followed him for aboutthree miles, a mere thirty feet above the ground, and perhaps 150 feet away. Itthen flew silently by, interfering with his radio. On February 2, in New SouthWales, Australia, witnesses reported an elliptical UFO with two “porthole-like”markings.68 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518011]For most of 1958, however, South America was where the UFO action was,especially Brazil. For years, this region had seen its share of bizarre UFOactivity. Now, on January 16, 1958, one of the best-documented UFO sightingstook place at Brazil’s Trindade Isle. While aboard the International GeophysicalYear naval survey ship Almirante Saldanha, many people saw a gray, metallic, andsolid-looking object, partially enveloped in a green haze. A ring ran throughits midsection, making it resemble the planet Saturn. A professionalphotographer took three photographs, which the Brazilian navy ministry subjectedto careful analysis before pronouncing the negatives and photos genuine. Underthe order of Brazil’s president, Juszelino Kubitschek, they were released to thepress with a statement that the photographed object was not a meteorologicalobject, balloon, or a U.S. guided missile. A Brazilian naval source later toldOlavo Fontes that the day before the sighting, the ship’s radar had tracked anunknown object at 2:30 A.M. Many years later, the photographer stated that justbefore the object appeared, the ship lost electrical power.This incident received a great deal of attention in Brazil, and that nation’sHouse of Representatives demanded an investigation from its navy. The navycomplied and delivered a top secret report of its investigation to the Congress.That document in turn leaked in late 1964 to Coral Lorenzen. The report’s authorconcluded that> the existence of personal reports and photographic evidence, of certain value> considering the circumstance involved [absence of evidence of tampering, the> presence of other witnesses], permit the admission that there are indications> of the existence of unidentified aerial objects. Compelling evidence notwithstanding, Menzel and the U.S. Air Force each supplieda debunking explanation.69 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518168]Trindade Isle was the best known, but by no means only, UFO report that yearfrom South America. Most of these were reported by private citizens throughoutthe continent, many were at close range by multiple witnesses (including lawenforcement), several involved automotive electrical disturbances and intenseheat, a few included sightings of humanoid beings, and one involved an objectwith portholes hovering over the sea for more than an hour. On May 5, in SanCarlos, Uruguay, a veteran pilot reported “intense heat and electromagneticeffect” from a disc-shaped UFO that hovered over his plane near the CurbeloNaval Base. On July 22, 1958, a major blackout occurred in Salta, Argentina,while a large UFO was observed.70 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518355]In Brazil, the banks of the Peropava River in Iguape (near the Sao PauloProvince), became the location of a UFO sighting on the afternoon of October 31,1958. Twelve people heard a loud roar overhead, accompanied by metallic clankingsounds. A shiny disc, about fifteen feet in diameter and four feet thick at thecenter, approached the river erratically. The people watched the craft crashinto the trunk of a palm tree, gouging out a notch. It hovered briefly over theriver, then plunged in. The river was fifteen feet deep at the point of entry,and very muddy. A loud hissing noise followed, and bubbles surged up. Police andinvestigators interviewed witnesses and, for two weeks, searched in vain for thecraft.71 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518568]Elsewhere in the world, UFO activity was considerably less intense. On January26, 1958, in Shimada City, Japan, several chemical workers saw a very brightobject land, and claimed that beings fell from the sky without parachutes. Theywore strange suits and spoke an unknown language. In Korea on March 8, Americanair force radar tracked a slowly descending UFO. On April 11, a Danish fighterpilot near Jutland saw a UFO formation. The objects accelerated away when hetried to close. The pilot’s commanding officer then broadcast an appeal toDanish citizens to report any strange flying object they saw. On August 3, alarge section of Rome, Italy, was blacked out while a luminous and large UFOmaneuvered overhead. In Switzerland on August 16, about a dozen people were outon Lake Leman in perfect weather when they saw a bright light descending. Theystopped their boat as the object hovered fifty feet over them. It looked like aclassic flying saucer: about thirty-five feet in diameter, an upper half with acabin and windows, and an outer spinning portion. The craft was silent andcreated a current in the water as it approached. After several “leaps,” it flewoff at an amazing speed.72 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518712]An incident somewhere in the Soviet Union was said to have occurred on November17, at 10 P.M. A bright object, with an apparent diameter greater than that ofthe full moon, was observed for two minutes descending from a high altitude,hovering at tree height, then landing. CIA files record a UFO incident along theSoviet-Indian border that took place on December 6, 1958. According to thefiles, an “artificial object having a continuous brightness of magnitude” wasseen through a telescope traveling north to south. Although the observeroriginally thought the object was Sputnik III, “subsequent observations proved[this to be] negative.” The report requested an evaluation by the Air ForceOffice of Special Investigations. Regarding the report’s distribution, it noted“Field dissemination: none.”73 [index_split_260.html#filepos1518963]Meanwhile, in America, all was quiet, and Blue Book files listed only tenofficially unidentified sightings for all of 1958. Although some of thisprobably reflected an actual drop-off in UFO activity, the greatly increasedcensorship also contributed. One NICAP report described an encounter during thesummer at an unnamed air force base in the southwestern United States, in whichtwo maneuvering UFOs evaded jet interceptors. At Offutt AFB in Omaha, Nebraska,on September 8, an air force major and other officers saw a rocket-like UFOaccompanied by satellite objects.74 [index_split_260.html#filepos1519115] TheCIA also maintained an interest and genuine puzzlement over UFOs. On October 1,1958, an unknown author of a CIA memo wrote of a civilian who had managedrepeatedly to photograph “geometrically shaped flying objects as they passedbetween his telescope and this moon.” These photos were “remarkably clear andcertainly indicated a phenomenon for which he had no ready explanation.” Thewriter requested advice on “how we might get our hands on these materials toexamine them firsthand and to make a more complete analysis of them.”75[index_split_260.html#filepos1519272]Perhaps the most interesting event in America from 1958 occurred on October 26in Lock Raven, near Baltimore. Two men saw a large, disc-shaped object, aboutone hundred feet wide, hanging between 100 and 150 feet off the top of a bridgeover a lake. They drove to investigate and reached to within seventy-five feetof the object. At that point, the car’s electrical system died, and one of themen felt a burning sensation. The object rose vertically and quicklydisappeared. Investigators uncovered corroborating testimony from several otherwitnesses, and Blue Book announced it as unexplained. Another interesting casetook place on the afternoon of November 3, in Minot, North Dakota, when a mastersergeant and medic named William Butler saw a bright green object shaped like adime. He also saw a smaller, silver object. The first object exploded, whereuponthe second object rapidly moved toward the location of the first one. The entiresighting lasted one minute; it remained unexplained by Blue Book.76[index_split_260.html#filepos1519443]"},{"pageContent":"THE MCCORMACK COMMITTEE FIASCO AND AFTERMATH Although UFOs were scarce in 1958, NICAP continued to make waves. During thesummer, after Congress had adjourned, Keyhoe learned from a congressman thatNICAP was “in a big fight—big league.” The congressman warned Keyhoe: “Don’t letup for a second. Keep boring in with facts, facts, more facts, and you’ll breakthis open.” Keyhoe never got the chance to do so. In August, Congressman JohnMcCormack’s House Subcommittee on Atmospheric Phenomena (part of the HouseSelect Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration) requested a briefing onUFOs. McCormack wanted an extended hearing in closed secret session, unrecorded,with all witness names held in confidence. Even this level of secrecy wasinsufficient for the air force. Instead, Blue Book Captain Gregory persuaded thesubcommittee to allow the air force to give a briefing, while allowing outsidepeople like Menzel, Ruppelt, and Keyhoe to offer their opinions. NICAP as awhole should be ignored, he emphasized. The subcommittee took therecommendation, and the main witnesses turned out to be official air forcepolicymakers such as Gregory and Tacker. The subcommittee commended Gregory forhis presentation on Blue Book’s “improved” methods. Of the outsiders invited,only Keyhoe opposed the official air force line, and his effect seems to havebeen nil.77 [index_split_260.html#filepos1519642]The McCormack committee was Captain Gregory’s final service toward debunking anddefusing the UFO problem. In October 1958, Maj. Robert Friend succeeded him asBlue Book chief. Friend was a trained physicist and less hostile to UFO reportsthan Gregory. Although he improved Blue Book’s filing methods, and supportedchanging Blue Book policies toward greater acceptance of UFO reports, hereceived little outside support. About this time, an air force fact sheet statedthat recent refinements in its investigative procedures had reduced unsolvedsightings to 1.8 percent. The refinement came mainly from lumping “probable” andeven “possible” cases into “identified.” The fact sheet also mentioned theRobertson Panel for the first time publicly, although it passed over the Panel’srecommendation regarding UFO debunking. 78 [index_split_260.html#filepos1519843]During the fall of 1958, air force intelligence officers ordered a staff studyto reevaluate its UFO program and public relations. The staff labeled Keyhoe a“political adventurist” and stated—incorrectly—that Ruppelt was affiliated withNICAP. The two represented “a formidable team from which plenty of trouble canbe expected.” This had been true a year earlier, when Ruppelt still opposed theair force line, but it was certainly true no longer. In any case, the staffdecided that the air force lacked credibility regarding UFOs, needed to respondmore quickly to reports, and needed to become more sophisticated in its UFOinvestigations. ATIC tentatively approved the plan, but the air force droppedit. The study’s recommendations, which were simultaneous with air force claimsof greater sophistication regarding UFO investigations, show perfectly that theair force deliberately lied to Congress regarding UFOs, and that Congressallowed itself to be duped with frightening ease.79[index_split_260.html#filepos1520009]"},{"pageContent":"FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE The failure of Congress to do anything productive about ending UFO secrecy didnot reflect the wishes of citizens who were directly affected by it. On December22, 1958, came the report that 450 airline pilots had signed a petition—alas,futile—protesting the official policy of debunking UFO sightings. This was anextraordinary and unheard-of development. One pilot described the policy as “alesson in lying, intrigue, and the ‘Big Brother’ attitude carried to theultimate extreme.” Of the signatories, over fifty had personally reported UFOsightings (!) but had been told by the air force they were mistaken. Even so,the air force still warned them that they faced up to ten years in prison underJANAP 146 if they revealed details of their sightings to the media.80[index_split_260.html#filepos1520154]The ability of the air force and its allies to disable the movement against UFOsecrecy was most impressive. It was certainly not above playing dirty pool: backin 1957 someone—most probably the NSA—was behind the attempt to feed NICAP falseinformation in order to discredit it. During 1958, the air force exertedheavy-handed, but effective, control over television to censor Keyhoe, was deftand deceptive in managing the press and Congress, and—in the case ofRuppelt—seems to have disabled a key individual who threatened its position onUFOs. Not a bad year.The trend continued in 1959. In retrospect, it is astonishing that Keyhoeentertained the idea of besting his nemesis, “The Silence Group.” He was goingup against an organization that was into much more than he could dream of. Thehorrific experiments conducted by the army and CIA at Edgewood Arsenal andMcGill University, unchecked by any responsible authority, only got worse. By1959, LSD was a sideshow compared with another chemical: quinunclidinylbenzilate, or BZ. Incredibly, this drug possessed effects far more profound thanLSD and which lasted for three days, although effects lasting as long as sixdays occurred at times. Between 1959 and 1975, an estimated 2,800 U.S. soldierswere given BZ at Edgewood Arsenal. About this time, Jose Delgado invented adevice he called the stimoceiver. This was a miniature depth electrode able toreceive and transmit electronic signals over FM radio waves. By stimulating acorrectly positioned stimoceiver, an outside operator could wield a surprisingdegree of control over the subject responses.81[index_split_260.html#filepos1520293]Writing of such developments in a book about UFOs is no mere exercise inparanoia. Such tools of mind control, developed and used by the Americannational security state, show what these official branches of the Americangovernment were capable of. We must assume that inventions such as Delgado’swere not merely drawing room experiments done for reasons of pure science.Inventions such as these had to be field tested. Against whom? Probably, as wehave seen elsewhere, against hapless prisoners, minorities, and unsuspectingpatriotic soldiers. It is maddening but true that the full dimension of thishistory will never be revealed. We shall never know whether an important orprominent person really died from an ordinary heart attack at just the wrongtime. We can never know if someone lost their mind because of the inscrutableworkings of their brain chemistry, or because the CIA made them lose it. BecauseAmerica’s official culture pretends that such realities do not exist, evenstating these as possibilities places one into the crackpot paranoia category ofpublic discourse. But the fact is that from the 1950s onward, and withincreasing effectiveness with each passing year, America’s national securitygroups developed effective, and wholly secret, means of disabling individuals aswell as large groups.All this is a separate issue from whether or not such techniques were ever usedagainst people in the UFO field. Surely, however, if the government deemed itfit to experiment upon patriotic and trusting soldiers, may one at least assumethey would have had fewer qualms about using such means against irritating pestswithin the UFO arena? We must realize, of course, that in matters such as this,“proof” will never, ever arise. One is left only with suspicion.By 1959, President Eisenhower himself had many suspicions over the motives andactivities of this sprawling national security apparatus. In February, heexpressed his reservations about American nuclear strategy to Gordon Gray, hisnational security assistant and alleged MJ-12 member. If we blow up the SovietUnion, said Ike, “there just might be nothing left of the Northern Hemisphere.”Eisenhower’s qualms aside, he did little or nothing to stop the train, whichreceived a strong push on January 1, 1959, when Fidel Castro led his triumphantprocession into Havana. Just hours before, American-backed dictator FulgencioBatista had fled into exile with $300 million in cash, mainly bribes fromHavana’s Mafia-run gambling casinos. Castro soon made himself America’s PublicEnemy No. 1 by expropriating about $1 billion in American assets, possibly thesingle most popular act in Cuban history, but the one which earned him decadesof assassination attempts by the CIA. With a communist amid America’s longtimerealm of control, there was no way on earth Eisenhower could consider slowingdown America’s national security locomotive.82[index_split_260.html#filepos1520448]Back to the matter of UFOs. The recent air force successes had prompted its hopeof cleansing itself once and for all of this issue and eliminating the UFO frompublic consideration. One noteworthy civilian UFO organization, Civilian SaucerIntelligence of New York, folded in 1959. In February 1959, the air force heldseveral policy meetings to review the UFO situation and ATIC’s overall approach.Hynek brought together several ATIC and Blue Book staffers in a series ofmeetings. They agreed to phase out the phrase “unidentified flying objects” andto reevaluate their older cases “in light of greater scientific knowledge.” Ofcourse, this simply meant retroactively debunking previously unexplainedsightings. The group met at various intervals during the year and trailed off in1960.83 [index_split_260.html#filepos1520588]"},{"pageContent":"SOME THOUGHTS ON J. ALLEN HYNEK84 [index_split_260.html#filepos1520753] Considering Hynek’s later reputation as the “Galileo” of UFO research, hiscomplicity in publicly debunking UFOs for years cannot be ignored. Hynek’s ownjustification is well known: in order to retain access to official UFO reports,he could not afford to risk an open confrontation with the air force. Hynek madethese claims as a matter of self-defense, years after the fact in the 1970s,after he had been criticized by nearly everyone in the UFO field as an air forcelackey. That this was Hynek’s reputation in the 1950s and 1960s seems all butforgotten today.Jacques Vallee worked very closely with Hynek for years during the 1960s andeventually concluded that “the air force kept Hynek around only as long as hewas silent.” This is certainly true. The question is, why did Hynek keep silent?Was it because he was an unassertive type of person—that is, because of afeature of his personality? Nearly all UFO researchers who have written aboutHynek say, in effect, yes, for all of his scientific virtues, he was not afighter—an unfortunate but all too human weakness.A detached analysis of the historical record does not justify this conclusion.Generally speaking, Hynek was a genial man who did not seek out openconfrontations. This, in fact, was one of the important traits that made himvaluable to national security interests. In the first place, Hynek was much morethan a mere civilian scientist who “helped out” the air force. From 1942 to1946, Hynek took a leave of absence from Ohio State University to work at theJohns Hopkins University in Silver Springs, Maryland. While there, he was incharge of document security for the highly classified project sponsored by thenavy to develop a radio proximity fuse. Along with radar and the atomic bomb,this is often considered one of the three great scientific developments of thewar. The device was a radio-operated fuse designed to screw into the nose of ashell and timed to explode at any desired distance from target.85[index_split_260.html#filepos1521015]Many scientists, of course, performed work for the defense establishment duringWorld War Two. But Hynek’s project was of considerable importance, and it doesnot appear that his main contribution was scientific: after all, he was anastrophysicist. Rather, one of his main efforts was in a security-related area.Vallee kept a diary during the period that he worked with Hynek. It waspublished in 1992 as Forbidden Science, long after Hynek was dead and enshrinedas the “father of scientific ufology.” When read with care, Vallee’sobservations make it clear that there was much more to J. Allen Hynek thaninitially met the eye. And yet, the UFO research community has continued toignore the implications, and even the plain facts, that Vallee related.For example, rumors had abounded through the 1960s that Blue Book was a publicrelations facade, and that there was a “secret study” of UFOs going on. Vallee,too, had his suspicions and broached this subject with Hynek every so often.Hynek inevitably rejected such opinions without reservation. Blue Book, Hynekmaintained, was the real thing, albeit a project that was being doneincompetently. Vallee was never quite convinced. He noticed Hynek’s cageyattitude about UFOs, that he seemed to know much more than he usually let onabout the subject, that he often appeared to be more interested inself-promotion than actual study of the problem, and that his personal recordswere in a state of near disaster. Then Vallee found the infamous “PentacleMemorandum” in Hynek’s office. This was a highly classified document fromJanuary 1953, proving the existence of a separate study group of UFOs, andurging that the Robertson Panel be delayed until they had come to their ownconclusions. Very strong stuff. In the mid-1960s, there was still no inklingamong the wider public that there was any such study as this. Understandably,Vallee agonized before broaching this topic.On another occasion, a colleague of Vallee and Hynek showed Vallee “some veryinteresting photographs taken from an airplane.” Here is the relevant passage:> “Do you know who took these? Allen did! But he hasn’t recorded the place, the> date or the time....” It turns out Allen was aboard an airliner when he> suddenly noticed a white object at his altitude, seemingly flying at the same> speed as the plane. He made sure it wasn’t a reflection and he convinced> himself it must be some faraway cloud with an unusual shape. He pulled out his> camera “to see how fast he could snap pictures.” In all, he took two pairs of> stereoscopic photographs and gave it no more thought. The photographs themselves appeared in a book authored by Hynek and Vallee in1975, The Edge of Reality. They may or may not be of a flying saucer, but theyare certainly not clouds. The importance of stereoscopic photographs cannot beoveremphasized. Such a camera is of outstanding evidentiary value. Hynek, ineffect, had captured a possible Holy Grail on film. But what happened? Valleecontinued:> Fred only learned about this a few weeks later. But then Hynek had lost the> negatives and one shot from every pair was missing.... Naturally the loss of> the negatives makes it impossible to determine whether it was really a cloud> or not. Fred is indignant: “Sometimes I have the feeling Allen doesn’t want to> know,” he says. Hynek, who had headed document security for the proximity fuse project, “lost”one (and only one) negative from such a set as this. One might well wonder, towhom did he actually pass this material?During another conversation, Hynek mentioned to Vallee that the air force hadsent him a new contract draft. He did not know whether or not he should sign itand gave it to Vallee to read. Vallee wrote:> The contract, I was surprised to read, was not really with the air force but> with the Dodge Corporation, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill. “What’s McGraw-Hill> doing in the middle of all this?” I asked, without trying to hide my> bafflement. “Is that some sort of cutout?” “Oh, they are just contractors to> the Foreign Technology Division,” Hynek replied. “By working through companies> like McGraw-Hill, which is a textbook publisher, it’s easier for them to hire> professors and scholars to conduct some intelligence activities, keeping up> with Soviet technology, for example. Many academics would be nervous saying> they were working for the Foreign Technology Division.” The contract clearly> puts Hynek under the administrative supervision of a man named Sweeney, who is> not a scientist. And it clearly specifies Hynek’s task as evaluating [original> emphasis] the sightings of unknown objects to determine if they represent a> danger for the security of the United States. Hynek’s substantial air force money was passed to him through a third party.Thus, Hynek’s relationship with “security” continued right through the 1960s. Wealso learn from Vallee that Hynek, despite his monthly trips to Wright-PattersonAFB, almost never saw Blue Book chief Hector Quintanilla, but was receivedpersonally by the commander, who usually took him to lunch at the officers’club. When Vallee asked Hynek what they talked about, Hynek replied,“innocently,” the weather and foreign cuisine.The preceding passage raises other unanswered questions, such as how many otheracademics were receiving cutout money to hide their intelligence value. Hynek’sremarks implied that he knew a lot about this topic, but unfortunately theconversation appeared to stop dead at that point. One might also wonder, who wasSweeney? And, since Hynek was being funded through one cutout organization, whynot two (not at all an unusual intelligence practice)? That is, was the airforce itself a cutout for another organization? This is currently anunanswerable question, but well worth asking in light of the clear evidence thatthe CIA was a major—perhaps the major—player behind the scenes in the UFOmystery.Another interesting and generally ignored fact about Hynek was the closerelationship he had with Donald Menzel. The astronomical community has alwaysbeen small, and of course it is not surprising that, aside from the issue ofUFOs, the two men would know each other well. But this relationship was morethan a simple professional acquaintance. From 1955 to 1960, for instance, Hynekwas associate director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Astrophysics Observatoryin Cambridge, Massachusetts, and headed its optical satellite tracking program.During this period he also lectured at Harvard University. Menzel, meanwhile,had been a full professor at Harvard since 1938 and was the most prestigiousastrophysicist in North America. For all intents and purposes, Menzel wasHarvard’s astronomy department. While Hynek was in town, Menzel was fulldirector of the Harvard observatory, and (as Vallee noted in passing) wasHynek’s mentor. On one occasion, Hynek declined to write a foreword for Menzel’sbook. One assumes, then, that Menzel asked in the first place.86[index_split_260.html#filepos1521266]When considering the public opposition the two occasionally had (such as theirparticipation in a scientific debate on UFOs in late 1952), this closeness seemsout of place. But the public view is often the misleading view. Menzel, ofcourse, was not merely one of the world’s leading astronomers. He was a mantightly connected to the upper levels of the American national securitycommunity and personally close to Vannevar Bush. During the war, Menzel chairedthe Radio Propagation Committee of the Joint and Combined Chiefs of Staff andthe Section of Mathematical and Physical Research of U.S. Naval Communications.He was a top-level cryptologist who had a long-standing association with theNational Security Agency, possessed a Navy Top Secret Ultra security clearance,consulted for thirty companies on classified projects, and worked for the CIA.Through the entire 1950s, Menzel was still a serving intelligence officer.Revelations such as these are especially important when one considers howsanitized Hynek’s treatment continues to be at the hands of most writers in theUFO field. Indeed, even Menzel is sanitized. Jerome Clark, for instance, claimedthat Menzel’s secret government work “does not significantly differentiate himfrom many other elite scientists of his generation.”87[index_split_260.html#filepos1521420] There is some truth in this statement, butthe larger picture is missed. What matters is that the surface and undercurrentmove in different directions. In the 1950s, as today, UFOs were a topic of greatsecrecy. They were important. In this context, the classified lives of men likeHynek and Menzel matter a very great deal. These were men strongly connectedwith the topic of UFOs, who by their outward appearance were at antipodes. Yet,below the surface, many commonalities existed.Hynek’s defenders have remained at the surface, claiming that his position onUFOs evolved over the years from skeptic to believer. Such a simple transitionis unlikely. For years, Hynek had access to classified air force UFO reports.Many of those reports were unusual and unconventional—as Hynek himself statedyears after the fact—and the air force official explanations for many of thesewere clearly absurd. Yet, for year after year, he did nothing. Even followers ingood faith might ask, what took him so long?Hynek’s remarks and insights, provided years later, remain of value to the UFOresearcher. But the careful reader must remain mindful of Hynek’s history inthis subject. It is a history that, depending upon which character flaw was hiscorrect one, leads any serious researcher into a stance of wariness regarding J.Allen Hynek."},{"pageContent":"1959 UNFOLDS While Hynek played along with the air force’s UFO program, others spoke out moreopenly about UFOs. On January 1, 1959, Wernher von Braun, the greatest scientistin aerospace history, made this statement in reference to the deflection of theU.S. Juno 2 rocket from its orbit:> We find ourselves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto> assumed, and whose base is at present unknown to us. More I cannot say at> present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers,> and in six or nine months’ time it may be possible to speak with more> precision on the matter. Von Braun said this while he was in Germany during the holiday season. He neverfollowed up on it, and no further information is available on it. A one-timeslip up?88 [index_split_260.html#filepos1521560]The year 1959 provided some interesting moments in the history of the UFO. Anincredible story came from none other than Blue Book chief Robert Friend. In a1974 interview, Friend related an account that he claimed occurred in 1959,concerning a Maine woman who was in “contact” with UFOs. The Canadian governmentlearned of this and sent Wilbert Smith to investigate. The U.S. Navy also senttwo officers, and eventually the CIA invited her to Langley. After shedemonstrated her trance technique, one of the CIA officers apparently madecontact. When others in the room asked for proof, the officer replied “look outthe window.” To everyone’s astonishment, a UFO was plainly visible and was alsobeing tracked by radar at Washington National Airport. Friend said the CIAbriefed him on this incident, and he claimed to have sat in on an uneventfultrance session. Blue Book never analyzed the development, while the CIA tookpunitive action against the officer and transferred all relevant peopleelsewhere.89 [index_split_260.html#filepos1521725]On January 11, Wilbert Smith spoke about UFOs in Ottawa before the IlluminatingEngineering Society, Canadian Regional Conference. “Various items of ‘hardware’are known to exist,” he stated to the audience, “but are usually clapped intosecurity and are not available to the general public.”90[index_split_260.html#filepos1521870]NICAP, still reeling from the failures of 1958, struggled to find direction.Early in 1959, Keyhoe received a lead from Delmar Fahrney, now out of NICAP butstill helpful, on a hidden report regarding Navy Commander George Benten and aUFO encounter from 1956. That spring, he met with Hillenkoetter at the New YorkYacht Club to discuss NICAP strategy. The secrecy was tighter than ever, Keyhoetold the admiral correctly, and Air Force Public Information Officer LawrenceTacker even sent NICAP a “sharp letter” telling them to stop writing members ofthe air force and to confine all questions to his office. (NICAP ignored thisrequest.) Meanwhile, the air force continued to fight strenuously againstNICAP’s efforts for congressional hearings on UFOs. Keyhoe also toldHillenkoetter that three scientists had privately reported UFO sightings to aparticular congressman. Hillenkoetter said, “we’ll have to do something to speedthings up.”91 [index_split_260.html#filepos1522011]"},{"pageContent":"THE KILLIAN CASE AND OTHER NOTEWORTHIES At 8:20 P.M. on February 24, 1959, another commercial airliner had an unusualencounter with a UFO. Veteran pilot Capt. Peter W Killian was flying an AmericanAirlines plane in excellent visibility over Bradford, Pennsylvania, at 8,500feet and 350 mph. Killian noticed three bright lights south of his plane, in aprecise line. As first he assumed it was Orion, until he realized these were notstars, and he could see Orion higher up in the sky. As Killian pondered this,one of the objects abruptly left the formation and approached the plane, sloweddown before Killian took evasive action, then rejoined the other two. Althoughunable to discern a distinctive shape, he believed the object to be huge—atleast three times the size of his plane.Killian alerted his copilot, John Dee, to the objects. Then, in a most unusualdecision, he opened the plane’s intercom to make a “calm announcement” about theobjects. He reasoned that warning the passengers now would be better thanrisking a full-blown panic. After Killian personally calmed one jitterypassenger who was brought to the cockpit, one of the UFOs again approached theplane and then rejoined the others. Killian put out a radio call to otherpilots. Moments later, an American Airlines captain flying north of Erie stated,“We’ve been watching the formation for ten minutes.” After this, anotherAmerican Airlines pilot, near Toledo, also called in to report the sighting. Itwas soon learned that three United Airlines crews also saw the formation. Beforelanding in Detroit, Killian reported the sighting to the airport there,intending to keep the story quiet. One of his passengers, however, was anaviation expert who spoke to the Detroit press about the sighting. After thestory broke, Killian received permission from American Airlines to discuss thesighting, and the story was carried across the country.Without bothering to investigate or even review the evidence, the air forceentered the picture three days later, stating that Killian saw Orion throughbroken clouds. On the following day, an air force spokesman described some UFOobservers as people “who can’t remember anything when they sober up next day.”Killian fired back strongly. The clouds, he said, were 3,500 feet below theplane. Also, he and the other witnesses saw Orion and the objects at the sametime, repeatedly. Keyhoe asked Killian if he would tell this to a congressionalcommittee. “I certainly would!” Killian replied. Meanwhile, American Airlinesappeared to be backing Killian and reprinted the account in its magazine.The air force’s vapid Orion explanation caused a loss of credibility. Therefore,on March 20, air force spokesman Lawrence Tacker officially retracted it.Instead of Orion, he said, the pilots had seen the wholly ordinary spectacle ofB-47 bombers refueling in flight from a KC-97 tanker. The press ran this withoutcomment or critique, and ridicule about “little green men” began to reachKillian. He did not take the comment lying down. “I don’t care what the airforce says,” the New York media quoted him. He knew exactly what B-47s lookedlike during refueling, he said. He knew the KC-97 tanker and how many lights ithad. He stated again that the objects “were at least three times the size of anytanker or bomber we have. They could travel at 2,000 mph. And they were notconventional aircraft.” It was unusual for an airline pilot to continue sobrazenly to defy the air force. Ryan and Neff, only three years prior, had kepttheir mouths shut following an even more spectacular incident. But the arroganceof the air force had forced Killian to defend himself.Killian’s defiant stance gave Keyhoe hope that a congressional investigationmight come out of all this. As was too often the case, however, Keyhoe wasoverly optimistic. NICAP member Lou Corbin told him that Maryland CongressmanSam Friedel was “all set to hop on this Killian business.” Keyhoe began to planfor Killian to meet with Friedel and even to get Senator Barry Goldwaterinvolved for a “red-hot press conference.” As planned, Corbin did meet withFriedel. Then, on March 27, Keyhoe learned from Killian’s wife that he had beensilenced by the air force. According to Mrs. Killian, he was under strict ordersnot to “meet or talk with anyone about what he saw.” It so happened that Friedelhad agreed to allow Killian to testify as part of a new congressional UFOinvestigation, but that Killian would have to make the first move; Friedel wouldnot subpoena him. When Killian told a U.S. Senator that he would not risk losinghis job by volunteering to testify, the issue became dead at once. NeitherSenate nor House was willing to fight the air force. Soon after, the air forcereleased this statement by Killian: “Having never seen night refueling of jetsby a tanker, I suppose that could be what we saw.” Keyhoe was appalled buthelpless.92 [index_split_260.html#filepos1522160]Several intriguing UFO encounters were occurring overseas early in the year.Several of these were monitored by the CIA, such as an encounter from January 20in Stigsjoe, Sweden. A craft twenty to twenty-five feet in diameter, surroundedby a glowing ring, approached a group of people at Lake Laangsjoen and wasobserved for three minutes. UFOs were seen in Britain, too. In January, alanding and paralysis incident was reported in Stratfordupon-Avon. 93[index_split_260.html#filepos1522357] On February 26, four witnesses at LondonAirport, including a traffic control officer, saw a UFO through binoculars. AnRAF description reported: “Bright yellow light varying in intensity, about twohundred feet above the ground. Stayed in one position for about twenty minutes,then climbed away at great speed.” Vallee reported an incident that occurred inMarch in which Polish soldiers at the coast near Kolobreg noticed the seabecoming agitated. To their astonishment, a triangular object, each side abouttwelve feet long, emerged from the water. The object initially circled over thebarracks, then zipped away. The CIA noted a UFO sighting involving a processionof bright bodies over Bergen, Norway, that took place on March 12. The next dayseveral Australian witnesses had a ten-minute sighting of a dome-shaped objectat a field a quarter mile away. It looked like a huge circus tent with flashinglights. As they approached, the object hovered, then took off at tremendousspeed. Investigators from the Woomera Rocket range questioned one of thewitnesses. At Australia’s Port Elliot on March 31, a man was driving home in theafternoon when he saw a glowing, reddish object with a row of portholes. Theobject was resting on the ground, was about twenty feet wide. The man drovearound a wooded area in time to see it take off. The area was tested forradioactivity, and none found.94 [index_split_260.html#filepos1522531]America rounded out the early spring with a few odd and ominous sightings of itsown. On February 28, Army Private Gerry Irwin stopped his car in Cedar City,Iowa, to investigate what he thought was a crashing plane. He was later foundunconscious and treated at an army hospital. He suffered from some amnesia,continued to have fainting spells, and returned more than once to the site in atrancelike state. Soon, Irwin deserted and seemingly disappeared.On April 1, a radio emergency call came from a C-118 plane with four men aboard(“we’ve hit something—or something hit us”) about an hour after takeoff fromMcChord Field AFB in Tacoma, Washington. Thirty minutes later, the plane crashedinto the side of a mountain, leaving no survivors. Although the military sealedoff the site, APRO found witnesses who had seen the plane in its final moments.All described two orange or yellowish objects closing in on the plane95[index_split_260.html#filepos1522767]"},{"pageContent":"THE STRANGE CASE OF MORRIS JESSUP Morris K. Jessup wrote several popular books about UFOs. He was the first to usethe term “UFO” in a book and was one of the earliest ancient astronauttheorists. In 1955, he published The Case for the UFO. Shortly after itspublication, a paperback edition of the book was sent anonymously to the chiefof the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D.C., filled with handwrittenannotations that appeared to reflect a detailed knowledge of UFOs. There werethree distinct personalities in the annotations, and it appeared that the bookhad been passed from person to person, in the form of an extended conversation.Later that year, the Office of Naval Research republished the book—with theannotations. Several hundred copies were then printed by the Varo Corporation inGarland, Texas.The people at ONR seem to have been impressed by the mysterious annotations. Theintroduction to the Varo edition stated that the notations implied an “intimateknowledge of UFOs, their means of motion, their origin, background, history, andhabits of beings occupying UFOs....” The notes referred to the building ofundersea cities and of various types of ships used for transportation. The ONRintroduction stated that terms such as mothership, home-ship, dead-ship, greatark, great bombardment, great return, great war, little-men, force-fields, deepfreezes, undersea building, measure markers, scout ships, magnetic and gravityfields, sheets of diamond, cosmic rays, force cutters, undersea explorers, inlaywork, clear-talk, telepathing, burning, “coat,” nodes, vortices, magnetic “net,”and many others are used quite naturally by these men.The navy introduction concluded that the remarks and explanations of the unknowncommentators “may be worth consideration.”By early 1956, Jessup received two anonymous, strange letters post-marked fromGainesville, Texas, about sixty miles north of Garland. The author of theletters appeared to be one of the annotators of the book. The letters describedsomething later known as the Philadelphia Experiment. According to the author(who wrote the letter in a bizarre English with copious and cryptic allusions tomen of science such as Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Michael Faraday),the U.S. Navy conducted an experiment involving Einstein’s unified field theoryin October 1943. In the words of the author (all emphasis in original):> The “result” was complete invisibility of a ship, Destroyer type, and all of> its crew, While at Sea. (Oct. 1943) The Field Was effective in an oblate> spheroidal ishape, extending one Hundred yards (More or Less, due to Lunar> position & Latitude) out from each beam of the ship. Any Person Within that> sphere became vague in form BUT He too observed those Persons aboard that ship> as though they too were of the same state, yet were walking upon nothing. Any> person without that sphere could see Nothing save the clearly Defined shape of> the Ships Hull in the Water PROVIDING of course, that that person was just> close enough to see yet, just barely outside of that field. Why tell you now?> Very Simple; If You choose to go Mad, then you would reveal this information.> Half of the officers & the crew of that Ship are at Present, Mad as Hatters. The author added that the ship, after disappearing from the Philadelphia dock,appeared “within minutes” in the Norfolk-Newport News-Portsmouth area ofVirginia, and that the experiments were discontinued. The second letterexpressed a desire for more work to be done in field theory in order to continuedeveloping “the form of transport that the navy accidentally stumbled upon (totheir embarrassment) when their [experimental ship] took off & popped up aminute or so later” in the Chesapeake Bay. According to his good friend IvanSanderson, these letters mystified Jessup, but did leave him feeling that therewas too much in them to ignore wholly.Several years later, in October 1958, Jessup met with Sanderson in New York,seeming depressed. He gave Sanderson a Varo edition of his book and asked him tostore it safely “in case anything should happen to me.” In mid-April of 1959,Jessup wrote a depressed letter to a friend, which Sanderson later read andcharacterized as “a straight suicide note.” On April 20, Jessup was found neardeath in his car near his home in Coral Gables, Florida, an apparent suicide. Ahose was attached to his exhaust pipe and ran into his vehicle through a smallcrack in a window. He died later that night.Jessup’s death never escaped rumors of murder. The main theory was that Jessupknew too much about the Philadelphia Experiment. Gray Barker made this the themeof his book, The Strange Case of Dr. M. K. Jessup, and others followed suit,arguing that the suicide was a frame-up. The author of the Varo notes is nowgenerally believed to be a man named Carl Allen (alias Carlos Allende), after heessentially confessed as much to the Lorenzens in 1969, then recanted. Allende’sown parents later described him as a “master leg puller,” and his brother calledhim a “drifter.” If this is meant to discredit the notes, it fails to addressthat the ONR analysis concluded there were three authors. Sanderson, as usual,put it well: If the authors were nothing but crackpots, “where did they dredgeup all these facts or allegations... requir[ing] many years of research tounearth?” In any case, subsequent research into the Philadelphia Experiment longago reached a dead end. Barring a radical development, the story will remain alegend attached to a disreputable individual.96[index_split_260.html#filepos1522947]"},{"pageContent":"THE REVEREND GILL SIGHTING AND ACTIVITY IN THE OCEAN As the reader should discern by now, UFOs have a long history of being seen inand around large bodies of water, a fact generally unremarked upon by mostresearchers. (The great exception, of course, is Ivan Sanderson.) Uponreflection, it is easy to see why there should be a large share of UFO activityat sea, and why most people, landlubbers that we are, tend to ignore it. Theworld’s surface is, after all, 70 percent water, and little of it is known belowa few hundred feet, even today. Time and again, however, we come acrossencounters with strange objects at sea. In June 1959, the Argentine navy trappeda large silver object in the harbor at Buenos Aires. It was “shaped like a hugefish,” with a tail similar to the vertical stabilizer on a B- 17. Diversobtained a good look at it but could not identify it as a submarine; moreover,the object seemed too maneuverable and fast to be a sub.97[index_split_260.html#filepos1523157]In late June occurred yet another “classic” sighting, out in the remote regionof Papua, New Guinea. Actually, it was a series of encounters over June 26 and27, 1959, and involved multiple, close-up sightings of a hovering UFO craft,with much mutual waving and seemingly goodwill exchanged. The main witness wasthe Rev. William Booth Gill, a respected man on the island, known by all asscrupulously honest and decent. On the evening of the twenty-sixth, Gill,accompanied by thirty-eight witnesses, saw a shining object at around 6:45 P.M.,hovering in the air at about three hundred or four hundred feet. The object wascircular and had legs under it, and a bright blue light shone from the craftupwards into the sky. Everyone also saw four figures on what appeared to be adeck.The visitors returned the next night at about 6 P.M. Father Gill quickly arrivedon the scene, along with many others. Again, they saw four figures on top of theship, and this time saw two smaller craft nearby. In Father Gill’s detailedaccount of the incident (an eleven-page, single-spaced report signed by overtwenty-five witnesses):> [T]wo of the figures seemed to be doing something near the center of the deck.> They were occasionally bending over and raising their arms as though adjusting> or setting up something (not visible). One figure seemed to be standing,> looking down at us. At this point, Father Gill waved to the figures. To everyone’s surprise, thefigures waved back. A teacher among the witnesses then raised both of her armsand waved, and two of the figures did the same. The mutual waving went on forsome time. When it became dark, Father Gill used a flashlight to make a seriesof movements toward the craft, and the craft eventually made several waveringmotions back and forth.The Rev. Norman E. G. Cruttwell (not present) who investigated the event wrotethat> the facts of this sighting and the waving by the men and the responses to the> [flashlight] signals are fully corroborated by ... many of the other witnesses> in personal interview with myself. Cruttwell also reported that between June 26 and 28, there were several UFOsightings at nearby Giva, Baniara, and Sideia. Allen Hynek also interviewed Gillsome fifteen years later and found him to be completely credible.Donald Menzel and Philip Klass wrote debunking pieces on the sighting. Menzeldid not impugn Gill’s integrity, but theorized that the whole thing was anoptical illusion of the planet Venus caused by Gill’s bad eyesight. Themalleable natives merely wanted to impress “their Great White Leader” who had a“god-like” status with them. True to form, Klass did impugn Gill’s character. Heclaimed that the reverend invented or imagined the encounter in order to pleaseCruttwell. Considering the incredible nature of the claims, it is interestingthat these were the most damaging arguments skeptics could come up with.98[index_split_260.html#filepos1523315]The expanses of the Pacific Ocean continued to be the scene of UFO activity thatsummer. On July 11, 1959, about nine hundred miles northeast of Hawaii, a Pan AmAirways crew saw a strange craft with satellite objects make sharp turns. For atime, the crew feared the possibility of a collision, although the air forceprivately told interested congressmen that the crew only saw a meteor. Just twodays later, a farm woman in Blenheim, New Zealand, saw a domed disc descend andhover. She said it was about thirty-five feet in diameter, had two intense,green lights and two rows of jets around the rim, and gave off orange flames.She also claimed to see two men in metallic suits inside a clear dome. The crafttook off rapidly with a high-pitched sound, giving off heat. The next day, July14, a group of hunters on Australia’s Prince of Wales Island saw a red objectland on the island. Other hunters claimed to see a similar object nearby.99[index_split_260.html#filepos1523634]"},{"pageContent":"GETTING UP-CLOSE AND PERSONAL The nature of UFO sightings changed from the 1940s to the late 1950s. Reports inthe 1950s continued, as in the previous decade, to describe impossible objectsseen in the sky. Increasingly, however, they also included vivid descriptions ofcraft at close range, encounters with the beings operating them, and physicaleffects. The phenomenon had always been global but somewhat dominated byAmerican sightings from 1947 to 1954. After 1954, however, quality reports camein large numbers from around the world, often overshadowing the Americanreports.In 1959, the trend continued and provided some remarkable alleged encounters, inparticular during the late summer. On August 9, in Sombrero, Tierra del Fuego, apetroleum engineer and two other witnesses stopped their car when they ran outof gas; they then saw a large, bright light descending like a pendulum, making aswishing sound. One of the men aimed a rifle at it, but the object zoomed away.In Brion, Spain, on August 12, a farmer saw an object land in a pasture, takeoff vertically, and fly away. On the thirteenth, in Freeport, Texas, a bright,low-flying object passed over a car, whose engine stalled, and landed in awooded area. Six people in two separate groups saw the object and called thepolice, although the dense underbrush prevented an investigation. On August 17,a low-flying UFO appeared to cause a power interruption in Minas Gerais, Brazil.Late morning on August 25, in Werdehl-Eveking, Germany, a man approached abright object in a forest but fainted when he got too close. As he regainedconsciousness, it took off silently and vertically. It was round, had a tripodlanding gear, two rows of bright openings, and was about one hundred feet indiameter. On September 7, in Wallingford, Kentucky, a postal worker saw abluish, disc-shaped object at ground level; it flew away horizontally, leaving astained ring on the ground.100 [index_split_260.html#filepos1523840]Meanwhile, the air force once again reassigned UFO investigative duties. In July1959, the 1127th Field Activities Group stationed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia,replaced the 1006th AISS as the main field investigative unit. According toJacobs, the group made few investigations. In September, AFR-200-2 went throughanother revision, which again emphasized that “unidentifieds” must be reduced toa minimum—something which had been the policy for quite some time.101[index_split_260.html#filepos1524051]"},{"pageContent":"REDMOND, OREGON: SIX JETS ATTEMPT AN INTERCEPT The extraordinary UFO encounter at Redmond, Oregon, of September 24, 1959,discussed at length in this book’s introduction, contained all the ingredientsthat make the UFO story so compelling: (1) a multiple-witness, visual sightingof an object that defied conventional explanation; (2) clear tracking onmultiple radars; (3) a serious and daring attempt by the air force to interceptthe object, in this case with six F-102 jets; (4) strong indications that themilitary forcibly silenced the personnel involved; (5) continued stonewallingand deception on the part of the air force to explain the incident away, endingwith the classic of all debunking solutions: the planet Venus; (6) the work ofcivilian UFO organizations—in this case, NICAP—to obtain documentation (FAAlogs) that disproved the air force claims; (7) the loss of air force credibilityto everyone involved in the incident; and (8) the mixed nature of success incovering up the incident—not enough to prevent it from reaching the attention ofoutside snoops who could then write about it, but enough to keep it frombecoming a problem in the media or Congress.102[index_split_260.html#filepos1524221]Fundamentally, the encounter provided more evidence that the military took UFOsvery seriously and was doing everything possible to stifle all information aboutthem—in short, that the government was hiding something big about UFOs.Four days after the Redmond incident, on September 28, ATIC issued a reportreassessing its UFO role. It recommended that the UFO program be transferred toan air force division with better scientific capabilities, which could thenimplement an active public relations campaign with the goal of “the eventualelimination of the program as a special project.” This did not mean that the airforce would stop receiving UFO reports, but would merely eliminate Project BlueBook and the public dimension of the problem. ATIC’s problem now became toconvince any other area of the air force to take the program, and none werefoolhardy enough to agree.103 [index_split_260.html#filepos1524383]By October, NICAP was again gathering congressional support for a renewedinvestigation of the air force’s censorship over UFOs. Several former air forceofficers and NCOs provided statements for NICAP Among them was Lt. Col. RichardT. Headrick, a radar bombing expert who devised key missions during the SecondWorld War:> Saucers exist (I saw two). They were intelligently flown or operated (evasive> tactics, formation flight, hovering). They were mechanisms, not United States> weapons, nor Russian. I presume they are extraterrestrial. Another, Air Force Sgt. James H. Sawyer, stated:> Many airmen asked for more UFO information; I received strict orders there> would be no discussion. I am convinced the unexplained UFOs are guided by> advanced, intelligent beings. I believe the censorship is a grave error. A third, Sgt. Oliver Dean, was also a NICAP member. In 1958, two officers atKirtland AFB grilled him about his personal UFO investigations. He told NICAP,“I was warned, ‘If you continue this, Sergeant Dean, be careful; it can get youinto serious trouble.’”In addition to testimonies such as these, Keyhoe and NICAP collected a number oftentative statements by senators and congressmen favoring UFO hearings, providedsuch hearings not jeopardize national security. NICAP’s leaders also hoped thatthe Killian case might be a useful instrument in their hands. Ultimately,however, October was just not the right time to push ahead. It was too late inthe session to gather enough momentum. Keyhoe learned from one congressman that“you don’t have enough support yet to ram it through. Get everything in shapefor next year and keep on lining up with more backing.”104[index_split_260.html#filepos1524529]"},{"pageContent":"RUPPELT REVISES HIS BOOK, THEN DIES Throughout the spring of 1959, Keyhoe and NICAP encountered rumors that Ruppelt,under great pressure, would be revising the conclusion of his 1956 book, TheReport on Unidentified Flying Objects. The more extreme of these reported thatRuppelt was being forced “to make a right about-face” on UFOs, and to ridiculethe phenomenon. In May, Ruppelt phoned Keyhoe from California to inform him thathe was bringing his book “up to date” and wanted NICAP’s latest information.When Keyhoe asked him how he was getting his latest UFO cases, Ruppelt answeredthat the air force was giving him full cooperation. Discerning Keyhoe’s growingunease, he added that he was still “middle of the road” on the issue. WhenKeyhoe asked Ruppelt about his debunking-oriented letter from the spring of1958, Ruppelt—according to Keyhoe—changed the subject and ended the call.The telephone conversation made Keyhoe uneasy, and he decided to write an openletter to Ruppelt for NICAP’s June issue of the UFO Investigator. The letter,which listed many of Ruppelt’s past statements on UFOs, urged him not to let theair force trick him into falling into an untenable position that, in the end,would only damage his credibility. All was for naught. In December 1959, FrankEdwards obtained an advance copy of Ruppelt’s book. He called Keyhoe immediatelyabout it. Ruppelt, said Edwards> rewrote the last three chapters. It’s absolutely incredible. Now he sneers at> people he formerly labeled expert witnesses. He plays up the wildest contact> stories—completely backs the air force policy line.... The writing doesn’t> even sound like him. And he takes sarcastic cracks at serious investigators,> especially NICAP and you.105 [index_split_260.html#filepos1524675] This was not quite accurate. Ruppelt had not changed anything from his originalbook. What he had done was add three new chapters, each of which debunked theUFO phenomenon as explainable in conventional terms and ridiculous to takeseriously. There was no “middle of the road” here, although he did try tomaintain the pretense of objectivity by listing some interesting UFO sightingsfrom the mid- and late 1950s. After that, it was all downhill. The new chaptersoffered a striking contrast to the detached and evenhanded account thatcharacterized Ruppelt’s first edition.After taking several cracks at “saucer fans,” Ruppelt directed snide remarkstoward Keyhoe and NICAP. While the air force was conducting itself responsiblyand scientifically toward UFOs, wrote Ruppelt, “Keyhoe and his hungry NICAPions... wanted blood, and that blood had to taste like spaceships or they wouldn’tbe happy.” Such a tone seemed truly incredible, but here was Ruppelt insultingan organization he nearly joined less than two years earlier. NICAP, far frombeing a detached organization interested in solving the UFO problem, merely“bombarded” busy congressmen and senators who had important work to do but were“polite enough to listen.” Ruppelt even smeared Keyhoe personally, repeatingsupposed rumors that he was accused of “minor social crimes” (“But personally Idoubt this,” he explained). There was no air force secrecy over UFOs, emphasizedRuppelt. Instead, the air force wanted to keep the nuts at NICAP from rummagingthrough their files—which surely would result in “proof” that UFOs really werevisitors from space.Ruppelt emphasized the extremely high percentage of solved UFO cases. Directlycontradicting statements he had made not long before in private, Ruppelt nowrepeated the standard air force line:> [M]ore manpower, better techniques, and just plain old experience has allowed> the air force to continually lower the percentage of “unknowns” from twenty> percent while I was in charge of Project Blue Book, to less than one percent> today. Ruppelt also spilled much ink on George Adamski and the Contactee movement,essentially lumping them together with serious UFO groups and throwing morediscredit upon UFO researchers. He then offered his definitive conclusion thatUFOs simply don’t exist. Ruppelt was “positive” about this. “There’s not even aglimmer of hope for the UFO,” he wrote.Ruppelt easily explained many supposedly unidentified sightings. He debunked theability of so-called experienced observers and used a number of authorities,including Hynek, to support his position. The Levelland sightings, which at thetime prompted him to contradict the air force in public, now turned out to beexactly what the air force claimed all along: St. Elmo’s fire. Disregarding theMcMinnville, Rouen, or Trindade photos, Ruppelt stated there was no shred ofphotographic evidence for UFOs “other than meaningless blobs of light.” TheLubbock Lights provided the coup de grace, as Ruppelt now explained them as“night-flying moths reflecting the bluish-green light of a nearby row of mercuryvapor street lights.” He concluded in resigned fashion that, because of thefanaticism of saucer fans, the world was “stuck with our space age myth—theUFO.”106 [index_split_260.html#filepos1524838]Ruppelt’s book shocked the UFO researchers who knew him. Was it really possiblethat he had changed his mind on the subject in an unforced, honest way? Mattersare complicated greatly by the fact that Ruppelt was dead less than a yearlater, of a second heart attack, while living in Long Beach, California, at theage of thirty-seven. As with Morris Jessup, rumors of suspicious deathcirculated. We might add, for good reason. First, it must be stated thatRuppelt’s conversion to the air force point of view shows all the signs of unduepressure. He worked for Northrop, a major defense contractor, and was thereforesubject to pressure from both his current and past employer. Rumors of suchpressure had been circulating for years; certainly not proof, but then again,who was starting the rumors? Observe the following scenario: (1) Ruppeltactively working against UFO secrecy from 1954 through the end of 1957, by whichtime he had made himself a positive nuisance to the air force, and wasconsidering membership in NICAP; (2) a period in early 1958 when he removedhimself from the Armstrong Theater program on UFOs, amid rumors of general airforce pressure on other participants; (3) strongly debunking statements inprivate by mid-1958; (4) burned bridges with former colleagues by 1959; (5)death a year later.Jerome Clark thought little of this sequence. “Ever since [Ruppelt’s death],” hewrote, “rumors have circulated that he was forced to recant his earliermore-or-less pro-UFO sympathies. But no evidence to this effect has eversurfaced.” With that statement, all is dismissed. Ruppelt’s widow, continuedClark, told interviewers that the reasons for this change had nothing to do withpressure. Rather, her husband’s continuing association with Blue Book personnel,plus exposure to the Contactee movement in southern California “soured him.” AndRuppelt’s widow is supposed to be a detached witness for what reason? We are tobelieve that his “exposure” to the Contactees prompted him publicly to insultKeyhoe, a man whom Ruppelt knew despised Contactees? Ruppelt, who had writtensuch a detached and mature work three years prior, now wrote this sophomoricdiatribe because he “soured”? The key lies in Ruppelt’s “continuing association”with Blue Book and air force personnel. No doubt, that was a crucial factor, butcertainly not the kind implied by Clark. In the context of Ruppelt’s recentstance toward the air force on UFOs, his rapid and total conversion, and hisdeath at such a young age, matters ought to look suspicious, particularly in thelight of the capabilities that existed within the American national securityapparatus by this time. Whether he actually was killed, or whether he died fromthe stress brought on by what he had gone through (the belief of Edwards andKeyhoe), there seems little reason to doubt that Ruppelt was coerced.107[index_split_260.html#filepos1524985]"},{"pageContent":"1960: SERIOUS BUSINESS On December 24, 1959, the inspector general of the air force issued thefollowing warning regarding UFOs to every air base commander in the continentalU.S.:> Unidentified flying objects—sometimes treated lightly by the press and> referred to as “flying saucers”—must be rapidly and accurately identified as> serious USAF business in the ZI [Interior Zone].... Technical and defense> considerations will continue to exist in this area. It also noted that UFO investigators sent out from air bases “should be equippedwith binoculars, camera, Geiger counter, magnifying glass, and a source forcontainers in which to store samples.” Samples of what? Once again, it appearedthat air force policy on UFOs was inconsistent. Actually, it was not. The airforce leadership, we know, always considered UFOs of great importance; it wasfor that reason that it had gone out of its way for years to ridicule thephenomenon in public. The problem had always been, how to track UFOs without itseeming to be important. This included deciding how most air force and militarypersonnel were to deal with the matter. Generally, it was considered best tokeep them away from such matters, and ridicule worked well for this. But someresponse to the problem was needed, and the ridicule policy had caused reportingto become lax. Hence, the “serious business” memo.108[index_split_260.html#filepos1525126]The year 1960 brought no shortage of serious business in other realms ofsecrecy. That year, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) was formed.Essentially, the NRO is America’s spy satellite department, a Pentagon-CIA-NSAcentral office that determines surveillance targets. Its existence was notrevealed publicly until 1973, and even into the 1990s its name could not bementioned in Congress or in any unclassified government document. Already in1960, optics capabilities had become quite advanced. An optics expert that yearwrote that it soon should be possible to develop satellite cameras capable of“resolving two objects three inches apart from 125 miles up.”109[index_split_260.html#filepos1525404]Also in 1960, CIA Director of Plans Richard Bissell asked MK-Ultra DirectorSidney Gottlieb to undertake research on assassination techniques. Gottlieb’ssupport of people like Ewen Cameron already placed him in the Mengele class ofmad scientists. He was glad to oblige Bissell, and had already developed aperfume that could be sprinkled on pillows and sheets which, upon inhalation,was instantly lethal.110 [index_split_260.html#filepos1525585] Speaking ofCameron, by early 1960 he was taking his sensory deprivation experiments totheir ultimate conclusion: the irreversible scrambling of the human mind.Cameron was happy to take CIA money, courtesy of Gottlieb, but he had no need of“expendables” from the agency—he simply used his own patients. Researcher JohnMarks wrote:> It cannot be said how many, if any, other agency brainwashing projects reached> the extremes of Cameron’s work. Details are scarce. In what ways the CIA> applied work like Cameron’s is not known.111> [index_split_260.html#filepos1525745] Probably the most significant new CIA project of 1960 was its secret war inLaos, which continued until 1973. This covert operation raised athirty-thousand-man army, consisting mainly of Meo tribesmen, to fight thecommunist Pathet Lao. Air America, a CIA airline, provided air support.112[index_split_260.html#filepos1525913]Project Paperclip showed that extremely secret programs could continue in theU.S. for well over ten years without a significant leak. Throughout the 1960s,Paperclip (along with National Interest, a similar program), sponsored thearrival of at least 267 more people into America. Another project, known as 63,brought an unknown number of others. These recruits worked everywhere. Among thegovernment-related organizations were NASA, Edgewood Arsenal, Wright-PattersonAFB, Fort Monmouth AFB, and the Naval Ordnance Testing Station in China Lake,California. Private corporations included Pennsylvania State University, MIT,Bell Laboratories, RCA, CBS Laboratories, Martin Marietta, Convair, and MobilOil.113 [index_split_260.html#filepos1526062]In April 1960, worried over the Frankenstein nature of America’s military state,President Eisenhower asked the dying Foster Dulles, “How are we going to scaleour programs down?” If we did not, suggested Ike, “in the long run, there isnothing but war—if we give up all hope of a peaceful solution.”114[index_split_260.html#filepos1526202]"},{"pageContent":"1960: MONITORING THE UFOS On the UFO front, the secret state never ceased in its efforts to monitor, andprobably undermine, the civilian organizations. In early 1960, Keyhoe publishedyet another UFO book, Flying Saucers: Top Secret. As always, Keyhoe’s narrativestyle—fast, impetuous, and full of snappy dialogue—did not lend credibility toconservative readers. Yet, this made four books in ten years on the subject, anda careful reading of them provided a huge cache of information to the seriousUFO researcher. No doubt some of those careful readers were in the air force,CIA, ONR, NSA, and elsewhere. Despite his busy pace throughout the 1950s, thisbook would be Keyhoe’s last for another thirteen years. He was now in hissixties, and his NICAP duties undoubtedly took much of his time. Still, it wasobvious that Keyhoe needed watching. Perhaps coincidentally, in 1960 Col. JosephJ. Bryan III joined NICAP’s board of directors. It would not be known until 1977that Bryan had founded and led the CIA’s psychological warfare staff. Prior tothis, he had vehemently denied any connection to the agency. Although he made anumber of strong pro-UFO statements throughout his history with NICAP, he laterbecame strongly suspected in helping to facilitate the eventual demise of theorganization, and certainly of Keyhoe’s role in it.APRO, although much less dangerous than NICAP, had become a substantialorganization in its own right. By 1960, it had a good investigative network,both within the U.S. and abroad, including South America, New Zealand,Australia, and several European countries. Led by Coral and Jim Lorenzen, APROdiffered considerably from NICAP in its indifference to the drive forcongressional hearings and disbelief in an air force cover-up. UFOorganizations, the Lorenzens believed, ought to be conducting investigations,and NICAP’s obsession with a cover-up was a supreme waste of effort. Despitethis entrenched attitude, APRO was also monitored. In 1960, the Lorenzens movedfrom Alamogordo, New Mexico, to Tucson, Arizona. On their third day in Tucson an“exterminator” visited them, offering to inspect their premises for free. Thisunusually well-dressed exterminator, with very polished shoes, failed to mentionthe name of his company. Although the Lorenzens were renting, he did not ask forthe name of the landlord and did not seem interested in his profession. He was,however, very interested in conversing with Coral Lorenzen at length over theirreason for moving, where Jim Lorenzen was employed, and UFOs.115[index_split_260.html#filepos1526404]Meanwhile, ATIC sought in vain to transfer the UFO problem to such places as thePentagon Information Office, SAFOI, NASA, the Smithsonian Institution, and theBrookings Institution. Maj. Lawrence Tacker remained the air force’s main publicrepresentative on UFOs, and he seemed to become more sour each year. In 1960,Tacker released a book, Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force, a straightpromotion of the air force line. He toured the country, appeared on radio andtelevision, and took shots at Keyhoe and NICAP.116[index_split_260.html#filepos1526580]Tacker was never anything more than an air force front man, paid and ordered tobe a mouthpiece. The people within the air force generally knew better than tobelieve his statements, and certainly this applied to Blue Book staff. Accordingto Richard Hall, a former Blue Book chief (Robert Friend?) told him that duringthe late 1950s and early 1960s time-gun camera films of UFOs were being“routinely” obtained during jet interceptor chases and sent to the CIA’sNational Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) for analysis. The individualalso stated that “none of the... analysis data in these cases has been released,nor has the existence of these films ever been acknowledged.” Although no onesaid anything about the role of the newly formed NRO, may we at leastacknowledge that it was ideally suited for contributing in this area?117[index_split_260.html#filepos1526760]On February 27, 1960, Roscoe Hillenkoetter released to the media copies of theair force directive of the previous December about “serious business.” He alsomade a public statement on UFOs, quoted the following day in the Sunday New YorkTimes:> It is time for the truth to be brought out in open congressional hearings....> Behind the scenes, high-ranking air force officers are soberly concerned about> UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to> believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.... [T]o hide the facts, the> air force has silenced its personnel through the issuance of a regulation. The air force admitted that it had issued the order; it added that the copy wasmerely part of a seven-page regulation which had been issued to update similarpast orders, and that it made no substantive change in policy.118[index_split_260.html#filepos1526900]UFO sightings dribbled along in 1960. Rumors of huge mystery satellites hadexisted for many years. Now, on February 11, 1960, another such story broke out.Papers in Britain reported a U.S. Defense Department announcement that anunidentified object orbiting Earth had been discovered by a navy-operated spacesurveillance unit and was under constant observation. Flying Saucer Reviewcovered this in several issues. The object was said to be about fifteen tons,orbiting the poles, and had thus far preserved total radio silence. The Pentagonsaid the object “may have been of Soviet origin,” a statement that brought askeptical reply from a Soviet astronomer, who maintained that all Sovietsatellites were fired into orbits of sixty-five degrees to the equator, wellclear of the poles. In late August of that year the satellite was seen forseveral days and photographed by Grumman Aircraft Corporation.119[index_split_260.html#filepos1527058]The mystery satellite also figured into a CIA file dated March 17, 1960, whichdescribed a March 6 sighting and photograph of two UFOs over Norrtalje, Sweden.A man had gone out that morning “to photograph the unidentified satellite, 1960Alpha.” Just before the satellite became visible, he saw two objects movingslowly, “not entirely unlike that of the satellites he had seen before.Suddenly, however, the direction of movement changed, and the objects turnedsuch that they were going back in the same direction they came from.”120[index_split_260.html#filepos1527225]Thus, despite year after year of blanket denials issued by the American militaryand government regarding the validity of UFOs, the CIA continued to gatherreports from around the globe. Who determined this agency policy? And why wereUFOs deemed of interest to the CIA? Could these really be evidence of interestin possible Soviet technology?"},{"pageContent":"PROJECT OZMA GETS A SIGNAL By the late autumn of 1959, Frank Edwards, still receiving UFO information frommany sources, was able to confirm a tip he had originally gotten back in April:that a “giant telescope” was under construction at Green Bank, West Virginia, bythe National Science Foundation, with the purpose of searching for intelligiblesignals from outer space. The NSF promptly denied this, but the story was true.The project, soon known as Project Ozma, was directed by Dr. Otto Struve, whowas assisted by Dr. Frank Drake, a protégé of Lloyd Berkner.Word on Project Ozma leaked sufficiently that by early 1960, Struve announcedthat Ozma was an attempt to establish communication with intelligentextraterrestrial civilizations. Then, at 4 A.M. on April 8, 1960, Project Ozma’sradio telescope at Green Bank, West Virginia, focused on the star Tau Ceti andreceived a powerful signal. In Drake’s words, the signal “knock[ed] the needleoff the dials” for five minutes. It seemed amazingly quick to receive anintelligent signal from outer space, yet it appeared to be so. Then, two weekslater, after repositioning the telescope, the signal reappeared. This gavestrong support to the idea that the signal had been terrestrial, most likelyfrom a nearby and extremely powerful transmitter. The Naval Research Laboratorylater revealed that its staff had been listening to these same signals for thepast six months. It is curious that they were unable to determine the source.The best guess is that the NSA ran the transmitter, as it happens to have amajor facility at Green Bank. Drake himself later said that he “never reallyknew what we made contact with that first day.”What we do know is that by 1961, Project Ozma was washed up, and Struve reversedhis earlier statements on the project’s importance. “Come back in a hundredyears,” he told reporters. Actually, however, the project did not die, as Struveimplied; it simply moved to Arecibo, Puerto Rico.121[index_split_260.html#filepos1527359]"},{"pageContent":"THE U-2 AFFAIR: A PEEK DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE On May 1, 1960, CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down in a U- 2 over theSoviet Union. This was the first time in five years of overflights that anythinglike this had occurred. Quite serious, indeed, and no announcement appearedwhile both governments were determining just what to do. On May 5, SovietPremier Nikita Khrushchev announced that the plane had been shot down. He madeno mention of Powers. The U.S. State Department confidently replied that theplane was not a spy plane; rather, it was a NASA weather plane that had driftedover the border from Turkey when its pilot had oxygen trouble. Sorry about theconfusion. State was able to lie so confidently because it knew Powers had beeninstructed, in case of trouble, to eject from the plane and blow it up with aremote-control device. They did not know that Powers had not activated themechanism. After letting this story sit for two days, Khrushchev triumphantlyrevealed that he had both pilot and plane. Whoops. The State Department nowadmitted to the spy flight (what else could it do?) but maintained that it hadnot been authorized in Washington. This was weak, and everyone knew it.Therefore, on May 9, Eisenhower reversed the State Department position, tookfull responsibility for the U-2 flight, and issued a statement that was widelyinterpreted to mean that the flights over Soviet territory would continue.Khrushchev, indignant, stormed out of a much-heralded summit conference.122[index_split_260.html#filepos1527572]Khrushchev played the U-2 affair exceedingly well, but none of this changedAmerican policy. Here is a snapshot of mid-1960. In May, the CIA sponsored thecovert arrival of the first Cubans in Guatemala and soon built a secretairstrip. The U.S. Ambassador was generally aware of the operation, but stayedclear since it was black. Meanwhile, the CIA was deeply involved in theelections of the former Belgian Congo, newly independent. The Congo had themisfortune to be the site of some of the world’s richest mineral deposits,including high-grade uranium. It was therefore a universal target of domination,a game won by the Americans. In June, the CIA began providing arms to theanti-Trujillo underground in the Dominican Republic. In July, it made a paymentto arrange for an “accident” to Raul Castro, Fidel’s brother. In August, theagency’s Office of Medical Services poisoned cigars destined for Fidel.Meanwhile, J. Edgar Hoover assiduously recorded JFK’s reckless womanizing at theDemocratic convention, and may have fed this information to his friend LyndonJohnson to use for blackmail purposes against Kennedy, perhaps even to influenceJFK’s choice of a running mate.123 [index_split_260.html#filepos1527721]"},{"pageContent":"MID-1960: NICAP PRESSES CONGRESS ONCE AGAIN While 1960 was a busy year for the covert world, UFO reports were scarce. Notonly within the United States, but worldwide, flying saucers seemed todisappear. The few interesting sightings cannot obscure the fact that, by now,the fight to end UFO secrecy had become more engaging than the sightingsthemselves. Nevertheless, a few incidents are worth mentioning from this period.On May 14, 1960, a six-state area in Brazil experienced an unusual number of UFOsightings. One of these included a sighting of small, pale, human-like beingsstanding near two landed discs near Paracura, Ceara State (northeast Brazil).The beings beckoned to the witness, named Raimondo dos Santos, who fled. Heclaimed they wore blue uniforms and white helmets. Later, with others, he foundmarks in the sand where the crafts had rested.

A tracking cameraat the Grumman Aircraft plant on Long Island had apparently photographed theobject, which was believed to be three times faster than the satellite Echo I,and traveled from east to west, rather than the west-to-east path followed byartificial satellites.127 [index_split_260.html#filepos1528374]On October 3, announced a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation news-cast, six“flying saucers” and a “mother ship” were reported from the Australian islandstate of Tasmania. A Church of England minister claimed to see the craft but hadbeen reluctant to report them. He finally did report the matter when otherpeople in the area claimed to see the objects.128[index_split_260.html#filepos1528522]On the evening of December 9, 1960, in Carignan, France, three witnesses saw aglowing object in a park, about twelve feet in diameter, with vague shadowsinside. A circle of yellowed grass was found at the site after it took off.129[index_split_260.html#filepos1528662]The lack of current UFO reports weakened NICAP’s hand in its bid for open UFOhearings. During the first half of 1960, Keyhoe spoke at length with CongressmanJohn McCormack, urging him to consider holding another congressionalinvestigation. According to Keyhoe, McCormack believed that UFOs were “real” andnot familiar objects or delusions. In June, NICAP sent a confidential report tomembers of Congress outlining its accumulated UFO evidence. In early July,members of the Senate Preparedness Committee, and the House Science andAstronautics Committee, requested an air force briefing on the UFO program. TheCIA also asked to attend. The air force gave a major briefing on July 15 beforea number of people: Congressmen Richard Smart (Armed Services Committee),Spencer Bereford (House Science and Astronautics Committee), Richard Hines, andFrank Hammit, and two men from the CIA (Richard Payne, technical advisor, andJohn Warner, assistant for legislative liaison to Allen Dulles). Air forcerepresentatives included Tacker, Friend, Hynek, and three generals. This meetingwas somewhat antagonistic, especially because of Smart, who charged the airforce with withholding information and said he expected to be informed of allsignificant sightings. Still, the air force succeeded in preventing openhearings and avoiding significant changes.130[index_split_260.html#filepos1528804]Again, the air force knew that NICAP had provided most of the initiative behindthe anti-secrecy rumblings in Congress and was none too pleased. On July 26,Tacker stated that there was “absolutely no truth in the charge that the airforce or any other governmental agency [was] withholding information on thesubject of UFOs from the general public.”131[index_split_260.html#filepos1528983]But of course, such a statement could not possibly be true, no matter how onechose to interpret the meaning of UFOs. By July 1960, the United States hadeleven small satellites in orbit, and the Soviet Union had sent a single largesatellite. All of these objects were following predictable paths. According toNewsweek, however, tracking gear seemed to show something else in orbit.Certainly, an American satellite program would be interested in this developmentbut would not want to publicize such a thing. Within this context, the U.S.launched its first truly successful spy satellite on August 10, 1960. This wasDiscoverer, which had a camera so powerful that its photos could resolve imagesas small as three feet. (This turned out to be an embarrassment for the airforce, which had been hammering its missile gap agenda, now irrefutably provenwrong.) Days later, on August 15, the secretary of the air force wrote a memotitled “Air Force Keeping Watchful Eye on Aerospace.” It stated:> The air force maintains a continuous surveillance of the atmosphere for> unidentified flying objects.... There is a relationship between the air> force’s interest in space surveillance and its continuous surveillance of the> atmosphere near Earth for unidentified flying objects—UFOs. It would be difficult to state the matter any clearer, and yet the message, onceagain, eluded the larger public.132 [index_split_260.html#filepos1529130]Matters dragged on through the fall and winter with no change. In November, theair force informed Congressman Smart it had “not yet” implemented his requestsfor improvements to Blue Book. On December 5, 1960, Keyhoe debated Tacker onNBC’s Today show. Tacker said he wrote his book, Flying Saucers and the U.S. AirForce, because he “felt the air force was being set upon by Major Keyhoe, NICAP,and other UFO hobby groups who believe in spaceships as an act of pure faith.”Keyhoe brought out his guns, and host David Garroway seemed to side with Keyhoe.The exchange generated many phone calls and letters to NBC, most of which werecritical of Tacker and the air force.133 [index_split_260.html#filepos1529402]The last item of significance to UFOs from 1960 was the famous BrookingsInstitution report, released on December 14, which gave credence to the conceptof extraterrestrial life. Titled “Proposed Study on the Implications of PeacefulSpace Activities for Human Affairs,” the one-hundred-page report was prepared onbehalf of NASA to discuss the implications of the space program. Because ofNASA’s status as a government agency, the report was sent to the SenateCommittee on Science and Astronautics, chaired by Overton Brooks, for approval.The report discussed much of interest to UFO researchers, such as thepossibility of finding alien artifacts on Earth and elsewhere in the solarsystem. Contact with aliens, argued the report, could be dangerous. Not onlywould it be traumatic to religious fundamentalists and scientific circles, butindeed might result in social “disintegration.” It suggested that if evidence ofextraterrestrial life were uncovered, withholding such knowledge from the publicmight be a good idea. Of course, it might not matter. In relation to UFOs, thereport stated:> It is possible that if the intelligence of these creatures were sufficiently> superior to ours, they might choose to have little if any contact with us.134> [index_split_260.html#filepos1529577] "},{"pageContent":"THE SECRET STATE IN 1960 AND 1961 By late 1960, Eisenhower was on his way out, Kennedy in. From a review of whatdeclassified information exists, it appears that America’s national securitystate went through significant expansion during this period, and, no doubtemboldened by years of secrecy and success, its activities became ever morebrazen. More exotic methods of controlling the human mind emerged, such as theinnovation by Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) biophysicist Alan Frey, whoannounced in 1961 that human beings were capable of hearing microwavebroadcasts. More traditional methods of disposing of enemies remained the rule,however. In September 1960, Sid Gottlieb of MK-Ultra prepared a lethalbiological agent intended for Patrice Lumumba, then in the protective custody ofthe United Nations. His concoction never reached Lumumba, but on January 17,1961, Lumumba was “shot trying to escape” by the troops of CIA-backed JosephMobutu.135 [index_split_260.html#filepos1529952]By October 1960, as Castro’s poisoned cigars were ready, the CIA decided that aforce of perhaps one hundred Cubans would make a landing in Cuba in late autumn.This was planned to be a major, well-trained guerrilla group within Cuba and arallying point for other guerrilla groups. In November, the CIA beganairdropping supplies into Cuba. President-elect Kennedy was soon briefed on theCuban operation (11/17/60) by Dulles and Bissell at Palm Beach and gave thego-ahead.136 [index_split_260.html#filepos1530161]Eisenhower, still president, finally learned of SAC’s war plan in late November,called the Single Integrated Operational Plan, or SIOP The plan distressed him:ten nations would be totally obliterated, and 500 million people would die. Bythis time, the United States had roughly twenty-three thousand nuclear warheadsin its arsenal, and Eisenhower probably realized that he had lost command overAmerica’s nuclear arsenal.Dwight Eisenhower delivered his farewell address on January 17, 1961. It becamefamous for introducing the phrase “military-industrial complex.” His keystatement:> We annually spend more on military security than the net income of all United> States corporations. This conjunction of an immense military establishment and> a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total> influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every> statehouse, every office of the federal government.... In the councils of> government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,> whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential> for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. Famous last words, but they could not undo the damage of eight years ofalternately encouraging and acquiescing in the growth of that complex.137[index_split_260.html#filepos1530335]The CIA’s Cuban operation was the main subterranean event of 1961. Eisenhowerbroke off relations with Cuba on January 3. Sketchy reports in The Nation, theNew York Times, and the Miami Herald described the Guatemalan base but failed tobreak into the mainstream. By February, the CIA-fostered guerrilla movementwithin Cuba had collapsed. In early April, the State Department accused Castro’sregime of offering “a clear and present danger” to the Americas, and Kennedysoon felt compelled to announce that no U.S. forces would invade Cuba. Withindays, however, American-supplied B-26s tried to destroy the Cuban air force, butonly alerted the Cubans. Still, the CIA told the Cuban pilots in Guatemala thatCastro’s planes had been destroyed. When Kennedy gave his final go-ahead, theplan had no chance to succeed. Why do it, then? Bissell may have thought eventswould force Kennedy to commit American troops. If so, he was mistaken.138[index_split_260.html#filepos1530479]The invasion took place at Cuba’s Bay of Pigs on Monday morning, April 17, 1961,as State Department and White House spokesmen denied all knowledge. Six of theeleven B-26s were lost, and the exile brigade withered quickly on the Cubanbeaches. The next evening, Bissell desperately asked Kennedy to authorize theuse of navy jets. Kennedy, knowing that plausible deniability was at thebreaking point, first said no, then relented to allow unmarked navy jets tosupport the B-26s for one hour, purely defensively. The navy fliers arrived atthe wrong time; no one remembered their time zone was one hour off. Theoperation ended in disaster.139 [index_split_260.html#filepos1530734]Kennedy was determined that CIA heads would roll, and they did, just in time forthe opening of the new Langley headquarters. On September 27, Allen Dullesresigned as DCI; Rockefeller associate John A. McCone replaced him. Bissell soonleft clandestine services, replaced by Richard Helms. Charles Cabell, who playeda small but crucial role in the invasion’s failure, was also gone. But despitenew faces, little changed. If anything, the debacle heightened Kennedy’s burningdesire to get Castro the hell out of Cuba. The result was Operation Mongoose, a“full court press” against Cuba that included coup attempts, contamination ofexports, and counterfeiting, often with Mafia assistance. Ironically, the SovietUnion also tried to remove Fidel, who was not especially servile in the earlyyears. Castro’s security forces disabled a KGB-organized plot against him in thefall of 1961.140 [index_split_260.html#filepos1530885]The last key event of 1961 was the birth of the Defense Intelligence Agency onOctober 1, 1961. The DIA was mandated to coordinate all military intelligenceand became an instant competitor to the CIA. Interservice rivalries, however,impeded its effectiveness. Before long, the DIA was an unwieldy organization“rutted with independent intelligence fiefdoms and esoteric study groups.”141[index_split_260.html#filepos1531115]"},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN 1961 The trend of scant UFO sightings continued in 1961. Some were interesting forthe attention they received; others simply in their own right. During thetest-firing of a Polaris missile at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 10, “anunidentifiable object,” much larger than the missile itself, tracked it, and gotso close that radar momentarily locked on to it, according to official logs. Theincident made it to the NICAP files and was reported in the January 1965 issueof True magazine.142 [index_split_260.html#filepos1531346]On January 22, at Eglin AFB in Florida, a metallic-looking and elliptical UFOapproached from over the Gulf, made a U-turn, and sped back. A civilianapparently photographed it on 8 mm movie film. From February 5 to 7, several UFOreports came from Maine describing strange lights in the sky. Some of theseblinked and moved up and down. Local press wrote, “The military had us justabout convinced that no such objects existed. The only trouble was that manypeople—good, reliable observers—continued to see these things.” In Antarctica onMarch 16, a meteorologist saw an odd, multicolored, fireball-like object.143[index_split_260.html#filepos1531493]On April 18, just six days after Yury Gagarin became the first person to orbitthe Earth, and while the Bay of Pigs invasion was disintegrating, a strange UFOencounter allegedly took place at Eagle River, Wisconsin. At 11 A.M., JoeSimonton claimed to hear a whining sound and then saw a craft, thirty feet indiameter and twelve feet high, resting on his property. A man about five feettall appeared from the craft; he wore a black, turtleneck pullover with a whiteband at the belt and black trousers with a vertical white band along the side.Inside the craft, Simonton discerned two more figures; he said all threeresembled “Italians.” The strange man held up a metallic jug, which Simontontook and filled with water. He noticed one man frying on a flameless grill andmotioned for some food. He received three ordinary pancakes or cookies, aboutthree inches in diameter, perforated with small holes. Soon after, the craftdeparted. The air force investigated the case and even analyzed the pancakes,finding them to be entirely ordinary, except for the lack of any salt. The casewas inconclusive: nothing ever pointed to a hoax, but little evidence supportedanything more.144 [index_split_260.html#filepos1531637]The rest of 1961 provided few, albeit intriguing, reports. On April 29, 1961,near Newport, Rhode Island, a man on the beach saw a spherical object bobbing onthe waves two hundred yards out. It then rose about sixty feet and took off in astraight line out to sea at an estimated 100 mph. Another water-related incidentoccurred in Savona, Italy, early on June 3. Four people in a boat were shaken bygrowing waves; at some distance, they saw the sea swell up, and a cone-shapedobject emerge. It hovered briefly over the water, showed a glowing underside,then left at high speed.145 [index_split_260.html#filepos1531807]In Exeter, England, on June 19, a flying object was reported to have hovered forover an hour above an airport. The object appeared on radar and was observed“for some time.” It appeared to be large, highly reflective, and about fiftythousand feet high. Officials were baffled.146[index_split_260.html#filepos1532001]A month later, on July 17 at 2 A.M. in Las Vegas, Nevada, two people travelingon U.S. Highway 91 saw a low-flying object in the rearview mirror that overtooktheir car, bringing a rush of cold air. The object stopped, circled the vehicle,then flew off behind the mountains, where the witnesses believed it might havelanded. Vallee said the ensuing military investigation was “exceptionallycomplete,” yet no one found evidence of a landing.147[index_split_260.html#filepos1532141]Another low-flying UFO was seen by car passengers sometime around August 25,1961, in Toulouse, France. Five people claimed to see a luminous, yellow sphere,about twenty-five feet in diameter, flying about thirty-five feet above theroad. The object ascended rapidly when the car reached town.148[index_split_260.html#filepos1532283]On September 18, Fourth Officer G. Gendall of the vessel Queensland Star, in theIndian Ocean, reported seeing a white-colored UFO through a cloud formation. Itvanished into the clouds, reappeared, then descended into the sea. Thesurrounding water then grew bright, and white particles fell into the sea forsome time.149 [index_split_260.html#filepos1532425]"},{"pageContent":"1961: ANOTHER ROUND WITH CONGRESS By early 1961, the air force gave Blue Book slightly more money and staff, whichappeased Congressman Smart, but which affected neither operations nor publicstatements. An air force release from January 19, 1961, stated the old news that“... no physical or material evidence, not even a minute fragment of a so-called‘flying saucer’ or spaceship has ever been found.” The Soviet Union issuedsimilar statements. On January 9, 1961, Pravda denounced Soviet citizens whoreported UFOs as “either feebleminded or delicate liars.”150[index_split_260.html#filepos1532572]In March, Maj. Lawrence Tacker used his strongest language to date on UFOs.Claims for UFOs were either “absolutely erroneous,” “a hoax,” “sensationaltheories,” or the work of “amateur hobby groups.” NICAP’s evidence was “drivel,”its claims “ridiculous,” and it made “senseless accusations.” In April, the airforce reassigned Tacker to Europe. He had been associated with the UFO projectfor three years and had written a book on the subject, but his UFO career wasnow abruptly over.151 [index_split_260.html#filepos1532732]Despite official statements, some prominent people remained interested in UFOs.In March 1961, House Majority Leader McCormack privately told Donald Keyhoe hehad urged a UFO investigation by the Science and Astronautics Committee.Pressure was rising in Congress against UFO secrecy. In May, Congress announceda new UFO investigation to be headed by Congressman Joseph Karth of Minnesota.Among other things, the plan called for a statement by Hillenkoetter. NICAP alsoreleased a joint statement by twenty-one American scientists which demanded anopen investigation of UFOs without secrecy, the need for the air force toimprove its manner of investigation, and disclosure of all facts on major UFOsightings. By June, Congress had received many requests for an investigation ofUFOs.152 [index_split_260.html#filepos1532872]Before matters could reach a breakthrough, however, they fizzled out. The airforce wasted no time to kill the investigation and briefed key congressionalcommittees in private between July 11 and 15, 1961. Once again, that was the endof the matter. Keyhoe seemed undaunted and continued to push for open hearings,full disclosure of UFO secrecy, and a government body authorized to release UFOdata to the public. He thought it was still possible to make something happenduring 1961, but began to consider early 1962 as more realistic.153[index_split_260.html#filepos1533032]Soon enough, the air force Office of Legislative Liaison learned of Keyhoe’s newplans and directed its efforts toward heading them off. On August 4, 1961, Rep.Thomas W. Downing sent a letter to NICAP, advising them that “an investigationof the UFO phenomenon [was] being contemplated by the Science and AstronauticsCommittee.” He believed that Congressman Joseph Karth might serve as chairman ofthe three-man subcommittee. Meanwhile, Sen. Overton Brooks met privately withHillenkoetter and Keyhoe. According to Keyhoe, Brooks asked them to bring a“cross section of [NICAP’s] strongest and best-documented evidence, also proofof official censorship.” Brooks set a UFO congressional conference for August24.But the Blue Book staff was also at work. In mid-August, Friend briefedCongressman Richard Hines on Blue Book’s operation, which favorably impressedhim, and “enlightened” him about Keyhoe’s intentions. Accompanying Friend onthis mission was J. Allen Hynek, who continued to provide valuable service tohis benefactor, the air force, while helping to undermine NICAP. Hinesimmediately wrote back to Friend, informing him that Brooks had decided not topursue UFO hearings after all. That would be putting it mildly. Overton Brookssuddenly became ill and died. Brooks’s successor was Congressman George P.Miller of California, who stated that he would not order UFO hearings.154[index_split_260.html#filepos1533215]Once again, Roscoe Hillenkoetter placed himself on the public record for endingUFO secrecy. On August 22, 1961, he signed a NICAP letter to Congress urgingimmediate congressional action on the matter. It must have impressed a fewmembers of Congress that a former director of the CIA should continually takesuch a stand on this matter:> Acting with the majority of the NICAP Board of Governors, I urge immediate> congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified> flying objects.... Two dangers are steadily increasing:> > > 1. The risk of accidental war, from mistaking UFO formations for a Soviet> > surprise attack.> > > 2. The danger that the Soviet government may, in a critical moment, falsely> > claim the UFOs as secret Russian weapons against which our defenses are> > helpless.> > Shortly after this (8/28), Karth sent a harsh letter to Keyhoe, attacking himfor a “headline-seeking” desire to grandstand in a direct confrontation with theair force. “I am not a captive of the air force,” wrote Karth. Keyhoe apparentlysmoothed matters over, and on September 19, Karth wrote to Keyhoe that, “nowthat we better understand each other,” perhaps they could proceed with a newhearing early in 1962, “providing that the new chairman authorizes hearings.”But Miller, the new chairman, had no such intention. Another year was passing,and still no congressional hearings on UFOs. NICAP was chasing its tail.155[index_split_260.html#filepos1533394]"},{"pageContent":"THE HILL ABDUCTION CASE The case of Antonio Villas-Boas aside, the modern alien abduction era can besaid to have started on September 19, 1961, near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Acouple driving at night lost over two hours without realizing it after seeing aUFO at close range. Under hypnosis much later, they gave detailed and similaraccounts, which in turn correspond closely to many abduction claims starting inthe 1970s.156 [index_split_260.html#filepos1533558]Barney and Betty Hill were socially aware and politically active citizens.Barney, thirty-nine, was the legal redress chairman of the Portsmouth NAACP, amember of the state advisory board of the United States Civil Rights Commission,and on the board of the Rockingham County Poverty Program. He also served threeyears in the army during World War II, and had received several awards for hiscommunity work. Betty, forty-one, was a state social worker known for her workwith the poor; she also assisted the NAACP and was the United Nations envoy forher Unitarian-Universalist Church.On the night of September 19, 1961, the Hills were driving home with their dog,Delsey, from a vacation. At 10:05 P.M., they left a diner in Colebrook, NewHampshire, and drove south along U.S. Route 3. Barney predicted they would gethome by around 2:30 A.M., or 3 A.M. “at the latest.”Shortly after leaving Colebrook, they were puzzled by an object with an“unpredictable movement.” Barney, a strict rationalist who was indifferent toUFOs, first thought it was a satellite, then a star. Betty discounted bothexplanations as ridiculous, especially after the object erratically changed itscourse. Then it must be a commercial plane, said Barney. Betty was unpersuaded.Through binoculars, she saw the object’s silhouette against the moon. She latersaid it “appeared to be flashing thin pencils of different colored lights,rotating around an object which at that time appeared cigar-shaped.”Barney continued to maintain the object had to be a plane, even after it changedits speed several times. He did admit, however, that it seemed to be trackingthem and “playing games.” They drove on to Cannon Mountain at about five milesper hour while Delsey whined and cowered. The object then descended to a fewhundred feet. As it did so, it became clear to them that it was huge—a“structured craft of enormous dimension.” Betty noticed a double row of windows.Both were terrified.Barney stopped the car in the middle of the highway and got out, motor stillrunning. The object had swung toward them and hovered “not more than twotreetops away.” It was tilted and looked like a large, glowing pancake. It thenswung in a silent arc directly across the road. Barney walked across a fieldtoward the craft, possibly to within a hundred feet of it. Betty screamed afterhim, but he did not hear her. Now he, too, saw a double row of windows, and atleast six figures inside. They seemed to be wearing uniforms and stared directlyat him. Barney recalled thinking that one of them appeared to be the leader, buthis memory became blurred at this point. He remembered running back to the car,screaming and hysterical. Back in the car and driving again, the two heard astrange electronic beeping sound, which seemed to vibrate the car. They felt anodd tingling sensation, and a drowsiness overcame them.After some time had passed, the beeping sound repeated itself, theirconsciousness returned, the car was moving, and Barney was still driving. Theywere now near Ashland, thirty-five miles south of where the first beeping soundhad occurred. Finally, at 5 A.M., they arrived home, “a little later thanexpected,” Barney noted.Immediately and inexplicably, Barney felt an urge to examine his abdomen andbecame aware of an unexplained soreness on the back of his neck. Nor could heexplain why the tops of his shoes were so badly scuffed. He later commented, “Ididn’t know why at the time, but I felt unclean.” The sighting still baffledhim, but he continued to contend it was a known aircraft, in spite of its totalsilence and other unconventional features.Although both agreed to tell no one about their encounter, Betty called hersister, Janet, who had seen a UFO in 1957. Janet repeated the story to aphysicist neighbor, who suggested that an ordinary compass might show evidenceof radiation. Janet passed that on to Betty, who took a compass to her car.Barney opposed dwelling on the event, but he and Betty noticed a dozen or moreshiny circles scattered on the surface of their trunk, all perfectly circularand the size of a silver dollar. The circles were highly magnetic.Janet also described the incident to a former local police chief, who suggestedthe Hills notify Pease AFB in Portsmouth. Betty was afraid she had been exposedto radioactivity, and called. She gave only the bare details to the officer onthe phone (not mentioning, for example, the double row of windows or the shinyspots on the car). Barney also spoke to the officer, who informed him the callwas being monitored. Whereas Betty had felt the officer was “cynical anduncommunicative,” Barney thought he was “intensely interested.” The base calledback the next day for more details, but received little more from the Hills.That appears to be the sum total of the Blue Book investigation into the Hillcase. Two years later, on September 27, 1963, its final report cited“insufficient evidence” to make a determination, although the author of thereport stated the object “was in all probability Jupiter,” and that “no evidencewas presented to indicate that the object was due to other than natural causes.”For now, however, intrigued by their encounter, the Hills decided to draw theobject from memory while in separate rooms; the drawings were remarkablysimilar. Betty decided to learn more about UFOs and found Keyhoe’s The FlyingSaucer Conspiracy in the local library. On September 26, 1961, she wrote toKeyhoe, describing their experience (mentioning the windows and figures) andrequesting more information. Then, beginning around September 29, and continuingfor five consecutive nights, Betty Hill began having a series of awesome andvivid dreams. These were far more intense than anything she had ever experiencedand even dominated her waking life. They involved encountering a strangeroadblock on a lonely road and being approached by a group of men, all dressedalike. As they reached the car, she became unconscious, then awakened to findherself and Barney aboard a strange craft, being given a complete medicalexamination by “intelligent, humanoid beings.” Barney was taken down a corridor,and both were assured that no harm would come to them, and that they wouldforget everything that happened.On October 4 and 5, 1961, two more individuals, C. D. Jackson and Robert Hohman,entered the story. Jackson (presumably not the C. D. Jackson with extensiveintelligence and journalistic connections) was a “senior engineer” for a companythat no one would specify, but which was “one of the world’s most notablecorporations in the electronic industry.” Hohman worked for the same company asa staff scientific writer on engineering and science. The two were in Washingtonfor the Twelfth International Astronautical Congress, as part of their “regularroutine.” They were “deeply involved” in work on the space program and were inthe process of preparing a paper on Nikola Tesla, David Todd, and Marconi tosuggest that these men were monitoring interplanetary communications between1899 and 1924—possibly from Tau Ceti. Incredible as this sounds, both Keyhoe andjournalist John Fuller attested to it. (Jackson and Hohman are odd and shadowyfigures in this episode, but recall William Lear’s earlier comments regardingsecret research in the aerospace industry on antigravity propulsionmethods—clearly related to UFOs.) Jackson and Hohman were also members of NICAPand arranged for lunch with Keyhoe to gain relevant UFO data for their research.When Hohman said that UFO reports seemed to be dropping in frequency, Keyhoeshowed them Betty Hill’s letter, which he had just received. The two wereimpressed.On October 19, NICAP secretary Richard Hall wrote to Walter Webb, a lecturer atthe Hayden Planetarium in Boston and NICAP scientific advisor. Would Webbinvestigate the Hill case? Initially reluctant, he met with the Hills on October21, confident he would find holes in their story. Instead, he interviewed themfor eight hours. In his words, he was> so amazed, so impressed by both the Hills and their account that we skipped> lunch and went right through the afternoon and early evening. During that> time, I cross-examined them together, separately, together, requestioned them> again and again. I tried to make them slip up somewhere, and I couldn’t.> Theirs was an ironclad story. They seemed to me to be a sincere, honest couple> driving home from vacation late at night on a lonely road, when suddenly> something completely unknown and undefinable descended on them. Something> entirely foreign or alien to their existence. If anything, Webb felt the Hills underplayed the dramatic aspects of theirencounter. The three were so caught up in the account that the Hills forgot toshow Webb the spots on the car, although they mentioned them. Barney, meanwhile,was still running up against a “curtain,” beyond which he could go no further.Webb’s report to NICAP on October 26 gave great detail on the interview andconcluded that the two were telling the truth. As far as Webb was concerned, theincident occurred just as they claimed.On November 5, Hohman wrote to the Hills, mentioning his and Jackson’s interestin their encounter, and asked to meet them. He and Jackson, wrote Hohman, had a“close familiarity with most of the unclassified (military) literature” on UFOs.The two mystery investigators met with the Hills on November 25, 1961. Alsovisiting the Hills that day was Maj. James McDonald, a recently retired airforce intelligence officer and a close friend who had already discussed the case“many times” with them. The five discussed the encounter for nearly twelvehours, during which Hohman and Jackson asked several obscure and technicalquestions. One of them asked, “What took you so long to get home?” When Bettyand Barney realized that they could not account for over two hours, they were“flabbergasted.” McDonald suggested they undergo hypnosis, but no one couldsuggest anyone specific.The holiday season came and went, and in February 1962, the Hills—due to Betty’sinitiative and Barney’s acquiescence—began a series of pilgrimages to the sceneof their encounter, which continued for several months. By March, she waslooking for a psychiatrist who used hypnotism. On March 25, 1962, the two metwith a doctor who ruled out simultaneous hallucination. That spring, Barneydeveloped a series of warts in an almost geometrically perfect circular ring inhis groin. Feeling exhausted and a general malaise, he began to see apsychiatrist. Throughout his entire period of treatment, more than a year,Barney never associated his problems with the UFO incident. Meanwhile, he andBetty put aside the idea of hypnosis.In September 1963, the Hills were invited by their church to a discussion abouttheir UFO experience, which was taped by one of the attendees, a journalist.Another of the attendees was Capt. Ben Swett of Pease AFB, known locally for hisstudy of hypnosis. The positive reception their story received encouraged theHills, and Barney mentioned the subject during his next session. His doctorrecommended Dr. Benjamin Simon, a well-known Boston psychiatrist and neurologistwith much experience in hypnosis. Simon had also worked on an extensive scale aschief of neuropsychiatry and executive officer at Mason General Hospital, thearmy’s chief psychiatric center in World War Two.The Hills’ sessions with Simon lasted from January 4 to June 6, 1964.Throughout, they underwent separate sessions, and for most of the period theydid not remember their experiences following the sessions. These sessions wereintense, especially for Barney. Under hypnosis, he remembered driving off Route3, instructed against his will by a “mind voice” to drive deep into the woods.He saw six men standing in the road, wearing dark clothing, with a bright orangeglow behind them. Three men approached his car and told him to stay calm and toclose his eyes. Barney said, “I felt like [their] eyes had pushed into my eyes.”The men led Barney and Betty out of their car, and Barney felt his shoesdragging on the ground. They went up a ramp and inside a craft. He saw three menin an “operating room,” and he lay down on a table. His shoes were removed and acup was placed over his groin; he later believed his semen was extracted at thistime. Someone scraped his left arm, examined his ears and throat. A cylindricaldevice was inserted up his rectum, and someone counted his vertebrae.Betty’s story under hypnosis closely matched her dreams from over two yearsearlier, except that in her sessions the aliens had no hair and smaller noses. A“doctor” on board took scrapings from her skin, cut off a sample of her hair,studied her mouth, throat, ears, and hands, and took clippings from herfingernails. She was asked to lie down on an examination table, and the doctorpulled a machine over. One of the procedures involved a “pregnancy test” with aneedle, four to six inches long, which was inserted into her navel. Later, shehad time to speak with the leader, who seemed to communicate in English, butwhich Betty later believed was through telepathy. She asked if she could bringsomething back that would prove her experience to others. The leader agreed, andshe picked up a large book with strange symbols. She was forced to give it up,however, when the other crew members objected. She also asked the leader wherehe was from. He went to a wall and pulled down a strange map of space, withstars of various sizes. Many stars were connected by broken or solid lines, allcurved. The lines, said the leader, represented expeditions, but he lostinterest in explaining once he realized Betty knew little astronomy. He told hershe would forget all about this encounter; she was determined to remember.Barney’s and Betty’s accounts were extremely consistent with each other. Bothdescribed the men as about five feet tall, with gray skin, oddly shaped headswith broad foreheads. They had large eyes and spoke to each other with a hummingsound. The descriptions differed in certain details, mostly related to theappearance of the crews. (Betty said they all wore caps, Barney only recalledthe leader wearing one—although his conscious recollection to Webb was that allthe crew wore caps.)Simon discounted the possibility of alien abduction. He simply did not believein UFOs, and, according to Webb, declined to read any relevant literature on thesubject. Thus, he tried to persuade the Hills that Betty’s initial dreams hadinspired Barney’s account, which was simply a fantasy. The Hills wereunconvinced. Barney pointed out the many unique aspects of his account; indeed,he said, he wished the whole thing had been a hallucination.The Hill story became public in 1965, after their taped conversation fromseveral years earlier was released. In 1966, journalist John Fuller wrote TheInterrupted Journey, cementing their place in UFO lore. The response from UFOresearchers was mixed. Despite Webb’s strong endorsement, NICAP accepted onlythat the Hills saw occupants and considered the abduction to be “highlyquestionable.” Jerome Clark pointed out that, while all debunkers of this casetook their cue from Simon, no one mentioned that Simon was both hostile andignorant regarding UFOs. Nor could Simon’s theory explain why Barney felt traumaimmediately after the experience, before Betty even had her dreams, or accountfor the various pieces of physical evidence. Debunkers Klass and Sheaffer evenwent so far as to endorse the air force’s Jupiter explanation, losing allcredibility in the process, as far as this case was concerned.The main problem in accepting the Hill case was its novelty: stories of alienabduction were unknown in 1961. Even among UFO researchers, accustomed todealing with the unconventional, this seemed just a little too far-out. But theHills were obviously not hoaxing, nor did they seem crazy. During the 1970s, asthe abduction phenomenon became more widely claimed, discussed, andacknowledged, the case of Betty and Barney Hill seemed increasingly plausible.Indeed, if one concedes the existence of UFOs as the product of a nonhumanintelligence, and the possibility of occupants in at least some of the craft,then it is hard to accept anything other than the obvious: that Barney and BettyHill were abducted by aliens.Following the experience of Barney and Betty Hill, people continued to see UFOsat close range. One of the most compelling sightings occurred on October 2. Thiswas a classic sighting of a daylight disc that took place in Salt Lake City,Utah, by Waldo J. Harris, a private pilot and real estate broker. Harris wasabout to take off from the runway at Utah Central Airport when he saw a brightspot in the sky. He continued to see the spot after he was airborne, assuming itwas some aircraft reflecting the sun. He became curious when he realized thespot was not moving, and he moved toward it. As he did so, he could see that theobject had no wings or tail and “seemed to be hovering with a little rockingmotion.” He could now see it was a disc-shaped object, between thirty-five andfifty feet in diameter and perhaps five or ten feet thick. It looked like“sandblasted aluminum,” showed no windows, openings, or landing gear. At abouttwo miles distant from the object, it rose suddenly about one thousand feetabove him, affording a clear view of the underside, which seemed exactly likethe top side. He continued to approach the object, when it departed abruptly andwas gone in about two or three seconds. Harris said, “I can keep our fastestjets in sight for several minutes, so you can see that this object was movingrather rapidly.” He later described the speed as in the thousands of miles perhour. Others at the airport also saw the disc, including airport controller JayGalbraith, who saw it for fifteen continuous minutes; at least six others inSalt Lake City also saw it. One airport witness, Virgil S. Redmond, had justlanded when he saw the object; he watched it with others, sharing field glasses.“Whatever it was seemed to be rocking while hovering almost stationary justsouth of the field. At times, as it turned, it looked like a zeppelin,” he said.The air force investigated this case; a check with the U.S. Weather Bureauconfirmed there was no cloud cover, with visibility at forty miles. No balloonswere in the area. No air traffic was in the area that could account for thesighting.A week after the sighting, the official Blue Book report stated “all logicalleads have been exhausted in an effort to identify the object.” Yet the Pentagonoverruled Blue Book on October 11, when unnamed officers told reporters thatHarris had seen the planet Venus, or possibly a research balloon. Harris shotback that they were “really off the beam.” The object he saw “was saucer-shaped,had a gray color, and moved under intelligent control. I got within three milesof it, and that is a lot closer than Venus is. I have seen a lot of balloons,too, and this was no balloon.” It became obvious that the Venus explanation wasimpossible, and the air force dropped it. Eventually, it dropped the balloonexplanation as well. The eventual explanation was “sun dog,” also known as amock sun and parhelia. Menzel endorsed it, despite the fact that sun dogs do notmove, and that several witnesses clearly saw the object move. No one bothered totell Harris of the official explanation until atmospheric physicist JamesMacDonald asked him in 1966 if he knew what a sun dog was. (Harris did.) Bothagreed that the official explanation was impossible.157[index_split_260.html#filepos1533917]"},{"pageContent":"MOVING TO 1962 In the fall of 1961, NICAP obtained a photocopy of an air force intelligencesketch of a flying saucer. This came from a restricted manual for intelligenceofficers titled AFM 200-3. Somebody in the military had forgotten to reclassifyit as Confidential when the Restricted classification was canceled. 158[index_split_260.html#filepos1534077] More information slipped out fromunmanageable sources. In November 1961, Wilbert Smith was speaking at length inan interview with two Ohio UFO researchers, C. W Fitch and George Popovitch. Hereiterated that he had handled “quite a bit” of UFO hardware and some “verystrange metal,” which had been recovered around July 1, 1960. He said:> We are speculating that what we have is a portion of a very large device which> came into this solar system ... we don’t know when ... but it had been in> space a long time before it came to Earth; we can tell by the micrometeorites> embedded in the surface. But we don’t know whether it was a few years ago—or a> few hundred years ago. Smith also said that he had shown his friend and fellow NICAP board member Adm.H. B. Knowles a piece which had been shot from a small flying saucer nearWashington during the July 1952 flap, and which had been loaned to him brieflyby the U.S. Air Force. Smith emphasized that it was not the American air forcebut “a small group very high up in the government” who determined UFO policy.159[index_split_260.html#filepos1534218]Air force intelligence decided to select personnel for two secret projects inNovember 1961: Moon Dust and Blue Fly. A classified memo about Moon Dust stated:> Moon Dust: As a specialized aspect of its overall material exploitation> program, Headquarters USAF has established Project Moon Dust to locate,> recover, and deliver descended foreign space vehicles.... Blue Fly: Operation> Blue Fly has been established to facilitate expeditious delivery to FTD [the> Air Force’s Foreign Technology Division based at Wright Field in Ohio] of Moon> Dust or other items of great technical intelligence interest.> > > > > > These ... peacetime projects all involve a potential for employment of> qualified field intelligence personnel on a quick reaction basis to recover or> perform field exploitation of unidentified flying objects....Journalist Howard Blum called this a UFO SWAT team. What these teams actuallydid, however, remains largely speculation. Other than this document, informationon either project is scarce. The argument can be made that these two projectswere related to terrestrial satellites. Still, the inclusion of the phrase“unidentified flying objects” appears to make the connection with unconventionalcraft explicit.160 [index_split_260.html#filepos1534392]"},{"pageContent":"HILLENKOETTER RESIGNS FROM NICAP By early 1962, according to Keyhoe, the CIA struck at NICAP in order to block athreatened showdown which might have ended the UFO cover-up. This is entirelyplausible. Although NICAP had lost battle after battle, it continued to fightdoggedly on. In February, a plan was germinating among congressmen to end UFOsecrecy using a statement by Roscoe Hillenkoetter, by far NICAP’s mostprestigious member. Keyhoe was involved in these machinations and met with “acongressman who had strongly supported Karth” to discuss the strategy ofbringing the UFO matter to the congressional floor. This congressman confirmedto Keyhoe that Hillenkoetter would be a key person involved. Keyhoe thereforeplanned to see Hillenkoetter directly at his residence in New York. Thetelephone did not seem like a good idea.Before leaving, Keyhoe decided to check into a UFO report he received from alead by Delmar Fahrney. The story concerned a navy pilot named George Brent.While flying a navy transport plane near Newfoundland, Brent and his crew got aclose-up view of a “huge flying disc with a glow around the rim.” They believedit to be “well over” three hundred feet in diameter and at least thirty feetthick at the center. They saw a reflecting surface, apparently smooth metal.After a rapid approach and near collision, the crew saw the object for anotherten seconds before it zoomed away. Air force intelligence officers interrogatedBrent and the entire crew; he was later shown secret photos of UFOs, one ofwhich portrayed a disc like the one he saw. Brent was also interviewed atWright-Patterson AFB, although no one there would answer any of his questions.This account was undated but occurred (according to one of Keyhoe’s sources)“some time back.”Seeing more ammunition for a congressional investigation, Keyhoe sought to getmore detail on this case. He contacted a former navy man—using the pseudonym ofJack Morton—and asked Morton to find out where Brent was currently stationed.Morton believed the navy had flagged Brent’s file, which meant that personnelwould refuse requests for information and report any queries. Despite this, forsome reason, Morton thought he could get the information for Keyhoe. Severaldays passed with no word from Morton. Keyhoe finally reached him after repeatedcalls to his house. “That navy call,” said Morton, “raised hell.” Less than anhour after his inquiry, he said, two CIA agents were at his door and gave him“the third degree.” They demanded to know who wanted Brent’s address and why.Morton ended up telling the CIA agents everything about the congressional plan,including Hillenkoetter’s role. “For heaven’s sake,” Morton told Keyhoe, “don’ttry to call or see me again.”Keyhoe did not get the chance to see Hillenkoetter. Immediately after theincident with Morton, Keyhoe received a letter from Hillenkoetter whichannounced his resignation from NICAP and stated that he decided not to proceedwith any UFO investigation or announcement. The air force, said Hillenkoetter,was doing all it could. Keyhoe knew Hillenkoetter, his former Annapolisclassmate, well. Hillenkoetter had been “absolutely convinced” that the UFOcover-up should be exposed. “The only answer,” decided Keyhoe, “was persuasionat a very high level.” It is hard to credit any other interpretation. The onlyquestion is why would Hillenkoetter be pressured, and what means were used. Themore benign interpretations are that Hillenkoetter’s statements were of“considerable embarrassment” to the CIA. In the context of clear indications ofpressure on Ruppelt, it appears that embarrassment was only the beginning of theproblem. As far as the manner used, we can only say that it seems unlikely thatHillenkoetter would have backed down following a mere request.161[index_split_260.html#filepos1534548]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY For five years, despite some hopeful moments, NICAP had tried and failed todeliver the goods. In 1962, a congressional hearing on UFOs was as far away asever. Keyhoe, who early on had predicted a NICAP membership of 100,000, couldnot seem to get it much past 5,000, and the organization was in financialstraits from the beginning. On the other side, the air force, CIA, NSA, andother intelligence organizations involved in UFOs had enormous reserves ofmoney, secrecy, and power. NICAP had given it a good effort but was out of itsdepth and sinking slowly but surely.UFOs themselves continued to appear in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but withmuch less frequency than in previous years. Clearly, this helped the secrecy,but was also to some extent the result of secrecy. We simply do not know howmany sightings were recorded through unofficial channels. That said, the periodwas a quiet one but saw steady numbers of up-close sightings and the developmentof something new: claims by credible individuals to have been abducted byaliens. In the early 1960s, almost no one took these seriously, but thephenomenon had begun nonetheless.Also, the handling of this problem appears to have gone deeper underground.There are many indications of various “unofficial” dealings with the UFOproblem, well beyond the authority of ATIC and Blue Book. The NSA and CIAcertainly fit in here, but so do air force programs like Moon Dust.Finally, there appears little doubt that some organization was pressuringindividuals into silence and worse regarding UFOs. Ruppelt and Hillenkoetter areundeniable examples of this, and we must remember that agencies such as the CIAoperated with almost total impunity during this period, carrying out grandioseand at times horrific schemes against undesirable individuals whenever it suitedtheir needs. The UFO cover-up restricted more than the flow of information; ittargeted people, as well."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7 Open Confrontation: 1962 to 1966 > After talking with both officers involved in the sighting, there is no doubt> in my mind that they definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon. —Air force investigating officer, reporting a Blue Book unidentified, September1965> > > > I think there may be substance in some of these reports and because> I believe the American people are entitled to a more thorough explanation> than has been given them by the air force to date.—Congressman Gerald R.

The war in Vietnam opened a permanentcultural chasm and estrangement among Americans. Civil rights, black power,feminism, gay rights, and the generation gap distinguished the era. It was adecade of assassinations: the Kennedy brothers, Malcolm X, and Martin LutherKing, Jr., to name the most prominent. Riots became widespread, many of theminflicting permanent damage on the cities where they occurred: Watts neverrecovered from 1965, and it would be a long time until Chicago again hosted anational political convention. Intellectuals challenged old assumptions aboutAmerica’s place in the world, and revolution was in the air. That thisrevolution ultimately failed did not make it any less dramatic for those wholived through it. For a while during the sixties, everything was up for grabs.The struggle to end UFO secrecy partook of the general upheaval. But here, as inmost matters, the decade started quietly. Sightings of unidentified craft wereat a low ebb and received little publicity. The air force’s heavy-handedmanagement of the problem was messy at times, but effective enough. Undesirableleaks and statements continued to occur, but only within a context of officialdismissal and ridicule which impeded forward motion. In near total mediaisolation, NICAP’s struggle for congressional hearings met with failure yearafter year. Hillenkoetter’s departure from the scene went unremarked. Keyhoe wasno longer writing books and seemed to be slowing down. NICAP did publish aremarkable collection of its UFO evidence, which it sent to members of Congress,but even this work achieved only a modest distribution. To the public, the UFOquestion appeared to be settled, with the air force getting the final word.Then, almost all at once, everything changed. By the end of 1964, UFOs beganappearing in large numbers and continued on a steady rise through 1966. Theintensity of the wave equaled the Great Wave of 1952, and surpassed it induration. By now, Blue Book had long ceased investigating most reportsfirst-hand; only rarely did it send a man to the scene of a reported sighting.Instead, the Blue Book goal was explaining away, so that of the thousands of UFOreports from the mid-1960s, only a handful remained officially unidentified, andmost of those were fairly innocuous.The actions of Blue Book had become too transparent, however. By 1966, theimpossible had happened: UFOs were a matter of public concern, and members ofCongress had even brought the matter to the floor. Suddenly, NICAP’s goal ofopen UFO hearings, independent of air force control, seemed attainable. Then, inOctober 1966, the air force announced that it had awarded a contract to theUniversity of Colorado to conduct a scientific study of UFOs. It would beindependent and serious and led by a physicist of world renown. For the moment,all sides of the UFO debate were satisfied that someone was finally doingsomething about this. It was an ephemeral satisfaction, and a grave illusion."},{"pageContent":"THE LAS VEGAS UFO CRASH On April 18, 1962, an unidentified, red, glowing object was seen moving westvery rapidly over Oneida, New York. Was it a meteor? If so, it was quiteunusual. In the first place, it was tracked on radar, which, while possible, isexceedingly rare. Second, as it passed across the country, Air Defense Commandalerted all bases along its path, and at least two air force bases—Luke AFB nearPhoenix and Nellis AFB in Nevada—sent jet interceptors after it. Why pursue ameteor? Finally, the entire sighting—from New York to Nevada—lasted thirty-twominutes. This gives an average speed of 4,500 mph, well below the slowest speedever recorded for a meteor. 1 [index_split_261.html#filepos1534835]When the object passed over Nephi, Utah, people on the ground heard jetsfollowing it. The object then landed at Eureka, Utah. Several witnesses saw itas a “glowing, orange oval which emitted a low, whirring sound.” When it landed,it disrupted the electrical service from a nearby power station. It then rose,maneuvered, and headed toward Nevada. It was seen at Reno, then turned south andwas spotted somewhat east of Las Vegas, when it went off the radar screens. Manywitnesses saw it as a “tremendous flaming sword.” By now, it had been seen bythousands of people. It exploded near Mesquite, Nevada, at which time it wasbeing pursued by armed jet interceptors from Nellis AFB.The Las Vegas Sun reported the incident in its April 19 edition under theheadline, “Brilliant Red Explosion Flares in Las Vegas Sky.” The articlebroached the UFO topic and mentioned the air force alert in several states. TheClark County sheriff’s office was swamped with calls, investigated the incident,but found nothing of consequence. On May 8, 1962, the air force sent Blue Bookchief Robert Friend and J. Allen Hynek to investigate. Their results were quiteunsatisfactory. The two did not go to Nevada, but confined themselves to centralUtah. Despite their knowledge that jets had pursued the object, they concludedit was a bolide, an especially fiery meteor.Blue Book ultimately listed the sighting as two separate incidents, in a mannerso slippery and misleading that intentional deception seems likely. First, itlisted an April 18 multiple radar sighting at Nellis AFB, which it initiallylabeled as unidentified, then changed to “Insufficient Data for a ScientificAnalysis.” The report noted that the object’s speed varied, that it wasinitially observed at ground level, then disappeared at ten thousand feet. Itstated “no visual,” despite the many people in Las Vegas who telephoned thesheriff’s office. The “second” incident, investigated by Hynek and Friend inUtah, was listed as a bolide, and said to occur on April nineteenth. Except thatthis was uniquely logged in Zulu, or Greenwich Mean Time, which added sevenhours and thus gave the wrong date! In reality, the Utah and Nevada sightingsoccurred within minutes of each other (around 8:15 P.M. Mountain Time or 7:15P.M. Pacific Time). Even so, the official file on the Utah incident concededthat the power in Eureka was knocked out and that fighters had been scrambledfrom Nellis AFB.On September 21, 1962, Maj. C. R. Hart of the air force Public InformationOffice responded to a letter from a New York State resident about the UFO. Airforce records, he said, listed the April 18 Nevada sighting as “insufficientdata” but stated that the object’s movement suggested a “U-2 or high balloon.”He also stated that it was “not intercepted or fired upon.” All of the claimsand suggestions in this letter were entirely wrong. A U-2 is fast, but not Mach7 fast, and the idea of a balloon causing the sighting was absurd. Moreover, thejuxtaposition of a U-2 and balloon as alternate explanations was nonsensical:their respective movements and speeds were totally distinct.For the next few years, only Frank Edwards mentioned this incident, and heconfined himself to the Sun article. Much later, Kevin Randle dug deeper,interviewed many witnesses, and reviewed the Blue Book files, where hediscovered the time discrepancy. Randle also communicated with an anonymous manwho claimed to be an officer at Nellis AFB at the time of the crash. He andthirty others, claimed the man, were driven into the desert early the nextmorning to retrieve the crash debris. They were loaded into a bus withblacked-out windows, but one window was not entirely covered, and the manclaimed to have seen a damaged saucer-shaped craft.Although no independent source has confirmed the story, we may at leastacknowledge that an object able to scramble jet interceptors from two air bases,and apparently crashed, would warrant a top-level military retrieval. This muchis clear: a UFO did crash or explode near Las Vegas on the evening of April 18,1962, and the air force hid the event from the public and in its officialrecords. Precisely what crashed remains unknown, but the pursuit of the objectby U.S. jets appears to preclude natural phenomenon or American experimentalaircraft as the explanation."},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN AMERICA: 1962 In February 1962, the month that Hillenkoetter was pressured to quit NICAP anddrop out of the UFO business, the air force issued the last of its old-stylefact sheets. For the next three years, it released occasional public relationspackages dealing with UFO reports, typically reevaluating (“solving”) earliercases. For all of 1962, Blue Book recorded only fourteen unidentified sightings,but the category of unknown became so diluted as to be meaningless and sobroadened that it included many vague and incomplete cases. Several of theseoccurred in the eastern U.S., through the spring and summer, of round, oval,triangular, diamond-shaped, and even rectangular objects, usually red in color,performing intricate maneuvers. Meanwhile, the air force tried hard throughoutthe year to ditch its program to places such as NASA and the National ScienceFoundation, with no success.2 [index_split_261.html#filepos1535142]As noted, the Las Vegas crash was not among the unknowns, although it was by farthe most spectacular UFO event of the year. Other good-quality sightings wereignored or mishandled by Blue Book, two of which involved American X-15aircraft. The first occurred on April 30 during Joe Walker’s record-breakingfifty-mile-high flight. Although Walker saw no object, his instrumentationphotographed five or six “cylindrical or discoid-shaped” objects. On May 11,1962, at the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space Researchin Seattle, Washington, Walker showed slides of the objects and said this hadbeen the second time they were photographed. According to the Paris paper, LeMatin, he also admitted that one of his appointed tasks was to detect UFOs. BothNICAP and the publication Flying Saucer Review tried, but failed, to obtainprints of the slides. NASA told FSR that the objects were actually ice flakingoff the aircraft, as “ice forms on the aircraft after it is filled with liquidoxygen.” No still photos were available, said NASA.3[index_split_261.html#filepos1535324]The ice explanation seems weak, if only because another X-15 pilot saw a strangeobject in space at the top of his climb on July 17, 1962. Maj. Robert White wasabout fifty-eight miles high when he saw a grayish object “about thirty to fortyfeet away.” According to Time magazine, White reportedly exclaimed during theflight, “There are things out there. There absolutely is!” Presumably he did notmean ice crystals.4 [index_split_261.html#filepos1535516]By July, the lack of UFO publicity, combined with an economic recession,contributed to an open rift between APRO and NICAP In an APRO Bulletineditorial, Coral Lorenzen wrote that NICAP was little more than a lobbyinggroup; if forced to choose, members should retain their APRO membership, sinceit was a truly research-oriented organization that refrained from pointlessattacks against the air force.5 [index_split_261.html#filepos1535696]NICAP, of course, could not change what it was, and besides, it had a valuablerole to play. In the August issue of the NICAP Bulletin, the organizationreported that an air force spokesman at the Pentagon, Maj. C. R. Hart, revealedthat UFO investigations and evaluations involved “hundreds” of air forceintelligence officers, as well as> the best scientific brains available in the laboratories of all government> agencies, also scientific investigators in commercial laboratories, whenever> needed. 6 [index_split_261.html#filepos1535884] Indeed, only the month before, the Air Force re-released AF 200-2, coveringseven pages of instruction in tightly spaced eight-point type. It described UFOsas> any aerial phenomena, airborne objects, or objects which are unknown or appear> out of the ordinary to the observer because of performance, aerodynamic> characteristics, or unusual features. It also restated the threefold air force interest in UFOs: first as a possiblesecurity threat, next to determine the “technical or scientific characteristics”involved, finally to explain or identify all sightings. All air base commanderswere to “conduct all investigative action necessary” before submitting aninitial report. Air Force Intelligence and Air Defense Command had “a direct andimmediate interest” in UFO reports within the country. Base commanders couldonly release information to the public “after positive identification of thesighting” as a familiar or known object. Discussion with unauthorized personsremained prohibited.7 [index_split_261.html#filepos1536054]Many of those persons were members of Congress. On October 29, 1962, Departmentof Defense Assistant Secretary Arthur Sylvester admitted that, when necessary,the government did withhold UFO data from the public. He cited air forceregulation 11-7, which stated that sometimes information requested by Congressmight not be furnished “even in confidence.” 8[index_split_261.html#filepos1536197]The air force received more UFO reports during the second half of 1962. In mid-to late-September, northeastern New Jersey experienced a flurry of sightings.Something strange occurred near the Oradell reservoir on September 15, whenwitnesses claimed to see two bright discs descend toward the reservoir, one ofwhich was heard touching the water. Someone called the police, but the objectsoon departed. ATIC investigated, but neither this nor any New Jersey sightingwas classified as unknown. Most official unknowns were less interesting, such asthe sighting in Tampa, Florida, on November 17, by a former Marine Corps captainwho saw three star-like objects approach horizontally and hover for aboutfifteen minutes.9 [index_split_261.html#filepos1536350]On November 15, Carl Sagan presented a remarkable paper to the American RocketSociety, arguing that not only was space travel possible, but that othercivilizations “must today be plying the spaces between the stars.” Indirectlycritiquing the Ozma/Arecibo program, he stated that radio was not always thebest way to establish contact with others. What would be, then? Apparently,direct, physical contact. Sagan assumed that if there were about a millionworlds in the galaxy capable of such feats, they might visit one another once inevery thousand years. Thus, he said, scouts may have visited the Earth a totalof ten thousand times over the full span of Earth’s history. Sagan quickly addedthat there were no reliable reports of such visitation, but urged scholars tostudy ancient myths and legends for clues. It was “not out of the question,”said Sagan, that relics of such visits could yet be found. There might even be ahidden base, perhaps on the far side of the moon. Indeed, a remote locationcould very well be used for protection against weather and elements, and toavoid meddling with Earth’s inhabitants. Throughout his public life, Sagan camedown hard against UFO reports, eventually describing belief in UFOs aspseudoscience. Yet, what an amazing speech! Especially considering that Saganwas no mere independent academic, but rather an advisor to the U.S. military atthe time on such matters as extraterrestrial life.10[index_split_261.html#filepos1536510]On December 27, 1962, Wilbert B. Smith died. He had contributed to the cause ofending UFO secrecy and developed some interesting, if unprovable, ideas aboutaliens, essentially in line with the interpretation offered by many of theso-called contactees. Smith had long asserted privately that he had establisheda telepathic communication with the aliens. He did not publicize this or attemptto profit by this belief, but believed it sincerely. A speech he delivered inOttawa on March 31, 1958, contains a fair sampling of his thoughts. Althoughalien science, he said, might be “forever beyond our comprehension,” the alienswere our “blood brothers.” Despite their interest in us, they remained aloofbecause of a basic law that “grants each and every individual independence andfreedom of choice.... No one has the right to interfere in the affairs ofothers....”11 [index_split_261.html#filepos1536688] For believers in the UFOphenomenon, this was among the most hopeful of philosophies."},{"pageContent":"WHO RAN THE CIA? The U.S. presidency was not the only office that could be out of thedecision-making loop in the netherworld of the secret state. By late 1962, afull year into John McCone’s tenure as DCI, he remained unaware of the MK-Ultraprogram, or of the agency’s connection to the Mafia. Richard Helms, who did knowabout such things, simply neglected to tell him. This is yet another lesson intrying to understand the nature of the UFO cover-up, a slippery entity if thereever was one. What did McCone know about UFOs? We don’t know.12[index_split_261.html#filepos1536854]On February 11, 1963, the CIA established a domestic operations division for itsclandestine services, conducted within the U.S. against “foreign targets.” DavidWise noted that this was actually one of at least half a dozen CIA operationsoperating domestically in the U.S. In reality, no one can really determine whatwas going on at the CIA. For example, MK-Ultra was supposedly terminated in1963. More accurately, this refers to the program’s official name only. True,Cameron’s work was terminated following the Kennedy assassination. But during1964 and 1965, Sid Gottlieb authorized over a dozen subprojects related toCameron’s work under a new acronym, MK-Search. Many of those investigationsdealt with ways to destabilize human personalities.13[index_split_261.html#filepos1536994]The NSA’s Operation Shamrock benefited from new technology during 1963. This wasRCA Global’s development of computerized magnetic tape, which revolutionizedcommunications and intelligence gathering.

The NSA soon had many customers for this service: the FBI,CIA, Secret Service, and others who asked for “watch lists” of names andorganizations."},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN THE WORLD: 1962 Project Blue Book may have ignored UFO reports in the rest of the world, but theCIA did not, nor did APRO and NICAP Globally, UFO sightings in 1962 were of twobasic categories: South American and non-South American. Within South America,Argentina by far had the most intense activity, which claimed the attention ofthat nation’s military and the CIA.The wave started in May, when dozens of UFOs were seen in Argentina, at leastfour by Argentine navy pilots. On May 12, in Argentina’s La Pampa province, twomen claimed to see a humming, illuminated, landed object off the road at around4 A.M. It rose, crossed low over the road, ascended with a flame, and, to theirastonishment, divided into two sections that flew away separately. The objectleft a huge circle about three hundred feet in diameter; grass was burned withinit, and insects were “carbonized.” The Puerto Belgrano Naval Base analyzed thesite. About twenty-four hours later, dozens of people in the Argentine towns ofUncativo, Cordoba, Carranza, and the Los Molinos Dam saw a bright, elongatedobject with a bright trail. A fog soon filled a wooded section near Uncativo,and people saw an object on the ground. Little else is available about theincident. CIA files recorded a “most extraordinary” sighting over Bahia Blanca,south of Buenos Aires, witnessed by many people on May 21. A strange luminousobject hung as though suspended for several minutes, then quickly disappeared. Aphotographer took two pictures, showing the object to appear as a “luminousoval.” A FOIA request by CAUS failed to obtain the photo. On or near May 22 orMay 24, in the town of Winifreda in the La Pampa province, a woman washospitalized after she and her husband claimed to see an object land and twolarge “robot-like creatures” emerge. According to the Lorenzens, Argentine airforce officials found a circle of scorched grass.14[index_split_261.html#filepos1537167]Argentines reported UFOs through the summer of 1962. An amazing near-landing wasreported at the Camba Punta airport on August 2, 1962. A round object rapidlyapproached the airport and circled overhead. The airport’s director, LuisHarvey, ordered a landing strip to be cleared after he and his staff saw it. Itdescended and hovered extremely low above the runway for three or four minutes.The object spun while giving off flashes of blue, green, and orange light. Ittook off quickly when excited witnesses ran out to get a closer look.15[index_split_261.html#filepos1537394]Activity spread to Brazil during the late summer, including a bizarre, ominousincident on the evening of August 17, in the town of Duas Pontes. A diamondprospector named Rivalino da Silva, a man ignorant of UFOs, told several peoplethat he saw two short beings digging a hole near his house. They ran away whenhe approached, and an object took off from behind the bushes. No one believedhim. Two nights later, Rivalino’s son, Raimundo, woke to the sound of steps, sawodd shadows, and heard voices saying “this one looks like Rivalino,” and thatthey would kill him. The next night, Raimundo reportedly saw two sphericalobjects hovering near his house, humming and emitting a flame. Rivalino warnedRaimundo to stay back, and he approached. The two objects merged, spread ayellow mist, and gave an “acrid smell.” According to the story, Rivalino wasnever seen again, local police investigated, and several frightened people leftthe area.16 [index_split_261.html#filepos1537582]On December 21 in Angel Falls, Venezuela, a bright, teardrop-shaped light rosefrom the jungle floor, apparently filmed from an aircraft. On the same day,another Argentine airport incident was reported, this time at the Buenos AiresEzeiza International Airport, shortly after 2 A.M. The airport’s two controltower operators, Horado Alora and Mario Pezzuto, saw a large, fiery disc on orlow over the runway. The crews of two aircraft also saw the object. It soon roseto about thirty feet off the ground and flew away to the northeast. During thesefew minutes, an incoming flight held a holding pattern over the airport.17[index_split_261.html#filepos1537771]Elsewhere, there were fewer UFO sightings, but several which recalled the 1954European wave. In the Australian town of Norwood, a woman was driving with herthree children on the evening of October 28, 1962, when they all saw anilluminated oval object land near the road. She stopped the car and watched theobject for forty minutes, claiming to see a man wearing a helmet and gas masknear the craft. On the morning of February 15, 1963, in the Australian town ofWillow Grove, a man saw an object approach and stop over his farmhouse at analtitude of about fifty feet. It was about twenty-five feet in diameter andabout ten feet tall. The object was blue, made a swishing sound, and theunderside spun counterclockwise. It hovered for about five seconds, then tookoff amazingly fast. The man had a strong headache for the rest of the day.Landings and humanoid sightings were reported in Italy in December 1962 andJanuary 1963, including one case of witness paralysis. Meanwhile, on December12, in Amagasaki City, Japan, five students saw, and independently sketched, aSaturn-shaped UFO.18 [index_split_261.html#filepos1537941]"},{"pageContent":"THE UFO SCENE IN 1963 In January 1963, Robert Friend left as Blue Book’s director. He had tried, andfailed, to disband it. His replacement, Maj. Hector Quintanilla, held to asimple policy: make no changes whatsoever. No changes meant no improvement, asthe April 1963 issue of the Yale Scientific Magazine commented:> Based upon unreliable and unscientific surmises as data, the air force> develops elaborate statistical findings which seem impressive to the> uninitiated public, unschooled in the fallacies of the statistical method. One> must conclude that the highly publicized periodic air force pronouncements> based upon unsound statistics serve merely to misrepresent the true character> of UFO phenomena. Despite the new leadership at Blue Book, 1963 was essentially a repeat of 1962.Once again, it recorded a mere fourteen official unknowns (this time, fiveoutside the United States). Once again, the unknowns were an unimpressive lot:mostly oddly maneuvering lights. Once again, most of the good UFO reports weregoing elsewhere.19 [index_split_261.html#filepos1538137]NICAP recorded more interesting and difficult sightings, including two from June26, 1963. First, at 1 P.M. in Rockland, Massachusetts, a number of people hearda loud roar and saw a silhouette of a Saturn-shaped UFO; a white light on topand orange light on bottom were visible. The object hovered, then moved awayhorizontally. The same day in Pine Crest, California, a technician and manyothers saw three glowing, greenish objects with halos move westerly. They wereapproached by a similar object from the west; the fourth object stopped andhovered while the others approached, split formation, and continued west. Itthen continued east.20 [index_split_261.html#filepos1538313]Once again, South America was the source of many UFO reports. An especiallydense wave of sightings occurred there in October. Several times in Argentina,humanoids or figures were seen, and sightings included gunfire, witness burns,and local panics. Two interesting naval sightings occurred in November 1963. Thefirst involved an Argentine navy transport vessel, Punta Medanos, which sufferedinterference from the presence of a large UFO that followed it at a distance ofone mile on November 12. Equipment returned to normal after the craft left. Thesecond involved the Scottish vessel Thrift on the night of November 21-22, inthe North Sea. Four members, including the captain, saw a “flashing red light”pass within a mile of port side, about fifteen to twenty feet above sea level.It made no sound, then disappeared at a distance of three miles. The vessel wentout to search for it and twice obtained a radar fix, both of which disappeared aquarter mile distant. They never found a trace of the object, but the captainsaid “something definitely fell into the water.”21[index_split_261.html#filepos1538452]The most interesting UFO incident of 1963 occurred in Britain, where throughoutthe mid-1960s landings and crop circles were increasingly common. In many ofthese cases, reeds and grass were found in a clockwise swirl. On July 15, in theEnglish town of Charlton, Wiltshire, a farmer named Roy Blanchard discovered astrange crater in his potato field, about eight feet wide and four inches deep.A hole at the center was three feet deep and less than a foot in diameter. Allvegetation inside the circle was burned, leaving only the bare earth, and therewere four “slots” in the ground around it, each about four feet long and a footwide. A small piece of metal was recovered from the hole. British astronomerPatrick Moore stated that a “shrimp-sized meteorite” caused the crater. Amilitary investigation, however, showed no burn or scratch marks, nor any traceof an explosion. Just prior to the appearance of this crater, several UFOreports had come from the neighborhood. Moreover, a number of “craters” alsoappeared in other areas in England and Scotland, some quite large. The series ofevents gained much coverage in Flying Saucer Review, and the journal of theBritish UFO Association (BUFOA). Soon after, on August 1, a former RAF pilot andcurrent flying instructor in Garston, Hertfordshire, England, saw a triangularUFO which hovered for a long period of time, then climbed out of sight. An airtraffic controller four miles away also saw it.22[index_split_261.html#filepos1538614]But Britain was over there. Across the Atlantic, congressional interest in UFOswas extremely low. On July 18, 1963, Georgia Congressman Carl Vinson made thelast congressional inquiry into UFOs for the next three years.23[index_split_261.html#filepos1538870]"},{"pageContent":"ASSASSINATION AND SECRET DOINGS: 1963 AND 1964 In Dallas, on November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Working fromthe premise that one contentious conspiracy theory is quite sufficient for onebook, we will restrict ourselves to a few remarks regarding the officialinvestigation.FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had a hatred of all things Kennedy. He had knownabout, and used, JFK’s womanizing to his advantage. He detested his directsuperior, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. In August 1962, when Marilyn Monroedied, Hoover had information connecting RFK to Monroe’s residence that day; heused this information to his advantage, too. In June 1963, when JFK met withMartin Luther King, Jr., at the White House, Kennedy actually took King outside,where there were no FBI bugs, to warn him about Hoover’s surveillance.After the assassination, Hoover’s office filtered nearly all information goingto the Warren Commission. Caught in the net, among much else, were connectionsto the world of organized crime, which the assassination suggested at myriadpoints. Hoover may have had connections to that world and may even have beenblackmailed by it.24 [index_split_261.html#filepos1539027] He also filtered outties to the FBI itself. Within mere hours of the assassination, Hoover stateddefinitively that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone. He denied that eitherOswald or Oswald’s own assassin, Jack Ruby, had ever been FBI informants. Yet,it later surfaced that Ruby had, in addition to his links to the Mafia, no fewerthan nine contacts with the FBI and was listed in FBI files as potentialcriminal informant. If Hoover misled the Warren Commission about Ruby, whatabout Oswald? Oswald was well-known to the CIA long before the assassination, afact unknown to the Warren Commission.By this time, the U.S. intelligence community was spending an estimated $4billion annually via federal channels; this was distinct from money generatedthrough private ventures, of which there are no financial records, but which wasprobably considerable. Even Truman commented on the growing secret state. OnDecember 22, 1963, the Washington Post quoted him as “disturbed by the way inwhich the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment.” It had “become agovernment all of its own and all secret. They don’t have to account toanybody.”25 [index_split_261.html#filepos1539236]These were true words. Year after year, the CIA seemed to outdo itself. Itsactivities in Southeast Asia have already been discussed. During 1964, the CIAalso fixed the Chilean elections to defeat Marxist candidate Salvador Allende.Richard Helms, chief of clandestine operations, coordinated the action.Incredibly, more than half of all money spent on this election came from theCIA. In addition, CIA was flying Cuban exile pilots—Bay of Pigs veterans—in B-26bombers over the Congo, under the cover of a dummy company. Their mission wasnow to suppress a revolt against the Central Congolese government of JosephMobutu, who had wasted no time in his quest for personal enrichment at theexpense of his people.26 [index_split_261.html#filepos1539411]Clearly, American intelligence agencies were not alone in committing dastardlysubterranean deeds, and the foregoing is not intended to make it appear so. Notonly the CIA and KGB, but intelligence agencies around the world regularlycommit acts that are denied officially, and which would have seriousrepercussions if known. Rather, it is important to be mindful that organizationslike the CIA were not immune to such activities. One should beware of fightingmonsters, for there is danger in becoming one. By the 1960s, lying anddeception, whether for the perceived greater good or not, had long been ahallmark of the American national security state in all areas within its realmof interest, including UFOs."},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN 1964: THE PACE QUICKENS The year 1964 began with few UFO sightings. By the year’s end, however, UFOs hadshown themselves with greater frequency than in many previous years. The yearalso produced several intriguing statements and rumors. An issue of AstronomicalJournal mentioned Soviet studies that called attention to possibleextraterrestrial space signals. More intriguing were rumors that Jacques Valleeclaimed to be hearing from “quasi-official sources” in Paris during 1964. Onewas that the British military was carefully monitoring the UFO situation andpooling its information with the Soviets! Another was that U.S. law enforcementagencies had compiled exhaustive studies of the American cases, “a rumor,” wroteVallee, “that appears at least partially true.”27[index_split_261.html#filepos1539567]NICAP published its seminal The UFO Evidence that year, and sent it to everymember of Congress. Edited by Richard Hall, the book impressively documented andcategorized a massive number of UFO sightings, with a heavy emphasis on militaryencounters. It also provided useful information on the development of air forcepolicies, NICAP’s efforts on behalf of a congressional investigation, and agenerous sample of quotes from public figures. If meant to stir congressionalinterest in UFOs, however, the book was a disappointment. Donald Menzelpublished another book as well, essentially rehashing his material from 1953.Menzel supported Blue Book, attributed most sightings to mirages and opticaleffects, and blamed sighting waves on overexcited imaginations and the media.Two interesting U.K. cases occurred in December 1963. One involved two RAFairmen witnessing a dome-shaped object appearing to land; the other, an apparentlanding of a craft that left flattened grass over a circular area. Otherwise,little was reported until April 1964. On April 8, during the first orbitallaunching of a Gemini spacecraft, reports came that while the craft was in itsfirst orbit, it was accompanied by four unknown, seemingly controlled objects.After one complete orbit, the objects broke away and went off into space. Thisincident, reported in True magazine, led to an inquiry by members of Congressand a formal denial by NASA. Yes, said NASA, there were other objects on radar,but these were related to the separation of the capsule and booster rocket.28[index_split_261.html#filepos1539730]"},{"pageContent":"CLOSE-UP SIGHTING IN SOCORRO On April 24, 1964, one of the classic UFO-alien sightings occurred at Socorro,New Mexico. At 5:45 P.M., Police Sergeant Lonnie Zamora was pursuing a speedingvehicle when he heard a roar from outside the car. He saw a “flame in the sky”and thought a nearby dynamite shack had exploded. He abandoned his pursuit anddrove partially up the hill, over which the flame had passed. He walked thefinal part and at the top saw a shiny object about 150 to 200 yards away. Atfirst, Zamora thought a car had overturned, and he moved forward to help out. Healso saw what appeared to be two children in white coveralls. Then he noticedthe object was resting on four legs and that the “children” were examining orrepairing the craft. They did not notice him at first; when they did, theyhurried back into the object.Zamora moved quickly back to his car, either out of fear, or in order to drivecloser, or perhaps both. Just then, the object began to roar, a flame appearedon its underside, and it ascended slowly. Zamora now discerned it was oval inshape and very smooth. Although he saw no windows or doors, he did notice aninsignia with red lettering of some type. He ran after the object as itcontinued to rise in the air and accelerate toward the southwest. By the time itdisappeared, the flame was gone, and the craft was silent, leaving no trail.Zamora was so shocked by what he saw that he asked to see a priest beforereleasing his report to the authorities. Quite simply, he believed he saw analien craft. Everyone came down to look into this one. Within two hours, armyintelligence from White Sands Proving Grounds was there, along with an FBIagent. Hynek arrived the next day. Air force intelligence also investigated, asdid Kirtland AFB and Blue Book Sergeant James Moody. The CIA had a file andprobably investigators as well. Among civilians, NICAP and APRO were there, andalso, a bit later, debunker Philip Klass. (During APRO’s investigation ofSocorro, Blue Book’s Sergeant Moody told the Lorenzens, “you get lots of casesthat we don’t.”) Everyone but Klass thought the case was among the mostlegitimate and compelling of all UFO encounters.There were several reasons for such an assessment. For a week after the event,Zamora was subjected to an almost continuous barrage of interviews by the manyinvestigators on the scene. He impressed everyone with his honesty, his genuinepuzzlement and even shock, and his extremely detailed report. No one questionedhis integrity or ability to discern what he claimed to have seen. Other reasonswere the deep landing marks left by the legs of the craft, as well as a charredarea where it had taken off. These traces forced Hynek into writing about thisas a “real, physical event.”Much of the scrutiny Zamora received centered over his description of the beingshe saw, and of the strange insignia he saw on the side of the craft. He laterrefused to discuss these elements of the story because, he said, he was asked tokeep quiet about “some things” he had seen.In a 1966 classified article for Studies in Intelligence, Blue Book chief HectorQuintanilla, while not endorsing the extraterrestrial hypothesis, wrote:> There is no doubt that Lonnie Zamora saw an object which left quite an> impression on him. There is no question about his reliability.... He is> puzzled by what he saw and frankly, so are we. This is the best-documented> case on record, and still we have been unable, in spite of a thorough> investigation, to find the vehicle or other stimulus that scared Zamora to the> point of panic. Publicly, Quintanilla debunked and even ridiculed the story. Philip Klass cameinto town years later and decided the whole thing was a tourism-related hoax. Noone took Klass seriously, and no evidence for a hoax ever emerged. Hynek laterwrote that the case strongly affected him. It also forced NICAP to reconsiderits position on occupant sightings. Henceforth, occupant reports were viewed ascredible, even in this conservative bastion of UFO believers.Lonnie Zamora’s sighting of aliens in Socorro is generally considered among themost compelling and interesting UFO encounters ever. Certainly, it was afascinating close-range sighting, backed by strong physical evidence andpersonal testimony. Zamora’s experience, however, was not unique. Such sightingswere reported with great frequency over the years in South America and were amajor event in Europe in 1954. Many of those encounters were equally wellsubstantiated. What made the event at Socorro special was merely that it tookplace in America. The focus of American researchers on the event as the“classic” alien sighting has more to do with native provincialism than anythingelse.The final chapter to the Socorro story occurred during the summer. On July 31,1964, Ray Stanford and Richard Hall visited NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centerat Greenbelt, Maryland, in order to have the lab there analyze metals on a rockfrom the landing site. Dr. Henry Frankel, head of NASA’s Spacecraft SystemsBranch, directed the analysis and agreed to Stanford’s request that only halfthe rock’s metal be scraped off. Frankel declared that some of the particleslooked like they had been in a molten state when they got onto the rock.When the rock was returned to Stanford, it had been scraped clean. “There wasnothing, not a speck of the metal left,” said Stanford. On August 5, he phonedFrankel, who told him that> the particles are comprised of a material that could not occur naturally....> This definitely strengthens the case that might be made for an> extraterrestrial origin of the Socorro object. Frankel instructed Stanford to phone again in a week, after he had time toanalyze the metal further. On August 12, Stanford phoned Frankel’s office butcould only reach Frankel’s secretary, who said he was unavailable. Stanfordcalled again the next day—no luck. He called yet again on the seventeenth, andwas told by Frankel’s secretary that “Dr. Frankel is unprepared, at this time,to discuss the information you are calling about.” Stanford tried to reachFrankel again on the eighteenth and nineteenth, both times without success. Amidfailure, he had the virtue of persistence.On August 20, 1964, Stanford received a phone call from Thomas P. Sciacca, Jr.,of NASA’s Spacecraft Systems Branch. “I have been appointed to call you,” saidSciacca,> and report the official conclusion of the Socorro sample analysis. Dr. Frankel> is no longer involved with the matter, so in response to your repeated> inquiries, I want to tell you the results of the analysis. Everything you were> told earlier by Dr. Frankel was a mistake. The sample was determined to be> silica, SiO2. By now, these games had become monotonously depressing. How could one hope toobtain confirmation of any sort within such a setting, against such forces?29[index_split_261.html#filepos1539898]"},{"pageContent":"SOCORRO AFTERMATH: A YEAR OF UFOS Depending on one’s choice of sources, 1964 was either a very active year forUFOs or business as usual. UFO reports to NICAP and APRO shot way up. Blue Book,on the other hand, tallied only twenty official unidentifieds (including theSocorro incident) for the year. Then again, it received about five hundredreports and had long since mastered the art of fake explanations. Most of BlueBook’s unexplained cases continued to be of the lights in the night sky type.Without a doubt, however, the Socorro case heralded a new spate of UFO sightingsin the U.S. and sparked new media coverage. A large number of landing,electromagnetic (EM), and occupant cases were reported throughout the summer andfall, several quite vivid in detail, and at least one describing high-pitchedvoices. The air force investigated several of these cases. 30[index_split_261.html#filepos1540483]Just two days after the Socorro sighting, and about two hundred miles north,Orlando Gallegos near La Madera, New Mexico, saw a metallic, oval-shaped objecton the ground about two hundred feet away. He saw blue flames circle the bottomof the machine, which was silent and about the length of a telephone pole. Thelocal police captain, Martin Vigil, reported scorch marks and four imprints atthe site. Another New Mexico sighting occurred on April 28, near the town ofAnthony. According to many witnesses, including police officer Paul Arteche, areddish, round object hovered at a low level, then took off swiftly toward thewest.31 [index_split_261.html#filepos1540651]On April 30, 1964, according to APRO, the pilot of a B-57 bomber from HollomanAFB, Alamogordo, radioed to his control tower that he was watching an“egg-shaped, white” UFO with markings that matched the one at Socorro. As hecontinued to observe the UFO, it landed on the base. Both Lorenzens claimed thatthey got this story from a very reliable source. Others, too, had heard thestory, including a ham radio operator who claimed to have monitored the exchangebetween the pilot and control tower. A journalist called Holloman about it andreceived a denial. But Jim and Coral Lorenzen were adamant that they had three“entirely independent, unconnected sources of information” for this story.Shortly after the incident was said to have occurred, an airman walked into anAlamogordo clothing store and blurted out an incredible story of a UFO beingparked in a hangar at Holloman AFB, under heavy guard. A day or two later, hereturned to the store to insist he had made a mistake. There was no such thingas an alien spacecraft at Holloman, he said. An incredible story; can it bebelieved? The story was circulating, and the Lorenzens never wavered in theirclaim to have gotten it from several inside sources. It should be remembered,too, that for years, they were exceedingly cautious in assessing U.S. militaryinvolvement in UFOs.32 [index_split_261.html#filepos1540796]UFO sightings increased through May, especially in the western U.S. Severalmultiple-witness sightings that month occurred in the small town of Rio Vista,California. On May 5, in Comstock, Minnesota, a farmer saw an oval object risefrom a field and fly into the clouds. It left a depression and imprints. A boyin Hubbard, Oregon, reported a silvery object, about ten feet long, resting onfour legs in a wheat field on May 18. It made a beeping noise, rose about twentyfeet, then ascended vertically. Flattened wheat was found at the site.33[index_split_261.html#filepos1540936]Two incidents at White Sands Proving Ground occurred in the latter part of May1964, neither case going to Blue Book. On May 22, a UFO was tracked on radar; aweek later, on the twenty-ninth, two objects “moving leisurely across the range”were tracked on radar. This time, witnesses saw them visually asfootball-shaped.34 [index_split_261.html#filepos1541102]Blue Book unknowns, meanwhile, were more of a joke than anything else. Considerthese two from May 26. The first, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, took place at7:43 P.M. by an RAF pilot and ex-Smithsonian satellite tracker, who saw a thin,white object fly straight and level for about four seconds. The other took placein Pleasantview, Pennsylvania, at 11 P.M., when a man saw a yellow-orange lightin a field, then chased it down the road for two miles. Such unknown cases weresurely nothing to get excited about. Perhaps the entire point."},{"pageContent":"THE DAM BREAKS Despite a number of well-documented UFO sightings, NICAP remained stalled in itsefforts to break the secrecy throughout 1964. On the other side of the fence,the air force was also stymied in its efforts to unload the Blue Book program.Allen Hynek was showing signs that he was no longer a certain air force ally.Moreover, Gen. Curtis LeMay’s autobiographical Mission with LeMay appeared in1965, in which LeMay stated that he was “asked about flying saucers all thetime.” Unable to quote classified information, he gave “the straightest answers”he could. Contrary to what the public perceived, wrote LeMay, the air force wasnot deliberately trying to debunk UFOs. In fact:> There is no question about it. These were things which we could not tie in> with any natural phenomena known to our investigators.... There were some> cases we could not explain. Never could.35> [index_split_261.html#filepos1541262] Such developments were generally ignored by the public, of which less than 20percent believed in UFOs, according to various polls and private estimates byboth the air force and NICAP. The air force reinforced such negative publicperceptions on January 25, 1965, with the statement that only 2 percent of theUFO cases of the past five years had not been solved.36[index_split_261.html#filepos1541458]The dam broke in 1965. The UFO activity of 1964 was a whisper compared with thefollowing year. Along with the dramatic increase in sightings, there was anexplosion of UFO-related literature, including the first significant discussionsof the abduction phenomenon.Incredibly, air force official statistics provide fewer unidentifieds for 1965(sixteen) than for the previous year, although the number of reports receivednearly doubled, to about nine hundred. But the Blue Book numbers were a smallfraction of the total story. Flying saucers were being reported in great numbersaround the world. Indeed, one of the early interesting reports of the year camefrom Waihoke, New Zealand, where a ring on the ground at the location of a UFOsighting remained visible for four years. The site contained a highconcentration of an unidentified whitish material which resolved into fibersduring an oil immersion test. Philip Klass said the material was from the urineof sheep feeding from some circular device; Vallee, who had the results of thetests, said the material was “vegetal in nature.”37[index_split_261.html#filepos1541636]On January 5, 1965, a large flying disc was seen over the NASA station atWallops Island, Virginia. The station’s satellite tracking chief calculated itsspeed at 6,000 mph. On the same day, the navy disclosed that two UFOs had beentracked on radar at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. One had made a sharpturn at 4,800 mph. The air force, which was working hard to debunk as manyreports as quickly as possible, decided to do something. Therefore, Blue Bookchief Hector Quintanilla went to Richmond for a debunking tour. Not a single UFOreport was genuine, he told reporters.38 [index_split_261.html#filepos1541779]In Washington, D.C., at 4:20 P.M. on January 11, twelve Army communicationsspecialists in the Munitions Building at 19th Street and Constitution Avenue.,N.W, saw twelve to fifteen white, oval-shaped objects moving across the skybetween twelve thousand to fifteen thousand feet. These objects were alsotracked on radar, and two delta-wing jets were soon in pursuit but were easilyoutmaneuvered. The incident was reported in the Washington Star on January 13.The Pentagon had a ready response to the incident: the army personnel had seennothing at all. Just in time, as the soldiers had been scheduled for aninterview by a local television station. At the scene of the interview, arepresentative from the Pentagon prevented both military and civilian witnessesfrom speaking.39 [index_split_261.html#filepos1541924]Just past midnight on January 12, came a much-reported incident from a farm nearCurtis, Washington, not far from Blaine AFB. A family reported seeing a glowing,circular, domed craft land in a snowy field. The object soon left, but meltedthe snow in a thirty-foot circle, and even scorched the earth. Air forceauthorities told the family not to discuss the incident, and the ground itselfwas plowed under. Additional confirmation of the incident came from Blaineitself, where, just before the landing, radar had tracked a thirty-foot objectwhich had buzzed the car of Department of Justice officer Inspector Robert E.Kerringer while he was driving to the base. The man saw the object and even gotout of his car and watched it hover for a minute or two before flying off. Hedescribed it as a “huge shining thing [which] swooped down, right over the car,”then shot upward. As he reached for his radio microphone, the object climbedfaster than any jet, into the clouds and out of sight. Kerringer was also toldby Blaine officials to keep quiet about the incident. Later on the same day, anOregon woman and her two sons reported seeing a triangular UFO coming slowly outof the southeast and “suddenly plunge into the seas” some miles offshore atTillamook Head. It left two trails of fire behind.40[index_split_261.html#filepos1542070]Following this, a wave of reports came from Virginia. At midnight on January 14,in Norfolk, Virginia, a man saw a bright, circular object rise from the ground.On January 19, 1965, in Brands Flat, a man cutting wood saw two hovering,saucer-shaped objects, one hundred feet and twenty feet in diameter. The smallerone landed and was so highly polished that the man said, “I would bet on a clearday you could not see it at five thousand feet.” A door opened, and threehuman-looking pilots emerged, except that their skin was reddish-orange, theyhad “staring eyes,” and one of them had an unusually long finger on his lefthand. They spoke incomprehensibly and reentered the object. When the doorclosed, its outline became invisible. On the morning of January 23 inWilliamsburg, a driver experienced engine failure at the intersection of U.S.Highway 60 and State Route 14. At the side of the road, he saw a huge metallic,light bulb-shaped object, perhaps seventy-five feet high, hovering very low overthe ground. Something, presumably its engine, was making a noise, and it had areddish and blue light on either side. It took off rapidly toward the west.41[index_split_261.html#filepos1542283]Two days later in Williamsburg, a “top-shaped” metallic object descended rapidlyfrom the sky, causing engine failure in the car of a real estate executive. Ithovered low above the ground about half a minute, then shot up at tremendousspeed. The Virginia State Police took the report. A few miles away on the samenight, an object matching the same description descended near anotherbusinessman, whose car stalled as the object landed. On January 27, nearHampton, Virginia, two NASA engineers, one a former air force pilot, saw a UFOdescend with flashing lights. One of them told NICAP that the object zigzaggedto a brief landing, then rapidly climbed out of sight.42[index_split_261.html#filepos1542424]"},{"pageContent":"THE WAVE OF 1965 On January 19, 1965, NICAP’s acting director, Richard Hall, met with a CIA agentand obtained a direct telephone line to that agent’s office. A CIA memorandumdated January 25 discussed the meeting> at which time various samples and reports on UFO sightings procured from NICAP> were given to [blank] for transmittal to OSI. The information was desired by> OSI to assist them in the preparation of a paper for [blank] on UFOs. Later, Hall wrote that he used this line only one time, “to report somehigh-quality UFO sightings” to the CIA. That would appear to be in addition tothe meeting described in the CIA memo. Hall was the subject of a CIA securityclearance, without his consent or knowledge, he wrote. He obtained severalpreviously known documents after an appeal through FOIA, but the CIA refused torelease the security clearance paper trail.Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett wrote that the memo showed “an inordinateamount of interest in [NICAP], considering that the CIA’s function is foreignintelligence.” Exactly right, but it should be no surprise, given the longtimeCIA interest in UFOs. A more pertinent question might be, what was therelationship between Hall and the CIA? Hall recently stated “emphatically” that“there was no CIA (or any other intelligence agency) influence on NICAP” whilehe was at the center of NICAP affairs during the mid- and late 1960s.43[index_split_261.html#filepos1542583]Again, it must be stressed that the CIA’s secret collection of UFO reportsmirrored the activity of America’s many intelligence agencies in all facets ofsociety. In March 1965, for example, FBI offices were asked to compile lists ofreliable reporters who could be called on for Cointelpro work. Hoover wasmeanwhile busy gathering data on antiwar groups as well as members of Congress.That summer, U.S. Army intelligence agents began to infiltrate and spy on a widerange of political groups involving about one thousand investigators and threehundred officers collecting questionable political utterances.44[index_split_261.html#filepos1542773]UFO developments of 1965 were substantial enough to become a major publicinterest. On the night of January 29, the mayor of Monterey, California, and hisfamily saw a bright light performing acrobatics in the sky. The light hovered,shot straight up, then faded and dropped down to hover some more. Finally, itdropped toward the water and disappeared. A local pilot also saw the event, andthe Coast Guard investigated but offered no explanation. 45[index_split_261.html#filepos1542934]On the other side of Monterey Bay that night, radio technician Sid Padrickclaimed to have encountered UFO occupants. At about 2 A.M., while taking a latestroll before going to bed, Padrick claimed he heard a loud humming noise andsaw a machine shaped like “two thick saucers inverted.” An entity told him notto be afraid and welcomed him aboard. “You may call me Zeeno,” the being said tohim. For what it’s worth, Xeno is the Greek word for stranger, something Padrickdid not know. The being asked Padrick if he wanted to pay his respects to thesupreme deity, and Padrick reported having a deep spiritual experience. Perhapssurprisingly, officers from nearby Hamilton AFB interviewed Padrick for threehours. According to Padrick, “they wanted my account of it, word for word.” Hesaid there were certain details which they asked him not to talk about publicly,but he talked anyway. Reporters found that Padrick was backed up by everyone whoknew him; he was not a nut, nor a religious fanatic, nor interested in UFOs.46[index_split_261.html#filepos1543077]The UFO wave of 1965 was not merely nationwide, but a global affair. On thenight of February 3, 1965, in South Brighton, New Zealand, flattened grass wasfound after a man saw a UFO, about twenty-five feet in diameter, rise to analtitude of about sixty feet, then depart. On February 11, an air force officerand flight crew, en route from Anchorage to Japan, obtained a radar-visualsighting of three huge objects that paced their F-169 freighter aircraft overthe Pacific Ocean. The objects were red and glowing and, after thirty minutes,ascended swiftly at over 1,500 mph. The pilot later remarked that he had oftenseen UFOs on the Alaskan run. A sighting of three short humanoids emerging froma craft was reported in Chalac, Argentina, by about fifty people on February21.47 [index_split_261.html#filepos1543220]On the night of March 14-15, 1965, James W Flynn, a forty-five-year-old rancherand dog trainer who was hunting in the Florida Everglades, claimed to havegotten a close-up view of a UFO. The object descended after midnight, and Flynninvestigated. He saw an enormous cone-shaped machine silently hovering a fewfeet over the ground and watched it for about forty minutes. Flynn estimated itwas about seventy-five feet in diameter and twenty-five to thirty feet high andhad four rows of ports or windows. He could see yellow light coming through thewindows, and heard an engine-like sound. Evidently feeling lucky, he approachedthe craft with a raised hand. He got to within about six feet when a narrow beamof light struck him in the forehead and knocked him unconscious for close totwenty-four hours. The story was incredible, but Flynn spent five days in a FortMyers hospital with a large bruise on his head, burns, and damage to deep muscletissue. He had lost vision in the right eye and saw poorly with the left.Everyone, it seemed, vouched for his character. Evidence also existed at thelanding site, where the ground showed definite scorch marks in a large circulararea, and the tops of trees were burned by something.48[index_split_261.html#filepos1543381]A major UFO sighting occurred on May 24 at Eton Range in Australia, forty-twomiles from the city of Mackay. A round glowing object either landed or hoveredjust above the ground for about thirty minutes, where it was seen by threeguests of the Retreat Hotel: Jim Tilse, Eric Judin, and John Burgess. One hadbeen a WWII pilot, one was a veteran airline pilot, and the other was anengineer. According to Tilse, the commercial pilot:> It was about three hundred yards from the hotel where we were staying. It had> a bank of spotlights, twenty or thirty of them, along a circular platform. It> was solid, metallic-looking, thirty feet or more in diameter. The craft made a buzzing sound, illuminated trees as it settled, and wassupported by a large tripod-type landing gear. When it rose to three hundredfeet, it accelerated swiftly toward the northwest, leaving no exhaust or trail.These men had all been skeptics regarding UFOs, but no longer. Tilse went backthe next day to photograph a circular impression on the ground at the site; itsinside diameter was twenty feet and confirmed by local police as a perfectcircle. A police investigation also found damaged trees and other landingtraces. The regional director of civil aviation accepted the incident report asgenuine, and Australian authorities interrogated the men at length.49[index_split_261.html#filepos1543624]UFOs were being seen in both hemispheres, north and south. On June 4, they werealso seen in space. Astronauts James McDivitt and Edward White were orbiting theEarth during the Gemini 4 mission. While the mission passed over Hawaii, and asWhite was sleeping, McDivitt saw a “weird object” with some sort of“projections” on it “like arms.” He photographed the object with a movie camera.Soon after, both men saw two similar objects over the Caribbean. McDivitt laterhad this to say about what he saw:> I noticed an object out the front window of the spacecraft. It appeared to be> cylindrical in shape with a high fineness ratio. From one end protruded a> long, cylindrical pole with the approximate fineness of a pencil. I had no> idea what the size was or what the distance to the object was. I do not feel> that there was anything strange or exotic about this particular object.> Rather, only that I could not identify it. After McDivitt turned the film over to NASA, the photographs disappeared. JamesOberg, a flight controller at the Johnson Space Center who later became wellknown as a UFO skeptic, stated that McDivitt’s eyes were affected by anaccidental urine spill inside the capsule and were half-blinded by the sun’sglare. These two facts, said Oberg, prevented him from recognizing the Titan IIsecond stage. At least two images of McDivitt’s film are available today on theInternet, although they do not show very much.50[index_split_261.html#filepos1543851]The remote region of Antarctica also became the scene of significant UFOactivity. On June 19, members of the Chilean military saw a large, lens-shapedflying object maneuvering on an erratic path at the Chilean station in theAntarctic. Not much more is known. On July 2, the English base in Antarctica atHallet reported sighting an unidentified flying object for eight to ten minutes.Then, on July 3, Argentina reported an extraordinary encounter over its base inAntarctica. According to Argentina’s secretary of the navy, with corroborationfrom the Chilean military, this is what happened: At 7:40 P.M. on DeceptionIsland, a large, lens-shaped flying object, looking like a classic flyingsaucer, moved on a zigzag trajectory, maneuvering over the base. It then hoveredmotionless for about fifteen minutes. It interfered with radio communications,and its speed and maneuverability were beyond the capabilities of any man-madedevice. In addition, magnetic tapes registered the object, which caused stronginterference with variometers used to measure the Earth’s magnetic field.Thirteen members of the Argentine garrison and three Chilean sub-officers sawthe object with high-powered binoculars. The crew took ten color photographsthrough a theodolite. Everyone at the base believed strongly that this was noterrestrial aircraft.British scientific personnel learned of the report, and the incident wasreported in one American newspaper, the July 7, 1965, issue of the BaltimoreSun. It also appeared in La Razon in Buenos Aires on July 6 and the ManitobaStandard on July 9. The American media otherwise ignored the event. To this day,no photographs, scientific data, or witness reports have been made public.Richard Hall attempted and failed to obtain reports through embassies inWashington, D.C. It is not known whether Hall informed the CIA of this sightingat the time, though we can assume the agency had other means of discovery. 51[index_split_261.html#filepos1544043]"},{"pageContent":"THE WAVE OF 1965: JULY Over at Dayton, Blue Book either ignored or explained away the amazing UFOencounters of the year. The Antarctic encounter left no resonance in the States.Instead, Blue Book continued its insipid reporting of supposed “unknowns,” ofwhich there were a mere two during the month of July, of 135 reports received.52 [index_split_261.html#filepos1544225]As was the norm by now, most of the interesting events never made it to Dayton.On July 1, for example, an extraordinary sighting occurred in Valensole, France,by forty-one-year-old lavender farmer Maurice Masse. Masse heard a strange noiseearly in the morning and saw an oval object one hundred feet away in his field.Thinking it to be a prototype of some sort, he approached to within twenty feetof it to find that it was about fifteen feet long with a round cockpit.Supporting the structure were six legs and a central pivot about the size of asmall car. Masse then saw two beings, completely hairless and very white, lessthan four feet tall, with extremely large heads, normal hands, and practicallyno mouth. They wore gray-green one-piece suits, small containers on their belts,and no headgear or gloves.The beings appeared surprised when Masse came near and stopped their examinationof a plant. One of them pointed a small tube at Masse, which paralyzed him whilethey looked at him with human expression in their eyes and made gurgling noisesto each other. Masse remained conscious and unafraid and believed the beingswere making fun of him. They entered their craft through a sliding door, and theobject soon hovered, then ascended, then vanished at about sixty yards. Althoughit made a whistling sound as it departed, Masse was not certain if it vanishedbecause of its incredible speed, or simply vanished. He remained paralyzed foranother twenty minutes after the encounter and felt uncharacteristically drowsyfor weeks. Masse was a former Resistance fighter, a successful farmer, andregarded as “absolutely trustworthy” by the police who investigated theincident. The object left holes in the ground which were examined by manypeople, including police.53 [index_split_261.html#filepos1544362]Less than a week later, an extraordinary encounter took place at sea. On thenight of July 6, while passing near Portugal, a lookout on the Norwegian shipT.T. Jawesta reported a bright, blue object that appeared to emerge from thesea, then rapidly travel northward toward the ship. He alerted the captain,first officer, and others, all of whom watched the silent object issue “tonguesof flame” and make sudden turns at tremendous speed. Through binoculars, itappeared to be cigar-shaped with a row of lighted portholes. It reached analtitude of about one thousand feet and left a bluish trail. The sighting lasteda little more than half a minute. In a report to the Geophysical Institute inBergen, Norway, the chief mate stated “with complete certainty that it was noquestion of an aircraft of conventional type, or rocket, or meteor, or balllightning.”54 [index_split_261.html#filepos1544621]On July 14, an object descended near an Australian space station (perhaps PineGap?), interfering with its tracking of Mariner IV. It was also observed bycontrol tower operators at Canberra International Airport. On the sixteenth, asimilar sighting was reported from near Buenos Aires.55[index_split_261.html#filepos1544782]Throughout late July, August, and September, citizens of Chile, Argentina, andPeru reported close-up sightings of UFO craft, landings (several of which leftimpressions in the ground), and small, human-shaped UFO occupants. In September1965, the Argentine navy reported the occurrence of fifteen incidents since late1963 in which UFOs had tracked its vessels and interfered with its equipment.56[index_split_261.html#filepos1544923]In the U.S., too, the air force was swamped with reports. Keyhoe wrote that bymidsummer of 1965, the “debunking system had almost broken down.” Not exactly,since labored explanations continued to fly out of Dayton as rapidly as the UFOsthemselves. But it was true that people were becoming less and less persuaded bythe honesty of the air force effort to explain the UFO problem. By July, beliefin UFOs had risen to 33 percent, up from 20 percent at the beginning of theyear, and editorials were appearing in newspapers criticizing UFO secrecy anddebunking policies. Hynek also called for a more systematic study of UFOs in aJuly 1965 letter to the air force. “I feel it is my responsibility to pointout,” he wrote, “that enough puzzling sightings have been reported byintelligent and often technically competent people to warrant closer attentionthan Project Blue Book can possibly encompass at the present time.”57[index_split_261.html#filepos1545129]"},{"pageContent":"THE WAVE OF 1965: AUGUST The pace of American UFO sightings increased during August, when the Blue Bookteam received 262 reports, surpassing most of the months (except July) duringthe 1952 crisis. Now, however, Blue Book’s explanatory methods were such thateverything had to be explained, except a few token inoffensive sightings, andeven these were exceedingly few—four, to be precise, or a mere 1.5 percent ofreports for the month.An intense barrage of UFO activity appeared in the Midwest from July 31 toAugust 2, 1965, witnessed by thousands of people across nine states, includingastronomers, state police, and journalists. What they appeared to be seeing wereUFO formations.Shortly after 9 P.M. on August 1, police squadrons in Oklahoma reported seeingdiamond-shaped formations of UFOs for more than half an hour. These movednortherly and changed colors from red to white to blue-green. In Oklahoma City,a police dispatcher said headquarters had received over thirty-five callsbetween 8 and 10 P.M., with most estimates indicating objects at between fifteenthousand and twenty thousand feet. A police officer in Wynnewood, Oklahoma,reported a forty-five-minute UFO sighting, which was reportedly captured onradar by Tinker and Carswell Air Force Bases. The Weather Bureau at Wichita saidit tracked objects south and west of Wellington that first appeared on radar atabout twenty-two thousand feet, then descended to four thousand feet. Observersdescribed the objects as red, which “exploded in a shower of sparks and at othertimes floated like a leaf.” Even the New York Times reported the sightings.That night was just the warm-up, however. On the night of August 2-3, 1965, tensof thousands of people from South Dakota to the Mexican border watchedformations of brightly colored lights speeding through the skies, occasionallystopping for a few seconds. The sightings at times were awe-inspiring, changingformation, speed, color, and size. According to state police reports, many ofthe objects were tracked on civil and military radars. In the Minneapolis area,fifty police and sheriff squad cars radioed and reported UFOs between 12:20 A.M.and 2:20 A.M. Several objects were photographed. A fourteen-year-old boy inTulsa took a picture with a cheap camera which, under enlargement, seemed toindicate a disc-shaped UFO which was divided by two bands into three segments.The picture was published in newspapers and studied by photo experts whopronounced it genuine. Another photo was taken near Sherman, Texas, of an objectthat had been tracked by Carswell AFB radar in Fort Worth.A few reports were of objects near or on the ground. Two deputy sheriffs inJustin, Texas, saw a very bright object land while they were on a patrol nearWagle Mountain Lake. The police investigated but found nothing. In OklahomaCity, five children claimed to see a bright, round object descend close to theground.In Dayton, the air force dismissed the sightings as nothing more than four starsin the constellation Orion and denied that any air bases had picked up objectson radar. The problem with that explanation, as people quickly realized, wasthat Orion was not visible in the Northern Hemisphere at this time of year. Itwas an embarrassing gaffe, even by Blue Book’s typically low standards ofexplanation. Wright-Patterson then ascribed the sightings to the planet Jupiterand other stars.Not surprisingly, this met with widespread disbelief. An air force weatherobserver in Oklahoma City said:> I have repeatedly seen unusual objects in the sky, and they are no mirage. One> of them looked like it had a flat top and flat bottom, and it was not a true> sphere. There seemed to be two rings around it, and the rings were part of the> main body. The Seattle Times wrote: “Do you ever get the feeling that ... the air forcemakes its denials six months in advance?”58[index_split_261.html#filepos1545314]During the morning following this extraordinary night of sightings, anotherencounter occurred which, if not a hoax, was even more amazing. On August 3,1965, Los Angeles County Highway Accident Investigator Rex Heflin took fourclear Polaroid photographs of a hat-shaped UFO near a lonely stretch of roadnear Santa Ana, California. The object was silent, said Heflin, and a beam ofwhite light seemed to rotate underneath the object. He tried to communicate withhis supervisor, but the radio went dead while the object was present, a factcorroborated by Heflin’s supervisor. Back at his office, he put the pictures inhis desk drawer. A few days later, one of Heflin’s coworkers sent the picturesto UPI, where photo analysts concluded them to be genuine. Shortly after Heflinreceived them back a few weeks later, he was approached by a man claiming to befrom North American Air Defense Command G-2 (NORAD), who demanded the prints.Unfortunately, Heflin gave them to the man, and the mysterious caller and photoswere never seen again. The air force and NORAD both denied having the photos orany involvement with the matter. Copies of the photos existed, however, and werewidely published. Heflin told reporters he was willing to take a lie detectortest to prove his pictures were authentic. A number of UFO writers concurredwith the air force assessment that the event was a hoax, but (1) the fact thatthe photos were Polaroids, (2) many particulars of the photos themselves seemhard to hoax (such as evidence of an air current creating dust directly belowthe object), and (3) the perspectives from which Heflin took the pictures do noteasily lend credence to the hoax scenario, and no one ever indicated how Heflincould have done it.Two years later, on October 11, 1967, Heflin was visited by a strange group ofmen in air force uniforms. Suspicious, he obtained their names and otherinformation. His visitors, in turn, asked him about the photos and such thingsas the Bermuda Triangle. He saw their car parked in the street; inside was afigure in the back seat and a violet glow, which looked like instrument dials.Heflin believed he was being photographed or recorded. Meanwhile, his FM radiomade several loud blips. Others investigated this, but no one ever learned whothe men were, except evident imposters.59 [index_split_261.html#filepos1545538]Landings and close encounters were being reported in North and South Americathroughout August 1965. That month, the air force inquired further into thepossibility of submitting UFO files to the Academy of Sciences, or some similarbody. Before long, events reached a crescendo that enabled the air force torealize its dream of unloading the UFO problem.60[index_split_261.html#filepos1545738]"},{"pageContent":"THE INCIDENT AT EXETER UFO activity continued at a gallop’s pace in September. On September 3, 1965,another monumental case occurred, this time in the small town of Exeter, NewHampshire. At 2:24 A.M., eighteen-year-old Norman Muscarello, just a few weeksaway from joining the navy, arrived at the Exeter police station in a state ofnear shock. He had been hitchhiking on Route 51 from Amesbury, Massachusetts, tohis home in Exeter about twelve miles away. Since there was little traffic atthat hour, he walked most of the way. At 2 A.M., he said, he reached Kensingtonby an open field between two houses and saw an object coming out of the skydirectly toward him. It was as big as or bigger than a house, he said, betweeneighty and ninety feet in diameter, with brilliant, pulsating red lights aroundan apparent rim. It wobbled and floated toward him without a sound. Muscarellodived in terror into a shallow shoulder off the road, and the object backed offslowly, hovering over the roof of one of the houses. As it backed off some more,Muscarello ran to the house and pounded on the door, screaming. No answer. A cardrove by, and Mucarello ran out into the road and convinced the couple to drivehim to the police station. Muscarello was so adamant that the desk officeragreed to send someone back with him.Just then, patrolman Eugene Bertrand, an air force veteran who had fought inKorea, arrived at the station, reporting that about an hour ago near Route 101,he had come across a car parked on the bypass with a woman at the wheel, who wastrying to regain her composure. She claimed that a huge, silent, airborne objecthad been trailing her car. It was only a few feet away, with brilliant flashingred lights. Then, according to the woman, the object took off at tremendousspeed toward the stars. Bertrand thought she was a kook and calmed her down butdid nothing else. Now, hearing Muscarello’s story, the two left for the scene ofMuscarello’s encounter.They arrived at the field on Route 150 at around 3 A.M. No wind and perfectvisibility. At first, the two saw nothing. Before long, however, horses and dogson the farm became restless. The two then saw a slowly rising object approachingthem—silent, brilliant, and roundish. It wobbled toward them “like a leaffluttering from a tree.” Red light bathed the area. Bertrand radioed to thestation, “My god, I see the damn thing myself!”The object hovered near the police car about three hundred feet away, onehundred feet in the air, silently rocking back and forth. It was too bright tomake out any definite shape, but the two clearly saw pulsating red lights thatdimmed from left to right then right to left in a 5-4-3-2-1, then 1-2-3-4-5pattern. Each cycle took about two seconds. The object hovered for severalminutes, and all was silent but for the horses and dogs. Then, according toBertrand, it “darted,” turned sharply, slowed down, and began to move away. Asthis happened, another patrolman, David Hunt, pulled up. He, too, saw thepulsating lights, heard the animals, and saw the object moving and rocking.Bertrand returned to the station “all shook up,” in the opinion of the deskchief. He later said that at one time the lights came so close, he fell on theground and started to draw his gun. He also stated that the lights of the objectwere always in a line and at a sixty-degree angle, and that when the objectmoved, the lower lights were always forward of the others.After daylight, the police station called Pease AFB to reconfirm the incident.By 1 P.M., two air force officers arrived to interview the three witnesses atlength. Although they appeared “interested and serious,” they made littlecomment and returned to their base.Journalist John Fuller investigated this case during the next month. He quicklylearned that the incident was not an isolated one in the area. The localpopulation was in a buzz about UFOs, and a huge gap existed between mediacoverage and local perceptions. Newspapers near Boston and Exeter ascribed thesightings to a “flying billboard” owned by the Sky-Lite Aerial AdvertisingAgency of Boston. Raymond Fowler told Fuller that his NICAP subcommitteeroutinely checked with Sky-Lite regarding possible UFO misidentifications andlearned that no Sky-Lite flights were flown between August 21 and September 10.Moreover, the company rarely flew down near Exeter, and the plane’s lights in noway matched the description of lights of the Exeter incident.On the other side were the witnesses. One woman said to Fuller:> We’ve often seen them come along these lines [referring to power lines]. And> right here by the poles one of these crafts came right down over my car,> dropped down four or five feet off the ground. You could see a metal surface> and the orange-red and white lights on it. Right there by that tree there. He learned that many of the sightings in the area were occurring near electricpower lines. Few could make out much beyond the very bright lights, though atleast one person, using binoculars, said it was the shape of a football.When an official report reached the Pentagon later in September about theincident in Exeter, an officer in army intelligence was said to turn to acolleague and remark: “I hope it’s one of ours.”61[index_split_261.html#filepos1545878]The Pentagon gave its official determination of the spate of sightings onOctober 27, with a press release that gave two basic explanations. Some stemmedfrom a high-altitude Strategic Air Command exercise out of West-over,Massachusetts. The Exeter sighting was caused by weather inversion, a layer ofcold air trapped between warm layers, which caused the appearance of stars andplanets to dance and twinkle. “We believe,” said the Pentagon’s spokesman, “whatthe people saw that night was stars and planets in unusual formations.”Many people considered this explanation to be a joke. Police officer Bertrandsaid:> [I]f they want to turn out ridiculous statements like that, that’s their> business. I know what I saw; they don’t.... I know for sure it had nothing to> do with the weather. I know for sure this was a craft, and it was not any> plane in existence. I know for sure it was not more than a hundred feet off> the ground.62 [index_split_261.html#filepos1546016] Bertrand took the debunking as a personal insult and complained to the airforce. In late November, Quintanilla sent an undated and unpostmarked letter toBertrand and Hunt, which explained the Exeter sighting as a high-altitudemilitary exercise that occurred between midnight and 2 A.M. (giving the date ofSeptember 2, 1965). He stated the case was still in the process of finalevaluation. Bertrand and Hunt wrote back on November 2, unequivocal about whatthey saw, and asked for a letter to clear their names. They received no responseand wrote again on December 28. Finally, on February 9, 1966, the Pentagon wroteto Bertrand and Hunt that the Exeter sighting was unidentified, but that airforce experience in these matters proved “almost conclusively” that UFOs wereall either man-made, natural phenomena, or caused by celestial bodies ormeteors.63 [index_split_261.html#filepos1546162]Philip Klass and Robert Sheaffer both tried to debunk this case. In fact, itmarked Klass’s entry (a year later) into the field of UFO research, as heattempted to explain the case as ball lightning. No scientist took his theoryseriously. Sheaffer claimed that the witnesses saw the planet Jupiter.64[index_split_261.html#filepos1546308]In terms of drama and quality of the UFO sighting, the incident at Exeter couldnot easily be topped. Yet, the following night—still September 3, 1965, at 11P.M.—in Brazoria County, Texas, near the town of Damon, another extraordinaryencounter occurred. Two area sheriffs saw a huge object from their car, over twohundred feet long and about fifty feet high. It had a bright, violet light atone end and a pale-blue light at the other. They stopped to watch it and saw thecraft fly to within one hundred feet of them, casting a huge shadow when itpassed by the moon. They felt a wave of heat and drove away in fear. Theydecided to return to the site but turned back around when they saw the objectstill there. One of the men had been bitten by an animal before the sighting,and his left index finger was swollen and bleeding. After exposure to the lightfrom the object, however, the pain was gone, and the wound healed quickly. Bothofficers were badly shaken by the incident. Later that evening, two men foundone of the officers at a restaurant and described the object in detail, addinghe should keep future encounters to himself. The incident was, however, reportedto NICAP.Hector Quintanilla initially explained the Damon sighting as a star or planet.But the local air force investigating officer reported:> After talking with both officers involved in the sighting, there is no doubt> in my mind that they definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon.... Both> officers appeared to be intelligent, mature, level-headed persons capable of> sound judgment and reasoning. This forced Quintanilla to reverse his original debunking explanation and labelthe sighting unidentified.65 [index_split_261.html#filepos1546487]On September 23, in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, a major blackout coincidedwith the appearance of a glowing, disc-shaped UFO hovering low over the city.Witnesses included the governor, Emilie Riva Palacie, the city’s mayor, and amilitary zone chief.66 [index_split_261.html#filepos1546702]"},{"pageContent":"AIR FORCE CRISIS OF CREDIBILITY In the past, the Blue Book policy of debunking all UFO sightings helped tosubmerge the problem. Now it only worsened matters. By early September, as aresult of the recent sightings, many newspapers demanded better air forceinvestigations of UFOs. An editorial in the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram stated:> They can stop kidding us now about there being no such thing as “flying> saucers.” Too many people of obviously sound mind saw and reported> independently from too many separate localities. Their descriptions of what> they saw are too similar to one another and too unlike any familiar object.

It calledfor> a working scientific panel composed of both physical and social scientists> [to] be organized to review Project Blue Book—its resources, methods, and> findings—to advise the AF as to any improvements that should be made in the> program to carry out the AF’s assigned responsibility68> [index_split_261.html#filepos1547007] That day, Maj. Gen. E. B. LeBailly, Air Force Director of Information, issued amemorandum stating that the inquiry into UFOs was important enough that allagencies and commands should support it. Rather than attempt to shop Blue Book’sprogram elsewhere, the memorandum said that Blue Book should stay right where itwas, at Wright-Patterson AFB. While hostility did not seem to be a factor inconsidering the unknowns, wrote LeBailly, they could not be ignored because ofthe excellent qualifications of many observers. Moreover, in an importantadmission, he stated that only an extremely small percentage of accountsactually made their way to Blue Book. Thus, he recommended that a new committeeof both physical and social scientists, including Hynek, be convened to reviewthe air force approach and policy with respect to UFOs offering a freshperspective and recommendations. 69 [index_split_261.html#filepos1547148]Meanwhile, the UFO controversy continued to stew through the autumn. On October5, the Oklahoma City Journal printed an enlargement of the August 3 UFO photofrom the Tulsa youth, which other papers reprinted for the next month or so.That day, astronaut James McDivitt spoke to the media about UFOs: “They arethere without a doubt, but what they are is anybody’s guess.” Later that month,John Fuller published his article on the Exeter encounter in the SaturdayReview, greatly stimulating public interest in UFOs. Before publication, Fullerwrote to his editors that> reliable, but off-the-record information from the Pease AFB in Portsmouth> indicates frequent radar blips and fighters are constantly scrambled to pursue> these objects. This information is not official, but it comes from a reliable> source. Fuller’s bosses in New York were impressed by his report. Around this time,Fuller met with Richard Hall of NICAP Hall said there was no pressure being puton NICAP by the air force or government and said that reports of close-rangeUFOs had been building up over the last year.70[index_split_261.html#filepos1547314]Such reports continued to pour in. By late October, around the time of thePentagon press release explaining the Exeter sighting, Fuller learned from anair force pilot that pilots had been ordered to shoot at any UFO they cameacross in order to bring it down. The UFOs, however, appeared to be“invulnerable” and were able to outmaneuver any air force aircraft. Fuller’sinformant personally disagreed with this policy, as he saw no gain in alienatingthe unidentified craft.Fuller also obtained a report from a military radar operator who told him that aUFO came directly toward an unnamed base, was seen visually and clocked on theradar scope. For a moment, it appeared that the object would actually land atthe base. Instead, the officer of the day watched it hover through a telescope,then suddenly accelerate to over 800 mph, while it was simultaneously clocked onthe radar scope. Fuller also learned that “constant” radar reports were beingmade at the Portsmouth Naval Base. In one instance, an object hovered over awater tower at the base before taking off incredibly fast, also seen visuallyand on radar. By this time, at Pease AFB, at least fifteen pilots were no longerskeptical about UFOs. Other air force officers told Fuller they were “shockedand dismayed” by the Pentagon report on Exeter. They all believed that thereport severely damaged the air force. Fuller theorized that the air forceimpotence against UFOs might be the underlying reason for the stonewalling.71[index_split_261.html#filepos1547521]In early November, the air force Scientific Advisory Board met in Dallas todiscuss the UFO question and the idea of an independent study of the problem.Within a year, this led to the announcement of the air force decision tocommission a study of UFOs by the University of Colorado, otherwise known as theCondon Committee. The meeting in November 1965 was later offered by JacquesVallee as “near proof” that the air force’s policy regarding UFOs was more of abungling than a conspiratorial nature. This is a frail reed upon which to basesuch an argument. Could it be possible that after almost twenty years ofinvestigation, the air force was still trying to determine what UFOs were?72[index_split_261.html#filepos1547667]"},{"pageContent":"BLACKOUT SEASON Over the years, blackouts linked to UFO sightings had been reported in citiesthroughout the world. None, however, matched the massive blackout that affected35 million people throughout the northeastern United States on November 9, 1965.Nearly 800,000 people were detained in elevators, subway cars, and commutertrains. The entire power grid for the region, supposedly invulnerable, failed.In addition, several local companies independent of the main power grid alsofailed, and short-wave and VLF transmissions and reception were jammed withstatic.The blackout began in the Syracuse area at 5:15 P.M. At precisely that moment,there was a UFO sighting in the area. Pilot Weldon Ross was approaching Syracusewhen he and his student pilot saw a huge red ball “of brilliant intensity”appearing over the power lines at the Syracuse substation. Ross estimated it tobe about one hundred feet in diameter and determined that the fireball was wherethe New York Power Authority’s two 345,000-volt power lines at the Claysubstation passed over the New York Central’s tracks between Oneida Lake andHancock Field. At least three other people corroborated this sighting. One ofthem was Robert C. Walsh, who was the Syracuse area deputy commissioner for theFederal Aviation Agency. Walsh reported that he saw the same phenomenon just afew miles south of Hancock Field.At 5:25 P.M., a teacher in Holliston, Massachusetts, saw through binoculars anintense white object in the sky moving slowly toward the horizon; a man from thesame town reported an identical object. At the same time in New York City, twowitnesses declared separately that they saw unusual objects in the sky. “It wasdifferent from anything I had ever seen,” said one.So, did UFOs cause the blackout? The possibility received widespread discussionduring the aftermath but was never offered as a serious explanation to thepublic. President Lyndon Johnson ordered an investigation to determine thecause. Early on, it was announced that a line break near Niagara Falls had doneit. A quick check, however, ruled this theory out. Next, the announcementpointed toward a remote-controlled substation at the power authority’stransmission lines at Clay, New York, about ten miles north of Syracuse. Thisdid not stand up to scrutiny, either. The Niagara Mohawk men who looked into itfound the substation in fine condition, with no sign of any failure or damage.The final, and official, conclusion was that backup relay #Q-29 at the Sir AdamBeck generator station in Queenstown, Ontario, was the source of the failure.Even so, this relay went right back into operation, and the line it protectedwas completely undamaged.On the other hand, circumstantial evidence existed to show that some sort ofelectromagnetic condition existed that caused the blackout. The fact thatstations outside the main power grid were affected suggested this. In addition,after the episode, Con Edison quietly installed expensive magnetic shieldingdevices around key equipment. Bell Telephone Company also switched from overheadlines to more expensive, heavily shielded cables buried under the ground. Beyondthe somewhat suggestive UFO connections, however, hard evidence is lacking.73[index_split_261.html#filepos1547807]The great northeastern blackout was the most publicized of a series of majorblackouts during late 1965. On November 16, a series of power blackouts hitBritain, affecting dozens of sections of London. On November 26, NICAP learnedof unexplained power failures in St. Paul, Minnesota, coming at the same time asUFO sightings in the area. From December 2 to December 5, 1965, a series ofmajor blackouts began in Mexico, western New Mexico, and Texas, including an ElPaso blackout affecting 700,000 people. Other areas affected includedAlamogordo, Las Cruces, and Juarez, Mexico. A month later, on December 26, theentire city of Buenos Aires, and towns as far as fifty miles away, were alsoblacked out, with many trapped in subways and other enclosed places. On the samedate, four major cities in south and central Finland were hit with blackouts. Inall cases, the cause was said to be a single insulator.74[index_split_261.html#filepos1548079]"},{"pageContent":"THE KECKSBURG CRASH Less conspicuous than the Roswell crash of 1947, the event at Kecksburg,Pennsylvania, on the evening of December 9, 1965, has caused its own share ofrancor among UFO researchers. Officially listed as a meteorite in the Blue Bookfiles, the object that crashed may have been several things—but certainly it wasnot a meteorite.That night, a brightly glowing object streaked eastward across Canada, Michigan,and Ohio before striking ground at 4:47 P.M., near the small town of Kecksburg.Thousands of people saw the object, which left an intense vapor trail that wasvisible for more than twenty minutes and was filmed by several people. Debrisfell in many places. Many people, including pilots, who saw it thought it was anaircraft on fire. Pilots recorded shock waves from it.At around 6:30 P.M., Frances Kelp phoned a local radio station, WHJB, inGreensburg, where she spoke with John Murphy, the news director. An object orfireball, she said, had crashed into the woods near her home. Her two sons hadgotten to within a half mile of the impact until she called them back; all threesaw smoke rising above the trees and a bright object off to one side, which Kelpdescribed as looking like a “four-pointed star.” State police and firefighterswere on the scene quickly. Murphy was also there, interviewed Kelp and her sonsin person, and saw the state police fire marshal walk into the woods with aGeiger counter, accompanied by a state investigator. These two men, Carl Metzand Paul Shipco, returned about fifteen minutes later. Murphy asked them if theyfound anything. “I’m not sure,” said Metz. Murphy kept trying to pry somethingout, when Metz said, “you’d better get your information from the army.”Murphy drove out to the state police Troop A barracks in Greensburg. When hearrived, he said, there were “not only members of the United States Army there,but I also saw two men in air force uniforms, one of them wearing lieutenant’sbars.” Murphy found Captain Dussia of the Pennsylvania State Police who told himthat after a thorough search, they were convinced “there [was] nothingwhatsoever in the woods.” Murphy overheard Metz talking about going back in andasked Metz if he could go in, too. Sure, said Metz, if it was okay with thecaptain. Dussia said, “of course.” Just then, a state trooper came back in fromthe woods, talking about a pulsating blue light he saw in there. According toMurphy, the military was very interested in seeing this.Back at the crash site, Murphy tried to enter the woods with Metz but was firmlytold by Metz he could not enter. Evidently, somewhere on the road betweenGreensburg and Kecksburg, Metz had received new instructions. Before long, allentrances into the woods were cordoned off. Before this occurred, severalfirefighters had gotten inside. One of them, Jim Romansky, was interviewed yearslater by Stan Gordon, a researcher who had done extensive investigation into theincident. Romansky reached the stream bed where the object first touched down.It had cut a furrow into the bed and came to rest nearby. It was acorn-shaped,said Romansky, between nine and twelve feet in diameter, and had a gold bandaround the bottom with writing on it. It had no wings, motors, or fuselage. Thewriting looked like “ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics,” more precisely withcharacters of broken and straight lines, dots, rectangles, and circles. Themetal was dented, but Romansky saw no rivets, seams, or welds.Gordon found another witness, named Bill Bulebush, who had gotten nearly asclose as had Romansky. He, too, described the object as acorn-shaped, with agold band along the bottom, about twelve feet long and six feet in diameter. Hecould see bright blue sparks coming from it, but heard no sound.Another man, Bill Weaver, was much farther from the object, but claimed to seeit glowing. He saw four men dressed in “moon suits” carrying a large white boxinto the woods on a stretcher. Soon after, a man in a business suit ordered himfrom the area and threatened to take his car if he did not move it. Romanskyalso spoke of men in business suits that he thought were military. He said theybegan to order the firefighters out of the area.The media covered the story almost exclusively as a fireball. Dr. William P.Bidelman, an astronomer at the University of Michigan, for example, stated, “Itwas undoubtedly a fireball.” Other astronomers chimed in with the same opinion,although none of them had seen the object. The air force said the object was notan aircraft, missile, or space debris. Thus, it seemed to be a meteorite. Addingto the evidence is the only known photograph of the object as it passed throughthe sky, which appeared in the February 1966 issue of Sky and Telescope, andshowed a “train” (ionized air) often associated with a fireball.In March 1966, Ivan Sanderson began to research the event and eventually sent areport to NICAP. He spoke with officers from many police desks, journalists, andwitnesses. From these discussions and the available data, he calculated theobject’s speed at just over 1,000 mph, far too slow for a meteor. Kevin Randle,who later investigated the crash at length, said Sanderson’s calculation mayhave been based on faulty assumptions. Even so, acknowledged Randle, ifSanderson’s calculations were off by a factor of ten, the object would stillhave been flying slower than the slowest speed ever recorded for a meteor, whichis 27,000 mph. After investigating this at great length, Sanderson alsodetermined something else of interest: the object appeared to change direction,turning southward at around Cleveland. Subsequent investigations, however, couldnot confirm this.Blue Book and the military had its explanation: meteor. Blue Book files,however, refer to a “three-man team” that had been dispatched to investigate andpick up an object that started a fire in the woods. Kevin Randle argued thatthis team was certainly part of Project Moon Dust. UFO skeptic James Oberg,writing in Omni, suggested that the crashed object was a Soviet Kosmos 96satellite, which he believed would have warranted the activation of Moon Dust.Could this be true? Researcher Stan Gordon said that U.S. Space Command showedthat Kosmos 96 most likely crashed in Canada at 3:18 A.M., about thirteen hoursbefore the Kecksburg crash.About all we know with certainty is that within two hours of the crash, themilitary sealed off the site, but not before witnesses got close enough to see acrashed object in the woods. Publicly, officials were claiming that nothing atall had crashed and nothing had been found. But other witnesses claimed to see aflatbed truck with a tarp covering leave the area at high speed. A final note:John Murphy’s then-wife stated some time after that Murphy “was convinced” theobject was no meteor, and in fact that he had reached the crash area with acamera. The military confiscated his film and audiotape. She also believed thatthe military pressured him into silence.In 1990, a person came forward claiming to be part of the military team sent into retrieve the object. He claimed that he received orders to “shoot anyone whogot too close” and that the object was transported to Wright-Patterson AFB.Another individual who worked at Wright-Patterson claimed that a strange objectwas shipped there on December 16, 1965. Before being escorted away, he claimedto see it and described it nearly identically to other witness descriptions.Both the meteorite and the Soviet satellite explanation appear to be mostunlikely explanations for the Kecksburg crash, and no researchers believe it wasan American satellite. Was it an alien object? The possibility is real, and thecase remains open.75 [index_split_261.html#filepos1548244]"},{"pageContent":"1966: A YEAR OF ESCALATIONS The United States was heading toward a boil in 1966, and the escalating war inVietnam dominated the news. Still, the status quo held. The Freedom ofInformation Act passed Congress that year, but it remained toothless until 1974.The CIA and the White House, meanwhile, defeated a Senate movement for anintelligence oversight committee. In March, Lyndon Johnson requested that theFBI develop dossiers on legislators and prominent citizens opposed to theVietnam War. From June 6 to June 10, the army conducted biological warfare testsin the New York City subway system. Trillions of bacillus subtilis variant nigergerms were released into the subway system during peak travel hours.76[index_split_261.html#filepos1548464]In July 1966, with Richard Helms in place as the new director of centralintelligence, MK-Search went into overdrive, reactivating abandoned projects.One of these was Spellbinder, an operation managed by Gottlieb. Its goal was tocreate a “sleeper killer,” someone who could be turned loose after receiving akey word planted in his mind under hypnosis. According to Gordon Thomas, theproject was a failure.77 [index_split_261.html#filepos1548670]Despite growing civil unrest everywhere, the American media contributed itsshare toward maintaining a rigid status quo, almost obsequious in its complianceto the national security community. Sen. William Fulbright commented about thison August 13, 1966, during Senate hearings on government and media. It was veryinteresting, said Fulbright,> that so many of our prominent newspapers have become almost agents or adjuncts> of the government; that they do not contest or even raise questions about> government policy.78 [index_split_261.html#filepos1548811] Despite the dominance of news from Vietnam, UFO matters managed to break throughfor significant media coverage in 1966. The crescendo of qualified sightings wassimply overwhelming. After working in practical solitude for years, Keyhoe andNICAP board members now found themselves sought for interviews and televisionappearances. By midyear, it was apparent that Americans were giving much morecredence to the subject of flying saucers.79[index_split_261.html#filepos1548952]Frank Edwards published his own successful UFO book during the year, FlyingSaucers: Serious Business. The book beat the Keyhoe drum of cover-up and relayedmany interesting UFO reports. Others criticized it, with some justice, forcareless reporting and factual errors. Coral Lorenzen went so far as to considerit “catastrophic to researchers who deal with facts.” This was going a littlebit too far. It is true that Edwards graduated from the Donald E. Keyhoe Schoolof Purple Prose and, more seriously, reported many stories without bothering tocheck them. Yet, Lorenzen’s motivations derived at least in part from her feudwith NICAP, of which Edwards was a longtime, high-profile member. In the 1960sas in later decades, UFO research was ridden with infighting and rivalries.Edwards’s book, flawed though it was, remained undeniably valuable in manyrespects and contained much that was useful to contemporary and laterresearchers. His errors of fact certainly did not distinguish him from mostother UFO writers of the period. Only a year before, Jacques Vallee’s study ofUFOs, Anatomy of a Phenomenon, had appeared in print and received widespreadacclaim, and yet it, too, contained various mistakes. Even Coral Lorenzen,admittedly more scrupulous in such matters than most, was not immune toerrors.80 [index_split_261.html#filepos1549115]On February, 3, 1966, the air force convened an ad hoc committee to reviewProject Blue Book. Chaired by Dr. Brian O’Brien, it included Carl Sagan, JesseOrlansky, Launor Carter, Willis A. Ware, and Richard Porter. Also attending wasLt. Col. Harold A. Steiner, assistant secretary to the United States Air ForceScientific Advisory Board. The group, which met for one day, received a briefingfrom Quintanilla, reviewed the Robertson Panel report of 1953, and studied a fewUFO reports.At the end of this one-day analysis, the committee endorsed Blue Book, despiteits knowledge that most of the ten-thousand-plus sightings had been investigatedby a ghost of a staff. The committee concluded that UFOs did not representextraterrestrial technology and that they did not pose a threat to U.S.security. Still, it recommended that Blue Book be strengthened to provide abetter scientific investigation for a certain number of cases that appeared tobe worthy of study. Its primary conclusion—actually a bit of a jolt to the airforce—was that> perhaps one hundred sightings a year might be subjected to this close study,> and that possibly an average of ten man-days be required per sighting so> studied. The information provided by such a program might bring to light new> facts of scientific value. The committee also recommended that the UFO problem be handed over to a fewselected universities and the full reports of such work be “printed in full andbe available on request.” Moreover, Blue Book’s data, which was then classified,should be widely circulated among members of Congress and other publicofficials. There can be no question that the O’Brien Committee’s recommendationssat poorly with those seeking to keep the UFO problem buried. Ask Blue Book tosubject one hundred sightings per year to ten man-days of study each? One canimagine the reaction at ATIC. All of the committee’s proposals weredisregarded.81 [index_split_261.html#filepos1549255]During the same month, a UFO panel discussion called Open Mind took place, whichincluded John Fuller, Donald Menzel, Allen Hynek, Leo Sprinkle, and FrankSalisbury. Its moderator was Dr. Eric Goldman, on leave from Princeton to act asacademic advisor to LBJ. Included in the discussion was the Exeter incident.Menzel called the police officers “hysterical subjects,” although he could noteven recall their names, and clearly knew nothing about the case. Fuller, whoinvestigated the case thoroughly, was amazed at such a display.82[index_split_261.html#filepos1549446]"},{"pageContent":"MICHIGAN SWAMP GAS Not all the interesting sightings were in America. On January 19, 1966, animportant crop circle event occurred in the town of Tully, North Queensland,Australia. George Pedley, aged twenty-seven, was driving his tractor at 9 A.M.,when he heard a high-pitched sound and saw a gray-blue object rise from a swampylagoon, then depart. According to Pedley, “It was all over in a few seconds; itmoved at terrific speed.” At the site was an area of flattened swamp grass,swirled in a clockwise direction, with a diameter of about thirty feet. Pedleysoon brought others to the site, and before long, many investigators had come tosee and verify the claim. One of the investigating bodies was the RoyalAustralian air force intelligence. Investigators actually found a variety ofcircles in the area, ranging in size from eight to thirty feet in diameter.Within each circle, however, plant roots were pulled completely out of the soil,as if the ground had been subjected to an intense rotary force. There wererumors that blamed the Soviets for the landing, but investigators learned thatdozens of people in the area had seen strange saucer-like craft, many beforePedley’s sighting. It didn’t seem to be the Soviets.83[index_split_261.html#filepos1549588]February was a quiet month. Not so, March. On the fourteenth at 3:50 A.M., twodeputy sheriffs in Dexter, Michigan, saw several disc-shaped objects maneuveringabove the town. Three other police agencies had already reported similarsightings. Selfridge AFB confirmed tracking objects on radar at extreme speedsand maneuverability. However, the incident received no publicity. At midnight onMarch 17, in Milan, Michigan, another law enforcement officer saw a UFO. Thistime, a policeman saw what he thought was a plane about to crash, although itssilence puzzled him. When he tried contacting headquarters, his transmittermalfunctioned. The object did not crash. Instead, it approached the patrol carto within about seventy-five feet, followed him for about half a mile, then flewoff. It appeared to be about fifty feet in diameter, with lights spinning at theperiphery.84 [index_split_261.html#filepos1549813]Something was going on in Michigan. At about 8 P.M. on March 20, near Dexter,Michigan, Frank Mannor and his son, Ronald, saw a luminous object hovering overa swamp. It was brown, cone-shaped, and had bluish lights that turned red. Atonce, the object lit up with a yellowish glow and flew away rapidly, making awhistling sound. That night, several lights were reported moving around in aswamp area. More strange lights were reported the next evening, near Hillsdale,Michigan. Civil defense director William Van Horn, and a group of students, sawa pattern of lights on the ground, the source of which appeared to maneuver forabout two hours.85 [index_split_261.html#filepos1549976]Although the sightings of the past two nights had not been the most compellingof the recent Michigan sightings, they received national attention. To calmeveryone down, and to stem the flood of calls to the Pentagon, the air forcesent Hynek to Michigan to investigate. Hynek was pleased, as he had wanted toinvestigate the events there but the air force had not been interested untilnow. What happened next was disaster. Hynek arrived in Michigan and almostimmediately gave a press conference. Unable to explain the UFO reports, hecalled for a thorough investigation but focused on the ground lights, suggestingthey could have been marsh gas caused by decaying vegetable matter in the swampyareas. In other words, swamp gas.Clearly, this was a greatly premature statement, and the press ridiculed Hynekand the air force. To those who had followed Hynek’s longtime support of the airforce position, it was a moment of poetic justice. Hynek, however, later said hehad intended to conduct a serious investigation and did not learn until afterhis arrival in Michigan that this was not to be the case. Instead, the air forcemerely wanted a public relations ploy to defuse the situation. Hynek’s job, saidthe air force, was to hold a press conference immediately and explain. This maybe true; certainly Blue Book was not in the habit of pursuing UFO investigationsenergetically. Perhaps Hynek bungled it because the air force rushed him. Evenso, Quintanilla offered a contradictory view later that year while in Colorado.According to him, Hynek was convinced he had solved the Michigan sightings(“This is it!”), and as a result, received permission to give the pressconference.Whether it was Hynek or the air force who pushed, the air force never looked soincompetent and duplicitous on the matter of UFOs as it did at that moment.Hynek’s press conference all but destroyed Project Blue Book’s image.86[index_split_261.html#filepos1550135]While much of the media handed Hynek his head, many of the larger organizationsand publications continued to debunk flying saucers. Life and Newsweek stillsupported Hynek and the air force, for example. Life quoted Quintanilla as“certain that no evidence [has] turned up to date that has even hinted atspacecraft of unearthly origin.” Nothing was known of Quintanilla’s classifiedarticle regarding the Socorro incident. Instead, his remarks for publicconsumption were:> We are spending millions to develop our own rocket boosters to get our> spacecraft to the moon and beyond. Imagine what a great help it would be to> get our hands on a ship from another planet and examine its power plant.87> [index_split_261.html#filepos1550379] Shortly afterward, in May, CBS tried to calm the situation with a specialprogram narrated by Walter Cronkite, which took a straightforward, debunkingapproach to UFOs. It focused heavily on fringe elements, such as the contactees,and remarks by Sagan about “flying saucer cultists.” Menzel, Harold Brown, andeven the exiled Lawrence Tacker were also featured, each claiming that no UFOshad ever been detected on radar screens, nor photographed, nor seen by satellitetracking stations. For “balance,” Keyhoe and Hynek were included, but the tenorof the show was clearly to discredit their position.88[index_split_261.html#filepos1550565]Meanwhile, Congress had finally decided to act, after its own fashion. On March25, 1966, Michigan Congressman and House Minority Leader Gerald Ford demanded aformal congressional investigation on UFOs, supported by other congressmen. Afew days later, Ford wrote to Armed Services Committee Chairman L. Mendel Riversto the effect that he was dissatisfied with government actions regarding UFOs:> I think there may be substance in some of these reports and because I believe> the American people are entitled to a more thorough explanation than has been> given them by the air force to date.... I think we owe it to the people to> establish the credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible> enlightenment on this subject.89 [index_split_261.html#filepos1550726] Thus, on April 5, 1966, for the first time ever, Congress held an open hearingon UFOs, chaired by L. Mendel Rivers. Like the O‘Brien Committee, it met for oneday only and was an exclusive gathering. Only three people, Air Force SecretaryHarold Brown, Quintanilla, and Hynek, were invited to testify. NICAP, pushingten years for this moment, was not invited, but did submit material for therecord. The results were predictable. Hynek, licking his wounds, said that UFOsdeserved the scientific community’s attention and called for a civilian panel ofscientists to examine the program. Brown said there was no evidence to supportthe claim that UFOs were spaceships. Afterward, he reportedly directed the airforce to accept the O’Brien Committee’s recommendations and to arrange for ascientific team to investigate and review the over six hundred officiallyunidentified sightings. That was the end of congressional action.90[index_split_261.html#filepos1550888]All this attention from Congress and the media affected public opinion. In theaftermath of the swamp gas fiasco, a Gallup poll revealed that 46 percent ofAmericans believed UFOs to be real. Moreover, 5 percent thought they had seenone personally: a figure that projected to 9 million people. Keyhoe saw this asa serious concern for the air force. Possibly, but it is still hard to creditpublic opinion as an important determinant of UFO policy.91[index_split_261.html#filepos1551089]Throughout the spring, UFO sightings continued at a rapid pace. On the morningof March 23, just as the UFO controversy heated up in Congress, an electronicsinstructor named William “Eddy” Laxson was driving through Temple, Oklahoma, onhis way to work at Sheppard AFB in Wichita Falls, Texas. At 5:05 A.M., he saw anobject blocking the road. It was shaped like an airplane fuselage, about eightyfeet long, had a bubble-shaped dome on top, rested on legs, and had brightlights. Laxson saw a door and a short stairway on the side and a man incoveralls appearing to examine the craft. He even saw an identification numberon the craft: TL 4768. When he approached, the man went back inside, and theobject took off, making a sound similar to that of a high-speed drill. Laxsonwas familiar with all conventional military aircraft but could not recognizethis one. Researcher Jerome Clark called this case “one of the most impressiveof all.” Presumably, the existence of an ID number on the vehicle implies thatit was a classified or experimental project. Unfortunately, no subsequentevidence ever arose to support this conclusion.92[index_split_261.html#filepos1551248]Additional landing cases were reported in Lexisburg, Indiana, Mansfield, Ohio,and Vicksburg, Michigan on March 30 and 31. In two cases, an unidentified objectfollowed or flew past an automobile; the other involved a sighting of a shorthumanoid inside a landed craft. On April 1 near Tangier, Oklahoma, a man who wasdriving at night reached a hilltop and saw a green object flying north rapidly,giving off a high-pitched noise and intense heat. His car engine died. Twoclose-range sightings of UFO craft by civilians in New York State occurred onApril 5, and another one that night took place in Tennessee.93[index_split_261.html#filepos1551410]"},{"pageContent":"THE PORTAGE COUNTY SIGHTINGS On April 17, an amazing UFO sighting, high-speed police chase, and possible airforce jet interception took place in Portage County, Ohio, and across thePennsylvania border. The case involved at least eight police officers andseveral civilians, incredible air force stonewalling and investigativeincompetence, and several ruined careers.At 5 A.M. on the seventeenth, four miles east of Randolph, Ohio, and shortlyafter returning from an accident scene, Portage County Deputy Sheriff Dale F.Spaur, traveling with Wilbur Neff (an auxiliary deputy whose main occupation wasairport mechanic), saw a rusty car parked on the highway’s shoulder. Spaur gotout to inspect the vehicle, while Neff stood by in front of the patrol car. AsSpaur glanced over his right shoulder, he saw a moving light through the treesat the top of a hill to the west, headed in his direction. Spaur was intrigued,since only fifteen minutes earlier, he and Neff had overheard radio trafficbetween Portage and Summit counties about a report of a large, bright object. Ithad gotten some laughs, but now Spaur realized that he was looking at theprobable source of the report. At 5 A.M., it was still dark, but Spaur and Neffboth described this object as extremely bright, enough to cause Spaur’s eyes towater. It passed over the road, then hovered fifty to one hundred feet in theair. Spaur and Neff raced back to their car, and Spaur contacted the sheriff’soffice, which told him to wait there until a car with a camera arrived.Spaur did not wait very long: the object ascended vertically to three hundred orfour hundred feet, getting brighter all the while, and emitted a humming noise.It then hovered some more. Spaur drove toward it, and he and Neff could now seeit was perhaps forty feet in diameter and about twenty feet thick, a perfectoval shape. Soon, the object began to ascend and move away. Spaur followed itdown Route 224 and was urged over the radio to shoot at the object, which herefused to do. Very quickly, he was driving at 100 mph. The object was so brightthat Spaur hardly needed his headlights to drive. As the object reached MahoningCounty, the pursuit was being broadcast over police radios in three counties. Atthis point the police car with the camera misunderstood the directions and gotlost.At Canfield, Ohio, Spaur and Neff continued to chase the object. They noticedthe object become more clearly visible as the sun continued to rise, or perhapsthey were just becoming accustomed to the object. Either way, they now discerneda metallic appearance, domelike top, and a long antenna protruding from therear-center of the object. The object seemed to slow down for them when they hadto slow down. As the officers neared East Palestine, Ohio, Patrolman H. WayneHuston, who had been following the chase on his radio, also saw the object.Huston watched it go overhead and said “it was brighter than the sun when itcame up.” He followed Spaur and Neff, at times reaching 100 mph.Just before 5:30 A.M.—nearly thirty minutes into the chase—in Salem, Ohio, twopolice officers near the border with Pennsylvania, who had been listening to thechase on the radio, saw the object. They described it as “a bright ball,” muchlarger than a jet, of unvarying brightness in the distance. They also saw threejets following it. Columbiana County Sheriff’s Deputy Dave Brothers followed thecommotion on the radio and also saw three airplanes. An AP report later statedthat Air Force Reserve pilots out of Youngstown attempted to follow the object,but that its speed, “estimated at one hundred miles an hour,” was too slow forthem.At the same time in Conway, Pennsylvania, local police officer Frank Panzarellasaw the object. In his words to Blue Book, it was “the shape of a half of [a]football, was very bright, and about twenty-five to thirty-five feet indiameter.” The two Ohio police cars raced into Conway at 5:30 A.M. They hadtraveled about fifty miles in a half hour, and now received instructions toabandon the chase. For most of the past thirty minutes, the object hadmaintained a fairly consistent altitude of one thousand feet. But now, itrapidly ascended to about 3,500 feet, then hovered. Panzarella saw this andcalled the Rochester, Pennsylvania, police operator, John Beighey, asking him tocontact the Greater Pittsburgh International Airport. Panzarella saw an airlinerpass beneath the object, then saw what looked like jet trails. He heard a voiceon his radio announcing that a jet interception was in progress. The objectfinally shot high into the air and disappeared.The event seemed to be over. In thirty minutes, many police officers andcivilians had seen the UFO, and the two police cars from Ohio now began theirdrive home. Just then, however, Panzarella received a call from Beighey that theair force office in Pittsburgh wanted to hear from the witnesses immediately.Beighey also said that during his call, he heard someone at the airport say theobject was “on the screen,” implying a radar return. Within minutes, Panzarellacaught up with Spaur, Neff, and Huston; just before he stepped out of his car,he heard a fading voice on the radio say, “Hey, Frank, I saw two jets....” Thevoice was that of Patrolman Henry Kwaitanowski. He had seen two jets, whichlooked like commercial airliners, flying behind a shiny, football-shaped object,which appeared to be about the same size and at about the same altitude.The three Ohio police officers went to the Rochester police station, and Spaurphoned the air force at Pittsburgh. Speaking to “some colonel,” he said theofficer tried to convince him he had seen something conventional. The officerdid not speak to the other two policemen.The case gained national attention immediately. The air force began itsinvestigation the next day, which consisted of a few phone calls to local mediaand checks for weather balloons (none were found). In any case, the wind nearground level was negligible that day and could not have accounted for themovement ascribed to the object. The air force personnel in Youngstown andPittsburgh denied that anything had been out of the ordinary, or that anythinghad turned up on radar. Quintanilla phoned Spaur, asking him to “tell me aboutthis mirage you saw.” Spaur later said, “Hell, I talked longer with that colonelSunday morning, and he didn’t ask much.” Quintanilla called Spaur briefly a fewdays later to confirm that he had seen the object for more than a few minutes(!).On April 22, Blue Book announced the solution to the Portage County sighting:the officers had first seen an Echo satellite; after it had moved out of sight,Spaur had mistaken the planet Venus for the same object. When Quintanilla phonedSpaur’s superior, Portage County Sheriff Ross Dustman, to give him thisexplanation, Dustman actually laughed out loud.Another investigation was being conducted, however, by William B. Weitzel, aprofessor of philosophy and field investigator for NICAP. Unlike the air force,Weitzel actually spoke to the principal police witnesses. He considered the BlueBook explanation to be absurd and before long wrote a four-page letter toCongressman William Stanton, whose district included Portage County. Shortlyafterwards, a Portage County judge who knew each of the three Ohio officersinvolved also wrote to Stanton, calling the air force explanation “ridiculous.”Stanton was soon in communication with the air force commanding general. Then,after getting no reply for two weeks, he spoke with Air Force Chief of theCommunity Relations Division Lt. Col. John Spaulding, who promised to send aninvestigator to the site.Quintanilla phoned Spaur again on May 9, obviously under pressure. He would bethere the next day to interview him, he said. Spaur asked Weitzel to record theinterview, and Weitzel brought his crew: two reporters and space-scientist /UFOresearcher David Webb. In addition, Sheriff Dustman was present. Quintanilla,none too happy about the crowd, asked Weitzel and Webb to leave the room, andthe reporters soon left as well. It didn’t matter: the meeting was ugly.Quintanilla failed to persuade Spaur of the air force explanation, and theexchange, which was recorded, became heated at times. When Weitzel returned tothe room, he and Quintanilla had their own exchange over the Echo/Venusexplanation, which Weitzel said contradicted the mass of witness testimony, mostof which Quintanilla never knew about.Congressman Stanton continued to apply pressure on the case and complained toSecretary of Defense Robert McNamara about Blue Book’s treatment of hisconstituents. Weitzel wrote to Quintanilla on May 17 with another critique ofthe Blue Book explanation. Even Hynek urged Blue Book to change the case tounknown. Still, in the words of Jerome Clark, Blue Book “withstood theonslaught.” The official explanation remained Echo/Venus.The incident ruined the career and marriage of Dale Spaur, who was apparentlytraumatized by the incident itself and then the subject of relentless ridicule.Immediately after the event, he seemed to change. His wife “never saw him morefrightened before.” He inexplicably became violent with her, and she filedassault-and-battery charges, then for divorce. Six months later, he had lostforty pounds, turned in his badge, and was working as a painter while living ina small motel room.Huston also resigned from the force within a few months and became a bus driverin Seattle. He had been a seven-year veteran. “Sure, I quit because of thatthing,” he said. “People laughed at me. And there was pressure. You couldn’t putyour finger on it, but the pressure was there. The city officials didn’t likepolice officers chasing flying saucers.” Wilbur Neff wasn’t a full-time policeofficer, but he, too, was affected. His wife said, “I hope I never see him likehe was after the chase. He was real white, almost in a state of shock.”94[index_split_261.html#filepos1551555]The Portage County UFO sightings were among the most compelling of 1966, butthere were other UFO sightings in the area at the time. On the night of April 18in Battle Creek, Michigan, a gray, oval object, about eighty feet in diameterand fifteen feet high, was seen from a distance of about eighty feet by aforty-two-year-old witness driving a car. The driver claimed to see windows andthree rows of lights. The next night, in Peabody, Massachusetts, a man saw whathe thought was a crashing plane, then realized the object was oval, withmulticolored lights. The object flew low over him, circled, came down withpendulum motion, and appeared to land on Route 114. Shortly afterwards, two mendriving along that route saw a beam sweep the road. They stopped and saw adisc-like object with multicolored lights matching the description of the firstreport. On April 25, Florida Governor Haydon Burns and a group of newsmen had aclose sighting of a UFO while on the governor’s Convair during a campaign tour.The craft paced the plane, then climbed away. Several journalists aboard theplane also saw the object and gave the story wide publicity.95[index_split_261.html#filepos1551726]"},{"pageContent":"JAMES MCDONALD, AN OUTSTANDING NUISANCE During the spring of 1966, James McDonald, atmospheric physicist from theUniversity of Arizona, entered the UFO picture. In March, he had written to TomMalone, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on theAtmospheric Sciences, urging that a small panel be set up by some scientificbody, which would avoid publicity but gain access to Blue Book and relatedfiles. McDonald also wrote to Congressman Morris Udall about the idea and urgedUdall to pass the letter on in confidence to Gerald Ford, who was then makingwaves over the Michigan sightings. Naturally, McDonald hoped to participate onsuch a panel. The idea never materialized, but McDonald soon received a smallstipend from the Office of Naval Research to examine Blue Book material atWright-Patterson AFB. The reason given: perhaps certain kinds of clouds couldaccount for some of the radar trackings of UFOs.On June 6, 1966, McDonald, at Wright-Patterson AFB, discovered an unedited copyof the Robertson Panel report. Seeing what surely appeared to be hard evidencethat the CIA was directing a cover-up, McDonald was extremely disturbed. Twodays later, he was at the office of J. Allen Hynek. Pounding his fist on Hynek’sdesk at one point, McDonald said Hynek should have spoken out about the cover-upof UFO information. Vallee was present and described McDonald as a man “afraidof nothing.” This was true, a quality that eventually led to McDonald’sdownfall. But for now, the air force saw McDonald as a man they needed tofireproof. Hynek wrote that the Blue Book staff considered McDonald as an“outstanding nuisance.” Certainly they gave him no assistance in his research:on June 30, he requested that Wright-Patterson photocopy the Robertson Panelreport for him. This was denied. On July 20, McDonald learned that the reportwas “reclassified” by the CIA.96 [index_split_261.html#filepos1551899]During the summer of 1966, McDonald met with the Lorenzens at their home andrepeated his complaint that Hynek should have spoken out long before. TheLorenzens were unimpressed. McDonald’s complaints about “alleged censorship” didnot persuade them, and he appeared to be “totally oblivious to the psychologicalaspects involved,” whatever that meant. Besides, McDonald had not done muchhimself. Like Hynek, he had been collecting data for years, “but waited untilothers had paved the way before publicly stating his own opinions.”97[index_split_261.html#filepos1552074]Hynek, still reeling from the awful publicity he received in March, and furtheraffected by McDonald’s demonstration in his own office, wrote a letter thatsummer to Science magazine, which publicly contradicted the air force positionof the recent Armed Services Committee hearing. He stated that the air force didhave unexplained radar reports and photographs of UFOs. He called for an end towitness ridicule and, in a direct slap at Blue Book, stated that a scientificprogram had never been undertaken regarding UFOs. One should be initiated, hewrote, as soon as possible.98 [index_split_261.html#filepos1552229]The air force had reached a dead end in its public handling of the UFO problem.During the summer of 1966, Vallee heard rumors in Europe through “informalchannels” that the air force was looking for an excuse to unload UFOs. Theproblem was “to find a university that was willing to write a negative reportafter a cursory examination of the facts.” In fact, wrote Vallee, this rumor wastaken seriously enough in Paris to prevent the creation of a French UFOinvestigative committee, where pressure was also rising for something of thesort.99 [index_split_261.html#filepos1552402]Meanwhile, UFO sightings continued at a fast rate, including a close-rangesighting by a Michigan police officer on June 13 and an investigation bySelfridge AFB. On June 23, Apollo Space Project Engineer Julian Sandoval andother witnesses reported seeing a UFO about three hundred feet long nearAlbuquerque. It left at an amazing speed, they said, swiftly reaching over 3,000mph. Through the summer, more close-range sightings were reported throughout theUnited States.100 [index_split_261.html#filepos1552542]"},{"pageContent":"AN AUTUMN BARRAGE The autumn of 1966 may not have equaled the spring in number or quality of UFOsightings, but it still reminded people why all the action was stirring withinthe air force and elsewhere. On August 20, just before 5 P.M. in Donnybrook,North Dakota, a border patrolman saw a bright, shiny disc on its edge, aboutthirty feet in diameter, floating down the side of a hill, wobbling from side toside low over the ground. It reached the bottom, then climbed to about onehundred feet and moved across to a small reservoir. The patrolman then saw adome on top. It hovered briefly and seemed ready to land but tilted back andzoomed into the clouds. Hynek personally interviewed the officer and believedhim to be “above reproach.”101 [index_split_261.html#filepos1552702]Another sighting occurred in North Dakota on August 24, this time involvingMinot AFB. At 10 P.M., an airman reported on base radio that a multicoloredlight was visible very high in the sky. A team went to the location, confirmedthe original unknown, then saw a second, white object pass in front of clouds.The base radar tracked the object, which was as high as 100,000 feet (almosttwenty miles). The object rose and descended several times; each time itdescended, an air force officer in charge of a missile crew found his radiotransmission interrupted by static, even though he was sixty feet below theground. The object eventually descended to ground level ten to fifteen milessouth of the area. The air force sent a strike team to check. Apparently, theysaw the object either on the ground or hovering very low. According to theofficial report:> When the team was about ten miles from the landing site, static disrupted> radio contact with them. Five to eight minutes later, the glow diminished, and> the UFO took off. Another UFO was visually sighted and confirmed by radar. The> one that was first sighted passed beneath the second. Radar also confirmed> this. The first made for altitude toward the north, and the second seemed to> disappear with the glow of red. The incident lasted nearly four hours and was confirmed by three differentmissile sites but failed to reach the press.102[index_split_261.html#filepos1552844]On September 13, 1966, an eleven-year-old in Stirum, North Dakota, saw adisc-shaped object land near a farm. It had a tripod landing gear, two redlights, two white lights, one green light, and a transparent dome. It left soquickly that it appeared to vanish. Two investigators, including an air forcelieutenant colonel, went to the site and discovered three round impressions inthe ground several inches deep, very compact. In Summerside, Canada, onSeptember 21, eight members of the Royal Canadian air force saw a bright objectthat flew down rapidly, stopped abruptly, remained at ground level for twentyminutes, then ascended vertically.103 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553015]In the New York area, a number of UFO reports in October centered around LakeWanaque, a large reservoir in northeastern New Jersey and the main feeder forthe Jersey City water supply. In a story picked up by the wire services, tens ofthousands of people poured into the area night after night to see lightedobjects over the water. The military also arrived, as the reservoir wasstrategically important. The mysterious lights were not seen over the reservoirper se, but over the small mountain range or range of large hills on the westside of the lake. One resident said such sightings had been in that area forhalf a century.104 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553161]"},{"pageContent":"SLOUCHING TOWARDS COLORADO Throughout the spring of 1966, the air force had sought a university willing toundertake a formal study of UFOs. In August, consideration centered on theUniversity of Colorado, featuring the world-renowned physicist Dr. Edward U.Condon. The announcement would not be made for several months yet, but the teamat Colorado was already working to decide how best to handle—or disable—thesubject. On August 9, a memorandum was written by the person who quickly became,behind Condon, the number two man of the project. Although he was no scientist,Robert Low was a senior administrator of the university and a formerintelligence officer who appears to have performed some serious work for the CIAin Albania twenty years earlier. On this day, Low wrote a memorandum addressedto Thurston E. Manning, the university’s vice president and Dean of Faculties,and Dr. E. James Archer, Dean of the Graduate School. Low’s memorandum laid outthe strategy for handling the UFO problem. “The trick would be,” wrote Low,> to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally> objective study, but to the scientific community would present the image of a> group of nonbelievers trying their best to be objective but having an almost> zero expectation of finding a saucer.... The memorandum blew up a year later, after project members found it and leakedit. Ironically, Archer claimed never to have seen the memo until journalist R.Roger Harkins brought it to his attention in November 1967. In Harkins’sjudgment, Archer was genuinely shocked when he read it, even though it had beenfiled in his office. Harkins asked Archer if he thought the memo wasdeliberately not sent to him; Archer paused, then smiled. “No comment,” he said.For now, however, preparations seemed underway for a phony study that wouldplacate the public as well as the skeptical, albeit unstudied, scientificcommunity.105 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553308]On August 31, Col. Ivan C. Atkinson, deputy executive director of the air forceOffice of Scientific Research, formally approached the University of Coloradowith the request to conduct a comprehensive examination of the UFO problem. Thisprogram was to be independent and beyond the authority of the air force. Ofcourse, the CIA was another matter entirely. Moreover, just how independentcould the Colorado study be, when it was wholly financed by air force money? Foryears, UFO researchers had argued that Congress should foot the bill for such anundertaking, an effort that the air force and its allies had thwarted everytime. Part of the problem with a congressionally funded program, from the airforce point of view, was the obvious loss of control, or at least influence,over the study’s direction. Direct funding, with air force money, would mitigatesuch a problem, if for no other reason than that the air force itself wouldchoose who would conduct the study. More than a decade earlier, when assemblingNICAP’s board of directors, Keyhoe also had understood the value of selectingthe right people for the job.106 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553505]In August, however, the main UFO news was coming not from Colorado, but theWashington Star. On August 7, the Star carried an article on UFOs by Lt. Col.Charles Cooke, a retired air force officer and former intelligence officer inWorld War Two. After the war he became founder and editor of the AirIntelligence Digest and was later editor of FEAF, the Far East Air ForceIntelligence Round-up. Cooke wrote that he had analyzed firsthand UFO encountersby air force pilots, which showed strong evidence supporting theextraterrestrial hypothesis. He strongly criticized Project Blue Book. Shortlyafter this, there was a renewed effort in Congress to break air force UFOcensorship. Rep. Edward Hutchinson had already introduced a resolution, HR 866,for an investigation of Project Blue Book methods. Now, in the wake of Cooke’sarticle, Hutchinson obtained new backing. By the middle of the month, an airforce officer privately told Keyhoe that the CIA had gotten them into this mess,“and now they sit back out of sight while the air force catches all thehell.”107 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553650]The other main piece of UFO-related news from August 1966, was the debut ofdebunker Philip Klass into the field. On August 22, he printed an article inAviation Week explaining the UFO at Exeter from the year before as plasmadischarges from high-voltage power lines. Klass received immediate attention,including a sympathetic New York Times article, which, in the words ofjournalist Howard Blum, made him “an instant authority” on UFOs. In earlyOctober, Klass again discussed UFOs in Aviation Week. Even so, most seriousresearchers never took his plasma or ball lightning theory seriously. UnlikeKlass, James McDonald was an atmospheric physicist and ripped Klass’s plasmatheory apart. (“Klass dismissed!”) Klass soon left plasmas behind to move on tomore traditional methods of debunkery: character assassination and ridicule. Hisfirst target was McDonald.108 [index_split_261.html#filepos1553792]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY The year 1966 was a crucial turning point in the history of the UFO problem. Forover two years, thousands of UFO reports had swamped America, many of them goodquality and utterly baffling. As a result, UFO consciousness was as high as ithad been in 1947 and 1952, and the belief in UFOs even higher. The debunkingsystem, in place since the 1953 Robertson Panel and which explained away UFOs atall costs, had broken down completely. True, Project Blue Book continued toderive explanations for an awesome number of reports which, upon superficialreview, seemed impressive. The problem was the loss of credibility: no one butthe most trusting loyalist believed Blue Book any longer. The explanationscoming from Dayton seemed, to many, absurd and even dishonest.Blue Book’s loss of credibility, however, did not mean the air force, or CIA, orwhatever group in the caverns of American intelligence ran this thing, had lostcontrol over the UFO problem. Project Blue Book, as a tool of the program, hadbecome ineffective. What was needed, therefore, was a new tool. In obtainingone, the air force and its allies never lost the initiative and easilyoutmaneuvered Congress to control the destiny of the UFO problem within thepublic domain. The air force or the CIA—but not Congress—would choose the peoplewho would, hopefully, end public speculation about UFOs.Contrast the management of the problem by the military/intelligence communitywith the failure of NICAP to exploit its opportunity. For ten years, NICAP hadpressed for congressional hearings on UFOs. Finally, amid the wave of 1966,Congress relented: a one-day hearing, to which NICAP was not even invited. Couldthe message have been any clearer? The UFO wave had given NICAP a rareopportunity which, had it occurred five years earlier, the organization mighthave been able to play more effectively. Now, however, NICAP lacked theleadership: Hillenkoetter and Fahrney were long gone, Keyhoe was getting old,and Hall, despite his abilities, was no Keyhoe. NICAP also lacked the money tolaunch an effective campaign for a real congressional investigation. Besides,NICAP never spoke for a unified “UFO community.” APRO held views that divergedand at times opposed NICAP’s, and neither organization was especially large,anyway. Undoubtedly, an ineffective organization is better than none at all. Butopportunities pass quickly, and NICAP let this one slip away.Finally, we may inquire about the attitude of the U.S. national securitycommunity to the UFOs themselves during this great wave. In 1947 and 1948, forinstance, we see prominent generals and scientists studying the problem andseriously considering the extraterrestrial possibility; in 1952 we see the airforce “bracing for an invasion”; what of 1966? The answer is hard to know withcertainty. Internally, there appear to have been no major reevaluations of theUFO problem or policy. However, the air force moved efficiently toward droppingits great public burden: Project Blue Book. Not only had Blue Book damaged theoverall credibility of the air force, but it probably hampered seriousinvestigations to some degree, simply by stimulating public inquiry. It’s hardto conduct a secret investigation that everyone knows about.And the past few years had brought many UFO cases that demanded secret inquiry:two probable UFO crashes and military retrievals; a possible landing at HollomanAFB; definite landings near Minot AFB, Blaine AFB, and elsewhere; the sightingby a trustworthy police officer of a landed craft and its humanoid occupants;continued sightings by army, navy, and air force personnel ; more attempted jetintercepts of UFO craft; the proliferation of crop circles in several countries;the continuation of UFO and humanoid sightings worldwide. These developmentspoint to continued concern, or at least strong interest, by the nationalsecurity state over unidentified flying objects, and the continuation in itsbelief that this was a matter that must never, ever, be allowed to escape itscontrol."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8 Winners and Losers: 1966 to 1969 > My own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that> UFOs are probably extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that> might very tentatively be termed “surveillance.”—James McDonald, physicist, before Congress in July 1968 > > > > If “they” discover you, it is an old but hardly invalid rule of thumb, “they”> are your technological superiors.—NSA analyst and author, 1968 > > > > [N]othing has come from the study of UFOs in the past twenty-one years that> has added to scientific knowledge.

Once it settled upon the University ofColorado for deliverance, it moved quickly. On September 19, AFR 200-2 wassuperseded by AFR 80-17, which stipulated that some data from UFO reports wouldnot be sent to Colorado:> Every effort will be made to keep all UFO reports unclassified. However, if it> is necessary to classify a report because of method of detection or other> factors not related to the UFO, a separate report including all possible> information will be sent to the University of Colorado. Item #5 of Paragraph 12 also restated that all radar evidence of UFOs wasautomatically classified and could not be discussed or revealed to the public. 1[index_split_262.html#filepos1554118]On October 6, 1966, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research formallycontracted with the University of Colorado at Boulder to conduct a “serious,objective, scientific, and independent investigation” of the UFO phenomenon. Thestudy was to be directed by physicist Dr. Edward U. Condon, assisted byUniversity of Colorado administrator Robert Low. The air force allocated$313,000 for the project, which was planned to run from November 15, 1966, toJanuary 1968.The decision appealed to all parties, including Hynek, Keyhoe, the Lorenzens,and McDonald. The relief was so strong that a body other than the air forcewould do an official study of UFOs, people assumed it had to be better than whatthe air force had inflicted upon the public.The honeymoon was brief, however. Condon immediately demonstrated his dislikefor the entire subject and his support for the air force position. On October 8,he was widely quoted as saying it was “highly improbable” UFOs existed. “Theview that UFOs are hallucinatory will be a subject of our investigation,” hesaid, “to discover what it is that makes people imagine they see things.” Theair force had done a good job, he told the Denver Post. “About 95 percent of theUFO reports are relatively easily identified,” he said. “With more information,others could probably be explained ... [which] indicates an appalling lack ofpublic understanding.” Low’s remarks were similarly disparaging, but heacknowledged that “you don’t say no to the air force.”2[index_split_262.html#filepos1554280]At the same time, James McDonald made the news. All year long, McDonald had beenstudying the old reports, interviewing hundreds of witnesses. For a scientist ofworld stature, as McDonald was, this was unprecedented. His analyses of oldercases laid waste to the conclusions of Menzel, Klass, and the air force. Forgood reason, the air force feared James McDonald. So, after working diligentlyon the UFO problem for most of the year, McDonald went public on October 4,1966. First to reporters in Tucson, and the next day at the University ofArizona Department of Meteorology colloquium, he gave his views on the realityof UFOs and the concealment of information. The faculty was wary; one ofMcDonald’s friends called the decision “professionally risky.”3[index_split_262.html#filepos1554492]On October 7, McDonald spoke to reporters about the Robertson Panel report,which he had seen the previous June at Wright-Patterson AFB. The CIA had orderedthe air force to debunk UFOs, he said. A few days later, he spoke at theAmerican Meteorological Society meeting in Washington, D.C.The speech was explosive:> My study of past official air force investigations (Project Blue Book) leads> me to describe them as completely superficial. They have, for at least the> past dozen years, been carried out at a very low level of scientific> competence.... Officially released “explanations” of important UFO sightings> have often been almost absurdly erroneous.

On the other hand, official press releases,> statements to Congress, etc., have conveyed an impression that no significant> scientific problem exists with respect to UFOs. McDonald was rocking the boat with authority, saying things no one had said, atleast not this well. Keyhoe had tried to convey this sort of thing, but therewas only one James McDonald.4 [index_split_262.html#filepos1554631]Keyhoe remained in the mix, however. By mid-October, he was already distressedby what Condon and Low were saying, and decided to phone them. Both assured himthey had been misquoted and asked for NICAP’s support. Unpersuaded, Keyhoenonetheless gave in. He expressed his reservations to Colorado UniversityProject member (and NICAP member) David Saunders; with some effort, Saunders andRichard Hall convinced him that NICAP needed to support the project, at leastfor now.5 [index_split_262.html#filepos1554792]"},{"pageContent":"VISITS TO BOULDER Condon shot from the hip again on November 5, 1966. The Colorado Project, hetold the press, had “to take it on faith that the air force is not trying todeceive us.” Referring to McDonald, he continued, “I know some people whobelieve the air force is misleading us, but I don’t think so. Maybe they are. Idon’t care much.” This was not an auspicious start to the project. By now,Condon was already using the phrase “damn UFO,” to his colleagues. But Condonappeared to be a remote director of this project and was spending only half ofhis university time on it. More visible direction came from project coordinatorRobert Low.6 [index_split_262.html#filepos1554946]Throughout November, the University of Colorado received a steady stream ofvisits from major UFO researchers. On November 11, Allen Hynek, accompanied byhis protégé Jacques Vallee, visited the team at Boulder. Hynek gave a history ofUFOs, describing them as the greatest mystery of the age, perhaps ever. Valleediscussed how UFOs might be studied scientifically. He brazenly (andpresciently) predicted failure for the project: the duration of the study, hesaid, was too short and the current wave of sightings would probably not lastvery long. Hynek and Vallee both sensed that Low, not Condon, was “clearly thedecision-maker.” Privately, Hynek told project member physicist Roy Craig thatthe project must recommend that scientific investigations of UFO reports becontinued.7 [index_split_262.html#filepos1555120]On the heels of the Hynek-Vallee visit, Blue Book chief Hector Quintanillabriefed the project on November 14. He generally restated Hynek’s remarks, withnone of the enthusiasm for the subject. He contradicted Hynek on one point: theaccount of the Michigan swamp gas incident, as noted earlier.8[index_split_262.html#filepos1555316]On November 22, 1966, James McDonald informally visited several project members.He explained some radar complexities and mirage effects. He also told them thatthe time would come when they would find themselves “confronting astonishingevidence of mishandling of the UFO problems by your sponsoring agency,” that is,the air force.9 [index_split_262.html#filepos1555469]Keyhoe arrived in Boulder with Richard Hall on November 28. They met Low firstand showed him some strong NICAP reports. When Keyhoe brought out the 1959Redmond, Oregon, case, however, Low dismissed it as too far back. “The witnesseswouldn’t remember the details.” Keyhoe was astonished: the case was only sevenyears old, and the witnesses were still available for interview. Moreover, Low,who knew nothing about UFOs, was posing as an expert. Keyhoe met privately withCondon and Saunders, during which time Condon did little more than quip aboutcontactees. In their presentations to the project members, Keyhoe focused on thecover-up, while Hall argued that the best way to review the UFO evidence was notto isolate each case, but to assess their combined weight.Later, Saunders told Keyhoe that most project members would work hard for a fullinvestigation, “as much as the contract allows.” Keyhoe failed to grasp the fullflavor of this until he returned to Washington. Back home, he read thisparagraph in the air force contract with the University of Colorado:> Because of the continuance of Project Blue Book for the handling of all> reports, it is our understanding that the university is under no obligation to> investigate reported sightings other than those that the principal> investigators [Condon and Low] select for study. With Condon’s and Low’s attitudes already quite clear, this was bad news.10[index_split_262.html#filepos1555622]Bad news continued when Low visited NICAP’s headquarters soon after. After someprodding by Keyhoe, he admitted that Condon considered the early reports to beworthless. For Keyhoe, this was almost too much—nearly everything NICAP had wasan “early” report. Before NICAP wasted any more time providing UFO reports tothe Colorado Project, he said, he wanted to know from Condon about the recent1965 cases NICAP had just provided. Otherwise, NICAP might pull out altogether.Low tried to assure Keyhoe of a fair investigation.11[index_split_262.html#filepos1555801]On January 12, 1967, the air force advisory panel held a special briefing inBoulder. This time, Condon was deferential. He discussed project plans and askedfor air force opinions on where the emphasis should be placed with respect topolicy questions. Lt. Col. Robert Hippler, the chief liaison with the Universityof Colorado Project, replied, “You see, first of all, we (the air force) havenot charged you, and you have not promised, to prove or disprove anything.”Eventually, however, Hippler remarked that, “I don’t think we want anyrecommendation from you unless you feel strongly about it.” By January 16,Hippler’s position evolved a bit more in a letter to Condon, stating that sinceno one knew of any extraterrestrial visitation, there was therefore “novisitation.” Instead, Condon needed to consider the air force’s cost ofinvestigating UFOs and decide whether taxpayers ought to foot the bill on thiswasteful project “for the next ten years.”12[index_split_262.html#filepos1555942]Despite such omens as these, others tried to keep faith in Condon. By the end of1966, APRO had sent about 250 UFO reports to Boulder. Hynek, too, expressed hopein the project in a December 17, 1966, article in the Saturday Evening Post.13[index_split_262.html#filepos1556101]"},{"pageContent":"THE PROJECT BEGINS Throughout the later part of 1966, strange UFO reports continued, many of whichwere now headed for Boulder as well as ATIC. Several described UFO occupants,such as a November 2 incident in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and a November 17case in Gaffney, South Carolina, in which two patrolmen saw a craft on theground and a small man in a shiny suit who spoke perfect English. On the nightof December 30, 1966, in Haynesville, Louisiana, a physics professor drivingthrough a wooded area saw a bright, pulsing, orange and white glow, deep in thewoods. The next day, he found traces of burns and called the air force and theUniversity of Colorado.14 [index_split_262.html#filepos1556270]With the exception of David Saunders, however, project members showed littleinterest in UFOs. It is not surprising that the project started sluggishly. InNovember, Low took the project’s first field trip—with Hynek—to Minot andDonnybrook, North Dakota, to investigate the August 1966 sighting. In December,project member Dr. William Scott, a psychologist, devised a questionnaire forUFO witnesses. He devoted only one page to fundamentals (size, shape, color,etc.) and about twenty pages to the psychological reaction of the observer. WhenScott discovered that his perspective was not the project’s main focus, he tookhis questionnaire and went home. Saunders began to wonder whether such adisparate academic group could work together as a team.In December, Michael Wertheimer was in Washington investigating the 1952sightings. Virtually every witness still disputed Gen. John Samford’s publicexplanation. Wertheimer initially concluded the sightings could not be explainedbut soon wrote a paper discussing visual misperceptions, implying this as theexplanation. It was a “logically indefensible jump,” he said, from seeingsomething unexplainable to concluding that extraterrestrials were behind it.On January 13, 1967, Low traveled with project member Jim Wadsworth to Joplin,Missouri. The trip stimulated much press interest and, according to contemporaryreports, each man ran interference for the other the whole time.15[index_split_262.html#filepos1556455]"},{"pageContent":"CONDON LOSING ALLIES Condon continued to cause public relations mishaps. On January 25, 1967, he wasin Corning, New York, making another speech. This time the Elmira Star-Gazettequoted him saying that he did not take UFOs seriously and that they were not thebusiness of the air force:> It is my inclination right now to recommend that the government get out of> this business. My attitude right now is that there’s nothing to it ... but I’m> not supposed to reach a conclusion for another year. After this, Keyhoe told Saunders that NICAP was “through” with the ColoradoProject. Saunders was astonished by Condon’s remarks. It must be a mistake, hethought, and he checked with Condon the next day. No, said Condon, he had beenaccurately quoted: what is all this fuss about? Saunders convinced him to writea letter to Keyhoe to patch things up. Condon grudgingly sent off a weak note tothe major.16 [index_split_262.html#filepos1556628]Within days, Keyhoe was back in Boulder for what he believed would be a finalmeeting with the Colorado team before NICAP withdrew its support. Condon aloneseemed oblivious to the implications. NICAP’s withdrawal of support, so early inthe project, could be a serious blow to the entire effort. Other project memberstried to convince Condon that the project needed NICAP Condon was prevailed uponand threw Keyhoe a bone. The ignored NICAP reports, he said, would be examinedas soon as possible. “I appreciate your cooperation and I hope NICAP willcontinue.” Once again, Keyhoe accepted this for the time being, but Condon wasangry at having to apologize. 17 [index_split_262.html#filepos1556787]James McDonald also saw storm clouds. By late January 1967, he lobbied thepresident of the National Academy of Sciences, Frederick Seitz, with somerelatively mild criticisms of the project and revived his idea for a UFOresearch panel. Seitz, however, was a former student of Condon’s, and McDonaldgot nowhere.By February 1967, according to Vallee, several project members had privatelyapproached their scientific colleagues to learn their reactions to therecommendation that Blue Book be closed down. All this before any significantinvestigative work had even been done.18 [index_split_262.html#filepos1556949]On the twentieth of that month, project members Condon, Low, Saunders, Price,and Rachford visited the CIA’s National Photographic Interpretation Center(NPIC) to become familiar with the CIA’s photographic analysis capabilities. Thevisit required a clearance level of Secret and established that no photographicwork done for the project would be linked to the CIA. NPIC personnel would beavailable, according to a CIA document, to perform work “of a photogrammetricnature, such as attempting to measure objects imaged on photographs that may bepart of Dr. Condon’s analysis.” No written comments or documentation from NPICwould be made public. Another CIA memo stated:> Any work performed by NPIC to assist Dr. Condon in his investigation will not> be identified as work accomplished by the CIA. Dr. Condon was advised by Mr.> Lundahl to make no reference to CIA in regard to this work effort. Obviously, it was essential to keep CIA involvement out of the realm of publicknowledge, as McDonald and others were becoming vocal about the CIA’smanipulation over the entire UFO controversy.19[index_split_262.html#filepos1557118]Meanwhile, the University of Colorado Project’s main opportunity to study UFOreports was slipping away. The first three months of 1967 continued to be anactive period of American UFO reports, but practically no one at Boulder had theknowledge or resources to perform a serious investigation. Other than Low andthe junior staff, nearly everyone lacked the basic equipment and tools, such asquestionnaires, psychological tests, and even cameras or tape measures. “Most ofthe fish in this wave got away,” said Saunders. Unfortunately, it was the onlysignificant wave within the U.S. during the project’s term. Vallee’s predictionwould prove true.20 [index_split_262.html#filepos1557257]In early March 1967, Robert Low wrote a position paper which expected that theproject would fail to support the ETI theory, even after a diligent search andsubstantial record. Before sharing his paper with project members (which he didindividually and confidentially), he shared them in talks and speeches with theRand Corporation, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Boeing. Low was obsessed with“building the record,” which appeared to mean creating a lengthy report thatwould persuade by its sheer bulk. Despite this ambition, the project’s failureto move quickly had by now forced it to prepare a proposal to extend itscontract.21 [index_split_262.html#filepos1557412]In March 1967, world-renowned physicist Dr. Paul Santorini revealed along-hidden experience connected with UFOs. Santorini’s credentials were surelyimpressive: he had helped to develop radar, fuses for the atomic bomb, and theNike missile guidance system. Until 1964, he had directed the ExperimentalPhysics Laboratory of the Polytechnic. Santorini stated that a “world blanket ofsecrecy” surrounded UFO reports and related his experience of twenty yearsprior, when strange objects flying over Greece had alarmed the government, whichsoon learned the objects were not Russian missiles. When Greek army commandersasked the U.S. Defense Department about the objects, he said, “they were quicklypressured into silence, (and) the army ordered the investigation discontinued.”Santorini said he was later closely questioned by U.S. scientists fromWashington. He offered one clear reason as to the secrecy: authorities wereunwilling to admit the existence of a force against which we had “no possibilityof defense.” When asked about Santorini’s statement, Condon brushed it off.22[index_split_262.html#filepos1557571]Keyhoe continued to be unhappy. He met with Low once again during the spring andlearned that of the thousand or so reports that NICAP had given to the project,“probably four or five,” were to be spot-checked. So far, Low conceded, none ofthem had been. When, in March, Keyhoe met with his old friend Frank Edwards,Edwards recommended that NICAP withdraw its support. Although no longernationally syndicated, Edwards still was on the radio and decided to blast theproject over the airwaves. He began to work on an expose and told Keyhoe that hewas planning to speed it up.23 [index_split_262.html#filepos1557727]Unfortunately, Frank Edwards died of a heart attack on June 23, 1967, at the ageof fifty-eight. Amid the growing storm, APRO continued to support Condon.Members of the project visited APRO headquarters in March, and the Lorenzensgave leads on several classified cases which they had obtained with greateffort. The project members tentatively agreed to try developing these leads,but in fact nothing happened with them. One of the main problems was that,despite the supposedly independent nature of the Colorado investigation, projectmembers were directed by the Pentagon to rely primarily on current cases.Digging up old cases, they were told, was too expensive.24[index_split_262.html#filepos1557873]"},{"pageContent":"SECRECY IN 1967 While the UFO was busily being solved, courtesy of the nation’s tax money, thenational security state spent much more money to solve other problems secretly.The escalation of the undeclared war in Vietnam pressed President Johnson andthe entire intelligence community into new acts of illegality, partly to containdomestic discontent, partly to neutralize the Vietnamese enemy in new ways.According to Gordon Thomas, by 1967, many of the MK-Search projects were costinglots of money without producing results. In the spring of 1967, however, the CIAbegan to take Vietcong prisoners to a room where the men were strapped to tablesand given electroshock. An unknown number of VC were subjected to the torture,and apparently all of them died as a result. The idea was to see whether the CIAcould “depattern” the VC communist indoctrination.25[index_split_262.html#filepos1558029]More gruesome activities lay in store for the Vietnamese. In May 1967, WilliamColby, head of the CIA’s Far East Division of Clandestine Services, launchedProject Phoenix. This was a comprehensive attack against the Vietconginfrastructure which soon turned into a straightforward assassination program ofsuspected Vietcong (or VC sympathizers), often as a bullet in the head while thevictim slept. The CIA established a nationwide system of interrogation centers,about which little is known. According to Colby’s testimony in 1971, Phoenixkilled 20,587 suspected VC in two and a half years. The South Vietnamesegovernment put the figure at 40,994.26 [index_split_262.html#filepos1558179]Not everything in Vietnam went according to CIA wishes. In late June 1967, amajor debate emerged between the CIA, the chairman of the Board of NationalEstimates, and the Pentagon regarding the North Vietnamese Order of Battle—thatis, the size of enemy forces. The gap was irreconcilable. Military numbersplaced the number at 270,000, while the CIA’s main analyst called this“ridiculously low”—more like 600,000, he said. By September, the military hadcompromised to 300,000. Just as it played with UFO statistics, so now did themilitary manipulate numbers and categories in this debate. When the CIA analystproved the VC had more men in one category, the military reduced anothercategory by a similar amount. On September 11, DCI Richard Helms ordered the CIAstation in Saigon to accept the military’s figure of 299,000. It soon went downto 248,000. Thus could the Pentagon prove that America was winning the war.Helms knew the numbers were phony, but he also knew what numbers PresidentJohnson wanted. In January 1968, the Tet Offensive made the debate moot.27[index_split_262.html#filepos1558340]Elsewhere for the CIA, it was business as usual. In Greece, a CIAORGANIZED coupplaced the military in power. In Bolivia, on October 8, 1967, the CIA-advisedBolivian rangers, in the presence of a CIA operator, tortured and murderedlongtime irritant Ernesto “Che” Guevara.28 [index_split_262.html#filepos1558485]Aside from the dispute over the Order of Battle, Lyndon Johnson had other pointsof friction with the CIA during 1967. He shut down Operation Mongoose, forinstance. Then there was the extended issue over CIA assassinations. In March,Johnson asked Richard Helms directly about the rumors of CIA assassination plansin conjunction with the Mafia. Helms said he would get on it. On April 24, theCIA’s Inspector General presented to Helms a report on CIA assassination plots.Helms was not pleased. He often said, “the first rule in keeping secrets isnothing on paper.” The document apparently was quite thorough and has never beenpublished, although the Church Assassinations Committee used it a decade later.On May 10, Helms gave his answer to Johnson. What he said is not completelyknown, but he did inform the president about the CIA’s longtime mailinterception program “and some other things that were going on.” Johnsonessentially appears to have said, be careful and don’t get caught.29[index_split_262.html#filepos1558623]Throughout 1967, Johnson also pressured Helms to discover foreign connectionsbehind the wave of student unrest. By August, this led to a partnership betweenthe CIA and FBI for Operation Chaos, a large-scale domestic spying program. Theprogram ran through 1973, amassing ten thousand files and computer indexes onover 300,000 individuals and over one hundred domestic groups. Some files wereseveral volumes long. The NSA provided assistance through Shamrock, and theeffort from the NSA’s side was so significant that in 1969 the project there gotits own name: Minaret. The NSA at this point had large files on at leastseventy-five thousand Americans, including members of Congress and prominentbusinessmen. Aside from the obvious illegality of all this, the programs wereunknown to the public for years. The program involved more than justsurveillance, but direct action by agents provacateurs.30[index_split_262.html#filepos1558774]Over at the FBI, the NSA attempted without success to persuade Hoover to expandhis collection techniques. Decades of illegal programs were beginning to makethe old director a bit nervous. Still, in August 1967, Hoover approved anintense and disruptive Cointel program against black nationalist groups in theU.S. In the fall, the NSA agreed to a request by army intelligence to monitorinternational telephone and cable traffic to support the army’s civildisturbance responsibilities.31 [index_split_262.html#filepos1558935]"},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN EARLY 1967 Amid the controversy, social unrest, and secret dealings of 1967, one mightforget that UFOs continued to present themselves around the world in largenumbers. Although the investigators at Blue Book did very little, and theColorado University Project was slow to start, NICAP and APRO were busyinvestigating reports. In 1967, NICAP’s membership had risen to eleven thousand,while APRO’s was at four thousand. Throughout the year, APRO collected manyreports of UFO landings, near landings, and occupant sightings throughout theWestern Hemisphere. The Lorenzens also printed the full version of theVillas-Boas incident in 1967, shortly after John Fuller had published the Bettyand Barney Hill abduction story in Look magazine. James McDonald believed suchstories would “set UFO research back ten years.” But like it or not, abductionswere part of the package, and the UFO phenomenon was becoming stranger and morecomplex than most people had realized. Abductions were simply the mostsensational of the new dimensions of the problem. Crop circles were increasinglypart of the story, and, before the year was out, animal mutilations.32[index_split_262.html#filepos1559090]Several close-range sightings of landed UFO craft were reported in North andSouth America through the year. Many of these were detailed and presented byseemingly reliable people; multiple-witness sightings were not unusual, andseveral were South American military encounters.33[index_split_262.html#filepos1559312]The U.S. military was too busy with its own UFO reports to worry much aboutsightings by civilians. An oblique reference to Project Moon Dust in connectionto UFOs surfaced on January 18, when a U.S. Defense attaché in Rabat, Morocco,forwarded press clippings and added:> [T]he page one coverage afforded this sighting demonstrates a high level of> interest in the subject of UFOs and presages further reporting which could be> valuable in pursuit of Project Moon Dust.34> [index_split_262.html#filepos1559492] An air force memo from March 1, 1967, alluded to reports of visitations by Menin Black. “Information, not verifiable,” said the memo,> has reached HQ USAF that persons claiming to represent the air force or other> defense establishments have contacted citizens who have sighted unidentified> flying objects. The memo ordered that all military personnel hearing of such incidents reportthem to their local OSI officers.35 [index_split_262.html#filepos1559634]But inquiries such as these were overshadowed by matters much more serious,involving airspace violations over bases near the northwestern U.S. border. OnMarch 5, 1967, NORAD radar tracked a disc-shaped UFO over the Minuteman missilesite at Minot AFB in North Dakota. Immediately, strike teams were scrambled tothe area with orders to capture the object undamaged if it landed. Sure enough,at the site, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped UFO with bright flashing lightsmoving overhead. It stopped abruptly and hovered at five hundred feet, circledover the launch control facility, then ascended vertically and disappeared, justbefore NORAD ordered F-106s to intercept it. The incident reached Raymond Fowlerand thence NICAP36 [index_split_262.html#filepos1559790]Early in the morning on the sixteenth, at Malmstrom AFB in Montana, one of themost extraordinary events in the history of military-UFO encounters took place.Under a clear and dark Montana sky, an airman with the Oscar Flight LaunchControl Center (LCC) saw a starlike object zigzagging high above him. Soon, alarger and closer light also appeared and acted in similar fashion. He calledhis NCO, and the two men watched in awe as the lights streaked through the sky,maneuvering in impossible ways. The NCO phoned his commander, Robert Salas, whowas below ground in the launch control center. Salas was dubious. “Great,” hesaid. “You just keep watching them and let me know if they get any closer.”A few minutes later, the NCO called Salas again. As Salas later wrote, this timehe was clearly frightened and shouted that a red, glowing UFO was hoveringoutside the front gate. “What do you want us to do?” asked the NCO. Salas toldhim to make sure the site was secure while he phoned the command post. “Sir,”replied the NCO, “I have to go now, one of the guys just got injured.”Before Salas could ask about the injury, the NCO was off the line. The man, whowas not seriously injured, was evacuated by helicopter to the base. Meanwhile,Salas woke his commander, Lt. Fred Meiwald. As he briefed Meiwald, an alarm rangthrough the small capsule, and both men saw a “No-Go” light turn on for one ofthe missiles. Within seconds, several more missiles went down in succession.Twenty miles away, at the Echo-Flight launch facilities, the same scenario wastaking place. First Lt. Walter Figel, the deputy crew commander of the MissileCombat Crew, was at his station when one of the Minuteman missiles went into“No-Go” status. He immediately called the missile site to determine the cause ofthe problem. Was it because of the scheduled missile maintenance, he asked thesecurity guard? No, came the response, as the maintenance had not yet takenplace. However, continued the guard, a UFO had been hovering over the site. LikeSalas, Figel doubted the story. Before he had any time to reflect on this,however, ten more ICBMs in rapid succession reported a “No-Go” condition. Withinseconds, the entire flight was down.Strike teams were dispatched to two of the E-Flight launch facilities, wheremaintenance crews were already at work. Figel had not told the strike teamsabout the UFO report. Upon their arrival, however, the teams reported back tohim that all of the maintenance and security personnel had been watching UFOshover over each of the sites.The missiles were down for the greater part of a day. The air forceinvestigation included full-scale tests on-site, as well as laboratory tests atthe Boeing Company’s Seattle plant. No cause for the shutdown could be found.The Boeing engineering chief said, “there was no technical explanation thatcould explain the event.”37 [index_split_262.html#filepos1559953]UFO reports continued to originate from that region, including several on March24 from the Belt, Montana, region. One of these reports was of a UFO landing.Police and a Malmstrom AFB helicopter searched the area, but found nothing.38[index_split_262.html#filepos1560097]Also during March 1967 (most likely) was the occurrence of the “Cuban jetincident,” a story that years later fell into the hands of UFO researchersStanton Friedman and Robert Todd, and was described at length by Fawcett andGreenwood, who labeled it “probably authentic.” The story, in summation, is asfollows: Cuban air defense radar controllers reported an unidentified craftapproaching Cuba from the northwest, moving at 660 mph and traveling atthirty-three thousand feet. Two MIG-21s were scrambled to meet it and wereguided to within three miles of the object. At that point, the flight leaderradioed in that the object was a bright metallic sphere with no visiblemarkings. He was unable to establish radio contact with the UFO, and Cuban airdefense ordered the object to be destroyed. The flight leader reported that hisradar was locked and missiles ready. Seconds later, a wing-man screamed into theradio that the flight leader’s jet had “disintegrated.” The UFO then quicklyaccelerated and climbed above ninety-eight thousand feet, heading toward SouthAmerica. The U.S. 6947th Security Squadron, centered at Homestead AFB, wasmonitoring the incident all the while and, as AFSS units were under operationalcontrol of the NSA, sent a report to Fort Meade. NSA then ordered the 6947th toship all tapes and pertinent data to the NSA and to list the Cuban aircraft lossin squadron files as due to “equipment malfunction.” Friedman learned of theincident in 1978 through a security specialist stationed at Homestead AFB. AfterTodd learned of it shortly thereafter during the same year, he received anintimidating visit by the FBI at the behest of NSA.39[index_split_262.html#filepos1560280]By April, just as the Colorado staff was ready for serious investigating,reports in America ebbed. Sightings of weird, close-range objects did continue,however. APRO, in particular, collected many reports of UFOs that hovered verylow or landed in America and elsewhere. Some of these cases included multiplewitnesses, EM effects, and ground traces.40[index_split_262.html#filepos1560440]"},{"pageContent":"FALCON LAKE The Colorado Project staff did not investigate many sightings that spring,either because the cases seemed too outlandish, or simply because the staff didnot learn about them in time. The following report, however, did get aninvestigation, of sorts. On May 19, 1967, shortly after noon, Stefan Michalak, afifty-two-year-old mechanic and quartz prospector, claimed to have seen two red,glowing objects flying at high speed while in the wilderness at Falcon Lake inManitoba. They appeared to be disc-shaped as they became closer, and one of themabruptly stopped its descent to hover, then soon departed toward the west.Meanwhile, the other one landed. Michalak watched it from behind some bushes ata distance of about 160 feet. It was about thirty-five feet wide, ten feetthick, had a small dome on top that contained horizontal slits. As exotic as itlooked, Michalak assumed it was an experimental American aircraft.After thirty minutes of observation, a small door opened, showing a well-litinterior. Michalak then decided to approach it. At sixty feet distant, he heardvoices which were somewhat muffled, in his words, “by the sounds of the motorand the rush of air that was continuously coming out from somewhere inside.”Still, one of the voices was discernibly more high-pitched than the other.Michalak called out, “Okay, Yankee boys, having trouble? Come on out, and we’llsee what we can do about it.” The voices did not respond. Michalak, who wasmultilingual, tried other languages: Russian, German, Italian, French, andUkranian. Still no response.Michalak decided to peek inside the craft. In his words:> The inside was a maze of lights. Direct beams running in horizontal and> diagonal paths and a series of flashing lights, it seemed to me, were working> in a random fashion, with no particular order or sequence. I took note of the> thickness of the walls of the craft. They were about twenty inches at the> cross-section. As soon as he moved his head back, three panels closed off the opening. When hetouched the highly polished craft with his glove, its rubber coating melted.Almost immediately, the object began to lift and angle off the ground so thatthe bottom of the craft faced Michalak. He saw what looked like an exhaustsystem which was in the form of a grid with a uniform pattern of small circularvents. A blast of hot gas erupted from the vents, hitting Michalak in the chestand knocking him back. Tearing off his burning shirt, he saw the object ascend,clear the treetops, and head off to the west. It left a fifteen-foot circle.Michalak felt dizzy, and vomited for days afterward, and lost over twenty poundsin the coming weeks. He suffered minor burns to his face and more serious burnson his chest, a photograph of which showed a pattern matching his description ofthe exhaust grid. He experienced intense headaches, rashes, and swelling,especially in his hands, which “looked as if they had been inflated with air.”He went to a hospital in Winnipeg, where the attending physician, an immigrantwith limited English, attributed the marks to aircraft exhaust. Michalak was tootired to relate his experience to the doctor. On May 23, he saw a radiologistwho found nothing wrong. A week later, he was tested for radiation at theWhiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment in Pinawa, Manitoba, with no unusualresults. The grid pattern remained, however, with no explanation from doctors.After another trip to the hospital, he was told his swelling was caused by anallergy.His symptoms continued into 1968, and Michalak, at his own expense, visited theMayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He spent two weeks under study, withdisappointing results. Doctors were able to describe his problems quite nicelybut were unable to determine causes, nor provide a remedy. They found “no overtevidence of significant mental or emotional illness.”Meanwhile, researchers had been trying to investigate the landing site. Theseincluded the Canadian Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (CAPRO), the RoyalCanadian air force, the Colorado Project, and numerous other groups. For awhile, no one could find the site. Michalak, at first too sick to go with theparties, attended a helicopter search on June 2, 1967, and a ground search onJune 25. Both failed to find the site.The University of Colorado sent project investigator Roy Craig on June 4, 1967,but he was unable to find the site. He did, however, interview local individualswho might have been in a good position to have observed the object on May 19.This included a ranger, who noted that the forest was dry, and that a firecapable of burning a man would have started the forest burning. The watchmen intowers, who usually noticed smoke from campfires immediately, saw nothingunusual. Moreover, no watchtower personnel saw a metallic saucer. On the otherhand, Craig found that those who knew Michalak considered him to be honest.Disgusted, Craig returned to Boulder.Soon after, Michalak stated that during the search of the twenty-fifth, he hadfound the site he was originally looking for (as a quartz prospector) and had nointention of leading anyone else near the landing site until he had staked hisclaim. On June 30, Michalak found the landing site while searching with anotherperson. They found an outline of the landed object, remains of his shirt, andthe tape measure he had lost that day. Within a month, he had cooperated withthe RCAF, who reached the site on July 28, and collected samples. The Canadianair force representative, Paul Bissky, also saw the outline, which he describedas a “very evident circle.” He wrote that it was> an approximate fifteen-foot diameter circle on the rock surface where the moss> and earth covering has been cleared to the rock surface by a force such as> made by air at very high velocity. The RCAF also found a high level of radiation in some samples from the site,which it deemed to be “a possible health hazard.” Upon returning, they found ahighly localized contamination at the site—right on the crown of the rock whereMichalak alleged the landing occurred, and where the fifteen-foot-diametercircle was. No explanation ever emerged, other than by hoax, as to how this“smear” of radiation got onto the rock.A year after the sighting, Michalak again visited the site with a friend andfound pieces of radioactive material in a fissure of rock at the landing site.This had been missed, evidently, by a representative of Manitoba’s Department ofMines and Natural Resources, who had visited the site several times. Someresearchers believed the metals were planted. Craig wrote, “In view of thethoroughness of the earlier searches ... it is improbable that the particlesdiscovered a year later would have been missed.” Several groups analyzed samplesof the metal. Some tests confirmed the presence of Radium 226, which was alsofound in the soil samples from a year earlier; other tests were inconclusive.The Colorado Project simply noted the “inconsistencies and incongruities in thecase” implying that the event was a hoax, a conclusion which has been disputedover the years.41 [index_split_262.html#filepos1560655]"},{"pageContent":"MCDONALD RIPS BLUE BOOK AND MENZEL In a March 1, 1967, interview with the Tucson Daily Citizen, James McDonaldstated, “I’d advise the public to view the Bluebook statistics as meaningless.”Elaborating on this statement in another interview published on April 6, heexplained:> As a result of several trips to Project Bluebook, I’ve had an opportunity to> examine quite carefully and in detail the types of reports that are made by> Bluebook personnel.

On April 22, 1967, McDonald assailed Donald Menzel before the American Societyof Newspaper Editors. “When he comes to analyzing UFO reports,” said McDonald,> he seems to calmly cast aside well-known scientific principles with almost> abandon in an all-out effort to be sure that no UFO reports survives his> attack. “There is no sensible alternative,” he argued, “to the utterly shockinghypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial probes....” Menzel shot back thatMcDonald was a pseudoscientist with absurd views. A week later, McDonald toldthe press that he had learned from several “unquotable sources” that the airforce had long been trying to unburden itself of the UFO problem and had triedtwice to transfer its program to NASA.42 [index_split_262.html#filepos1560840]McDonald was vocal enough about UFOs that spring that he obtained assistancefrom United Nations Secretary General U Thant to lecture on the subject beforethe UN’s Outer Space Affairs Group on June 7. By the end of the month, he was inAustralia on a small ONR grant to perform research in cloud physics.Unfortunately for McDonald, he had announced his intention to do some UFOinvestigating and lecturing there, in a memo to Low. In short time, thisinnocuous statement would backfire on him with significant repercussions. 43[index_split_262.html#filepos1561030]"},{"pageContent":"THE COLORADO PROJECT IN MID-1967 By mid-1967, NICAP maintained what Keyhoe later called an “uneasy truce” withthe Colorado Project. Actually, he had already decided to withhold any furthercooperation: he was convinced that the air force was behind the project’s effortto obtain NICAP files. As a result, he held back the remaining big cases, inspite of requests for more reports. Besides, Keyhoe felt that the projectmembers had not looked seriously at the good reports NICAP had already provided.Part of the problem, it must be said, was Keyhoe’s personality and authoritarianstyle of managing NICAP Even the sympathetic Saunders conceded that thesituation was tolerable for NICAP members “only because they are interested inthe problem and the major is out of the office as much as he is in.”44[index_split_262.html#filepos1561175]On July 1, someone leaked information to the Denver Post that the project hadrequested an additional $280,000 to extend the project to September 30, 1968.The publicity noticeably upset Condon. The air force ultimately approved anadditional $183,155, plus $29,750 to go toward a national opinion survey,bringing the final total to $525,905.45 [index_split_262.html#filepos1561348]Among themselves, project members were divided about UFOs. The situation recallsProject Sign in 1948. By midyear, several Colorado Project members, afterreading reports and interviewing witnesses, believed the extraterrestrialhypothesis to be the most probable explanation of the difficult UFO cases.Moreover, as with Sign, the project’s leadership was hostile to a pro-ETexplanation of UFOs, a situation that would soon force a showdown.46[index_split_262.html#filepos1561503]By July, driven by Low’s insistence on “building the record,” plans wereunderway to compile a case book of the project’s best UFO cases. But this was noeasy undertaking and would require a major effort by the whole staff. RichardHall was therefore invited for two days of official consulting and narrowed thelist to about one hundred cases of a good variety. A small group within theproject then agreed to review those cases to decide which ones would receivemore intensive analysis. From the beginning, the case book was behind schedule,despite its being Low’s special project. First of all, Low himself was notreading any cases, although he continued to push the project all through theSummer of Love. By default, Saunders became the one responsible for selectingcases. By August, it was moving at a snail’s pace—only twelvenone-too-impressive cases were gathered—and clearly would not be ready by thehoped-for completion date of November 1967. The major problem, according toSaunders, was that the staff> found it difficult to adopt an attitude of judging a case by the potential> that it displayed. Instead, we found ourselves discarding case after case> because the evidence that might have made them airtight, and that might have> been available if we really investigated, was not already handed to us on a> silver platter. After two meetings like this, Saunders was convinced the group was doing moreharm than good. As a result, the project hired a University of Colorado lawstudent to write the case book itself, based on the notes.47[index_split_262.html#filepos1561661]It occurred to Saunders that although Blue Book was supposed to be sending itsreports to Boulder, little was arriving, and most that did was of poor qualityand late. Eventually, Saunders and project member Norm Levine traveled to Daytonto determine the problem. What they found disturbed them: thick cases inseparate folders adjacent to, rather than in, the main folders. Other cases werestored in a classified safe, and it took some cajoling by Levine to get BlueBook’s permission to look at them. The vast differences between Blue Book’s andNICAP’s reports also bothered Saunders. First of all, there was practically nooverlap between the cases. Second, NICAP had much higher percentage of “good”UFO reports—where the object in question was not obviously a meteor or balloon.Another realization sank in: by now, the only witnesses reporting UFOs to theair force were either naive in the extreme or motivated by an overriding senseof duty.Saunders was also finding problems with Blue Book Special Report Number 14 (theBattelle Report), released in 1955. Low had asked him to provide a statisticalanalysis of the report, since this was Saunders’s area of expertise. The poorquality of statistical analysis within the report distressed him. He noticedhow, “with remarkable regularity, whoever did these statistics combined thecategories so as to minimize his chances of finding anything significant.” Tomake matters worse, the original data, contained in IBM cards, had all beenthrown away.48 [index_split_262.html#filepos1561818]Saunders later wrote that he sensed a lack of teamwork all summer among thosewith differing views on UFOs and an undercurrent of “mutual distrust and gameplaying.” He began to wonder whether someone on the project was “acting in adouble role” and was certain that others on the project also wondered aboutthis. “The possibility that we were all being played as pawns in someone else’schess game,” he wrote, “did not help morale, either.” His thoughts drifted backto the summer of 1966, while the air force was wooing the University of Coloradofor the contract. At that time, Saunders spoke with Low about the charges ofKeyhoe, Edwards, and others that there was a UFO conspiracy on the part of theCIA. Saunders suggested that, if the university took the contract, the projectshould demand a written draft of its “need to know” from the highest possiblelevel of government, either the president or the National Security Council. Ifthe true story was foul-up, as opposed to cover-up, this affirmation should havebeen easy to obtain, argued Saunders, especially while the air force was stillwooing them. “In fact,” wrote Saunders, “this was my only suggestion about theproposal that was ignored.” That is, it was not established that the ColoradoProject had a need to know about all UFO cases. That fact by itself threw doubtover the legitimacy of the study.49 [index_split_262.html#filepos1561977]Of course neither Saunders nor anyone else surmised Low’s position on thesubject of UFOs and cover-ups back in 1966, when he wrote his infamousmemorandum in which he stated that “the trick” to the project would be todescribe it “so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study,but to the scientific community would present the image of a group ofnonbelievers trying their best to be objective but having an almost zeroexpectation of finding a saucer.” But in July 1967, like a body carelesslydisposed of, Low’s memorandum finally surfaced. That month, project member RoyCraig was searching through office files—at Low’s suggestion, no less—forunrelated information and found the memo. Craig immediately recognized theseriousness of the problem. In his words, “my stomach caught in my throat.” NormLevine was sitting nearby. “See if this doesn’t give you a funny feeling in thestomach,” Craig said, handing him the memo. Levine, too, was distressed. Levineshowed the memo to Saunders, who felt it “expressed concisely what we knewanyway based on Low’s day-to-day behavior.” Craig, who in his own book disagreedso fundamentally with Saunders about the Colorado Project, agreed with him thatthe memo’s sentiments were consistent with Low’s actions throughout the projectand “clearly implied that we were involved in a whitewash noninvestigation,probably aimed at getting the air force off a public criticism hook.”The Low memorandum quickly made the rounds among project members, then went backinto the file. Before the year was out, however, Saunders would also show it toKeyhoe, who in turn would tell McDonald about it-all without knowledge of Low orCondon (who did not even know the memo existed). By then, the problem would bebeyond repair.50 [index_split_262.html#filepos1562132]"},{"pageContent":"APRO SUMMER CASES Two cases that reached APRO during the summer of 1967 illustrate the up closenature of many UFO sightings at the time. One occurred at 4:20 A.M. on July 5,near Coventry, Connecticut, on Route 31, when a motorist saw what appeared to bean orange ball of light hanging from a tree. When police arrived, the area wasdeserted. APRO investigator Lawrence Fawcett notified the Colorado Project,which sent off two investigators. With Fawcett, they found a grassy area thathad been compressed and swirled flat. No presence of radioactivity wasestablished, and the photo taken by Fawcett came out completely blank. Severalsimilar sites were found in the area at the time.51[index_split_262.html#filepos1562317]Near Whitehouse, Ohio, at 11:30 P.M. on July 13, Robert Richardson was drivingwith a friend, Jerry Quay. As the car turned around a bend, the two saw abrilliant bluish source of light blocking the road. Richardson slammed on thebrakes, closed his eyes, and felt an impact. The object, however, was gone,leaving both men shaken but unhurt. Local police dismissed the incident, butstate police returned with them to the scene. All they found were Richardson’sskid marks. The next day, Richardson found a lump of metal and noticed variousdents and scratches on the hood of his car, and that some chrome on the bumperhad been stripped off. On the fifteenth, he sent a telegram to the Lorenzens andgave his phone number.At 11 P.M. on the following night, Richardson received a visit at his home fromtwo friendly young men, who stayed about ten minutes to ask some questions butdid not identify themselves (Richardson did not ask their names). He did checktheir car, however, a 1953 black Cadillac with license 8577-D. He later learnedthat the plate had not been issued. A week after this visit, Richardson receiveda classic Men-in-Black visit. Two men, different from the others, arrived at hisdoor. They wore dark suits, had dark complexions, and were “foreign-looking.”One had an accent of some sort but spoke fluent English. At first, Richardsonthought these men were trying to convince him that he had not hit anything inthe road. However, they soon demanded his two pieces of physical evidence.Sorry, said Richardson, but he had handed both pieces over to APRO for analysis.Is there any way he could get it back, the men asked. No, he replied. Justbefore leaving, one of them said, “If you want your wife to stay as pretty asshe is, then you’d better get the metal back.” He saw them drive away in a 1967Dodge sedan but could not make out the license plate. What disturbed him, otherthan the threat, was that the metal had only been discussed on the phone twice:once between himself and Coral Lorenzen, and once between himself and APROresearcher Nils Paquette. Coral Lorenzen believed her phone call was monitored.The case reached the Colorado University Project. In March 1968, Roy Craigconducted a test of the material, along with the fibrous metal taken from thefront bumper of Richardson’s car. The metal pieces were of iron and chromium,with traces of nickel and manganese. The fibrous metals on the bumper were 92percent magnesium, not what one would expect to find on one’s bumper, butnothing definitive, either.52 [index_split_262.html#filepos1562472]In 1967 there was yet another global wave of UFO activity. South America appearsto have generated the most reports, most of which were collected by APRO.Sightings were so frequently characterized by multiple craft that the Lorenzensreferred to it as the “fleet phenomenon.” Several of these were seen by militarypersonnel, such as a June 24 sighting of about ten silent, disc-shaped UFOs overPuerto Neuvo, Argentina. Venezuela and Brazil reported a great deal of UFOactivity as the summer progressed, including many landings and sightings ofsmall beings in silvery clothing.53 [index_split_262.html#filepos1562648]Many cases involved unknown craft in the sea. One of the more widely reportedoccurred about fifteen miles north of the Venezuelan town of Recife on themorning of August 4. Dr. Hugo Sierra Yepez, an engineer, was fishing on a beachwhen he felt a vibration and saw large bubbles in the water. A grayish-blue,metallic, flat disc, about twenty feet in diameter, emerged from the water. Itbriefly hovered just above the surface, dripping water, then rose slowly towardthe east, ascended in a curve, and shot upward and away. Yepez discerned a“revolving section with triangular windows” on the craft. The entire sightinglasted less than one minute.54 [index_split_262.html#filepos1562802]Other remarkable water-related sightings were reported off the South Americancoast. On July 20, 1967, an underwater “UFO” was reported by the Naviero, a shipwith the Argentine Shipping Lines Company. The crew saw a shining, self-luminousobject in the sea that paced the ship at an extremely close range—no more thanfifty feet away starboard. It was cigar-shaped and estimated at 105 to 110 feetin length, emitted a powerful blue and white glow, was completely silent, anddid not disturb the water. Was it a submarine, or perhaps a whale? The captainand chief officer decided no, it “could not possibly have been either of thesethings.” They saw no sign of a periscope, railing, tower, superstructure, orother protruding part. After pacing the ship for fifteen minutes at 15 to 20knots, the craft suddenly dived and passed beneath the ship and vanished intothe depths “at great speed.” Deep beneath the water, it continued to glowbrightly. The captain told the Argentine press that he had never seen the likeof it.55 [index_split_262.html#filepos1563011]About three weeks later, on August 8, just after dark, off the Venezuelan coastnear Salina, a pastor noticed the water changing to various colors and becomingbrighter. A glowing, orange, disc-shaped object then emerged from the sea andhovered at about 1,500 feet for several seconds. The pastor heard a buzzingsound and saw the object disappear quickly. Yet another water-related UFO caseoccurred in Venezuela on August 25. At 5 P.M. at Catia la Mar, Ruben Noratonoticed a disturbance in the sea, then saw three large discs emerge and zoom outof sight.56 [index_split_262.html#filepos1563157]Reports such as these prompted the Lorenzens to see for themselves what washappening, and on August 11, they left for several destinations in SouthAmerica. Upon arriving, they discovered, in their words,> more than one government-sponsored agency engaged in an effort to solve the> secret of UFO propulsion. Such endeavors, which proceed on the assumption that> “flying saucers are real,” could hardly have come into being without a certain> amount of preliminary intelligence gathering.57> [index_split_262.html#filepos1563361] Throughout South America, hundreds of UFO sightings were reported, with manyhigh strangeness cases. In late August and early September, several seeminglyreliable witnesses, including a police officer, claimed to see short humanoidcreatures who sought to take them to “their world.” All individuals claimed tohave successfully refused the offer. Meanwhile, landing and humanoid sightingswere being reported worldwide, including the United States and especially theSoviet Union. Indeed, the Soviet Union experienced a major UFO wave during 1967,featuring many cases similar to those being reported in South America, althoughthis fact went unknown for many years. It certainly throws cold water over thenotion that these sightings are most easily explained by classified aircraft, anexplanation that would be difficult to offer even without the Sovietdimension.58 [index_split_262.html#filepos1563527]"},{"pageContent":"PROBLEMS IN COLORADO The South American wave was ignored by the American media and the ColoradoProject. For the last ten days of August 1967, Robert Low was in Prague at theInternational Astronomical Union even though a bona fide project astronomer,Frank Roach, was there (Hynek also attended). What was Low doing in Europe?Certainly nothing relating to UFOs. He wasted an opportunity to visit CharlesBowen, the editor of Flying Saucer Review, and Aimé Michel (who received a visitfrom Bowen at that time). Instead, Low visited Loch Ness, because neither theLoch Ness monster nor UFOs existed, he explained privately. Upon his return toBoulder, Low gave an informal twenty-minute summary about his trip, includingalmost nothing about the conference itself.59[index_split_262.html#filepos1563758]As the new academic year was about to begin, the project obtained a thirdhandreport of a UFO sighting at Edwards AFB, said to have occurred on September 1.The route was certainly indirect: a civilian employee at the base saw thereport, then mentioned it to a relative, who discussed it with a scientistvoluntarily cooperating with the project. According to the story, six UFOsfollowed an X-15 while it landed. When project members called the base, they“really got the runaround.” After two weeks of phone calls, they learned that noX-15 flew that day. No one, however, would deny a UFO sighting had taken place.Instead, base personnel sidestepped all pertinent questions and stated they hadno such report in their files. The case went nowhere.60[index_split_262.html#filepos1564054]The project also learned of a series of radar and visual reports from LakeSuperior and Upper Michigan from September 6. At one point, more than twentyradar targets appeared and disappeared over the middle of the lake during athree-hour period, tracked at speeds of up to 2,000 mph (at times turning atright angles), and involving apparent separation and merging of distincttargets. Project members discovered from radar operators at Kincheloe AFB (whoreported the incident to them) that radar operators at the other end of thelake, in Duluth, Minnesota, had gotten similar targets. The project sent JohnAhrens and Norm Levine to investigate. While there, they checked into rumors ofvisual sightings over Sault Sainte Marie, although none of these correlated withthe radar. When they reached Duluth, to their surprise, they drew a completeblank, with denials that anyone had obtained any such radar return. Theyreturned home with a much weakened case. The Colorado Project’s public statusmeant precious little when it came to important cases within the classifiedworld.61 [index_split_262.html#filepos1564213]Shortly after Labor Day, Saunders suggested to Low that academic commitmentsmight require a reorganization of project duties. Namely, that Low and principalinvestigator Roach each report directly to Condon. According to Saunders, Low“blew his stack.” First of all, Roach had known Condon much longer than had Low;second, Roach was more sympathetic to Saunders’s position. Low ultimately agreedto a change, but replaced Roach with Levine. Meanwhile, Edward U. Condon stirredup more controversy. A week before returning to campus, he gave an after-dinnertalk about UFO crackpot cases to his former colleagues at the National Bureau ofStandards in Washington, startling his audience with his cavalier attitude. WhenJames McDonald briefed the project soon after on his Australian trip, he wasdismayed that Condon asked no questions and dozed off three times.62[index_split_262.html#filepos1564372]With leadership such as this coming from the project charged with conducting ascientific study of the UFO problem, and with the discovery of the Lowmemorandum now widely (and secretly) known among project members, it should beno surprise that discontent was the rule. On September 17, Franklin Roachsubmitted his resignation from the project, in order to pursue his academicinterests. On the nineteenth, Saunders, Low, and Condon met for three hours todiscuss Saunders’s suggestions on improving the project’s public image. Saundersargued that the public could already tell the project was headed toward anegative conclusion. Little came of the meeting, other than the speculation byCondon that if the project did find evidence to support the extraterrestrialhypothesis, he would either put the evidence in a briefcase and take it directlyto the president, or else he would write a report to the air force and let themdecide what to do with it. In either case, he would not disclose the factpublicly. Saunders interpreted this as a failure to honor the project’scommitment to make a public report and to tell it like it was.63[index_split_262.html#filepos1564536]On the following day, NICAP provisionally withdrew its support. Keyhoe had heardCondon’s gaffe at the NBS, and told Saunders he had made this decisionreluctantly and only under pressure from NICAP’s Board. He hoped some meansmight be found to allow for a reversal of that decision and said he would notyet publicize the break. Keyhoe had other reasons to be angry. He had recentlylearned that Condon had not interviewed a single UFO witness, and had nointention of doing so. He also discovered—gasp!—that the only reason theColorado Project wanted NICAP’s support was for its own credibility. This wassurely a difficult time for Keyhoe and NICAP Just recently, for personalreasons, Richard Hall resigned from NICAP. Now, it looked as though relationswith the Colorado Project might be irretrievably severed. But if all was notwell at NICAP, neither was it in Boulder. Keyhoe may not have fully appreciateduntil his conversation with Saunders how wide the chasm was that separated theleaders from the led.Saunders immediately told Low about NICAP’s withdrawal of support. The newsupset Low, who asked Saunders to patch things up. Saunders reluctantly said hewould try. Meanwhile, on September 25, Low, Saunders, and Condon had anothermeeting, a brief one at Condon’s home. Nothing new, nothing resolved. Saunderssurely must have irritated Condon: this time, he pointed out that the problemwith NICAP would not have arisen had Condon abided by his own rule of notspeaking publicly about UFOs; it could also be resolved, he continued, byallowing other project members to do likewise. Condon said he understood thepoint but offered no change. In fact, two days later, the Rocky Mountain Newspublished a commentary by Condon where he debunked UFOs and discounted NICAP’scontribution to the Colorado Project. The article quoted Low in a similar vein.As a result, Low freely predicted Saunders’s resignation from the project andtold him privately that if he wanted to return to the administration, he neededto get on the team and work with him and Condon. The staff was understandablyupset by the article.64 [index_split_262.html#filepos1564691]The lines of battle were drawn: it was Low and Condon against everyone else.Saunders probably expressed the majority view when he wrote:> [W]e could no longer doubt that any prospect for successful completion of the> UFO project depended on us and would have to circumvent the obstacles of our> leadership as well as the complexities of the problem itself. Indeed, the staff was close to an en masse resignation. On the night ofSeptember 27, 1967, project members held a meeting without Low and Condon todecide what, if anything, they would do. Norm Levine was the group’s hard-liner,pushing for mass resignation. Roy Craig, who expressed a “residual faith” inCondon, was the sole dissenter. Saunders essentially sided with Levine but stillwanted to explore strategies that were not irreversible. Franklin Roach, hisresignation already tendered, thought Condon was tired but ultimately reliable.Several members expressed the concern that Condon’s final word on the subjectwould be so negative as to stifle further scientific research into UFOs foranother twenty years, or even more. They decided, therefore, to prepare theirown report, one “so compelling that Condon would be forced to accept it on itsmerits.” Undoubtedly, a fond, trusting position.65[index_split_262.html#filepos1564877]The following day, Condon met with all project members. He expressed some regretover his public remarks—not what he said in them, but that he made them at all.He retracted nothing and explained that the only misquote had been that he wasdisenchanted with the project. In fact, he said, he had never been enchanted inthe first place. Members asked Condon the same question Saunders had recentlyasked: what would he do if the staff arrived at a pro-ET conclusion? This time,Condon was more diplomatic, albeit noncommittal. If they produced convincingevidence and could therewith convince him, he said, it would be the officialproject conclusion. The answer satisfied Roy Craig, and probably several others,but directly contradicted Condon’s reply to Saunders and Low just a weekbefore.66 [index_split_262.html#filepos1565032]Rocky times remained ahead. In early October, the Lorenzens visited the team atBoulder, and were unimpressed. The project’s investigatory methods, theydecided, were “sadly lacking” with “no standardized report form, no set methodof investigations.” Congress, too, continued to show signs of dissent. OnOctober 17, 1967, Congressman Louis Wyman submitted a congressional resolutionfor a full UFO investigation, without waiting for the Colorado report.67[index_split_262.html#filepos1565208]"},{"pageContent":"AN ANIMAL MUTILATION As if the UFO controversy were not contentious enough, it heated up furtherafter September 9, 1967, with the first publicized animal mutilation case. Thevictim was a horse named Lady (mistakenly called Snippy by the press), who wasfound in the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado. Her body had been stripped offlesh from the neck up, with the rest of her untouched. There was no blood atthe site. The cut around the neck was very smooth—perhaps too smooth to havebeen made with a hunting knife. Her exposed skeleton was so white and clean,that it looked as though she had lain in the sun for days. But Lady had beenalive and well only two nights before. Another odd thing was that, according toher owner, who found her, Lady’s tracks stopped about one hundred feet southeastof her body, with no tracks of any kind between her and where she was found.When Lady’s owner returned to the site the following day, the soil beneath Ladywas damp, and a medicine-like smell pervaded the area. Nearby was a bush thatwas flattened to within ten inches of the ground. Near the bush were fifteencircular marks pressed into the ground; close to that were six additionalindentations in a three-foot circular configuration—each was two inches acrossand four inches deep. Lady’s owner also found a piece of horse flesh encased inskin. When she punctured it, she said, a sticky green paste came out, burningher. Alamosa County sheriff, Ben Phillips, was less impressed by the unusualelements at the scene and blamed the horse’s death on lightning.John Henry Altshuler, M.D., was a doctor of pathology and hematology at RossMedical Center in Denver. He happened to be camping illegally in the area at thetime of Lady’s death. During his extended camping sojourn, he claimed, he sawthree UFOs over the valley, and in fact had gone to the area in the first placebecause it was a UFO hotspot. Before long, park rangers apprehended him, butwhen they learned of his profession (medical hematologist), they brought him tosee the horse.Altshuler saw Lady ten to twelve days after her death. He conducted a thoroughexamination, and concluded that she had been surgically worked on with some typeof burning instrument. “Most amazing,” he said, “was the lack of blood.” Headded:> I have done hundreds of autopsies. You can’t cut into a body without getting> some blood. But there was no blood on the skin or on the ground. No blood> anywhere. Upon looking at the inside of the horse’s chest, he found no organs. “Whoeverdid the cutting,” he continued, “took the horse’s heart, lungs, and thyroid. Themedia sternum was completely empty—and dry. How do you get the heart out withoutblood? It was an incredible dissection of organs without any evidence of blood.”The case finally made the press when the Pueblo Chieftain reported it on October7, replete with all UFO connections. Soon, everyone came out to investigate: theColorado Project, Blue Book, NICAP, and APRO had their own people on the scene.All but APRO attributed Lady’s death to conventional causes. Still, the theoryconnecting mutilations to UFOs retained its defenders, especially after themid-1970s, when a wave of animal mutilations spread throughout the western U.S.Following APRO’s lead, MUFON (Mutual UFO Network) gave credence to the UFOconnection, and Linda Moulton Howe placed herself at the forefront of the issuewith her film and book, Strange Harvest. But while the phenomenon did not becomewidespread for several years hence, there were still a significant number ofanimal mutilation reports that followed in the wake of Lady’s death. In Alberta,Ontario, Manitoba, and western Colorado, animal mutilation reports were madethrough 1968.68 [index_split_262.html#filepos1565380]"},{"pageContent":"SHAG HARBOR A most extraordinary UFO incident occurred off the coast of Shag Harbor in NovaScotia in the fall of 1967. During late September, several area residents hadnoticed odd nocturnal lights. Then, during the night of October 4, two sightingsof a bright orange light took place one hour and one hundred miles apart. In thesecond instance, two men saw an orange light first, which was joined by two morelights, forming a forty-five-degree angle. A few minutes later, other witnessessaw four lights moving in a horizontal line, flashing on and off in sequence.They positioned themselves at a forty-five-degree angle and descended, orglided, into the sea, about a half mile offshore.For some time, a single white light bobbed on the water, and some people heard ahissing noise from the area. The light seemed to be carried out by the tide anddisappeared before anyone could reach it, but witnesses also noticed ayellowish, bubbling froth about eighty feet wide. No one had ever seen anythinglike this before. A statement from the Royal Canadian navy said there were nomissing aircraft or ships in the area, and in fact no planes operating in thearea at the time.The object appeared to go into the sea between the mainland and Cape SableIsland. On October 6, Canadian navy divers from the H.M.C.S. Granby begansearching the waters and ocean bottom but found nothing, even after other diversjoined in. The search ended on October 8. On the eleventh, several witnessesreported seeing perhaps the same lights. They hovered about three-quarters of amile offshore, at about five hundred or six hundred feet altitude, thendisappeared; they soon reappeared, positioned at a thirty-five-degree angle, anddescended toward the horizon.Norman Levine of the Colorado Project investigated the incident but did notexplain it. During the 1990s, Canadian UFO researchers Chris Styles and DonLedger conducted an exhaustive investigation, which included interviews withseveral of the divers and military personnel involved in the search. Accordingto what they learned—all officially unconfirmed, of course—the searchersrealized that the object had moved northeast, near a then-top-secret submarinedetection station run jointly by Canada and the U.S. As a flotilla of shipspositioned themselves over the submerged craft, a second underwater UFO joinedthe first and engaged in a repair operation. The members of the ships observedbut did not interfere. Seven days later, a Soviet submarine appeared but wasescorted away. Soon after, the two UFOs moved off toward the Gulf of Maine.Emerging from the water, they ascended rapidly and flew off.69[index_split_262.html#filepos1565560]"},{"pageContent":"CLOAK AND DAGGER As a result of James McDonald’s public focus on the UFO cover-up, several keydocuments relating to UFOs and secrecy were released in late 1967. The two mostimportant of these were (segments of) the Robertson Panel report and the TwiningLetter of September 1947, which stated that UFOs were real, mechanical objectsunder apparently intelligent control. While McDonald could justly claim creditfor release of the former, if correct procedures had been followed, it wouldhave been declassified in January 1965. The public now learned that theRobertson Panel had known of 1,900 UFO reports to the Pentagon in 1952, not the1501 as Lawrence Tacker and others had long reported. With the release of suchdocuments, the rush began to counter their effectiveness for UFO researchers.Condon, for example, told the Lorenzens that the Robertson Report meant nothingsince it was not based on any scientific study as such. That was true, ofcourse, but also evaded some fundamental questions, to wit: (1) to what extentwas the CIA running UFO policy; (2) why was it necessary to hide CIA interest inUFOs; (3) what about those four hundred missing UFO reports; (4) why wasn’t thereport released in 1965, according to federal regulations ; (5) if the study“meant nothing,” why did the CIA gather Nobel-caliber scientists and use theirconclusions as the basis of policy?70 [index_split_262.html#filepos1565800]The Lorenzens visited Boulder on October 10. Aside from their aforementioneddisappointment with the project, they also met with Boulder journalist RogerHarkins, who had been covering the Colorado Project from the beginning. TheLorenzens and Harkins were both curious about the possibility of CIAmanipulation of the media and decided to see whether they could bait the hook.The Lorenzens gave Harkins a seven-point rationale for CIA interest in UFOs,mainly to see whether the AP would print it and whether the CIA would try tosuppress it. The seven points, summarized, were:> 1. The CIA was created to ensure that a surprise attack like Pearl Harbor> would never happen again.> 2. UFO reports exist.> 3. The reports give patterns indicating that they are based on real> occurrences.> 4. If UFO reports are based on real occurrences, that is, actual physical> objects invading U.S. airspace, this is a national security matter of prime> importance—exactly what the CIA was designed to handle.> 5. The existence of unidentified vehicles invading U.S. airspace must be> interpreted as indicating the existence of a possible unknown enemy.> 6. Intelligence procedures would require that all such information be withheld> from the public until firm conclusions could be reached; premature disclosures> might help the enemy.> 7. Therefore, the CIA could not possibly avoid responsibility for the UFO> mystery. In this perspective, the Robertson Panel was a device used by the CIA> to establish a cover program (Blue Book) that would draw attention away from a> covert program designed to meet the UFO challenge. After dictating the story to the Denver AP Bureau, Harkins waited. And waited.Nothing happened. The story never surfaced.71[index_split_262.html#filepos1565956]During the latter part of 1967, the Lorenzens were working on their newest book,soon to be published as UFOs over the Americas. They speculated on thepossibility that the Colorado University Project was infiltrated in some way bythe CIA:> [I]f we are right in our theories concerning CIA involvement [in the Condon> Committee], there is an agent on or near the committee quietly monitoring its> activities and preparing to subvert the final report for intelligence purposes> if it seems advisable. 72 [index_split_262.html#filepos1566111] "},{"pageContent":"LEAKS FROM BOULDER Two months after Keyhoe informed Saunders that NICAP had withdrawn its supportof the Colorado Project, he continued to keep the door open. On November 14,1967, he wrote separate letters to Condon and Low, asking if they would agree toinvestigate NICAP’s UFO evidence. Their responses, both sent on December 1, werenoncommittal but praised the assistance NICAP had provided. Low wrote: “Ourworking relationships have been excellent.... It would be a great pity if theywere terminated.”Before Keyhoe received these responses, Saunders paid him a surprise visit onNovember 22. That day, Saunders allowed him to copy the Low memo and encouragedhim to share it with NICAP’s board of directors. “I wanted Keyhoe to know,”Saunders wrote, “that I was under no illusions as to the one-sided nature of theColorado University Study, because I felt that this might facilitate NICAP’scontinued support of our efforts to salvage something of it.” Indeed, theinternal conflict had only worsened after Condon’s late September meeting withthe project members. Keyhoe assured him he would not release the Low memorandumwithout Saunders’s permission. Around this time, also, Boulder journalist RogerHarkins learned of the memo. The word was getting out.73[index_split_262.html#filepos1566267]On December 12, project members Levine and Saunders, along with projectsecretary Mary Lou Armstrong, brought Hynek and McDonald face-to-face for thefirst time since their unpleasant meeting in June 1966. The hope was to getthese two to bury their differences and work with them after the project ended.This would be an organization of scientists to promote UFO studies. After aninitial clearing of the air, the meeting went fairly well. Hynek left, thenMcDonald raised the issue of the Low memorandum. This was an unwelcomesurprise—how did McDonald know about it? The answer: Keyhoe. (Keyhoeacknowledged that he confidentially told McDonald of the memorandum, butmaintained that he did so in January 1968.) Since the secret was out, theproject members decided to give McDonald an actual copy.Soon after the meeting, Levine approached Roy Craig, hoping to bring him onboard for the new project. But Craig, a stalwart Condon loyalist, was a toughnut to crack. He considered the suggestion to be “mutiny.” Besides, he said,Condon assured them that all findings and conclusions would be represented inthe report, regardless of his personal conclusion. Certainly, Craig was notsympathetic to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, although he later conceded thatin some instances, “people can be, and are, convicted of serious crimes bypersonal testimony of the type we had heard [regarding UFOs].” But Craigbelieved that something as extraordinary as flying saucers needed more thanpersonal testimony.74 [index_split_262.html#filepos1566466]Leaks came from a variety of sources that December. Early in the month, Lowleaked information to Philip Klass regarding McDonald’s UFO-related activitiesin Australia. On December 16, Klass launched a letter-writing campaign tobureaucrats at the Office of Naval Research, asking who had been responsible forfunding McDonald’s UFO research in Australia. Moreover, asked Klass, who isfunding his upcoming trip to Europe and USSR? The problem was that ONRofficially authorized money to McDonald—known to everyone for his interest inUFOs—for atmospheric and cloud research. Of course, as we have seen, ONR had itsown history of interest in UFOs. Indeed, ONR replied that it was satisfied withMcDonald’s work and had no objections to his UFO research. But Klass wanted tointimidate ONR into discontinuing future funding for McDonald. He succeededbecause of his position with Aviation Week, where he could embarrass them. Fromhere on, Klass made McDonald his pet project, attacking not only his argumentsbut his integrity, implying that he was a habitual liar.75[index_split_262.html#filepos1566638]"},{"pageContent":"THE SCHIRMER ABDUCTION CASE Early in the morning on December 3, 1967, a young police officer named HerbSchirmer of Ashland, Nebraska, had what appeared to be an extraordinary closeencounter with alien entities. At 2:30 A.M. he noticed an object on the roadwith flickering lights. Believing it to be a truck, he flashed his high beams.To his surprise, the object took off. It was aluminum-colored and flashed ared-orange beam. His report read: “Saw a flying saucer at the junction ofhighways 6 and 63. Believe it or not.” When he tried to sleep, a strong headacheand buzzing noise prevented him from doing so. A red welt developed below hisleft ear.Schirmer realized that he had twenty minutes of missing time from theexperience. He was hypnotized by Wyoming psychologist R. Leo Sprinkle as part ofthe Colorado Project. During the session, he revealed that his radio and carengine died and a “white, blurred object” came out of the UFO and mentallycommunicated with him. He could not draw his revolver. He had somehow gotteninformation that the craft belonged to a sister ship; the occupants were basedin our solar system but originated from another galaxy; they were here toprevent humans from destroying the Earth.Colorado Project members dismissed Schirmer’s account as delusional, althoughSprinkle, the consultant who performed the hypnosis, believed otherwise.Schirmer, meanwhile, continued to experience uneasiness. Eventually, heunderwent a second hypnosis, and revealed much more. He now described the objectas metallic, football-shaped, and glowing. He heard a whooshing sound and sawlegs under the craft. Although he wanted to leave, something in his mindprevented him. Then, beings came out of the craft, wearing coveralls with animage of a winged serpent. They shot a greenish gas toward the car and flashed abright light at him. He then passed out. When he regained consciousness, one ofthe beings asked him, “Are you the watchman over this place?” They pointed tothe power plant and asked, “Is this the only source of power you have?” Theytook Schirmer aboard, and he saw control panels and computer-like machines. Theytold him they came from a “nearby” galaxy, had bases in the U.S., that theircraft was operated by electromagnetism, that they drew power from large waterreservoirs, and that radar and ionization disrupted the functioning of theirships. They had been observing the Earth for a long time and would continue tocontact more people. Schirmer said, to a certain extent, they wanted to puzzlepeople. They told him, “You will not speak wisely about this night. We willreturn to see you two more times.”76 [index_split_262.html#filepos1566778]Compared with later abduction stories, Schirmer’s was not especially unusual. Atthe time, however, this was not only outlandish, but almost unheard of, in asmall class of cases like the Boas and Hill abductions. Small wonder the staffat Colorado could not swallow it.Nor did Project Blue Book. But by now, of course, Blue Book was hardly much ofan operation, anyway. In 1966 and 1967, despite 2,049 UFO cases logged by thegroup at Dayton, a mere fifty-one cases, or 2.5 percent, were acknowledged to beunidentified. The trend reached its apex in 1968, the final full year of BlueBook’s existence, when it logged a total of three official unidentifieds. Thesenumbers, it must again be stressed, were due not to investigative expertise, butpolicy. However, no one was paying attention any longer to what Blue Book wasdoing. All the attention had shifted over to Boulder. The relief felt byQuintanilla and his small staff must have been very great."},{"pageContent":"THE CRISIS McDonald, armed with the Low memorandum, posed a distinct threat to theUniversity of Colorado Project. For a year, he had professed his intention tohelp the project in any way possible. It was obvious, however, that he wasdisappointed with its leadership and direction. And the memorandum itself wasdynamite. It was inevitable that he would raise the matter with Low. The onlyquestion was when.On January 19, 1968, the two spoke by phone, and McDonald raised some of hisconcerns about the project. The conversation was unsatisfactory, and the tworeached an impasse. McDonald decided to write a letter to Low. It ended up as aseven-page, single-spaced document, dated January 31, 1968. Masterful in everyway, it was fully worthy of McDonald. He stated the importance not only of theUFO phenomenon, but in particular of the Colorado Project, which increasinglyhad attained an aura of being the final authority over the matter; nearlyeveryone, McDonald noted, was now saying, “Let’s wait for Colorado.” The UFOquestion itself would hinge for many years hence upon its conclusions. For sucha major question to depend upon a single study was unusual, and, in this case,especially distressing.The problem pivoted around Condon, wrote McDonald, and he cited five reasons:(1) Condon’s repeated negative comments in the press; (2) Condon’s “disturbingpreoccupation” with the crackpot aspects of the UFO problem; (3) the evidentconclusion that Condon himself was not personally examining the kinds ofwitnesses and cases that had made the UFO problem so compelling; (4) “thedistinct impression” that the communication between Low and Condon on the onehand, and the bulk of investigators actually reviewing good case material, was“so weak as to seem almost nonexistent”; and (5) the failure of the project toinvestigate cases of “obfuscation,” that is, cover-up cases.Midway through the letter, McDonald mentioned Low’s memorandum from August 1966.He had heard about this memo and, “since it was in the open files,” had askedfor a copy. McDonald then quoted the memorandum in full. “I am rather puzzled bythe viewpoints expressed there,” he wrote, “but I gather that they seem entirelystraightforward to you, else this part of the record would, presumably, not beavailable for inspection in the open project files.”He continued on for several more pages, concluding:> I’m not opposed to negative findings—on UFOs or other scientific questions;> what bothers me is that it appears that these negative findings were being> adumbrated as early as January 1966, and perhaps even earlier. To make sure that Low could not possibly ignore the letter, McDonald sent a copyto the project’s open files, in hopes that “the more open the discussion, thesooner I shall be straightened out on points where I am either in outright erroror where I am making unreasonable arguments.”The letter arrived in Boulder on Monday, February 5, 1968. Low was out of town,and the staff read it first. He returned the next day but did not see the letteruntil 4 P.M., when Mary Lou Armstrong called it to his attention. As she laterrecounted, “Bob exploded.” Whoever had given that memo to McDonald should befired, said Low furiously. He phoned Condon, who reacted in like fashion.Meetings in Condon’s office dominated the rest of the week. Just before 11 A.M.on the morning of Wednesday, February 7, Low summoned Saunders to Condon’soffice. Did you know of the existence of the memo, Condon asked Saunders. Yes,said Saunders. Did McDonald know about it? Yes. How long did you know this? Acouple of months. Why didn’t you tell me? I didn’t think it was necessary, sinceMcDonald was a friend of the project.Condon pointed his finger at Saunders. “For an act like that, you deserve to beruined professionally!” Low asked Saunders why he was dissatisfied with his andCondon’s way of running the project. “Haven’t we let you do everything youwanted to do?” Saunders brought up several issues, including the failure toresolve their problems from September. When Condon asked Saunders if he gave thememo to McDonald, Saunders hedged significantly. No, he said—since it was nothe, but the small group to which he was a part that did.When Norm Levine arrived at 11:30, Low physically ushered Saunders out of theroom. “We don’t want you here anymore.” Levine pointed to the chair Saunders hadbeen sitting in and asked, “Is this the victim’s chair?” From Levine, Condonfinally learned it had been a group effort. He considered Levine’s actionstreacherous, he said, and told him not to discuss the meeting with other projectmembers, nor to communicate with McDonald. Levine was “not prepared to do that,”to which Condon replied, “I’m not sure what use you could be to the projectanymore.” “I guess that’s it, then,” said Levine, and he walked out.Condon and Low summoned staff members, one by one, for the rest of the day. Thatevening, and the next day, they met with Thurston Manning, the school’s vicepresident and Dean of Faculties, and Stuart Cook, chairman of the PsychologyDepartment. On the eighth, Condon told Armstrong that Levine and Saunders weregoing to be fired. Low typed the letters himself, and Condon signed them.On Friday morning, February 9, Condon called Roy Craig into his office. It wasCraig’s first visit there. As expected, Low was also present. Craig told Condonhe knew of the memorandum “and was quite concerned about its implications untilfrank discussions with you relieved my qualms about those apparentimplications.” For this, and the fact that he had not been present when the memowas given to McDonald, Craig kept his job with the project. He left the meeting,however, “deeply concerned” about the project’s viability.That day, journalist Roger Harkins wrote about the events, including revelationsabout the Low memorandum. While interviewing Condon, Harkins became convincedthat Condon “honestly didn’t know anything about that memo until a couple ofdays ago.” Off the record, Condon revealed to Harkins that, in contrast to hisstatement to the press, in which he announced Saunders and Levine had beendischarged for incompetence, the real reason was “contumacy,” that is,insubordination.Not surprisingly, the credibility of the Colorado Project suffered in theaftermath of the firings. McDonald soon told the press about the “entirelyinadequate job” by the Colorado Project, and the general media treatment angeredCondon. Publicly, he told the press that McDonald was probably jealous, “anothercase of an Arizonan wanting some Colorado water.” Privately, he phoned thepresident of the University of Arizona and charged that McDonald was “unethical”and had “stolen” the Low memorandum from committee files, that McDonald’s actwas “treacherous” and “disloyal.”On February 22, Mary Lou Armstrong, for some time secretary to both Condon andthe project, told her boss that the staff had no confidence in Low as projectcoordinator, that he had no interest in UFO sightings or reports, and that “theentire working staff had arrived at a radically different conclusion about UFOsthan Low had.” Two days later, she resigned from her dual roles. Four dayslater, Condon suffered a mild heart attack. The day after that, project memberJim Wadsworth was arrested for possession of marijuana; he soon resigned fromthe project. February 1968 had not been a good month for the University ofColorado UFO Project.An interesting commentary on the progress, or lack thereof, that the project hadmade: when John Fuller arrived on March 1 to prepare an article, he spoke withthe project members, most of whom felt they learned more from him about UFOsthan the reverse.77 [index_split_262.html#filepos1567006]"},{"pageContent":"AIRING THE DIRTY LAUNDRY Fuller’s article hit the newsstands on April 27, 1967. It was titled, “TheFlying Saucer Fiasco: The Half-million Dollar Cover-up on Whether UFOs ReallyExist.” As Fuller put it:> A strange series of incidents in the University of Colorado Unidentified> Flying Objects study has led to a near mutiny by several of the staff> scientists, the dismissal of two Ph.D.’s on the staff, and the resignation of> the project’s administrative assistant. In discomforting detail, Fuller described the Low memorandum, the firing ofproject scientists, and NICAP’s complete break with the project. The latter wasannounced by Keyhoe himself:> After seventeen months, NICAP has broken with the University of Colorado UFO> Project. We join Look and John G. Fuller in disclosing the facts as a public> service.... NICAP will submit plans to the president and Congress for a new> official investigation.... Meantime, to offset the Colorado failure, our> investigations will be intensified. The effect on public opinion was devastating. Look’s circulation, after all, was8 million. Low spent the morning of Monday, April 29, doing damage controlbefore the press, claiming to have been quoted out of context. He maintainedthat the word “trick” from the 1966 memorandum did not carry the meaning Fullerimplied. For the rest of the morning, Low was in Condon’s office, conferringwith legal counsel. There could now be no question that Robert Low had to go forthe project to retain any credibility.78 [index_split_262.html#filepos1567230]Condon protested to Look’s publisher that the article contained falsehoods andmisrepresentations, but failed to specify them. Look stood by the article, andon April 30, the project was denounced in Congress by Rep. J. Edward Roush, amember of the House Science and Astronautics Committee. The Look story, saidRoush, raised “grave doubts as to the scientific profundity and objectivity ofthe project.” Roush wrote to Air Force Secretary Robert B. Seamans to ask forhis comments “on this deplorable situation,” and then to the comptroller generalto investigate the use of public money for the project. The Colorado Project,Roush said, was rigged from the start.Keyhoe followed up with a letter to President Lyndon Johnson (attaching thenow-infamous memorandum) and urged a new, impartial investigation. He received areply from the air force secretary’s office: “[W]e expect Dr. Condon willfulfill the terms of the agreement.” Through May and June, NICAP worked withRoush, assembling, in Keyhoe’s words, its “most powerful evidence” inanticipation of a full-scale investigation.Back at Boulder, Condon was concerned over the loss of so many people from theproject. On May 15, the announcement was made that Low would be relieved of “90percent” of his duties from the project, effective May 24, and would return tohis previous job as special assistant to Thurston E. Manning. Moreover, althoughthe project had received an extension to complete its work, the project membersnevertheless were anxious to get on with their careers. Roy Craig was amongthese, but Condon pleaded with Craig not to leave the project on June 30, 1968,as planned. Ever the loyalist, Craig stayed on, if for no other reason than toassist the editor of the final report—who had yet to be selected!In late May 1968, Condon finally hired science writer Daniel S. Gillmor to bethe editor of the project’s final report. Gillmor received editorial help fromDr. Joseph H. Rush, a physicist on loan to the project from the National Centerfor Atmospheric Research. Also assisting was associate editor Harriet Hunter andseveral specialists from the local lab of the Environmental Science ServicesAdministration (including Gordon Thayer). Franklin E. Roach also returned to theproject to work on astronaut sightings; Roach had been involved in briefing anddebriefing astronauts on Mercury and Gemini flights from 1961 to 1966. Thus, byJune 1, 1968, the date on which the Colorado study formally completed itsinvestigative phase, a substantially new crew had come aboard from that whichexisted at the beginning of the year—just in time to write the final report.Meanwhile, James McDonald continued to try, vainly, to persuade Frederick Seitzof his idea for a UFO research panel. McDonald asked Seitz to give him the namesof the 11 scientists who were going to review the Colorado Project Report; hewanted to let them know of his own views and criticisms. Seitz refused.79[index_split_262.html#filepos1567433]"},{"pageContent":"THE SYMPOSIUM The efforts of NICAP and Congressman Roush bore fruit on July 29, 1968, when theHouse Science and Astronautics Committee began a “symposium” on UFOs.Congressman George P. Miller, of California, was the chairman of the committee,but Roush, who was acting chairman, directed most of the proceedings. Some ofthe major figures in UFO research were invited to testify before Congress,including Hynek, McDonald, and Sagan. Others included Dr. James A. Harder,associate professor of civil engineering at the University of California atBerkeley; Dr. Robert L. Hall, head of the department of sociology at theUniversity of Illinois at Chicago; and Dr. Robert M. L. Baker, Jr., of theComputer Sciences Corporation and the department of engineering at theUniversity of California in Los Angeles. Baker, it will be recalled, hadanalyzed the Tremonton, Utah, film in 1955. Donald Menzel also attended, largelyon the basis of his complaint that the symposium presented a wholly pro-UFOpoint of view. Although he did not testify, he submitted a paper, which thecommittee included in its records.The symposium, while decidedly pro-UFO in orientation, was no free-for-all; itremained carefully managed. Menzel, for example, was not the only attendeeunable to speak to the committee. Keyhoe, too, learned that, despite NICAP’srole in securing the hearings, NICAP representatives could not testify or submitinformation. Chairman Miller also warned that no criticism of the air force’sProject Blue Book, nor of the University of Colorado’s UFO Project, would bepermitted. Although several prepared statements critical of the air force madeit into the official hearings record, they went unnoticed by the press.It was James McDonald who made the greatest impression during the symposium.Providing thirty pages of verified UFO reports, his long statement included thefollowing remarks:> I have become convinced that the scientific community, not only in this> country but throughout the world, has been casually ignoring as nonsense a> matter of extraordinary scientific importance....> > > > > > My own present opinion, based on two years of careful study, is that UFOs are> probably extraterrestrial devices engaged in something that might very> tentatively be termed “surveillance.” ...> > > I believe no other problem within your jurisdiction is of comparable> scientific and national importance.

I had no idea that the actual UFO situation> is anything like what it appears to be....> > > I now regard the [extraterrestrial hypothesis] as the one mostly likely to> prove correct.80 [index_split_262.html#filepos1567667]McDonald may have made an impression, but the symposium had no lasting impact.Aside from some grumbling about the University of Colorado Project, Congress didnothing.81 [index_split_262.html#filepos1567953]With the symposium fizzling out, and the Colorado University Project clearlyheaded toward a negative conclusion, NICAP’s situation was dismal. The mainproblem was always a lack of funds, and by the summer of 1968, the situation wasbecoming desperate. In August, Keyhoe pleaded with members in NICAP’s UFOInvestigator that the organization was “on the brink of disaster,” facing “animminent shutdown.” The response barely kept NICAP limping along.82[index_split_262.html#filepos1568108]"},{"pageContent":"UFO HYPOTHESIS AND SURVIVAL QUESTIONS The involvement of the National Security Agency in the tracking and analysis ofUFOs has long been the subject of speculation. Indeed, several documentsobtained through Freedom of Information Act requests have proven, despite NSAdenials, strong interest in UFO reports. One document from the caverns of NSAthat surfaced in 1984 as a result of a FOIA request is, while not an officialNSA document per se, nevertheless a remarkable piece.83[index_split_262.html#filepos1568244]In this brief essay, the author methodically considered the various “humansurvival implications” suggested by the major competing hypotheses thatexplained UFOs. He then analyzed each hypothesis.The first hypothesis, that UFOs were hoaxes, seemed highly unlikely, the authorwrote. Historically speaking, hoaxes have been characterized by infrequency ofoccurrence and a restricted geographic nature. If UFOs were hoaxes of aworldwide dimension, “then a human mental aberration of alarming proportionswould have appeared to be developing,” an alarming conclusion in itself.The next hypothesis, that UFOs were hallucinations, also seemed unlikely. Whilepeople do hallucinate, group hallucinations are rare. Machines, too, can“hallucinate,” in that radar can at times mistakenly “see” a temperatureinversion. However, “a considerable number of instances exists in which thereare groups of people and a radar or radars seeing the same thing at the sametime....” If, in spite of the evidence, UFOs did turn out to be hallucinations,then “such a growing impairment of the human capacity for rational judgment[should] be subjected to immediate and thorough scientific study.”The third hypothesis, that UFOs were natural phenomena, seemed unlikely due tothe many instances of trained military observers seeing UFOs behaving likehigh-speed and high-performance aircraft, with an apparent solidity andcraft-like shape. If the hypothesis turned out to be correct, we must questionthe ability of air warning systems to diagnose an attack situation. It wasdisturbing, the author noted, that “many responsible military officers havedeveloped a mental ‘blind spot’ to objects which appear to have thecharacteristics of UFOs.” The implication is that many officers see, but do notreport, UFOs.Are UFOs secret Earth projects? The mysterious author failed to speculate muchon this fourth hypothesis, but agreed that it had some validity. All UFOs, heargued, should be scrutinized to ferret out such enemy or friendly projects.Otherwise, we risk the possibility of intimidation by a new secret weapon.The fifth hypothesis, UFOs as extraterrestrial intelligence, was the one thatmost intrigued the author, and the one to which he gave his strongestendorsement. He cited such scientists as McDonald, Hynek, Vallee, and SeymoreHess, and argued that the 1952 Washington, D.C., sightings “strongly supportthis view.” If the ET hypothesis is true, he wrote, the human survival questionsare far-reaching. “If ‘they’ discover you, it is an old but hardly invalid ruleof thumb, ‘they’ are your technological superiors.” Human history surelydemonstrates the dangers to weaker cultures when confronted by a technologicallysuperior civilization: a loss of identity and absorption by the others. Citingthe example of Japan, he noted that it is at least theoretically possible for a“weaker” society to survive such a confrontation, but he criticized theleisurely approach scientists had hitherto taken to the possibility that UFOsrepresented alien intelligence. “If you are walking along a forest path,” hecontinued, “and someone yells ‘rattler,”’> your action would be immediate and defensive. You would not take time to> speculate before you act. You would have to treat the alarm as if it were a> real and immediate threat to your survival. Investigation would become an> intensive emergency action to isolate the threat and to determine its precise> nature. It would be geared to developing adequate defensive measures in a> minimum amount of time. It would seem, he concluded, that a little more of this survival attitude iscalled for in dealing with the UFO problem. Chimpanzees in captivity, forexample, become confused, disoriented, and pattern their behavior after humans.Such a behavior, wrote the author, offers no survival value in the wild. “Do thecaptivity characteristics of modern civilization,” he wondered, “cause a similarlessening of man’s adaptive capability, of his health, of his ability torecognize reality, of his ability to survive?”The NSA maintained that, while the document in question does exist, “it wasnever published, issued, acted upon, or responded to by NSA or any othergovernment agency. Its author wrote it for personal reasons. As explained above,NSA has not been tasked to monitor or assess allegations of UFO activityworldwide.”84 [index_split_262.html#filepos1568694]Despite not being an official NSA document, this remarkable paper, which placescredence in the extraterrestrial hypothesis, makes it reasonable to assume thatothers within NSA, including those in leadership positions, could well havethought likewise."},{"pageContent":"“THE RAND DOCUMENT” The NSA was not the only place in 1968 where internally distributed UFO paperssupported the ET hypothesis. The RAND Corporation, one of the elite researchinstitutions in the world since its founding in 1948, and a major player in theformulation of U.S. national security policy, also produced an interesting UFOpaper that year. RAND emphasized that, while written by staffer George Kocher,it was not an official RAND document. Moreover, according to UFO researcher JanAldrich, it generated “little or no response.”It remains an interesting paper, in particular for its theory on the possiblenumber of worlds inhabited by technologically superior civilizations (100million in our galaxy alone, Kocher theorized), and the average distance betweenthem (about ten light-years). Kocher noted the likelihood that UFOs have beenwith mankind for ages, looked at some compelling reports, and pointed out thatit was “practically impossible” to estimate the number of worldwide sightings“because of the lack of suitable data collection means.”Kocher was certainly a believer in the extraterrestrial hypothesis, but his maingoal was to point toward a suitable direction for future action. His answersmade sense and were therefore entirely impractical: essentially to expand andimprove on the models of NICAP and APRO. This would mean establishing a centralreport receiving agency, staffed by permanent and experienced UFO investigatorsof all disciplines. Such an agency would provide uninterrupted scientificanalysis of UFOs and would be completely open and available to the public.Although the paper was supposedly meant for internal distribution (at top itstated, “Do not quote or cite in external RAND publications or correspondence”),a copy of this paper nevertheless made it to the Wright-Patterson AFB and thenceto the desk of Blue Book chief Hector Quintanilla. He wrote a “blazing letter”to RAND, which never responded. That appeared to be the end of the matter.85[index_split_262.html#filepos1568916]"},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN 1968 The year 1968 turned out to be the last year of any significant UFO activityuntil late 1973, and most of it occurred outside the United States. We mustremember, however, how difficult it is actually to measure UFO activity. Byearly 1968, for example, most UFO witnesses had stopped making public reports,thanks to air force ridicule. The result was that Blue Book went through theentire year with the incredible total of just three unidentified sightings.86[index_split_262.html#filepos1569051]Throughout the world, many of the sighting reports were outlandish, and humanoidsightings were common. A February 1, 1968, sighting in the Azores by a watchmanat the air station involved an oval, metallic craft and four beings. The witnessfainted, and the case was said to be investigated by American militaryauthorities.87 [index_split_262.html#filepos1569209]Once again, however, South America was the main area of reported activity. FromMay through July, many sightings of alien beings were reported by professional,low-key individuals. UFO researcher Gordon Creighton wrote at the time that“something very odd is again happening to many people in the southern part ofSouth America.” In May, five UFOs were seen diving into the ocean off the coastat Arrecife, Venezuela. On the night of June 4, at the southern tip of Chile,two veteran pilots of Argentine Air Lines, and several of their eighteenpassengers, saw a shining, reddish cylinder flying high above them. The sightinglasted five minutes. After landing at the airport in Chile, they learned theobject had been seen and photographed from there. On June 8, the senior pilotand copilot were interviewed in La Razon, a Buenos Aires newspaper, and wereadamant that they had seen a UFO.88 [index_split_262.html#filepos1569384] On thesixteenth of June, two high-ranking police officials of the Argentine town ElChoro saw a round object with a vivid blue light. It landed, left a strong odor,and burned vegetation. Throughout the month, close-range sightings and groundtraces were reported by a broad group of witnesses in Argentina, several of whomclaimed to lose consciousness, and others who reported physical aftereffectsfrom the encounter. Many of these cases were investigated by police.89[index_split_262.html#filepos1569589]Some of the stories were hard to take. The New York Times made light of thereports on July 13, 1968, with an article titled, “UFOs Add Spice to Life ofLatins.” Despite the article’s tone, it did quote an Argentine governmentofficial who said seriously, “I have no doubt that flying saucers have arrivedhere. I worry about what they are up to. I just can’t understand why they havepicked on Argentina.”90 [index_split_262.html#filepos1569768]UFO reports worldwide dwindled after August. One of the last major sightings of1968 occurred in France just before 4 A.M. on November 2. The witness was aprominent doctor (known as “Dr. X. Clark”), and veteran in the Algerian War, whoheard his fourteen-month-old son crying during a thunderstorm. The doctorentered his son’s room and saw two large, disc-shaped objects outside his housemerge into one. The single object sent a beam of light in his direction, thenvanished with a sort of explosion, leaving a cloud that slowly dissipated.Shortly after his sighting, the man’s leg, which had been wounded during thewar, healed. Unfortunately, he also soon began experiencing nightmares, pains inhis abdomen, and a red pigmentation that appeared around his navel, forming atriangle. He went to a dermatologist but gave no information about the UFOsighting; the doctor could not explain it. The case was even reported to theFrench Academy of Sciences, again with no UFO connections.Incredibly, the man’s fourteen-month-old son, who was in the same room when thesighting occurred, also developed a red triangle. UFO researcher Jerome Clarkcalled this incident one of the most fantastic UFO stories ever, with “physicalevidence of an eerily compelling sort.” The case was unusually well tracked andinvestigated, with a great deal of effort done by Aimé Michel.91[index_split_262.html#filepos1569910]"},{"pageContent":"THE CONDON REPORT During the fall of 1968, the Colorado Project was running down the home stretch.On September 13, Condon called together his new inner circle of projectmembers—Craig, Gillmor, Franklin Roach, and Joseph Rush—to discuss what theproject’s recommendation should be. He wrote the recommendation segment of thereport shortly thereafter.92 [index_split_262.html#filepos1570095]The Colorado University Project delivered its long-awaited report, titledScientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, to the air force on October 31,1968. The following is a synopsis of its contents.The first two sections were written by Condon himself; these were the projectconclusions and recommendations, and a summary of the study itself. His generalconclusion was that> nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past twenty-one years that has> added to scientific knowledge. Careful consideration of the record as it is> available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs> probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced> thereby. As to what the government should do about UFO reports received from the public,Condon answered, nothing. It was a clear recommendation to shut down ProjectBlue Book.Condon refuted the charge that the UFO subject had been shrouded in officialsecrecy and the subject of a cover-up. There was no such evidence, he stated.“What has been miscalled secrecy has been no more than an intelligent policy ofdelay in releasing data so that the public does not become confused by prematurepublication of incomplete studies of reports.” Moreover, a UFO cover-up wasunthinkable because no one could keep such a secret for so long, and “no usefulpurpose would be served.” He refuted the claim that the CIA had installed one ofits own agents within the project. Considering the probable history of RobertLow as a CIA covert operative in the 1940s, this denial takes on a surrealquality.Condon’s conclusions, while strongly negative about UFOs, left the door open forfuture research. “Any scientist with adequate training and credentials who doescome up with a clearly defined, specific proposal for study,” he wrote, “shouldbe supported.” Still, Condon himself doubted such a study could be done on thoseterms anytime soon. He expressed his approval of the air force and Donald Menzeland his disapproval of UFO “amateurists” and especially NICAP. The last, hewrote, tried more than once “to influence the course of our study.”Condon acknowledged limitations to the project. Only a few “old” cases could bestudied, since most appeared to offer little “probative value” in that (1) therewas usually nothing to analyze other than witness testimony, (2) such anecdotalrecords were usually misidentified sightings of ordinary objects, and (3) itmade little sense to re-interview people who had already been interviewedthoroughly before. Of course, this meant ignoring most of the compelling casesof the past twenty-plus years. Instead, the project focused almost exclusivelyon reports that occurred during its term. This approach proved to beunsatisfactory in many key respects. First, resources were too limited to allowany but a few UFO reports to be investigated. Second, it was rare when aninvestigation occurred within a week of the sighting. Third, only rarely wassophisticated instrumentation used—the most typical piece of equipment being atape recorder.Many of the UFO investigations, Condon wrote, were a waste of time. He openlywondered why, if aliens were here, they did not simply announce themselves. Theentire matter of alien visitation would be settled in a few minutes, he wrote,> if a flying saucer were to land on the lawn of a hotel where a convention of> the American Physical Society was in progress, and its occupants were to> emerge and present a special paper to the assembled physicists, revealing> where they came from and the technology of how their craft operates. While conceding the likelihood of intelligent life elsewhere (ILE), he rejectedthe extraterrestrial hypothesis. The distance between stars, argued Condon, issimply too vast to allow for practical communication. “We therefore conclude[emphasis added],” he wrote, “that there is no relation between ILE at othersolar systems and the UFO phenomenon as observed on Earth.”This is a key element of the report. One may wonder why, with such an opinion,would it be necessary to study any UFO reports with a view toward a possible ETexplanation? Condon’s answer was, no reason at all. More than any other reason,this probably explains why Condon himself never investigated any UFO reports forthe project. Despite his statements about the need for scientific objectivityand clarity in the study of UFO reports, it is clear that Condon’s own positionof UFOs, while based upon contemporary scientific theory and knowledge,nevertheless was fundamentally antiempirical, and therefore antiscientific.In passing, we may note that Condon also ruled out experimental, classifiedaircraft as the primary source of UFO reports, since he thought it unlikely thatany nation would test its secret aircraft over different countries.The report also included summaries of the project’s various types of studies:field studies, photographic evidence, direct physical evidence, indirectphysical evidence, optical and radar cases, and astronaut sightings. Roy Craigwas the workhorse of the group, writing three of these reports: field studies,direct physical evidence, and indirect physical evidence. Each time, heconcluded that the available evidence did not point toward extraterrestrialanswers.In the field study section, Craig conceded that some of the past cases suggestedsomething extraordinary. A few, such as the Great Falls, Montana, case, appearedto show evidence of air force deception. Others, such as the RB-47 report,would, if accurate, represent an unusual and puzzling phenomenon, “which, in theabsence of additional information, must be listed as unidentified.” Moreover,while witness testimony could never be taken without reservation, some casesinvolved testimony which appeared to describe experiences explainable “only interms of the presence of strange vehicles. These cases are puzzling,” wroteCraig, “and conclusions regarding them depend entirely upon the weight one givesto the personal testimony as presented.” He concluded, however, that early casessuch as these took place too long ago to offer much hope of obtainingsignificant data about the objects sighted. Ultimately, Craig, like Condon,doubted the value of UFO field investigations. Even if an alien culture werevisiting us, “such a report would be buried in hundreds or thousands of similarreports triggered by ordinary earthly phenomena.”Craig’s section on direct physical evidence concerned reports dealing with cropcircles, impressions in the ground, alleged pieces of UFOs, and the like.Unfortunately, there were no physical tests, he said, which could determine theorigin of imprints at a landing site. Even when the impression was real andconceivably from a large saucer, “it was impossible to establish as factual theclaims that the imprints actually were made by an extraordinary object orbeing.” Heavily compacted soil allegedly caused by UFO “landing legs,” forexample, could theoretically be achieved with a sledge hammer. The main featureof this section was Craig’s analysis of the Ubatuba fragment, which did notprove to have the unusual purity of magnesium as claimed and did not show aunique or unearthly composition. (APRO responded that this fragment was not thesame kind of fragment that had been submitted earlier and which had beendestroyed by air force tests.)Indirect physical evidence included electrical or electromagnetic effects, suchas the failure of a car engine or headlights, radio and television interference,local power failures, terrestrial magnetic disturbances, and so on. TheAntarctic sightings of July 3, 1965, wrote Craig, did not cause abnormalmagnetic fluctuations, and the visual observations were made by nine “untrained”people, according to a Chilean astronomer. In cases of automotive enginefailure, the project looked toward magnetic disturbances as the most likelycause. Independent tests determined that magnetic fields could indeed stop anengine, but they would have to be very strong and would leave definite traces,even years after an event. Of the two cases in which such tests were conducted,the results did not indicate a sufficient intensity to have interfered with thecar’s functioning. Robert Low contributed a small piece to this section,focusing on the northeastern blackout of 1965. He cited the Federal PowerCommission report on the incident, which explained the outage by an incorrectlyset relay at the Sir Adam Beck generating station in Queensland, Ontario(Q29BD), which caused the circuit breaker to trip. A query with one expertindicated that he was aware of no mysterious power outages.William K. Hartman wrote the project’s report on photographic evidence. Thecases broke down roughly into four equal categories: fabrications,misidentifications, poor image quality, and clear images which lacked sufficientdata for analysis. Two cases, wrote Hartman, made it past all these obstacles:Great Falls, Montana, and McMinnville, Oregon. In the case of the McMinnvillephotos, Hartman wrote:> This is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated,> geometric, psychological, and physical, appear to be consistent with the> assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disk-shaped,> tens of meters in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within sight of two> witnesses. It cannot be said that the evidence positively rules out a> fabrication, although there are some physical factors such as the accuracy of> certain photometric measures of the original negatives which argue against a> fabrication. Still, Hartman could not go all the way. “No matter how strange or intriguing,”he wrote, “it is always possible to ‘explain’ the observations, either byhypothesizing some extraordinary circumstance or by alleging a hoax.”Gordon David Thayer reported on optical and radar cases. He discussed theprevalence of anomalous propagation (AP), typically false radar returns causedby atmospheric conditions. Thayer worked ingeniously to find naturalexplanations to some extraordinary sightings. In order to do this, he frequentlydisregarded witness testimony; even then, his explanations at times broke theboundaries of the plausible.The BOAC sighting of June 1954 is an example. The British commercial pilots hadclear visuals of what seemed to be several craft, and a fighter sent tointercept the objects obtained a radar fix. The fact that the commercial planeobtained no radar, wrote Thayer, was suggestive of a mirage. He conceded theproblem with this explanation was that an extremely thin and sharp temperatureinversion would have had to appear just above the aircraft. Thayer wrote that> this unusual sighting should therefore be assigned to the category of some> almost certainly natural phenomenon which is so rare that it apparently has> never been reported before or since. Another case, at Selfridge AFB in 1953, was also puzzling. A pilot and radaroperator in an F-94 were sent to intercept unknown targets over Detroit. Bothmen saw “tiny specs in the sky, which appeared to look like a ragged formationof aircraft.” As they approached at 500 mph, the pilot was surprised that hecould not make out wings or tail. Ground radar had the F- 94 and the objects as“good, strong targets.” The pilot looked at his instruments momentarily—when helooked up, the objects were gone. Radar tracked the objects for another fourminutes. Thayer conceded that “the only admissible hypothesis would seem to bethat [the UFOs] became invisible as the fighter approached, but this does notaccount for the fact that they could not be picked up on airborne radar whilethe aircraft was searching the area.” He therefore hypothesized “an inferiormirage,” which “is another example of a natural phenomenon so rare that it isseldom observed....” Such a mirage would require a drastic temperature change—onthe order of ten to fifteen degrees Celsius within the space of one centimeter.And so on. Thayer attributed the Washington 1952 sightings to weather-relatedanomalous propagation of radar signals, combined “most probably” with meteorsand scintillating stars. The Rapid City-Bismarck sighting of 1953 was caused bya combination of (1) stars seen through an inversion layer, (2) at least onemeteor, (3) AP echoes on radar, and (4) possible ghost echoes on ground radarand malfunction of an airborne radar gunsight. Thayer acknowledged that thecommanding officer of the Rapid City detachment was doubtful of that last point.Despite the many ways in which atmospheric phenomena can mislead the human andelectronic eye, Thayer acknowledged a “small, but significant, residue of casesfrom the radar-visual files that have no plausible explanation as propagationphenomena and/or misinterpreted man-made objects.” One was a Utica case from1955, in which an object was seen by a pilot and copilot and described as “lightgray, almost round, with a center line.... Beneath the line there were several(at least four) windows which emitted a bright blue-green light. It was notrotating, but went straight.” Although the object was reported to be moving atabove Mach 6, there was no sonic boom, a serious inconsistency, Thayer wrote.Still, he conceded that “it does appear that this sighting defies explanation byconventional means.”Thayer’s most intriguing radar-visual case was the Lakenheath, U.K., incident ofAugust 1956. This involved the tailing of an RAF fighter by an unidentifiedobject. Thayer examined the possibility of atmospheric conditions, but to noavail. He commented that> this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The> apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical> device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting. But this was too radical a conclusion without some qualifier: in this case, “theinevitable fallibility of witnesses,” which kept alive the possibility of aconventional explanation.Despite, or because of, his dogged approach to arriving at conventionalexplanations, Thayer recommended several measures—all of which involvedexpending more resources—to improve UFO investigations. Thus, he parted wayswith Condon and Craig as to whether UFOs warranted full-time study. Thayerappeared to be saying that they did.Franklin Roach discussed astronaut sightings, mostly attributed to space debrisseen under typically poor observational conditions. Still, three cases remainedunexplained and “a challenge to the analyst.” Two were from the Gemini 4 missionof June 4, 1965, by James McDivitt; the third from the Gemini 7 flight by FrankBorman, who saw what he referred to as a bogey flying in formation with thespacecraft.The fifty-nine case studies constituted the heart of the book. Many of thesereports showed impressive detective work to explain what initially appeared tobe an extraordinary, and extraterrestrial, event. Others showed more signs offanatical determination to debunk than investigative expertise. Within thefifty-nine cases studied, there were actually ninety UFO reports, of whichthirty were not explained. Many of the explanations were on something of asliding scale of probability, a reasonable way to do things, but not so easy toattribute hard quantitative results. Not all conclusions were clearly stated (asin Case 34, the Shag Harbor incident). Many were deemed to have insufficientdata for analysis, or to have little probative value. One case did not belong inthe study at all: the failure of a predicted UFO landing. Some of theunexplained cases nevertheless had the possibility of various conventionalexplanations proffered. Several explained cases were stretches that could onlybe attained by disregarding seemingly rational witness claims.Looking at each of the fifty-nine case studies as a unit, however, the reportproduced sixteen cases in which the origin of the event could be consideredunknown. Considering a total of fifty-eight cases (minus the nonevent), thatproduces an unexplained percentage of almost 28 percent. Of those sixteen cases,eight were what one might consider to be “good” cases, and two extraordinary. Ifonly these two extraordinary cases (numbers two and forty-six) are included, oneis still left with an unexplained rate of 3.4 percent. In other words, theColorado Project produced results that were nearly identical with those of theair force, NICAP, and APRO, with the difference that it was charged withconducting its study at a more rigorous level. It is perhaps significant that ofthe most compelling cases presented in the study, all were of the periodpreceding the term of the project, that is, “classic cases.”The remainder of the report consisted of mostly padding: a historical study ofUFOs, an essay (by Condon) dealing with the 1947-1968 period, a short paper onUFO studies by other governments, and a public opinion survey. Another 250 pagesconsisted of essays on various problems of “scientific context,” such asperceptual problems, psychological aspects, optics, radar, sonic boom,atmospheric conditions, balloons, instrumentation, and statistical analysis.Several of these papers demonstrated perplexity regarding UFOs, such as oneauthor comment that the reported absence of sonic booms from UFOs in supersonicflight “cannot be explained on the basis of current knowledge.”The Colorado University report, known more widely as the Condon Report, wasmassive. At over 950 pages in its soon-to-be published paperback form, itprobably fulfilled Robert Low’s desire to “build the record.” Despite itsintimidating length, however, the Condon Report suffered from several majorfailings. In the places where it counted most, the case studies, the report wasskimpy. Why, a reader might ask, with eighteen months to investigate, did theproject produce so few studies? True, many reports were conducted morethoroughly than Blue Book, NICAP, or APRO had done, but fifty-eight cases isstill not much to go on. Of the 550 then-unexplained reports in the Blue Bookfiles, the Colorado Project had considered only three. Also, many of thesightings investigated by the project were poor bets to begin with.Probably the most striking discrepancy in the report, however, was between itscontents and conclusions. Condon had concluded that science could gain nothingfrom studying UFOs. Yet, the report ended up with a near 30 percent unexplainedrate, and a core of cases that came within a hair’s breadth of being conclusiveevidence for the reality of alien technology—cases which, under the mostrigorous analysis, appeared to be the result of extraordinary craft in theskies.Ironically, the Condon Report, which rejected so many cases as “lackingprobative value,” itself lacked value as a definitive statement of the UFOphenomenon. The fact that it showed most UFO sightings to be the result ofnatural or conventional causes was nothing new: everyone had known that foryears. From the beginning, Condon and Low were clear in their belief that allUFO sightings could be explained conventionally. While Condon chose to ignorethe unsettling data contained within the project’s report, he could not hide theglaring reality: the Colorado Project failed to get the strikeout."},{"pageContent":"REVIEW AND RELEASE OF THE REPORT Upon receiving the report, officers at Air Force Headquarters began a quickreview. On November 15, the air force sent it to the National Academy ofSciences for review by an eleven-member panel, charged with an independentassessment of the scope, methodology, and findings of the project. With littledelay, the NAS panel of scientists unanimously accepted Condon’s conclusions andpraised the project. The panel stated it was “unanimous in the opinion that thishas been a very creditable effort to apply objectively the relevant techniquesof science to the solution of the UFO problem.” Keyhoe was not alone inbelieving that the scientists had either read only Condon’s two openingsections, “or else they had deliberately ignored everything disproving hisconclusions.”93 [index_split_262.html#filepos1570235]In December 1968, before the Condon Report was released to the public, DavidSaunders published his own side of the story, UFOs? Yes! Where the CondonCommittee Went Wrong. In addition to better timing, the book had otheradvantages over the official report. Coauthored by journalist Roger Harkins, itwas better written. Second, it offered an insider’s account of the workings ofthe committee, including the biases of Condon and Low, and the dissension thatcharacterized the project. Rather than attempting to make a definitive argumentin favor of the ET factor (to which Saunders was certainly sympathetic), thebook’s main argument was that Condon and Low never intended to consider a pro-ETsolution to the UFO problem, that the project’s conclusions were preordained.Moreover, in the unlikely event that the project arrived at such adetermination, Condon would not have published such a fact. Instead, he wouldhave taken it through classified channels.The Condon Report was released to the public on January 9, 1969; the press hadgotten a copy one day before, along with the glowing NAS review. With no time toconduct a careful review, the media read Condon’s conclusions andrecommendations, and little else. Critical press comment was minimal, and mostof the media applauded the work. With justice, Keyhoe called this “steamrollertactics.”94 [index_split_262.html#filepos1570427]On January 11, 1969, attempting to mitigate the disaster, Keyhoe, Saunders, andMcDonald held a press conference and harshly criticized the report. Hynek alsoquickly denounced the report, speaking of its “trivial and irrelevantdiscussions, practically padding.” But McDonald was the most forceful. Hecirculated critiques, communicated with other scholars, and sought toreinvestigate several of the project cases. He even battled to get access to thephotocopied Blue Book material used by the project; Condon saw to it that thesewere destroyed. The tide had turned; in the public realm, UFOs were debunked.95[index_split_262.html#filepos1570616]It also appeared that Blue Book’s days were numbered. In early March 1969, SAFOIrepresentative, Maj. David J. Shea, attended a meeting at the Pentagon in which“there was no doubt that Project Blue Book was finished.” 96[index_split_262.html#filepos1570800] Condon spoke publicly about the report forthe first time in April. At a meeting of the American Philosophical Society, heseemed to state in seriousness that> publishers who publish or teachers who teach any of the pseudosciences as> established truth should, on being found guilty, be publicly horsewhipped and> forever banned from further activity in these usually honorable professions.97> [index_split_262.html#filepos1570940] "},{"pageContent":"FROM JOHNSON TO NIXON The most noteworthy feature of the American national security state during thelate 1960s was its covert pervasiveness throughout American society. First,Hoover’s FBI. In 1968, the bureau initiated a Cointel program against theStudents for a Democratic Society (SDS). From 1969 to 1971, the Chicago policedepartment routinely, and illegally, funneled intelligence to the FBI. Still,Hoover was falling behind. Both the NSA and CIA were increasingly unhappy withthe FBI, which they wanted to be more aggressive. Hoover in his old age had notso much mellowed as become nervous and, with good cause, concerned aboutexposure.98 [index_split_262.html#filepos1571081] The FBI also had made a fineshambles of the investigation of the assassinations of Martin Luther King andRobert F. Kennedy in 1968. (Ten years later, a congressional inquiry concludedthere was a conspiracy to kill King. James Earl Ray, the man convicted forKing’s murder, claimed that the FBI pressured him to confess. The RFKinvestigation was similarly mishandled.)Next to the bureau, the military intelligence services became the most importantcomponent of the domestic intelligence scene. Army intelligence had nearlyunlimited funds, extensive manpower, specialized personnel, deep planning andtraining resources, and the most sophisticated communications and dataprocessing capability. This ensured a unique versatility. The army’sintelligence surveillance did not focus on tactical and reconnaissance data, buton political and ideological intelligence within the United States. These werewholly illegal.99 [index_split_262.html#filepos1571247]Then there was the CIA. By the late 1960s, there were more spies than diplomatsin the State Department, or employees in the Department of Labor. The CIA wasusing the NRO’s spy satellite apparatus to gather intelligence on domesticdemonstrations. One of its domestic intelligence operations, known as Chaos,expanded steadily through 1968 and 1969, pacing the antiwar movement itself.When the Weather Underground, a radical splinter of the SDS, had an “acid test”to detect agents provocateurs, they had no idea that the CIA had been trippingon LSD throughout the 1950s, creating a special caste of “enlightened agents”for precisely these occasions.100 [index_split_262.html#filepos1571401]The agency continued its work on mind control. Following the work of Dr. JoseDelgado, a Yale psychologist, Dr. Robert Keefe, a neurosurgeon at TulaneUniversity, conducted work in Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). Thisinvolves implanting electrodes into the brain and body, with the result that thesubject’s memory, impulses, and feelings could all be controlled. Moreover, ESBcould evoke hallucinations, as well as fear and pleasure. “It could literallymanipulate the human will, at will,” said Keefe. In 1968, George Estabrooks,another spook scientist, spoke indiscreetly to a reporter for the ProvidenceEvening Bulletin. “The key to creating an effective spy or assassin,” saidEstabrooks, “rests in creating a multiple personality with the aid of hypnosis,”a procedure which he described as “child’s play.” Estabrooks even suggested thatLee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby “could very well have been performing throughhypnosis.” By early 1969, teams within the CIA were running a number of bizarreexperiments in mind control under the name Operation Often. In addition to thenormal assortment of chemists, biologists, and conventional scientists, theoperation employed psychics and experts in demonology.101[index_split_262.html#filepos1571563]Over at the NSA, all one can say with certainty is that its budget dwarfed allothers within the intelligence community. The FY 1969 budget for the NSA wasestimated at upwards of $2 billion, a staggering amount of money at the time,supporting, among other things, a cryptologic community of ninety-five thousandpersonnel—five times larger than the CIA.A basic feature of the pervasiveness of domestic spying was the general lack ofcivilian control. In the words of historian Frank Donner, “the civilianleadership of the Defense Department, the White House, and the attorneygeneral’s office, were left in the dark about the military intelligencecolossus. But it is fair to conclude that they preferred it that way.”102[index_split_262.html#filepos1571725]By the time Richard Nixon entered the White House in 1969, nearly every Americanintelligence organization was involved in major violations of the law. Still,Nixon found this to be insufficient. He distrusted the CIA and was frustratedwith Hoover’s jealousy and timidity. Of course, Nixon gladly accepted the usefuldirt offered by Hoover, under the code name “Inlet.” By June 1969, Nixon orderedseven wiretaps to be placed on the phones of his staffers.103[index_split_262.html#filepos1571871]Internationally, the American press remained silent while the rest of the worldcommented on the devastation of America’s “secret” bombing of northern Laos,described in Le Monde as “a world without noise, for the surrounding villageshad disappeared.” It took nearly an entire year before the New York Times waswilling to publish this fact, which it finally did (without editorial) in May1969. By then, the U.S. was also bombing and defoliating Cambodia, an operationwhich remained covert until 1970. The official denials kept coming. On October1, 1969, Air Force Secretary Robert Seamans visited the Plain of Jars in Laosand reported that he saw “no evidence of indiscriminate bombing.104[index_split_262.html#filepos1572047]A final event of some interest. The year 1969 saw the publication of aninteresting, little known book by Andrew Tully, with the hyperbolic title TheSuper Spies. The book is significant as an early report on the NSA, and evenmore so as its first chapter discussed the UFO controversy, albeitsuperficially. Tully stated that UFOs were products of secret militarytechnology:> Despite efforts by the military and the Central Intelligence Agency to debunk> the flying saucer as a natural phenomenon, informed speculation has continued> to maintain that it existed—as an intelligence device. It was common knowledge, wrote Tully, that the American and Russian intelligencecommunities were launching unmanned aircraft electronically equipped toeavesdrop from the skies on each other’s secrets. Within and outside government,“many of those who have given the flying saucer their scientific attention haveconcluded that they are mechanical creatures of the nation’s most hush-hushespionage outfit, the code-breaking National Security Agency and its Sovietcounterpart.” Although these unmanned craft operated mostly in space, theyoccasionally lost control, “and thus are sighted by the Norman Muscarellos ofExeter, and, probably, by the Ivan Ivanoviches of Smolensk.” That essentiallyended the UFO segment of Tully’s book, as shallow as it was brief.105[index_split_262.html#filepos1572247]"},{"pageContent":"THE END OF PROJECT BLUE BOOK On October 20, 1969, Brig. Gen. Carroll H. Bolender, the Air Force DeputyDirector of Development, wrote a classified memo recommending the termination ofProject Blue Book. As a result of the Condon Report recommendations and itsendorsement from the scientific community, he stated, “we agree, that thecontinuation of Project Blue Book cannot be justified, either on the ground ofnational security or in the interest of science.” Blue Book data, he argued,served neither the air force’s environmental research program nor anyintelligence function. Moreover, wrote Bolender,> reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security> are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11, and are not> part of the Blue Book system [emphasis added] (Atch 10). The air force> experience therefore confirms the impression of the University of Colorado> researchers “that the defense function could be performed within the framework> established for intelligence and surveillance operations without the> continuance of a special unit such as Project Blue Book.” An indisputable statement that UFOs affecting national security—the importantsightings—were “not part of the Blue Book system.” As if Bolender had not beenclear enough, he restated his point: “Reports of UFOs which could affectnational security would continue to be handled through the standard air forceprocedures designed for this purpose.”The implications are obvious. Blue Book served no useful purpose. It was “anadministrative burden” and had not been taking serious UFO reports, anyway. Whatcould it have been, other than a public relations facade? Unfortunately,Bolender said nothing else about other air force or military UFO activities. Thevery existence of military channels to investigate UFOs as part of nationalsecurity, however, makes it self-evident that someone must have thought thephenomenon was a threat of some sort.106 [index_split_262.html#filepos1572392]The rest was a formality. On December 17, 1969, Air Force Secretary RobertSeamans, back from his jaunt to the Plain of Jars, announced the termination ofProject Blue Book. On the basis of recommendations by Dr. Condon, Seamansstated, Blue Book could not be continued because it “cannot be justified eitheron the grounds of national security or in the interest of science.” WhileSeamans did not go so far as to say that all UFO reports had been explained, hecame very close:> As a result of investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of> Project Blue Book are: (1) No UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the> air force has ever given any indication of being a threat to our national> security; (2) there has been no evidence submitted or discovered by the air> force that sightings categorized as “unidentified” represent technological> developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific> knowledge; and (3) there has been no evidence that sightings categorized as> “unidentified” are of extraterrestrial vehicles. Project Blue Book records were to be retired to the USAF Archives at Maxwell AFBin Alabama. In theory, adequate public access to the records would be providedby the Air Force Office of Information (SAFOI). In practice, it did not followautomatically that Blue Book files were freely open to the public. As late asthe mid-1970s, the files, while not classified, were kept in a building thatwas. As Vallee remarked, “the interesting result [was] that one need[ed] asecurity clearance in order to see these ‘unclassified’ papers.” (Incidentally,the files of the Condon Committee became similarly unavailable, apparentlylocked up by the University of Colorado, transferred to a private home, thenburned.) Eventually, the Blue Book files, minus the witness names, wereconsigned to the Modern Military Branch, Military Archives Division, NationalArchives, Washington, D.C.107 [index_split_262.html#filepos1572531]Ironically, in October 1969, NICAP acquired a copy of a chapter on UFOs used bythe USAF Academy which took the subject very seriously, and even said theproblem warranted extensive scientific study. Among its references were two ofKeyhoe’s books, as well as NICAP’s The UFO Evidence. Keyhoe and others werestunned. After the inevitable publicity, the air force shortened the chapter,removed all actual sighting descriptions, and more closely followed the partyline.108 [index_split_262.html#filepos1572811]Thus, the air force ended its public involvement with UFOs. In the future, itcontinued to find UFO reports of interest, just as other military andintelligence services did, but with vastly improved privacy. Meanwhile, citizenswishing to report a UFO sighting now had no place in the government to go.Previous estimates by both Hynek and the Colorado University project indicatedthat less than 10 percent of people witnessing a UFO ever filed a report withany organization, be it Blue Book, NICAP, APRO, or elsewhere. Henceforth, thatnumber plummeted even further."},{"pageContent":"THE END OF NICAP The real demise of NICAP came on December 3, 1969, when the board of governors,meeting for the first time since 1960, demanded Donald Keyhoe’s resignation.Keyhoe did so, under protest. He was seventy-two years old. Leading the effortwas Col. Joseph Bryan, board chairman and former chief of the CIA psychologicalwarfare staff. Bryan also dismissed NICAP stalwart and assistant director,Gordon Lore, Jr., replacing him with G. Stuart Nixon, who then became actingdirector. Although Bryan had initiated the meeting, and had written anddistributed a memo calling Keyhoe inept, he later denied that he had anything todo with the ouster. However, UFO researcher Todd Zechel pointed out some historyregarding Colonel Bryan. In late 1959, for example, Colonel Bryan, ostensibly anair force officer, approached Keyhoe, asking to see some of his “really hotcases.” Keyhoe suspected an air force plot to infiltrate NICAP, and resisted.Soon, however, Bryan put Keyhoe at ease with several public comments regardingthe interplanetary nature of UFOs and criticisms of government UFO secrecy.Before long, Bryan was a member of the NICAP board. Although he denied anyassociation to the agency while on NICAP, he finally admitted to it in 1977. Hehad withheld this knowledge, Bryan said, because “it might embarrass CIA.”A new leadership took over at NICAP following Keyhoe’s ouster. John L. Acuff, anoutsider to NICAP and not a UFO researcher, was suddenly elected to serve onNICAP’s board. In May 1970, he became the new director. For some time, Acuff hadbeen executive director of the Washington-based Society of PhotographicScientists and Engineers (SPSE). SPSE had already cooperated with NICAPinformally in the area of photographic analysis. It was later discovered thatSPSE had significant intelligence connections: many members were photo analystswithin the various intelligence components of the Department of Defense and CIA.The group had also been the target of KGB espionage.Judged by Acuff’s management of NICAP, he was either wholly inept or else hedeliberately sought to sabotage the organization. Assisted by G. Stuart Nixon,he implemented a wholesale reorganization that ended the long-standing existenceof NICAP affiliates throughout the country, groups that had vigorously promotedNICAP for years. He ended the UFO subcommittee system organized by Keyhoe, Hall,and Gordon Lore that existed at the state level. Regional members were told tooperate independently from one another and were discouraged from communicationand cooperation. Acuff declared all regional UFO data to be NICAP proprietaryknowledge, which could not be disseminated without the approval of NICAPheadquarters. Criticism of the government’s UFO policy was no longer permitted,and NICAP turned into a mere “sighting collection center.” The UFO Investigatorbecame a four-page newsletter.G. Stuart Nixon was also in regular communication with CIA agents. Zechelmentioned an undated CIA document, probably from 1970, written by an unnamedperson within the agency, which indicated a familiarity with G. Stuart Nixon.NICAP daily activity logs from the late 1960s and early 1970s reflected thatNixon frequently met with CIA personnel such as Art Lundahl, director of NPIC;Fred Durant, author of the Robertson Panel report and a former CIA Office ofScientific Intelligence missile expert; and Dr. Charles Sheldon, a consultant tothe agency later with the Library of Congress. Another person Nixon was meetingwith frequently in 1968 was John L. Acuff. Oddly, none of the NICAP logsreflected any conversations between Nixon and Colonel Bryan, either by phone orin person, although almost every other daily occurrence was denoted in the logs.When questioned about this, Nixon refused comment.Keyhoe supporters, meanwhile, were pressured to quit. Raymond Fowler, chairmanof the NICAP Massachusetts Investigating Subcommittee, found his positioneliminated soon after Acuff’s appointment, and he became a regionalinvestigator. Other subcommittee investigators lost their investigator statusaltogether. In 1971, Fowler’s Massachusetts crew resigned en masse from NICAP,most joining MUFON which, as Fowler put it, “oddly enough, first appeared in thefortuitous year of 1969.” The organization, formed as the Midwest (later Mutual)UFO Network, was founded by Walter Andrus, a Motorola executive and former APROmember. The Lorenzens were furious, but MUFON quickly became a successfulorganization, bringing in members from APRO as well as NICAPAcuff served as director until 1978. His successors, too, all had CIAconnections, some tenuous, some strong. By then, serious management problemsalready caused the demise of NICAP. Even by 1973, its files were taken over bythe newly formed Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Evanston, Illinois. CUFOS wasformed by J. Allen Hynek, late of the defunct Blue Book program. It isreasonable to assume that copies of anything of interest also found their way toLangley.109 [index_split_262.html#filepos1572992]"},{"pageContent":"THE END OF UFOS The “definitive” explanation of UFOs coincided with a downturn of UFO reports.For the next two or three years, very little activity was reported worldwide. Abit in Australia and Brazil during 1969, some in Malaysia in 1970, and littleanywhere in 1971.110 [index_split_262.html#filepos1573221]One of the better-known UFO sightings of 1969 was the Jimmy Carter sighting ofJanuary 6. Carter, along with ten residents of Leary, Georgia, was waiting for aLions Club meeting to start when all noticed an unusually bright light at aboutthirty degrees elevation in the western sky between 7:15 and 7:30 PM. Carterrecalled later that it appeared slightly smaller than the apparent size of themoon. In his words, it “came close, moved away, came close, then moved away.” Heestimated its distance to be between three hundred and one thousand yards. Theonly analysis of the incident was offered by debunker Robert Sheaffer, whoestablished the presence of Venus in that part of the sky. To which one answers:so? Carter himself later attributed the sighting to an “electrical occurrence ofsome sort.”111 [index_split_262.html#filepos1573362]There were a few fairly well-researched UFO sightings that year which appearedto leave physical effects. Early in the day on June 17, 1969, in the Braziliantown of Ibiuna, several people saw a “brilliantly illuminated window” hoveringabove the ground. It appeared to be about thirty feet in diameter, ten feethigh, and illuminated a small part of the ground. The sighting lasted forforty-five minutes, the object appearing to be stationary all the time. It thenvanished. Later examination of the ground underneath showed a circle offlattened grass, twenty-five feet in diameter, swirled counterclockwise, withsome small “secondary” swirls. 112 [index_split_262.html#filepos1573502]On July 5, two children in the rural town of Anolaima, Colombia, saw a glowingobject about three hundred yards away. It came to within sixty yards, when theyran over the hill to tell others. Thirteen people, including their father,returned to see the object. This man, Arcesio Bermudez, took a flashlight withhim and returned in terror, claiming to have seen a small person and a craftthat lit up and flew away. Within two days, Bermudez lost all appetite, his skintemperature dropped, blue spots appeared on his skin, and his stools becamebloody. Within a week, two Bogota physicians, unaware of his UFO experience,concluded he had gastroenteritis. Within hours of his exam, Bermudez died. Hisdoctor claimed he had previously been in good health.“113[index_split_262.html#filepos1573684]The following week, July 12, in Van Horn, Iowa, a mysterious circular patch ofshriveled soybean crop was discovered. It was 425 feet wide and slightlyelongated. Intense heat or radiation was attributed as the cause. During thefall, two women near Kansas City claimed to see a craft descend close to theground, then to hear sounds of an animal being slaughtered as the object tookoff.“114 [index_split_262.html#filepos1573824]On September 4, 1969, a forty-foot diameter circle was found in some scrublandin Hamilton, New Zealand. Within the circle, vegetation was dehydrated andradioactive; three deep depressions, about ten feet apart, formed a triangle inthe circle’s center. Vegetation remained healthy outside the circle. Ahorticultural consultant said it appeared some object had landed on that spotand had taken off, emitting a short-wave, high-frequency radiation that cookedthe plants from the inside out. “I know of no earthbound source of energy,” heconcluded, “capable of creating a circle in this manner.” Nuclear scientistsbrought in by the New Zealand government, however, attributed the cause to “rootrot and blight.”115 [index_split_262.html#filepos1573997]In the public realm, nothing was heard about these incidents. The UFO was a deadissue, solved by the University of Colorado. Blue Book, even before its officialdemise, had ceased to take reports. NICAP and APRO were both in disarray. In alllikelihood, there were more sightings out there, more accounts to relate, but noone was talking, and no one listening. By the end of 1969, estimated JacquesVallee, perhaps twenty thousand or so fairly clear and dated UFO reports existedin official and private files. There appeared little hope, however, that thesescattered files would ever find their way to an organization that would seek todo anything with them.116 [index_split_262.html#filepos1574152]"},{"pageContent":"THE FINAL GASP December 1969 surely was an important month in the history of UFOs. Blue Bookended, Keyhoe was fired, and the American Association for the Advancement ofScience, impressed by Hynek’s and McDonald’s attacks on the Condon Report, helda symposium on UFOs at its annual meeting in Boston on December 26. Two of themain forces behind this were Carl Sagan and Thornton Page, former member of the1953 Robertson Panel, and the chairman of the astronomy section of the AAAS.While neither man was a UFO “believer,” Page at least felt more open-mindedabout the subject than in past years. Edward U. Condon, a former AAAS president,strenuously opposed the idea and received backing from several members. Condonwent so far as to attempt to enlist the support of Vice President Spiro Agnew.The obvious likelihood was that the report would be criticized somehow.Actually, the AAAS board had approved this symposium for the previous year’smeeting in Dallas, but postponed it, partly because of the opposition, partlybecause the Condon Report had yet to be published.As he had been everywhere he went for the past few years, James McDonald was themost dominant and noteworthy force to reckon with and made the most lastingimpression on the event. He knew this was a last-ditch effort to get UFOs on thescientific agenda. “I am enough of a realist,” he said, “to sense that, unlessthis AAAS symposium succeeds in making the scientific community aware of theseriousness of the UFO problem, little response to any call for newinvestigation is likely to appear.” Rising to the occasion, McDonald presented abrilliant paper. Titled “Science in Default: Twenty-two Years of Inadequate UFOInvestigations,” it is perhaps the most damning statement about UFO researchever made. Speaking before the convention at Boston’s Sheraton Plaza Hotel,McDonald came down hard on everyone: Condon, Menzel, Hynek, and finally thescientific establishment itself. He said:> No scientifically adequate investigation of the UFO problem has been carried> out during the entire twenty-two years that have now passed since the first> extensive wave of sightings of unidentified aerial objects in the summer of> 1947.... In my opinion, the UFO problem, far from being the nonsense problem> that it has often been labeled by many scientists, constitutes a problem of> extraordinary scientific interest. The grave difficulty with essentially all> past UFO studies has been that they were either devoid of any substantial> scientific content, or else have lost their way amidst the relatively large> noise content that tends to obscure the real signal in the UFO reports. He criticized mainstream scientists for complacency in not recognizing the“signal” from the “noise” in UFO reports and expressed dismay over the probablebleak future of UFO research in the aftermath of the Condon Report. McDonaldalso went after Project Blue Book and J. Allen Hynek:> The assurances that substantial scientific competence was involved in air> force UFO investigations have, I submit, had seriously deleterious scientific> effects.... My own extensive checks have revealed so slight a total amount of> scientific competence in two decades of air force-supported investigations> that I can only regard the repeated assertions of solid scientific study of> the UFO problem as the single most serious obstacle that the air force has put> in the way of progress towards elucidation of the matter. Projects Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book had conducted “scientifically meaninglessinvestigations.” The UFO panels and studies commissioned by the air force hadall brought “almost negligible scientific scrutiny into the picture.” This was adirect hit at the Robertson Panel, and thus Thornton Page, who sat listening.The Condon Report was “quite inadequate,” padded with fluff, but unable to hidethe fact that it studied only “a tiny fraction” of the truly difficult UFOreports. Its level of argumentation, said McDonald, was “wholly unsatisfactory.”He added:> Furthermore, of the roughly ninety cases that it specifically confronts, over> thirty are conceded to be unexplained. With so large a fraction of unexplained> cases ... it is far from clear how Dr. Condon felt justified in concluding> that the study indicated “that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot> be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.” Finally, the National Academy of Sciences came under McDonald’s censure :> That a panel of the National Academy of Sciences could endorse this study is> to me disturbing. I find no evidence that the academy panel did any> independent checking of its own; and none of that eleven-man panel had any> significant prior investigative experience in this area, to my knowledge. There was no one else like James McDonald. He was a first-rate scientist, on amission, afraid of nothing, able to say precisely what he meant. But McDonald byhimself could not turn the situation around, and he knew it. One suspects he wasspeaking to posterity. While his passion may have impressed, it failed topersuade. Sagan rejected the extraterrestrial hypothesis, much as Condon had, apriori. Others felt likewise. Menzel, who could not attend due to heartproblems, submitted a paper describing UFOs as a modern myth. It is true thatthe majority of participants urged Air Force Secretary Seamans not to destroyBlue Book’s files, but few would take on the imposing figure of Edward U.Condon, not to mention the entire mainstream scientific establishment. In fact,a few weeks later, Menzel wrote to Page that he favored impounding the files forten years and keeping them off limits to the likes of Hynek and McDonald.117[index_split_262.html#filepos1574293]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY The UFO problem reached its climax and resolution between 1966 and 1969. Whathad begun as a situation where anything seemed possible, in which flying saucerreports deluged the globe, ended with the sound of a door slamming shut. The airforce, at the nadir of its credibility on the UFO issue in 1966, rode tall withthe sanction of official science in 1969. The University of Colorado study onUFOs was riddled with dissension and saddled with bad publicity; it produced areport that, for all its bulk, was remarkably skimpy where it mattered. Itsconclusion did not coincide, even remotely, with its own data. But none of thatmattered—a telling statement on the state of mainstream science, and a lesson inhow to ride that capricious horse known as the public. It also surely helpedthat UFO reports dropped, as if off a table.The air force and the CIA had finally gotten what they had wanted for so long.Whatever UFOs represented to them, they could work on the situation henceforthin relative isolation from the prying eyes of the public. For, contrary to whatBolender claimed, UFOs were much more than an administrative burden. Theycontinued to represent, and be, a real burden. The mere publication of a weaklysupported scientific refutation could hardly be expected to change the judgmentsof those within the intelligence community, whether they be anonymous authorswithin the NSA, the strike team members at Minot AFB who saw a hovering UFO overtheir launch facility, or famous scientists such as Paul Santorini. Theexplanations passed off to the public were not congruent with the situation theclassified world continued to deal with.Winners need losers, and by 1969 NICAP had lost in a big way. For all of DonaldKeyhoe’s faults, he had been NICAP’s driving force, the major who led thecharge. His ouster loosened the organization from its mooring, and it sooncrashed into the rocks. It may be that there was little Keyhoe could have doneto save NICAP had he continued at its helm. The future looked bleak from anyvantage point. But, old man that he was, Keyhoe remained its best hope. Withouthim, instead of going down fighting, NICAP committed suicide—perhaps, with theCIA in mind, we should say, committed assisted suicide.Did the public lose, as well? The answer depends on whether one believes truthto be of greater value than social stability. In 1968, Richard Nixon was electedpresident on a platform of law and order, amid a society with a disintegratingsocial consensus. Not everyone cared about truth at all cost; many just wantedto keep the machinery moving. At the front of the line, as it is in all placesand all eras, was the national security apparatus, which saw the maintenance ofstability and the status quo as its preeminent goal. Viewed from thisperspective, at once paternalistic and self-serving, one might say the publicinterest was served. With the issue of UFOs at rest, the country, and perhapsthe world, could move on to other pressing items.There remains the small matter of truth, however. The problem with truth is thatit ever remains the uninvited guest who crashes the party. Even in disgrace,truth is hard to get rid of. With the wrong conclusion coming from the ColoradoUniversity project—and it was the wrong conclusion—a new era of deception aboutUFOs had begun, one with the sanction of science. Inevitably, truth would pop upagain—never without a challenge, of course, but there all the same. Within sucha context, in the face of official denials about UFOs, truth could only erodethe public’s confidence in its leaders. It may be hard for later generations toappreciate the faith placed by those of an earlier time in their government, intheir country. The death, long ago, of this faith testifies to the dangerouspower of truth, not simply in relation to UFOs, of course, but to all activitiesof the national security state, including UFOs."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 9 The Problem Renewed: 1970 to 1973 > To condemn a thing thus, dogmatically, as false and impossible, is to assume> the distinction of knowing the bounds and limits of God’s will and of the> power of our mother Nature....

The consensus around Nixon was that Hooverhad lost his guts and had to go. But Nixon was not the first president who hadtrouble firing J. Edgar Hoover.5 [index_split_263.html#filepos1575182]"},{"pageContent":"NIXON One of Nixon’s most persistent goals was the reorganization of the intelligencecommunity, an immense undertaking. The most famous result of his efforts was theHuston Plan, named after Tom Huston, his point man on the project. At the June1970 meeting in the Oval Office, all the main players attended: Haldeman,Ehrlichmann, Huston, and intelligence chiefs Hoover (FBI), Helms (CIA), Adm.Noel Gaylor (NSA), and Lt. Gen. Donald Bennett (DIA). Nixon made it clear hewanted a major effort against domestic dissidents. The group was chaired byHoover and named the Inter Agency Committee on Intelligence (ICI). Even theformidable presence of the now-cautious Hoover, however, could not prevent itsfar-reaching recommendations: expanded mail openings, resumption of illegalentries and “black bag” jobs, electronic surveillance of Americans andforeigners within the U.S., an increase in the number of “campus sources,” andexpansion of the army’s counterintelligence mission.Nixon endorsed the plan in mid-July but would not sign it, nor would Haldemanand Ehrlichmann. Who, then, at the White House, put his name to this dramaticauthorization? Why, Nixon’s young staffer, Tom Huston. Hoover easily torpedoedthe plan on July 23, when he announced that he would certainly go along, just assoon as he received written authorization from the president for all thesebreak-ins and wiretaps. Thus, the plan to “institutionalize burglary aspresidential policy” (the words are those of David Wise) failed. In practice, itmade little difference, as these agencies were already engaging in many of thepractices for which they sought approval. They did not cease simply becauseofficial sanction was not forthcoming. In some cases, they even expanded theiractivities.6 [index_split_263.html#filepos1575360]The first cracks in the facade appeared in 1971. With intelligence communitybreak-ins widespread, Hoover ended the Cointelpro program in April, not due toany recognition of impropriety but to fear of exposure. The bureau continued tobe aggressive against its Cointelpro targets but was less systematic. Hoover’sfears proved well justified, for in May 1971, burglars broke into the FBI FieldOffice at Media, Pennsylvania, escaping with about a thousand documents andexposing the FBI’s massive surveillance of blacks, students, radicals, and othermischievous groups. The word “Cointelpro” escaped into society.7[index_split_263.html#filepos1575570]Then, on June 13, 1971, the New York Times began publishing a series of highlysensitive documents known as the Pentagon Papers. These were a classifiedhistory of the Vietnam War, leaked by Daniel Ellsberg, whom the White Houseimmediately sought to smear and discredit. In September, a group ofCuban-Americans connected with the CIA, along with G. Gordon Liddy and E. HowardHunt, broke into the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist. These people wereRichard Nixon’s personal covert action squad, nicknamed the “plumbers group.” InApril 1972, it was almost certainly Nixon people who broke into the home of CBSWhite House correspondent Dan Rather.8 [index_split_263.html#filepos1575754]Also in April 1972, the residence of J. Edgar Hoover was broken into twice.According to Hoover biographer Anthony Summers, the second break-in allowed forthe placement of a poison (thiophosphate) into Hoover’s personal toiletarticles. The chemical is a compound used in insecticides, highly toxic if takenorally, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. It causes fatal heart seizure andis detectable only if an autopsy is performed within hours of death. J. EdgarHoover died between 2 A.M. and 3 A.M. on May 2, 1971. He received no autopsy,and the cause was ascribed to cardiac arrest, although Hoover’s doctor claimedhe had been in good health. That morning, about twenty government agentsmethodically ransacked Hoover’s residence, but Hoover’s secretary destroyedcountless files before anyone reached them. The official establishment lionizedand glorified Hoover, and twenty-five thousand people flocked to the Capitol topay homage to him. Nixon called him “a great force for good in our nationallife.” Privately, Nixon feared Hoover even in death. A year later, he spoke ofthe old Director as though he were still alive: “He’s got files on everybody,goddamnit!”9 [index_split_263.html#filepos1575918]Shortly after Hoover’s death, Nixon’s plumbers group burglarized the Chileanembassy in Washington. Then, on June 17, 1972, they were caught while breakinginto the Democratic National Committee in Washington’s Watergate OfficeBuilding. Many believe Watergate was just the tip of the ice-berg, since therehad been at least a hundred similar types of break-ins, all apparentlypolitically motivated, all unsolved, an unknown number of which were connectedto Nixon. At any rate, Nixon’s position seemed strong. It took some time beforethe FBI realized the break-in was not a CIA operation. Moreover, even after eyesturned toward the president, prosecutors appeared to be in his pocket.10[index_split_263.html#filepos1576068]"},{"pageContent":"THINGS FALL APART Nixon’s several failed attempts to reorganize the intelligence community showedthat he was no better than his predecessors at controlling this sprawlingoctopus. Dissatisfied with and mistrustful of Helms, Nixon fired him followinghis re-election to the presidency in November 1972. Helms now began two monthsof vigorous cleanup at the CIA, closing down such vulnerable programs asOperation Often. During his last days as DCI in January 1973, Helms orderedGottlieb, also on his way out, to destroy all files relating to MK-Ultra,MK-Search, and related endeavors in mind control. Among other things, Helms wasworried that the lawsuits of Ewen Cameron’s former patients could blaze a trailstraight to Langley. Inexplicably, Gottlieb failed to destroy about 130incriminating boxes in the archives. Had he destroyed these, MK-Ultra might haveremained unknown to this day. Meanwhile, the CIA was also working to prevent thepublication of an expose by former agent Victor Marchetti. HTLingual and theNSA’s Minaret programs also ended in 1973, the latter in order to preventexposure during the Weathermen Trial.11 [index_split_263.html#filepos1576259]In February 1973, immediately after Helms left the CIA, he was questioned by theSenate Foreign Relations Committee, subject to approval for an ambassadorialpost to Iran. (He was there, incidentally, during an amazing UFO sighting inTehran in 1976.) Helms was questioned by none other than Sen. Stuart Symington,the former air force secretary and enemy of James Forrestal. Symington askedHelms whether the CIA had tried to overthrow the government of Chile. “No, sir,”replied the ex-DCI, who also denied that the CIA had been involved in domesticintelligence activities. Seven months later, Salvador Allende died in aCIA-coordinated military coup.12 [index_split_263.html#filepos1576449]James Schlesinger, a CIA outsider, replaced Helms, then named William Colby ashead of clandestine services. At Colby’s urging, Schlesinger soon ordered CIAemployees to report all suspected violations of the law, or of the CIA’scharter, to the CIA’s Inspector General. The result was a 693-page report called“Potential Flap Activities,” known more commonly as The Family Jewels. Itdiscussed Operation Chaos, bits of MK-Ultra (although nothing significant),illegal domestic wiretaps and bugging, and so on. As amazing as theserevelations were, there is little doubt that much, much more never surfaced.Schlesinger fired about one thousand CIA officers, then left the agency in July1973 to take over at the Pentagon. Colby succeeded him as DCI, regarded as atraitor, possibly even a Soviet mole, by much of the old guard. Certainly JamesAngleton thought so, and Colby wasted no time in firing the CIA’s longtimecounterintelligence expert.13 [index_split_263.html#filepos1576615]Classified information spilled out throughout 1973. People learned that the FBIactually wiretapped reporters and White House officials. Former White Housestaffer John Dean squawked first about the burglary of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist’soffice, then about Nixon’s Enemies List. Nixon henchmen began to resign. Thenational security apparatus suddenly looked vulnerable, and the president mostof all.14 [index_split_263.html#filepos1576791]"},{"pageContent":"UFOS IN THE EARLY 1970S UFOs may have been old news in the early 1970s, but they had not gone awayaltogether. While there were few reports of strange craft, there wereinteresting reports of crop circles, as well as unexplained animal mutilations.Several cases described large, circular impressions within a grassy area, oftenafter a witness claimed to see a large craft descend in the field the nightbefore.15 [index_split_263.html#filepos1576970]Some landing reports were fairly well documented, such as the Delphos case ofNovember 2, 1971. At a farm near Delphos, in northern Kansas, a sixteen-year-oldboy, out with his dog in the evening, saw a mushroom-shaped object withmulticolored lights, hovering low over the ground about seventy-five feet away.It was about nine feet in diameter and sounded like “an old washing machine.”The young man became temporarily blind but regained his sight and called hisparents. All three saw the object high in the sky, about half the apparent sizeof the full moon. It then vanished. On the ground was a glowing ring, about afoot wide, and several trees glowed. A month later, UFO researcher Ted Phillipsinvestigated the site. He found the ring and noticed that the soil felt strange,“like a slick crust, as if the soil was crystalized.” UFO researcher MichaelSwords wrote that the soil was “hydrophobic [resistant to wetting], luminescent,and anaesthetic,” and could not attribute this to anything known. In the late1980s, Erol Faruk, a British chemist, wrote a series of articles about Delphos,concluding that the evidence pointed to an unconventional aerial object as “themost tenable explanation—despite its implications.”16[index_split_263.html#filepos1577124]In 1972, a man from Eganville, Ontario, took aerial photographs of perfectcircles burned into the grass at the time of UFO reports in the area, thenshowed his slides at an Experimental Aircraft Association meeting. Ten yearslater, the effects of the circles remained visible.Many crop circles were reported in South Australia, including the followingthree cases. In December 1971 at Tooligie Hill, a crop circle about ten feet indiameter was discovered in a wheat field. During the previous night, a localfarmer had seen a large ball of red light descending on the field where therings were found. In Bordertown in 1973, seven crop circles were discovered inan oat field, ranging in size from about eight feet to fifteen feet in diameter,all swirling counterclockwise. In December 1973, in Wokurna, South Australia,another crop circle was found in a wheat field, with counterclockwise swirls andbare soil patches.17 [index_split_263.html#filepos1577288]On June 28, 1973, a closely observed landing case was reported from Columbia,Missouri. At half past midnight, a man and his sixteen-year-old daughter lookedout the window of their home to see two bright, silvery-white light beams aboutfive feet apart and fifty feet away. The objects tapered to about two feet indiameter at the bottom. As the beams faded, a twelve- to fifteen-foot brightoval object appeared close to the ground, lighting up the area “as bright asday.” They heard a “thrashing sound,” and the trees swayed so much that a largelimb snapped off. As the father reached for his gun and called for help, the UFOmoved away to the north, passed beneath some tree limbs, rose, and hovered. Blueand orange bands of light were now visible on the surface of the craft. It movedsilently to its original position, but disappeared before police arrived at 1:45A.M. The police took a quick look, then left. Later searches uncovered brokentree limbs, damaged foliage, scorched leaves up to height of thirty-five feet,and impressions in the ground as deep as two feet.18[index_split_263.html#filepos1577446]Animal mutilations became widespread throughout the American West during the1970s, especially Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin.They also occurred in such eastern states as Pennsylvania and Florida. But thephenomenon was global, reaching Canada, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Brazil,parts of Europe, the Canary Islands, and Australia.As mutilations became common, cases arose which defied simple explanations.Frequently, the anal area of the animal was bored out and the reproductiveorgans removed. The cuts seemed to be precise, very smooth, and in a few cases,a near perfect circle of hide was removed from the belly. Often the eyes,tongue, ears, and reproductive organs were missing. Usually there were no signsof struggle, nor of blood—either in the victim’s body or anywhere at thesite—and predators often avoided the carcass. Even more strange, there werefrequently no tracks around the animal other than its own.Many mutilations appeared to coincide with sightings of nearby UFOs, as well asmysterious, unmarked, black helicopters. Inevitably, the UFO connectionsprompted claims that aliens were performing the mutilations, perhaps with afocus on the reproductive system. Skeptics claimed the mutilations were probablythe work of predators and perhaps cults. Still, several veterinarians could notdetermine what killed the animals, in some cases claiming the removal of organswas made by instruments that were not available to them. Other investigatorsdoubted that predators were capable of performing the precise incisions found onmutilated carcasses.Beyond question, the phenomenon of mutilated cattle was real. In Minnesota,twenty-two cases of mutilated cattle carcasses were reported between 1970 and1974. In Iowa, so many reports emerged that U.S. Attorney General Alan Donielsonasked the FBI in 1973 to make “an intensive investigation.” Between 1973 and1975, the state of Colorado confirmed more than 130 cattle mutilations. In thefollowing decades, there have been approximately ten thousand mutilationreports.The primary official study of mutilations, analogous to the Condon Report in itsstudy and conclusions, was undertaken by retired FBI agent Kenneth M. Rommel,Jr., for the state of New Mexico in 1979. Rommel concluded that “the vastmajority of mutilations are caused by predators and scavengers.” During thecourse of his study, unfortunately, reports of mutilations dropped off. Hepersonally investigated only fifteen cases and analyzed twelve more casesinvestigated by local law enforcement officials. Rommel declined to requeston-the-scene participation from the various experts he consulted with. Nor washe interested in the cause of death, per se, for any animal. If there wasevidence of scavenger activity, that was enough to move on. Rommel alsore-investigated, such as was possible, 117 “classic” mutilation cases that hadoccurred since 1975; each of these, he concluded, could be explainedconventionally. He quoted one physician who stated, that “surprising as it mayseem to the uninitiated, many of the scavengers make as clean a cut as might bedone by a surgeon....”Rommel’s report was thorough and sober, but inadequate to persuade many ranchersand some investigators. Alleged cases of mutilations, numbered in the manythousands, continued to appear. John Altshuler, who had examined Lady in 1967,later examined many such cases during the 1990s and found lesions “consistentwith electrosurgical excision.” Other researchers continued to find abnormallyhigh radiation levels near the dead animals.Some of the most active researchers believe not in aliens, but covert humanactivity, as the key to the mutilation mystery. The theory is that themutilations are occurring as part of a covert, random sampling of cattle to testfor excessive levels of radiation contamination. The area of northern NewMexico, which was the hotspot of mutilation activity during the 1990s, happensto be downwind from the nuclear test site in Nevada, possesses several activeuranium mines, was the scene of many nuclear detonations in past decades, andalso has two major nuclear research laboratories. Over the years, an estimated1,000 kilotons of radioactive dust fell on New Mexico, Nevada, and Colorado.Perhaps, in order to carry out necessary, albeit illegal, monitoring ofdangerous levels of radiation, a covert operation is behind the phenomenon. Asto the technologies required to undertake the job, they could be well withinhuman means. The air force possesses an in-house surgical laser probably able tomake the cuts described in so many cases of mutilated cattle. The device wasdeveloped by Phillips Laboratories, located in northern New Mexico, to conductmedical surgery in the field of battle.The mutilation mystery, like the UFO mystery, is real enough. Moreover, it, too,receives no official acknowledgment from authorities. The National Livestock andAgricultural Association, the New Mexico Livestock Board, and similar officialbodies deny the phenomenon exists at all. Whether the cause of the mysteryderives from UFOs, covert ops, or some other source, has yet to be determinedconclusively.19 [index_split_263.html#filepos1577610]"},{"pageContent":"AN UNDERWATER THESIS Neither the decline of UFO reports nor the results of the Condon Reportprevented UFO authors from continuing to publish their books. As in all fieldsat all times, much was disposable; other works were more valuable. One of themost intriguing, original, and intelligent of the books has also been among themost forgotten. In 1970, biologist Ivan Sanderson published his second and lastUFO book Invisible Residents. His subtitle, a charming archaism, read ADisquisition upon Certain Matters Maritime, and the Possibility of IntelligentLife under the Waters of This Earth. Sanderson obtained several degrees in thebiological sciences, taught zoology at Cambridge University, went into fieldwork on behalf of the British Museum and other such institutions, and mountednine expeditions to collect specimens.Sanderson developed an interest in UFOs during the 1950s, and even reported apersonal sighting to Project Blue Book (unexplained). He was also an ex-navyman, a fact of some significance, considering his thesis: that the UFO problemis not necessarily one dominated by the appearance of mysterious aerial objects.Indeed, the term unidentified flying object was misleading, he argued, as agreat deal of strange activity was going on beneath the waters. He offered theperhaps startling claim that, “by actual count, over 50 percent of all so-called‘sightings’ of UFOs have occurred over, coming from, going away over, orplunging into or coming out of water.” He not only described scores ofintriguing water-related UFO sightings, but offered the opinion that these neednot involve the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, but possibly anindigenous intelligence that evolved independently in the oceans. Or perhaps, hesuggested, there were many reasons why others arriving here might choose theoceans as more hospitable than dry land.To Sanderson the biologist, the idea of an indigenous, possibly ocean-based,intelligence behind UFOs was not really so outlandish as might seem to thoseuntrained in his field. The Earth itself has “more than enough ‘environment’available for the evolution of an almost endless variety of intelligentlife-forms.” To those who think smugly that it would be impossible for anintelligent life-form to have developed independently on this world without ourknowledge, Sanderson wrote:> We really know very little about our world or its environmental setup. What is> more, the world that we do know, or think we know, is extremely limited.... We> have only the vaguest notion of what lies more than a hundred feet under our> feet, on land, though geologists are doing pretty well, at least in general> terms, down to a few miles. We are fairly good under water down to about five> hundred feet around the periphery of the continental land masses and islands,> but we know practically nothing of the great body of ... “hydrospace,” which> includes all seas and oceans from the surfaces down to their bottoms. Moreover, “we know that the nature of living things on this planet alone rangesfrom man to ultra-filterable viruses that may produce inanimate generations. Sowhy should we balk at the suggestion that elsewhere it could range muchfurther?”Sanderson speculated that “aliens” operating UFOs could be artificiallyintelligent, or perhaps that even some of the machines among UFOs “might also be‘alive,’ having been constructed along biological rather than mechanicalprinciples.” Machines, he wrote, need not be made only of metal or ceramics. Maythey not be of “plastics and colloids; or colloids and gases; or even ...‘nonmaterial’ altogether?” Machines patterned on life-forms would always bebetter, more efficient, and more reliable than anything we can think up andconstruct with metal, nuts, and bolts. Such creatures could range from having avery high order of intelligence, to being a type of drone. Interestingly, in theearly 1990s, Manuel de Landa, a writer on artificial intelligence and warfare,argued that we were perhaps not far away from creating machines that would blurthe distinction between “real” and “artificial” intelligence.Sanderson’s collected evidence made it “painfully obvious” to him that, at thevery least, these intelligences were “either acting in consort or along parallellines of endeavor ... surveying and studying our planet and its life-forms.”Quite possibly, there are whole masses of aliens “either muscling in here orsharing in the enterprise.”Sanderson shopped his ideas and reports throughout U.S. Naval Intelligenceduring the late 1960s. Apparently visiting quite a few departments, he learnedthat most of the topmost individuals had not read any of the extraordinaryunderwater UFO reports he had come across. Most thought it was all nonsenseuntil he would make some remark that seemed to get through. The typical resultof his meetings, he said, was that officials begged him to send them the reportshe had collected.20 [index_split_263.html#filepos1577813]"},{"pageContent":"THE DEATH OF JAMES MCDONALD Following the disaster of 1968 and 1969, James McDonald and Allen Hynek tried tokeep the UFO issue alive. On January 21, 1970, the UFO Subcommittee of theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics sponsored a panel in New YorkCity, and Hynek, McDonald, Thornton Page, Gordon Thayer, and Philip Klassattended. The subcommittee, led by Joachim P. Kuettner, consisted of scientistswith no previous position on UFOs and reached several middle-of-the-roadconclusions. It criticized the NAS position that extraterrestrials were theleast likely explanation for UFOs and rejected McDonald’s position that it wasthe “least unsatisfactory.” The subcommittee determined there was no scientificbasis for assessing such probabilities. It criticized the Condon Report, whichretained a “small residue of well-documented but unexplainable cases which formthe hard core of the UFO controversy.” The Condon Report’s conclusions, said thesubcommittee, did not match its data. It recommended a moderate-level, ongoingscientific study of UFOs.21 [index_split_263.html#filepos1577976]Despite the appearance that UFOs were completely debunked, many people remainedskeptical of the official truth as handed down by Condon and the air force. InApril 1971, an engineering research magazine, Industrial Research, published theresults of a poll in which 80 percent of its members rejected the Condon Report;76 percent believed that the government was concealing UFO facts; 32 percentbelieved that UFOs were extraterrestrial. Poll or no poll, however, the CIAcontinued to lie about its UFO interests. An internal memo dated July 29, 1970,suggested a response to a U.S. citizen who had accused it of using the ColoradoUniversity Project and Robertson Panel to “whitewash” UFOs. The memo suggestedto say that “we have had no interest in the UFO matter for many years, have nofiles or persons knowledgeable on the subject....” 22[index_split_263.html#filepos1578127]The worst story of 1971 was the demise of James McDonald. As far as anyone couldtell, McDonald was fine all through 1970 and into 1971. On March 2, 1971, hetestified as an expert in atmospheric physics at the House Committee onAppropriations regarding the supersonic transport (SST) and its potentiallyharmful atmospheric effects. McDonald’s opponents questioned his credentials andridiculed him as someone who believed in “little men flying around the sky.”Laughter broke out several times.Shortly after this incident, McDonald shot himself in the head and became blind.He was committed to the psychiatric ward of the VA Medical Center in Tucson. InJune, he signed himself out. On Sunday morning, June 13, a woman in southTucson, identifying herself as a doctor, said a deranged blind man had taken acab to the area. She wanted to know where the driver had dropped him off, andshe made several calls. Meanwhile, a married couple and their children, walkingalong a shallow creek, found McDonald’s body under a bridge at 11:40 A.M. A .38caliber revolver was in the sand, near his head. A brief note attributed hissuicide to marriage and family problems.23 [index_split_263.html#filepos1578301]The reader who has made it this far, and through several unproven conspiracytheories will, it is hoped, endure one more. Did James McDonald commit suicide,or did he not? Most UFO researchers say that he did. Let us look at the otherpossibility. We know that many intelligence agencies were skilled in “creating”suicides. But, one might ask, wasn’t McDonald’s mental condition alreadydeteriorating? Jerome Clark stated that McDonald was ready to “crack” in theaftermath of the SST hearings. But what caused this? Embarrassment at the SSThearings? His marriage? Perhaps, one supposes, but both of these explanationsfeel flimsy. Without exception, those who knew McDonald described him aspossessing great integrity and courage. Was he really the type of person tocommit suicide? UFO researcher Val Germann wrote this about McDonald in anInternet essay:> Biographical Information: Dr. James E. McDonald (as of 1968]> Born: Duluth, Minnesota, May 7, 1920.> B.A., Chemistry, University of Omaha, 1942.> M.A., Meteorology, M.I.T., 1945.> Ph.D., Physics, Iowa State University, 1951.> U.S. Navy, Intelligence & Aerology, 1942-45.> Instructor, Physics, Iowa State University, 1946-49.> Assistant Professor, Physics, Iowa State University, 1950-53.> Research Physicist, Cloud Physics, University of Chicago, 1953-54.> Associate Professor, Physics, University of Arizona, 1954-56.> Full Professor, Physics, University of Arizona, 1956-57.> Senior Physicist, Institute of Atmospheric Studies, 1958-present.> Member, Weather Modification Panel, NAS, 1965-present.> Member, Navy Storm fury Advisory Panel, 1966-present.> Member, NSF Weather Modification Panel, 1967-present.> Member, AAAS, American Meteorological Society, Sigma Xi, American> Geophysical Society, American Society of University Professors.> Married, Six Children.> Yes, I would say this is a candidate for suicide, wouldn’t you? ... He was at> the top of his field by the late 1950s and... left no stone unturned once he> set his mind to a project. It has been said that genius is the capacity for> infinite pains, and by that standard James E. McDonald certainly qualified. Even if McDonald had been targeted by some dark force in the U.S. intelligencecommunity, one may ask, how could his “suicide” have been arranged, and why?After all, why fear McDonald when UFOs had become irrelevant? To answer thisquestion, we need to remember that, while UFOs were a nonissue within mainstreamculture, things were different in the classified world. There, it was understoodthat UFOs would not go away simply because of Edward U. Condon. Looking back, wecan see the early 1970s as a lull, not the end, of the UFO problem. Those on topof the problem at the time probably understood this. Therefore, James McDonald,only fifty-one years old, could well have been perceived as a nuisance, and evena threat.The how part was really no matter at all. By the early 1970s, there were alreadymeans available to alter the moods of unsuspecting persons. A pocket-sizedtransmitter generating electromagnetic (EM) energy at less than 100 milliwattscould do the job. This is no pie-in-the-sky theory. In 1972, Dr. Gordon J. F.McDonald testified before the House Subcommittee on Oceans and InternationalEnvironment on the issue of electromagnetic weapons used for mind control andmental disruption. He stated:> [T]he basic notion was to create, between the electrically charged ionosphere> in the higher part of the atmosphere and conducting layers of the surface of> the Earth, this neutral cavity, to create waves, electrical waves that would> be tuned to the brain waves.... About ten cycles per second.... You can> produce changes in behavioral patterns or in responses. The following year, Dr. Joseph C. Sharp, at Walter Reed Hospital, while in asoundproof room, was able to hear spoken words broadcast by “pulsed microwaveaudiogram.” These words were broadcast to him without any implanted electronictranslation device. Rather, they reached him by direct transmission to thebrain.24 [index_split_263.html#filepos1578463]Thus, we ask, could McDonald have been the victim of a program using technologysuch as described above? The answer is yes. Whether or not he was may never beanswered. Some will claim this account of McDonald’s death is little more thanconspiracy mongering. Not so. It is no better willfully to ignore suchunpleasant realities and pretend that McDonald died, unprovoked, of his ownhand—a practice that is the rule among UFO researchers today. No one is in aposition to state whether McDonald’s suicide was real or not. Both scenarios arepossible. It is an unsatisfying and all-too-common position, unfortunately,within the UFO field."},{"pageContent":"THE RETURN OF UFOS UFO reports of the early 1970s were sparse. Those that surfaced, however,continued to baffle. Puerto Rico was the scene of much reported UFO activitythroughout 1972, and several interesting cases came from Europe and SouthAfrica. On September 14, 1972, an unknown object was sighted at West Palm BeachInternational Airport. Two FAA air traffic controllers tracked the object, aswell as FAA operators at Miami International Airport and radar men at HomesteadAFB. It was seen through binoculars by an FAA supervisor at West Palm Beach. TwoF-106 interceptors were scrambled, and one pilot saw the glowing object, whichdisappeared as he closed. The story received only local coverage, and the airforce explained the object as the planet Venus. On January 11, 1973, a UFO wasfilmed in color for twenty seconds in Cuddington, Buckinghamshire, England.25[index_split_263.html#filepos1578613]In October 1973, an intense UFO wave hit the United States, coinciding with somecritical developments in the American and international scenes. On October 10,Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned from office. Ten days later, a spate ofresignations and firings spread through the Nixon administration. On thetwenty-fourth, U.S. nuclear forces, in response to Middle East war and possibleSoviet intervention, went on DEFCON 3 alert, the highest possible. Fifteenthousand troops of the 82nd Airborne Division were mobilized, and fifty B-52bombers were readied. In this context, UFOs made their reappearance in Americanskies.Most of the activity occurred in the southeastern U.S. On October 11, two menfishing in Pascagoula, Mississippi, claimed they had been abducted by horrificrobot-like creatures that floated out of a hovering UFO and brought them insidethe craft. Crazy as the story was, the men seemed sincere. On the seventeenth, aphotograph of a UFO “occupant” was taken in Falkville, Alabama, by a local chiefof police. A woman had reported a UFO landing to the police, and police chiefJeff Greenhaw investigated. He saw no craft, but on his way back noticed in hisheadlights a tall figure wearing a silvery suit and helmet. Greenhaw failed tocommunicate with it, then took four photos, two within ten feet. The figureturned and ran away, awkwardly but quickly. Most people dismissed the photos asa hoax, but Greenhaw stood by them, despite a ruined career. On the same nightas Greenhaw’s experience, a bedroom visitation and abduction was reported in theMidwest. It involved levitation, sophisticated instrumentation, a physiologicalexam on table, a human being working with aliens, and what was later termed the“mindscan” procedure.26 [index_split_263.html#filepos1578815]Perhaps the most amazing UFO report came the following night. Just after 11 P.M.on October 18, a U.S. Army reserve crew was flying a helicopter from Columbus toCleveland, Ohio. They included Capt. Lawrence Coyne (nineteen years flyingexperience), Lt. Arrigo Jezzi, Sgt. John Healey, and Sgt. Robert Yanacsek. At2,500 feet and good visibility, the crew noticed a red light to the west, slowlymoving south. They assumed it was probably an F-100 out of Mansfield. Veryabruptly, however, the light changed course and began to head right at them.Captain Coyne put the helicopter into emergency evasion in a controlled descent.When he tried to confirm the existence of a craft out of Mansfield, his UHF andVHF frequencies went dead (Mansfield later confirmed there were no aircraft inthe area). The red light continued to close, becoming brighter, while thehelicopter descended at the rapid speed of two thousand feet per minute.At 1,700 feet above the ground, the crew saw the object streak in front of, thenabove, the helicopter. It stopped dead for about ten seconds, filling the entirewindscreen. All four crew members saw it clearly: it looked like a gray cigarwith a small dome on top. One member thought he saw windows. The red light wasstill there, in the front of the object, and there was a white light on the sideand green one on the bottom. The green light swung around like a searchlight andshone into the cabin, bathing it in green light. The object then accelerated tothe west, soon appearing as nothing more than a white light. It made a sharpturn and moved northwest, where it was lost above Lake Erie.Meanwhile, the helicopter’s magnetic compass had been spinning at a rate of fourrevolutions per minute. More seriously, and for no clear reason, the altimetershowed an altitude of 3,500 feet and a climbing ascent of one thousand feet perminute. Yet the stick (for descent) still pointed down. Coyne had not attemptedto ascend, but his aircraft climbed to the dangerous altitude of 3,800 feetbefore he regained control. A few minutes later, radio frequencies returned. Acomplete inspection the next day found nothing wrong, and the event received athorough investigation.By itself, it was an amazing story. It was strengthened, however, by thepresence of ground witnesses. A woman, while driving with her four children,claimed to have seen the entire encounter, including the green beam, which shesaid lit the ground around her.Philip Klass said the crew misidentified a meteor or fireball and suggested theground witnesses were lying. Jerome Clark dismissed Klass’s theory as“fantastic,” since none of the testimony was even remotely consistent with it.“By any standard,” wrote Clark, “it is one of the most important UFO events everrecorded.” Agreed.27 [index_split_263.html#filepos1579039]To those willing to look at it, the wave of 1973 effectively refuted theconclusions of the Condon Report. Although it had more “high strangeness” casesthan most previous waves, they were reported by credible people. As odd as thecases were, they could not easily be dismissed. Of course, committed skepticssuch as Condon remained steadfast. On October 21, he debunked the currentsightings to the press and declared his own study of UFOs “was a waste ofgovernment money.” For the public, however, five years after Condon’s study wassupposed to have ended fascination with UFOs, such was not the case. A November1973 Gallup poll revealed that 51 percent of Americans believed UFOs were“real,” as opposed to 27 percent who thought they were “imaginary.” Morestartling still, 11 percent claimed to have seen one (the 1966 figure was 5percent), translating roughly into the astonishing total of 15 million people.Around this time, it was found that only one out of every twelve “technicallytrained” UFO witnesses had notified the air force of their sighting—presumablythis was while Blue Book was still active. In other words, the UFO phenomenonwas many times greater than the official numbers suggested. That much hadremained constant since the 1940s.28 [index_split_263.html#filepos1579226]"},{"pageContent":"SUMMARY In 1969, and into the early 1970s, the American national security state was atits most expansive. This belied a losing effort in Southeast Asia. But while theVietnam front was being lost and domestic dissent remained widespread, the UFOfront appeared to be won. Flying saucers were relegated to a remote corner ofcold war history as a curiosity in cultural paranoia and mass hysteria.The UFO phenomenon, however, did not go away after the Condon Report debunkedit. Odd, unexplained, and even fantastic events continued to be reported bysober, reliable people. Although the intense media fixation of 1940s or 1960swas no longer the rule in the 1970s, evidence for the reality of UFOs assomething extraordinary, and even alien, did not escape the public.Nor, it appears, the classified world. JANAP-146 and CIRVIS remained in effect,for example, indicating that UFO reports were still being routed through thosechannels. Moreover, journalist Howard Blum noted that since 1972, the NSA hadbeen “secretly monitoring and often assessing worldwide allegations of UFOactivity.” It was mandatory, Blum wrote, to “Flash-report” Fort Meade on allintercepted flying objects; “and these installations are required to track andFlash-report on any signals or electronics intelligence that might have anextraterrestrial origin.” In February 1974, the French Defense Minister, RobertGalley, confirmed in a radio interview that his department was very interestedin UFO reports and “that it had been interested since the great wave of1954....” His department’s records contained “some baffling radar/visualincidents.” The UFO phenomenon was global, Galley said, and he expressed hisconviction that “we must regard these phenomena with an attitude of completelyopen mind.... It is undeniable that there are facts that are unexplained orbadly explained.”29 [index_split_263.html#filepos1579451]The great advantage to UFO secrecy henceforth was the official deniability thatthe military now possessed. Previously, those who disbelieved air force denialsabout UFOs always replied with the unanswerable question: then why investigateUFO reports through Project Blue Book? Now, however, the air force no longerofficially investigated UFOs. With Blue Book gone, the last link to officialsanction was removed from the UFO problem, and it was taken in toto to where thenational security elite had always wanted it to be: deep within the classifiedworld."},{"pageContent":"Conclusion > Our acceptance of any new concept always seems to pass through three phases:> At first, it is declared impossible.

But finally, everybody says> blandly, “We knew it all the time.”—Arthur Schopenhauer From the 1940s to the 1970s, military personnel from the United States and manyother nations encountered unidentified flying objects, visually and on radar,sometimes at close range. These instances happened not scores of times, buthundreds of times, perhaps even thousands. Sometimes the encounter was nothingmore than a solid radar return of an object moving at an incomprehensible speed,performing impossible maneuvers. Sometimes it included the violation ofsensitive airspace. Often it involved the dispatch of one or more jets tointercept the object. At times, crew members claimed to see a metallic,disc-like object, sometimes with portholes, sometimes with lights, frequentlyengaged in what appeared to be intelligent, evasive maneuvers. In a very fewcases, it involved the crash and military retrieval of a UFO. In a few others,it involved injury and even death to military personnel. In the large majorityof instances recorded in this book, military personnel who encountered UFOs wereadamant that they did not see a natural phenomenon.This is clearly a serious development, and it was treated as such by thosegroups we may call the national security state. The CIA, NSA, and all branchesof military intelligence received UFO reports and discussed the matter assomething of serious concern. There is also evidence, provided by former BlueBook chief Edward Ruppelt, of an “Above Top Secret” group with access to all UFOdata, a group that straddled the worlds of government, military, and industry.At the same time, the military created the fiction, for public consumption only,that the UFO problem was nothing to be concerned about—certainly not the resultof little green men. Aided by a heavy-handed official media and culture, ittried to convince the public that the air force’s Project Blue Book was theappropriate tool for looking into this purely academic concern. Blue Book wasfundamentally a public relations tool, not an investigative body. Throughout itsexistence, it was under orders to debunk. After 1953, the public had no ideathat the best UFO cases usually went elsewhere.I have tried to show that the cover-up of UFO information is nothing unique. Astate capable of conducting terminal mind-control experiments, biologicalspraying of American cities, illegal mail and cable interceptions, nationwidedomestic surveillance by its military, human plutonium and syphilis injections,sundry coups and assassinations, ongoing media manipulation and flat-out publiclying on a continual basis, would surely be capable of lying about UFOs, too.Indeed, it was the very institutions involved in such unsavory and subterraneanactivities that were most interested in maintaining UFO secrecy.What could they have been so concerned about? As everyone likes to ask, why thesecrecy? Surely, if the military truly believed what it said for years aboutUFOs—that they are usually misidentifications of natural phenomena—it wouldhardly be interested in the problem. But that is not the case. As we have seen,objects have violated restricted airspace, and objects were seen by thousands ofwitnesses.The core of the UFO problem comes down to two possible answers. Both arestartling, and both difficult to accept, in their own way. The first possibilityis that UFOs are the product of a revolutionary, human, technologicalbreakthrough. Such rumors have existed for a long time, several of which eventrace the development to Hitler’s Germany. Without denying the sophistication ofthe German scientific establishment, such a claim cannot shake the aura ofabsurdity. The Germans, acknowledged by all to have done the most advanced workduring the war in the field of aerodynamics, barely figured out how to reachEngland with their V-2 rockets. A breakthrough to create flying saucertechnology would have involved much more than propulsion technology, materials,and aerodynamics. It would have meant the creation of a viable antigravity craftwith nearly unlimited maneuverability and speed. There has never been theslightest shred of evidence, either in the realm of fact or common sense, thatpoints to a German flying saucer.Could flying saucers have been invented after the war by the Americans, orpossibly someone else? As we have seen, this was a distinct possibility mulledover by various groups in the early years. During the wave of 1947, severalclassified documents expressed the belief that the objects were a secretAmerican, or possibly Soviet, technology. Following the Schulgen memo of late1947, American military intelligence seriously investigated the Soviet angle andcame up empty. The group assigned to the problem in 1948, Project Sign, rejectedboth explanations. If Soviet, why fly these things over the American heartland?If American, why fly them over cities, where everyone could see them, or oversensitive installations, where they were harassed by our own aircraft? Add ontop of this the amazing production levels that would have been necessary to flyso many of these objects, which were seen all over the world. After all, even ifone discounts the Foo Fighters of World War Two, what about the sightings overScandinavia and the rest of Europe in 1946? Were these the result ofrevolutionary American or Soviet technology?Looking back from some distance, we can see that the problems of creating aflying saucer were no easier for the Americans or Soviets than they had been forthe Germans. Such a breakthrough, so soon after the war, makes no sense.Moreover, it is supported by no evidence. Indeed, even as late as the mid-1950s,research into the creation of artificial gravitational fields, based onelectromagnetic principles, was in its infancy. By then, UFOs had been part ofthe public scenery for a decade. What type of classified project could have beenresponsible for those sightings?It is this very issue that makes a study of the early period of UFOs soimportant. Few people doubt that twenty-first-century aviation technology iscapable of awesome feats, some of which might be able to produce “flyingsaucers.” The point is, was such a technology in existence at the mid-twentiethcentury? All indicators point to a definitive no.That brings us to the second possibility: that UFOs are the product of an alientechnology. Without devising a priori arguments, let us simply look at theevidence, both historical and technological.First, the phenomenon has always produced believers among those who havebothered to investigate it. For decades, every official study of UFOs followedthe same pattern: extended analysis of the data persuaded researchers thataliens were the most likely explanation, a conclusion that was inimical to thosein charge of the study. As early as 1948, Project Sign concluded that flyingsaucers were probably extraterrestrial. After the UFO project atWright-Patterson AFB was revitalized in 1952, matters again reached the criticalpoint, and most project members favored an extraterrestrial solution. This, too,ended in failure and dispersion. After 1966, when the air force carefullyselected a university to solve the problem once and for all, a near massresignation ensued, and UFO believers were fired midway through the project.Within the military, as this study shows, believers in the ET thesis seem tohave been widespread, but almost never discussed their views openly. The samecan be said for the world of science, at least among those scientists who tookthe time to familiarize themselves with the problem. Aviation legends HermannOberth and William Lear both stated unequivocally their belief that UFOs wereextraterrestrial. Navy hero Adm. Delmar Fahrney concurred, and former CIADirector Roscoe Hillenkoetter all but stated this. Air Force General NathanTwining acknowledged in a classified document that the objects were “real, notvisionary or fictitious.”There is no lack of important personages who attested to the reality of the UFOphenomenon, nor of the belief that aliens were behind it. But what else isthere? Unfortunately, there is no authorized piece of a UFO craft to analyze,although several ought to exist. We know, for example, that objects wererecovered as early as 1946, during the Swedish Ghost Rocket wave. Something mustalso have been recovered near Las Vegas in 1962, most likely at Roswell in 1947,and several other places over the years. None of these pieces are available,however, for obvious reasons.What remains is photographic evidence, radar/visual evidence, and an enormousmass of witness testimony. Bearing in mind that UFOs are objects, they must beexplained. Unless one is Philip Klass, how does one explain theBentwaters-Lakenheath radar/visual encounter of 1956, in which a British fighterwas followed by a UFO, seen visually, and tracked on multiple radars? A UFOwhich, incidentally, was tracked on reliable instrumentation to have traveled inexcess of 4,000 mph? How does one explain the McMinnville photographs of 1950?Or police officer Lonnie Zamora’s sighting of two aliens in Socorro, New Mexico,in 1964? Or the sighting of a flying saucer by U.S. Senator Richard Russell in1955? How on Earth to explain the bizarre wave of late 1954, when hundreds ofpeople from Britain to Iran claimed to see diminutive aliens with large headstaking soil samples, and who paralyzed them with beams of light?The easy thing to do with UFO evidence is to ignore it. Much harder is toconfront it, study it, and ask, “Just what does this mean?” If we look at theevidence with no prior positions, no expectations of what are the limits of thepossible—if we are purely empirical about the matter—then we can easily concludethat alien visitation is the most probable explanation. Others have found us, orour world, and continue to find this world of interest.Why should this be so difficult to understand? In fact, it is not. No one doubtsour own ability, perhaps soon, to find another planet somewhere that supportslife. Nor do most scientists doubt the existence of intelligent life elsewhere.Despite the supposedly impenetrable nature of interstellar space, there arepeople currently working on breakthroughs in propulsion technology, and even afew qualified scientists who believe that the speed of light may not be theultimate barrier.Could it be that others have already found us? I believe they have. How theyarrived, I do not know, but I can speculate that they may not be able simply towalk about on our planet’s surface and that they may have good reasons formaking themselves scarce. I can speculate that others might find the Earth’simmense resources and biodiversity to be of great value, something that, despitethe possibilities of life in this universe, may yet be special in importantways. These others, whatever they are, could well be genetically engineered, oreven to some extent artificially intelligent. They may not, after all, benatural biological organisms. Looking into the next fifty years of our ownfuture, it is not so difficult to imagine things in this way.Such are some of the possibilities and speculations inherent in the secondalternative, that of alien visitation.What is not speculation is the inability of civilian groups to get anywhere withthis issue. NICAP was, by far, the world’s most significant civilian UFOorganization. It had prominent and active members, connections to Congress andthe military, and a director who was determined to end UFO secrecy. The effortlasted a little more than ten years and failed. Perhaps, however, it is unfairto focus on the failures of NICAP. Although it fell short of its ultimategoal—government acknowledgment of the reality of UFOs-NICAP’s extended fight forUFO congressional hearings kept the issue alive for another day. Moreover,NICAP, along with other organizations such as APRO, developed the core ofserious UFO researchers who continued in their work for decades afterward.A few words about Donald Keyhoe are in order. There is no question that Keyhoewas the most important UFO researcher, ever. Only James McDonald came close, buteven McDonald’s impact fell short when compared to that of the Major. It is notsimply that Keyhoe wrote five books, along with various articles, about flyingsaucers and cover-ups. It is not simply that he was the driving force behind theworld’s most important civilian UFO organization. It is that Keyhoe, nearly byhimself, opened up the field of UFO research and made it possible for others tofollow. Consider the situation of the 1950s had there been no Donald Keyhoe. In1949, his article in True magazine not only brought the issue of flying saucersinto the public domain but introduced the idea of a military cover-up. His booksin 1950, 1953, 1955, 1960, and 1973 provided an enormous amount of information,much of which was either leaked or even declassified solely for his use. In1952, the year that UFOs seemingly engulfed America, Keyhoe was there, writingabout events and forcing out information. He described the outlines of theRobertson Panel within months of its occurrence.When Edward Ruppelt produced what some think is the best book ever on UFOs in1956, much of what he wrote followed the path that Keyhoe had laid out. It ishard to imagine Ruppelt even writing his book at all, had not Keyhoe alreadywritten three. Would the conservative Ruppelt have been the first to describethe military concern about UFOs if Keyhoe had not already done so? Unlikely. Tosome extent, it is even possible to imagine Ruppelt’s book as a kind ofcorrective, or even damage control, to the information that Keyhoe had placed inthe public domain. Had there been no Donald Keyhoe, the UFO problem would havetaken many more years, if ever, to reach a significant level of publicacknowledgment.Considering his importance to the field of UFO research, it is remarkable thatKeyhoe has become, in the years since his death, almost a forgotten entity. Hisbooks are long out of print, so the general public knows nothing of him. EvenUFO researchers, while giving him lip service as an important figure, almostnever footnote his books, which indicates that they probably do not read them.Indeed, several writers have criticized, and therefore dismissed, Keyhoe assensationalistic or gullible. As I mentioned at various points in this book,part of that had to do with Keyhoe’s style as a writer. The tone of his booksmade it appear that the tension around the UFO problem was such that the wallscould come down at any moment. But this is a forgivable fault, especiallyconsidering the culture of 1950s America, fraught with real cold war fears, anda legitimate concern about UFOs. It is the content of his books, however, thatmake him so important. It is not possible to do justice to the UFO problem ofthe 1950s and 1960s without a detailed study of Keyhoe, and yet this is what thevast majority of UFO writers have failed to do. The day will come when Keyhoe’sreputation is reestablished for what it ought to be: as the man who pried openthe UFO problem for the public and ended the military monopoly.Despite Keyhoe, of course, it is within the national security apparatus, and notamong civilians, where most of the pieces to this puzzle exist. UFOs havenational security implications, if for no other reason than that they haveinvolved the military personnel of many nations. The subject is thereforesubject to secrecy protocols, a situation that has existed for over fifty years,and is unlikely to end any time soon. During the period under review in thisvolume, the military struggled to submerge its involvement with the UFO problem.The existence of Project Blue Book until 1969, however, had prevented this frombeing complete, and NICAP used Blue Book, with some success, as a kind of wedgeto obtain more information. That wedge was gone after 1969, but for a period ofabout ten years (1975 to 1985), the Freedom of Information Act also provided aneffective tool to get at the UFO problem. Unfortunately, changes during theReagan era have since limited its usefulness, and the military dimension to theUFO problem remains locked away within the classified world.Some believe this is as it ought to be. Can the public really handle the truthabout aliens? If the presence of others constitutes a threat to humanity, forexample, what could the average person even do about it? There are those whobelieve that secrecy about UFOs is in the public’s best interest. Whatever thevalue of this sentiment—which I do not share—the “public interest” has neverbeen the main concern of those making the decisions. Ultimately, a nationalsecurity apparatus exists not to protect the public but itself. The attachmentof Americans to the fiction of a representative government, or—God forbid—ademocracy, has clouded their ability to see their society for what it is: anoligarchy that uses the forms of democracy to appease and distract the public.Whether or not this is the best solution to organizing millions of people into abody politic, it remains folly to imagine that an oligarchy is not concernedwith maintaining its position, to the exclusion of all else.If we accept the reality of an alien presence, as the UFO evidence suggests, wemust be willing to consider that presence as a threat. The record of militaryencounters with UFOs suggests that this is the case. Since the public iscompletely unprepared to meet this threat, one can only hope that those groupswhich have been dealing with it will act in the public interest. During theperiod under review in this study, those groups did not always work in thepublic interest when it came to other matters. There is little reason to believeit was, or is, any different regarding an alien presence.Since the 1970s, the subject of UFOs has become more complex. Encounters are aswidespread as ever, and even more plentiful than in the early years. At the sametime, UFOs have received a thoroughly schizophrenic cultural treatment. Withinpopular culture, UFOs and aliens possess a cache they never had during the coldwar. Yet, the bastions of “official culture”—academia, mainstream media,government, and the elements of national security—continue to ignore the subjector else treat it as a joke. One can plainly see that neither ABC Nightly Newsnor the American Historical Review deems the subject worthy of analysis.Among organizations studying UFOs, the situation is one of extreme division, farmore so than in the simple days of NICAP, APRO, and Blue Book. Throughout mostof the century’s last three decades, very little effort was expended by thelarger organizations either to end government UFO secrecy or, it appears, toreach the public with a coherent message. Instead, they have spent their effortssquirreling away huge amounts of data for ... who knows what end?In addition to these, there now exist organizations that serve in a kind ofprofessional debunking capacity. The military and intelligence communitycontinue to show myriad connections with UFO organizations, and severalinstances of UFO disinformation planted by intelligence personnel are known. Theresult has been three decades of fragmentation and perennial wheel-spinning. Howcan one make sense out of such confusion?One way is by remembering that UFOs have continued to intersect with themilitaries of the world. Unauthorized airspace violations by unknown vehiclescontinue to occur; attempted interceptions continue to take place; secrecyorders are as severe as ever. For all of our sophisticated, secret, technology(yet another element to the confusion), these objects do not appear to be underour control. Through the cultural static, that signal is clear.But that is the subject for another book."},{"pageContent":"Appendix TABLE OF MILITARY UFO ENCOUNTERS This table is by no means comprehensive. Most likely, it describes only a smallfraction of encounters between military personnel and UFOs, and only those thatappear in this book. It does not include the many additional UFO sightings thatwere investigated by military or intelligence personnel. The sharp drop-off inreported military encounters during the 1960s probably has as much to do withimproved control over the release of information as anything else.Sightings designated by an asterisk (*) indicate encounters by the military ofcountries other than the U.S. Of the 285 military encounters in this table, 244were American, 41 non-American. Of course, several of the sightings wereofficially explained, although many of the explanations were threadbare.Abbreviations: R/V—radar/visual cases; EM—electromagnetic effects; ASV—Air SpaceViolation.003 [images/00003.png] 004 [images/00004.jpg] 005 [images/00005.jpg] 006 [images/00006.jpg] 007 [images/00007.jpg] 008 [images/00008.jpg] 009 [images/00009.jpg] 010 [images/00010.jpg] 011 [images/00011.jpg] 012 [images/00012.jpg] 013 [images/00013.jpg] 014 [images/00014.jpg] 015 [images/00015.jpg] 016 [images/00016.jpg] 017 [images/00017.jpg] 018 [images/00018.jpg] 019 [images/00019.jpg] 020 [images/00020.jpg] 021 [images/00021.jpg] 022 [images/00022.png] "},{"pageContent":"Endnotes"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 1 [index_split_010.html#filepos65246] The Learning Channel 1996. 2 [index_split_010.html#filepos67516] U.S. Air Force Fact Sheet 95-03. 3 [index_split_012.html#filepos73770] Hall 1964, 44, 138; Keyhoe 1960, 255;1973, 40-44. 4 [index_split_015.html#filepos76531] See McCoy 1991, Dinges 1991, U.S. Senate1989, Mills 1986, and Cockburn and St. Clair 1998.
