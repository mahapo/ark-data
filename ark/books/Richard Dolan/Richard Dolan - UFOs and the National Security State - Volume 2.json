Moreover, it is afinely tuned and compelling account by a master storyteller.”– Edgar Mitchell, ScD, Apollo 14. “This book is essential reading for anyone with a serious interest in ufology.This 3 volume series is the nearest thing to an official history of the UFOphenomenon that we're ever likely to see. While this second volume is anauthoritative account, this is no dry history - in this gripping account, Dolancaptures the cases, the controversies and the characters, giving us thedefinitive position on one of the last great mysteries of our time.”– Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense, 1985-2006 “Historian Richard M. Dolan masterfully weaves 1973 to 1991 UFO reports with thewarp and woof of global geopolitical events to reveal how Abraham Lincoln'sgovernment \"of the people\" suffered a secret coup d’etat as the power ofinsiders with need-to-know access about UFOs and ETs grew in Black Agencies withBlack Budgets protected by classified executive orders that prevented Congress –the peoples' representatives – from even knowing what those Black Budgetsfinanced.”– Linda Moulton Howe, Emmy Award-winning Investigative Journalist “In a field of study and international concern as diverse as this one, Dolan has– for a second time – canvassed the most significant events clearly andaccurately.”– Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, NARCAP.org “There is no praise elevated enough and no commendation weighty enough toimpress upon the world how important this book is. This long-anticipated book isthe brilliant work of the formidable and incomparable Richard M. Dolan. It is amasterful follow-up to the previous book by Dolan that has become the verycornerstone for understanding the intricate issues surrounding the nationalsecurity state and extraterrestrial contact. For many decades the government hasworked to obfuscate the facts and history contained in these pages – thank you,Richard Dolan, for challenging “official truth” in such a comprehensive, clearand cogent way. This should be required reading for every sitting and formerPresident.”– Paul Davids, Executive Producer of Roswell, the Showtime Original Movie “Richard Dolan has braved an intellectual jungle too terrifying for academichistorians, vigorously slashed away at the cancerous undergrowth ofinstitutionalized deception, and emerged into the sunlight bearing aconsciousness-raising chronicle of our puzzling relationship with themysterious, non-human intellects who share our planet. Not for theintellectually timid – but indispensable for those wishing to view history withtheir eyes wide open.”– Terry Hansen, author, The Missing Times: News Media Complicity in the UFOCover-up “Richard Dolan accomplishes something extraordinary with the publication of thisbook. His meticulously documented narrative of UFO activity, awareness andconcern during this highly charged period in American and world history offersreaders an in-depth account of astonishing sweep and breadth. Layered withheretofore neglected political, financial and intrigue factors which beardirectly on this singularly important story, it is never less than methodical,fascinating and chilling. A huge undertaking and a major accomplishment with thepotential to make a real difference in the public’s perception of the reality,seriousness and implications of UFOs and the intelligences behind them.”– Peter Robbins, co-author of Left At East Gate: A First-Hand Account of theRendlesham Forest UFO Incident, Its Cover-up and Investigation “This is an important exposition of extremely crucial facts and realities thathave long been concealed and systematically lied about by clandestine and publicagencies. It has been said that, “Ye shall know the truth and the truth shallset you free.” So read on, gentle reader, and take a deep draught of documentedtruth to bolster and guide you on your path to freedom.”– Richard Sauder, Ph.D., author of Underground Bases and Tunnels: What is thegovernment trying to hide? “Richard Dolan’s UFOs and the National Security State V2 is a fundamental work,slated to become the preeminent UFO historical reference text. With anintellectually inviting style, Dolan records the generational 1973 -1991 accountof UFOs and extraterrestrial events. In doing so, he transforms our historicalbelief system, which in turn, transforms human consciousness towardexoconsciousness. The strength of his quantum perspective provides scientificvalidation of human consciousness engaging extraterrestrial phenomenon. Dolan’shistory hurls us beyond the bounds of 3D reality. His ufology is a strongaccount of who we are – where we came from, with whom we communicate, and whatwe are to be about as a space-faring civilization.”– Rebecca Hardcastle, Ph.D., author, Exoconsciousness: Your 21st Century Mind “Once again, Dolan’s perseverance and unwavering research result in an instantclassic for any and all interested in the continuing UFO phenomenon. In Volume I(covering the years 1941 to 1973), Dolan gave us a hint of his penchant forhistorical accuracy; Volume II leaves no room for doubt. Little-known cases,many of which have been totally ignored by “ufologists” are brought to life withstunning detail. Dolan is to be commended for his critical eye and dedication tohistorical truth.”– Ronald Regehr, Deputy Director of Research, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). “While studying the FBI UFO files and many other government documents, Irealized that by learning The History you find The Truth. Richard Dolan's newbook provides the history. Read it and decide for yourself what is the truth.”– Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., author, The UFO FBI Connection and Abduction in MyLife.

CharlesRoberts, Scott Santa, the late William Sherwood, and Vince White.My parents, Barbara Dolan-Rice and Richard T. Dolan, have never failed toencourage and support my research. No matter how many battles one fights, norhow many years that go by, the love and support of one’s parents is one oflife’s great blessings. And in this matter I have been truly blessed.The members of my immediate family, however, have borne the brunt of my researchdemands. In the course of preparing this book, I have watched my son, Michael,develop into a young man, my daughter, Elaine, into a young woman. In return,they have spent their formative years observing their father prepare “The Book.”Along the way, they have met many personal challenges and made more than a fewsacrifices. Their unwavering support for me in this project, through all theseyears, is a precious gift that I will cherish all my life. To my wife, Karyn, Imust say all this and more. Despite the many struggles and sacrifices thatliving with a writer such as myself have exacted, she has never faltered in herconstant support of me and this project. To her I owe my loving appreciation andheartfelt thanks.Notwithstanding the insights and guidance from a multitude of readers andresearchers who have supported this endeavor, all limitations of this book aremy responsibility alone. Foreword by Linda Moulton Howe As an American TV producer and investigative journalist since graduating fromStanford University with a Masters Degree in Communication, I have produced manyworks for TV, radio, books and Internet. My beat is science and the environment,which includes earth mysteries. Of all the subjects I’ve covered, there is onethat never goes away and never leaves the public’s curiosity. That isUnidentified Aerial Craft (UACs), also known as “celestial,” “interplanetary,”UFOBs in government documents since the 1940s. Extraordinary aerial lights,beams and vehicles that defy human understanding of physics have been reportedby pilots, policemen, military offices – even U. S. Presidents Jimmy Carter andRonald Reagan. Associated with the mysterious aerial lights, beams and craft areworldwide animal mutilations, human abductions, crop formations and governmentcover-ups about those phenomena.Beginning in the fall of 1979 as Director of Special Projects at the CBSaffiliate in Denver, Colorado, I tried to get to the bottom of the large andsmall animal mutilation mystery – that leaves carcasses dead with similarpatterns of bloodless excisions from body to body throughout the United States,Canada, and many other countries in both hemispheres. That’s when lawenforcement first told me off the record that the perpetrators were from outerspace, because officers had seen orange, glowing spheres make 90-degree angleturns at their police cars, dive straight down into the ground, rise back up andsplit into two, orange, glowing spheres. Deputy Sheriff Bill Waugh of Elizabeth,Colorado, told me, “Whenever we see those fiery orange balls show up, we know weare going to have animal mutilations.”Veterinarians knew they could not remove a 9-inch by 11-inch heart from a cowwithout making an excision in the chest and cutting through the pericardiumsurrounding the heart. But, the facts were that in some necropsies on mutilatedanimals where there was no chest excision, all heart tissue and blood had beenremoved from inside the pericardium membrane, which was still intact withoutcuts or tears. Impossible for the most modern human medical technologies. No vetor sheriff wanted to say that in front of microphones and cameras. So, theofficial explanations to the public and media were predators, disease, andsatanic cults. Thus, cover-ups about the truly strange physical evidence wereperpetuated by local law enforcement as well as the CIA, FBI, DIA, NSA, NRO, NSC– and beyond.I reported what I learned in a 2-hour TV special entitled A Strange Harvest,first broadcast in Denver and the surrounding region on May 28, 1980. Threeyears later on March 21, 1983, I was in New York City signing a contract withHome Box Office to produce a TV hour about UFOs: The E. T. Factor . That took mestraight into the labyrinth of American counterintelligence, which wanted tokeep me from producing the HBO special – and succeeded. Eventually, I wassternly told, “We’ve tried to make it clear to you – we don’t want UFOs andanimal mutilations connected together in the public’s mind. Now, lay off!”But I kept going wherever physical evidence, eyewitnesses and facts took me,because I had a different philosophy than the government intimidators. I grew upin Boise, Idaho, where we pledged allegiance to the American flag each morningat school, had to memorize Lincoln’s Gettysburg address, which stressed we had agovernment “of the people, by the people and for the people.” We also had tooutline the U. S. Constitution and Bill of Rights to learn what democraticAmerican citizens were guaranteed. How naive others and I must seem to those whoare paid to misinform and intimidate so that powerful insiders can maintain apolicy of denial in the interest of national security about a non-human presenceon Earth. But how, why, and when did powerful insiders secretly hijack ourpromised government “of the people, by the people and for the people,” thatwould not perish from the Earth?The answer to that question is woven throughout the next nine chapters thatsynthesize E.T.-related events from 1973 to 1991. As each year is examined byhistorian Richard M. Dolan, there are the ever-present threads of strange lightsor solid-appearing craft in the sky, and human-piloted jets that chaseunsuccessfully after those unidentified aerial vehicles moving at mind-bogglingspeeds while making 90-degree turns. There are also unusual craft and beams thattouch the ground, along with animal mutilations, human abductions, geometricpatterns in cereal crops – all happening in both hemispheres. There are otherthreads, of powerful insiders who try to keep the public and media from payingserious attention to all the high strangeness. And there is a third strand ofthreads, the various non-human entities that human eyewitnesses have encounteredin daytime or night.Richard Dolan takes all those threads and weaves them through the warp and woofof global geopolitical events. This book is Mr. Dolan’s masterful explanation ofhow Lincoln’s government of the people suffered a secret, silent coup d’etat bypowerful insiders who probably thought in the beginning that their policy ofdenial was a superpatriotic act to protect tax-paying citizens from collapsingin the face of the unknown. But those powerful insiders did not collapse withtheir knowledge of the extraterrestrial biological entities and advancedtechnologies. Instead, their power grew in Black Agencies with Black Budgetsprotected by classified executive orders that prevented Congress – the peoples’representatives – from even knowing what those Black Budgets financed.In the last pages of this prodigious work, with the braid plaited, Mr. Dolanconcludes, “In all likelihood, secrecy relating to UFOs was a logical course ofaction initially that became an addiction the longer it continued. The longerthe UFO secret was maintained, the harder it was to reveal and the greater thegap between official and black-world societies. One might therefore think thatthis secrecy, which continues to this day, is bound to last indefinitely. Such aconclusion would be logical and perhaps even seem to be inevitable. Yet, itwould be wrong.”Richard Dolan unfolds how fear of E.T. disclosure in a republican system ofgovernment posed such a serious problem that clever minds “found a way to keepthe original system alive while creating another, increasingly separate systemthat would be empowered to deal with the extraordinary intrusion of others' intoour world.” That clever but unconstitutional answer is a “breakawaycivilization.” Linda Moulton HoweAlbuquerque, New MexicoJune 14, 2009 Introduction The truth is incontrovertible. Malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it,but in the end, there it is.― Winston Churchill In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.― George Orwell It’s no wonder that truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense.― Mark Twain The ProblemAcross the Earth’s skies and deep within the minds of humankind, UFOs areeverywhere and nowhere. For years, decades, generations, and centuries, peoplehave noticed unusual and occasionally impossible things in their skies. It willnever be known how many sightings occurred in early times; today they are dailyand worldwide. And yet, except for brief punctuations, the main instruments ofpower in our world continue to remain silent. The discrepancy between humanity’scollective eyes and its voice is striking and unsettling.There is scarcely a person on Earth who has not heard of UFOs; many believe inthem. Few, however, can say much about them. Fewer still – even believers – canfind much time to think about them. Life finds a way of keeping us occupied withother matters.Simply put, the phenomenon is a bundle of contradictions. But if UFOs could beshown to be genuine, anomalous, and apparently the result of some intelligenceother than that of our official and current civilization, then surely that wouldbe something . Something so big, so shattering, that all other truths might wellbe humbled by it.I argue that this is indeed the case, strange as this claim must seem to someoneschooled in the standard histories of their world. The following pages are amethodical presentation of facts and analyses that show the UFO phenomenon to besomething most assuredly “not us.”It is also a reality that is actively being covered up. It is a phenomenon sosignificant that elements of the human power structure have made it theirpriority to keep information about it strictly to themselves, apparently at allcost. As to the identity of these secret-keepers, many sources culled fromseveral decades of leaks, as well as broad geopolitical trends, make areasonable case that they are “beyond” nations. The U.S. power structure, whilestill integral to the system of secrecy, may not be the final word as it oncewas.The implications of a UFO reality and cover-up are profound. It means that oursociety has lived in an “official” reality so incomplete, so inaccurate, that wemay with justice call it fictitious. It means that the history we have learned,the science we think we know, and the very core of who we think we are, need tobe rediscovered.There is also the knotty issue of who or what is behind the UFO phenomenonitself. Here, matters become even more complicated. It seems clear that some ofthe phenomena are the result of secret breakthroughs by all-too-human groups,some more covert than others. Six decades of classified expenditures (and otherforms of secret spending) have provided ample resources to apply principles andtechnologies that have remained sealed off from the rest of humanity. Thisdevelopment alone is enough to justify the greatest secrecy.But terrestrial breakthroughs do not appear to account for the core of the UFOphenomenon. The confrontational nature of the objects, the never-ending militaryencounters and attempted interceptions tell the reasonable mind that somethingelse is going on. Added to this are the thousands of detailed descriptions,given by rational and intelligent people (who normally wish to remainanonymous), of having been taken by non-human beings to be studied and actedupon in various ways. These too tell us something is happening.Separating “ours” from “theirs” can be difficult and – due to entrenchedviewpoints – thankless. Still, it looks like both types of UFOs exist, adding tothe complexity of an already formidable problem.In a world that is moving fast toward a nightmarish dystopia relieved only bythe distractions of a mass entertainment industry, investigating such mattersmay not seem to be an attractive option for many. Yet in all societies at alltimes, there are those who care, those who hunger for that quaint anachronismcalled Truth. I am here to tell you that there is such a thing. With effort andsacrifice, truth can be known. Once known, it may continue to exact a heavyprice on those who possess it. And yet, it is more precious than the rarest ofgems, easily worth knowing for those who dare to chase it. For it is truth, andonly truth, that will ever set you free. Main ThemesI have brought together several themes in preparing this study, which covers theUFO phenomenon from 1973 until 1991. First are the reports themselves, priorityof which was given to those with military implications. In some cases this meantthat the report came from a military or intelligence agency within the U.S.,U.S.S.R., or another nation; in other cases it meant that reliable journalisticsources had reported an attempted jet interception or some other militaryencounter with a UFO; in others still it meant well-researched cases by a majorUFO investigative group, such as the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Of course, notall UFO encounters in this book have direct military implications. Some are justgood reports that were reliably investigated, important historically, or offeredsome other redeeming quality. Throughout, I sought to describe and analyze thesecases succinctly, yet fully.This book is more than a collection of UFO accounts, however. Ultimately, ittells a story, some of which concerns the attitudes of political and militaryagencies. We can learn these in several ways. One is through the availablemilitary and intelligence reports. While there are limits to what we can knowbased on reports of mid-level classification (i.e. “Confidential” as opposed to“Top Secret”), we can still see that the military considered many UFO encounterswith great seriousness, even gravity. Responsible thinkers must ask why this wasso, and why such an attitude has continually been countered by official silenceand dismissal. When powerful groups dismiss something publicly, but take itseriously in private, we can assume something important is being withheld.A related theme of this book concerns the evolution of the “national securitystate.” During the period under review, the power of the U.S. military andintelligence communities expanded at the expense of ordinary citizens.Elsewhere, multinational structures also weakened citizen power. It is littleappreciated how UFO secrecy has also eroded human liberty. From the 1940sonward, it required the creation of an apparatus that was independent ofrealistic oversight by elected representatives, with substantial funding andlatitude of action. Indeed, secrecy on UFOs is arguably a key factor in thegenesis of America’s so-called “black budget.” That, in turn, has shown itselfto be among the most formidable enemies of classical republican government.During the 1970s and 1980s, that American national security state was involvedin secret programs that were connected with UFO phenomena, ranging from the(alleged) electrogravitic elements of the stealth bomber, ET aspects of theStrategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the UFO-hunting Defense Support Program(DSP), the testing of non-aerodynamic and radical craft in Nevada’s Groom Lakeand Southern California, the spreading of disinformation targeted against UFOresearchers, and much more.The final key theme of this book deals with the evolution of our own ideas aboutUFOs. Leading edge thinking on the topic was in a very different place in 1991than it had been during the early 1970s. How researchers got from the one placeto the other is a fascinating story. What had once seemed like a somewhatstraightforward proposition – extraterrestrials visiting Earth in spaceships –went through many permutations. Researchers began to discuss subjects previouslyoff-limits, such as dimensions, time travel, remote viewing, abductions, animalmutilations, black helicopters, crop circles, and the Nazi “legacy.” Included inthis explosion of new ideas were claims and details of the cover-up, and evendiscussion of whether or not there was a “human-alien deal” involving abductionsand technology transfer. Much of the new thinking was based on solidfoundations, such as government documents, open source research, or newdevelopments in science. Some of it was fantastic and impossible to verify.Through it all was a backdrop of global change, technological revolution, andfinally the widespread adoption of personal computers throughout the U.S. andEurope, all of which affected the UFO scene. The StoryDuring the early 1970s, the UFO topic was still suffering from the conclusionsof the Air Force sponsored Condon Committee. In 1969, its report had concludedthat the study of UFOs had not added to scientific knowledge, and that UFOreports were “not of probative value.” UFO researchers responded by trying tobring respectability to the topic; hence the development of “scientificufology.” Studying the cover-up, a major tactic during the 1950s and 1960s,became passé while researchers focused on improving scientific and logicalrigor, as well as improving investigative methodologies. Meanwhile, the 1970sbrought many difficult, “high strangeness” reports that severely tested oldideas about UFOs. The phenomenon itself seemed to stimulate new ideas inresearch.The absence of a political emphasis in UFO research did not last very long.Government denials remained the rule, but the political turmoil of Watergate andVietnam led to a strengthening of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1974– which was further strengthened during the Jimmy Carter administration. Theresult was a flurry of requests by private citizens for documents pertaining toUFOs. Before long, thousands of pages of relevant documents had been released bythe CIA, FBI, and many military agencies. Taken separately, none of thesedocuments could be considered a “smoking gun” proving that UFOs wereextraterrestrial, but the cumulative impact of the best ones was formidable. Itbecame obvious that some UFO reports had been taken very seriously byresponsible agencies while, at the same time, they downplayed UFOs to thepublic. Some of these documents described baffling and provocative violations ofairspace by objects that simply should not have existed, and the futile attemptsby interceptors to engage them. This was explosive stuff in the late 1970s, andmany researchers understandably looked to FOIA as the best tool with which topry open the secrets of UFOs.Another prong in the attack on secrecy were leaks concerning the retrieval ofcrashed UFOs. Researchers had shunned the topic for years. Now, however, peoplebegan to talk, not just about Roswell (which quickly became the most prominentof them), but many other cases. Already by 1980, researchers had collectedscores of accounts from former military personnel who claimed to have beenpresent at the retrieval of a crashed UFO, or to have seen alien bodies atWright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), or to have participated in the secret insome other way. Some researchers wondered whether they could make an air-tightcase about one of these stories, and whether they could blow the lid off of thesecrecy.Alas, it was not to be. From all available evidence, it appears that theintelligence community initiated a counter-strike in the form of disinformation.Starting in the early 1980s, this effort has left a permanent mark on UFOresearch. Most prominent was the release of the “MJ-12” documents in themid-1980s, which certainly looked like authentic, secret statements describingthe extraterrestrial reality and cover-up. The problem was that they almostcertainly were mailed by intelligence officers from Kirtland AFB, one of whomhad previously shown another UFO researcher similar but decidedly differentdocuments. Those documents contained information that did not easily reconcilewith the later ones. On the other hand, the MJ-12 documents did containinformation that proved fertile for followup investigation, and certain arcanetidbits that suggested they were genuine. Complicating matters were a series ofstatements by prominent members of the defense community which supported theexistence of an organization like MJ-12 – that is, a UFO/ET “control group.” Theresult was that what had seemed like a straightforward proposition, e.g. justgetting hold of the “right” document, turned into an endless debate overdocument authenticity, while insider claims and leaks – inherently difficult toverify – were simply not enough to obtain a government admission that UFOs werereal and, in some fundamental way, alien .Yet, UFO research progressed markedly during this period. New issues came to theforefront, joining the FOIA effort and investigation into Roswell. Mostprominent of these was the abduction phenomenon. True, the topic of alienabduction had been discussed to some extent during the 1960s, but primarily as aside issue. At best, it was considered to be a rare event, and very difficultfor many researchers – to say nothing of the general public – to take seriously.But the phenomenon would not go away; researchers found themselves increasinglyin the presence of people who had periods of missing time, or memories of beingtaken and examined by alien beings. Some eventually found it impossible toignore any longer and began a systematic study of the phenomenon. The resultscaused yet more tremors in the field of ufology, more arguments, and morequestions.By the late 1980s, Roswell, MJ-12, and abductions all caused deep divisions inUFO research. But there was still an identifiable community of researchers who,in a sense, all spoke the same language. That is, they were a fairly close-knitbunch who knew each others’ work, had studied the same cases, were members ofone of the major organizations, and believed in “scientific ufology.” Startingin 1987, this cultural unity was shattered. This was largely due to theexistence of a new, wide-open forum: the Internet. Anyone with access to acomputer and a modem could publish their thoughts instantly, for all ofcyberworld to see. The UFO journals, governed by their various directors,editors, and submission policies, had for decades been the dominant venue fordiscussion. Suddenly, they were being bypassed by a steady stream of papers thatbefore long turned into a flood, and then a veritable ocean.The result was that the UFO community began to “let it all hang out.” Claims ofhuman-alien “deals,” and the reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technologybegan to surface. Discussions of global control groups like the Bilderbergersand Illuminati seeped into the mix. Increasingly, claims were made about thevarious types of extraterrestrials said to be on Earth. The old guard found allof this distasteful, embarrassing, and wrong-headed: what happened to carefulscientific evaluation of individual UFO cases and a suspension of judgment?Supporters of the new school countered that they had simply dragged theever-conservative ufology into a region where it had needed to be all along.Meanwhile, a new development in the phenomenon itself began to coalesce: theadvent of the mass sighting. Surely, there had been instances before where largenumbers of people witnessed a UFO. But during the 1980s, there were severalplaces where the sightings continued over an extended period of time, and wereseen by hundreds of people, sometimes thousands. The Hudson Valley region oflower New York State and Connecticut; Gulf Breeze, Florida; California’sAntelope Valley; Nevada’s Area 51; the town of Fyffe, Alabama; most of Belgium;and Mexico City all were host to ongoing waves of UFOs, with many witnesses,often armed with cameras and video.Here, as in prior years, we see the strange juxtaposition of the unusual natureof these aerial phenomena, combined with a decided lack of interest in them bymajor journalistic sources. Most of the limited coverage they received waslocal; to the extent they were covered by the major media, such as the New YorkTimes , they were typically dismissed as misidentifications of somethingconventional, or as hoaxes. Usually, they were simply ignored.Why would major newspapers and media players ignore something that, presumably,would be a major story and therefore bring in more money? They might, if theyhad close relationships to those very groups intent on maintaining secrecy. Infact, during the 1970s and 1980s, several studies appeared showing just this. In1988, Katherine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post and long-timecollaborator with the CIA, told a CIA audience that “there are some things thegeneral public does not need to know and shouldn’t. I believe democracyflourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets andwhen the press can decide whether to print what it knows.” Somewhere along theway, the mainstream American media transformed itself from being a publicwatchdog into the mouth of Sauron.Indeed, the world itself went through a major transformation. It was not simplya function of the Internet, although this was surely important. On a granderscale still, what was happening was globalization . The Soviet Union,increasingly unable to compete economically, began to fall apart. Elsewhere,multinational corporations assumed ever-greater power and influence in thegeopolitical realm. By 1990, the President of the United States had given a nameto these changes: the New World Order.What had happened was that the international power brokers who had always lurkedbehind the scenes had found better ways to govern their world. Whether or notone wishes to call this a conspiracy, we can state matter-of-factly that aKingmaker such as David Rockefeller (who was a major factor in creating nearlyall the Presidencies covered in this volume: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, RonaldReagan, and George Bush), was moving toward a goal he had openly desired for hisentire life. It included, first, a diminution of traditional concepts ofnational sovereignty in favor of an array of transnational structures. Thesemight be the old clubs like the Bilderbergers, Council on Foreign Relations, andTrilateral Commission, or other legal structures/entities such as the UnitedNations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, the European Union, or theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Regarding the management of UFOsecrecy, such a development should well give one pause before assuming that theoffice of the U.S. President had the final word on such matters.The second major result of globalization was (and continues to be) a transfer ofauthority from the public realm to the private. The evolution of UFO secrecyreflected this development. It is impossible to know the details, but thegeneral picture has become clear enough. Control over key components of the UFOsecret have drifted further and further away from (theoretically responsible)government and military officials, and increasingly toward private entities.This transfer of power is reflected in a number of statements from insiders, aswell as by more generalized studies of the Pentagon’s system of “Special AccessPrograms,” the prototypical black budget programs. In effect, the worldunderwent a silent, transnational revolution during the late 1980s and early1990s.Another thing that had happened was that someone seemed to be developing andflying, if not actual flying saucers, then something very much along thoselines. By the late 1980s the signs were becoming clear. Perhaps the HudsonValley objects were not terrestrial objects, perhaps they were. By the end ofthe 1980s, however, sightings in California’s Antelope Valley and Nevada’s Area51 were of objects that were surely made by the U.S. defense industry. In thejudgment not merely of UFO-watchers but aviation and aerospace experts, itlooked as if these objects were utilizing a form of field propulsion. That is,anti-gravity.“Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.” We canassume that the original lie of the 1940s was intended to stall for time;meanwhile, policymakers would frantically try to figure out what was going on.But this lie developed into immense, complex, and ultimately separateinfrastructure. The longer it continued, the more entrenched the establishedparties became; the more removed they became from officially established truths;the less they were able to explain to the rest of the world what was actuallygoing on. It was one thing to explain to the public that one or moreextraterrestrial intelligences were freely operating on Planet Earth forpurposes which they kept to themselves. It was entirely something else toexplain that a massive black infrastructure had evolved, siphoning off publicmoney, operating in total secrecy for years, developing new technologies, andmaking profits based on monopolistic exploitation of acquired ET technology.Another still to explain that the U.S. President, or other national leaders forthat matter, were not necessarily the key decision-makers when it came to suchmatters.Having said this, there is reason to believe that the President was notcompletely out of the loop, at least during this period. There appear to havebeen several times when a disclosure of the UFO reality was considered, one ofwhich was during the Bush administration in 1991. Like the others which precededit, it was an abortive attempt. From sources I have spoken to, people whom Iconsider to be in a good position to know, such discussions have tended to occur“every five years or so.” The obstacles are daunting, primarily intransigencefrom within the classified world, but just as importantly the fear ofrepercussions throughout the social, financial, political, and legal structures.There can be no question that the challenges of disclosure are intimidating. Forthose in the know, it is much easier to let matters continue as they have been,despite the difficulties already involved. That attitude can work – as long asthe world does not change. But we in the 21st century are living throughrevolutionary times, and this revolution truly began during the period underreview in this book. The world will never be ready for disclosure of this truth,just as most couples are not ready for their first child. It will come just thesame, however. Like any new parent, we will have to learn and adjust on the fly. SourcesIn researching this book I was fortunate to have a vast array of resources thatwere not available to me for the first volume of this study. Due to the kindnessof several individuals, most notably the late William T. Sherwood of Rochester,New York, who bequeathed me his entire, substantial ufological library, I havehad a surfeit of books, journals, newspaper clippings, as well as video andaudio interviews. Of greatest importance are government documents which areavailable to anyone via several large collections on the web. In addition, Ifound interesting and previously unknown documents while visiting the U.S.National Archives in College Park, Maryland and the Canadian National Archivesin Ottawa.Government documents are important; unfortunately they do not tell the wholestory. In the first place, even during FOIA’s “glory years” of the late 1970s,the UFO documents that were released had been of mid- to low-levels ofclassification. The few “Top Secret” documents were nearly entirely redacted.Generally speaking, this situation worsened in subsequent years to the pointwhere FOIA became nearly useless for most military UFO encounters after themid-1980s. A few accounts continue to make it through, however, so the effortremains important.In preparation for this history, I also examined the journals of many major UFOorganizations, including the MUFON UFO Journal , The International UFO Reporter, The APRO Bulletin , The NICAP UFO Investigator , Flying Saucer Review , and ahost of other publications, newspaper clippings, and websites. Moreover, I havebeen fortunate in interviewing a number of researchers and insiders of alltypes, most of whom allow public attribution, and a few who do not. Using ananonymous source for any historical work is a tricky business, and in general Ihave avoided using them for direct attribution. In a few cases, however, I havedeemed the information and source significant enough that I could not in goodconscience leave it out.Regarding the topic of UFOs, in which national security issues come into play,accompanied by official silence, disinformation, and outright lies, any historywill always be incomplete. Until matters come out in the open, this is how itwill continue to be. The best we can achieve is a balance between caution in theuse of sources, and courage in the willingness to draw implications from thedata. At all times, we must distinguish between what we know and what thingslook like . There are those who prefer to remain in the safe waters of theformer, and others who live exclusively in the deeps of the latter. For my part,I have ventured through them all, from the calm to the treacherous. ImplicationsEven for experienced researchers, UFOs can seem surreal, if only because theyfind so little support for the idea within respectable society. The same appliesto witnesses. Scratch below the surface a little, and you will find many peoplewho have seen, or at least believe they have seen, a genuine UFO. Althoughseeing is believing, the passage of time can still engulf an extraordinarysighting within the mundane necessities of daily life. The experience thenbecomes no more than an interesting anomaly, often forgotten or pushed asidebecause there is just no place for it, and they certainly do not have thestomach for the ridicule.Setting aside the truth value of the UFO phenomenon, it is an interestingsociological reality that so many people are unwilling to discuss the mostincredible – and at times traumatic – experience of their lives. What does itsay about our society that this is so? My feeling is that, by its very nature,it represents a form of repression. If you are a reader who believes UFOs to benonsense of some sort, I can nevertheless assure you that you have a friend orrelation who has seen one. They have simply learned not to discuss it. Manypeople can live perfectly well within the constraints of repression and denial;they simply learn to shut off certain parts of their mind. It is sad, but ithappens all the time.But not everyone is the same. Not everyone is willing to do this, or even can dothis. By any estimate, there are many millions of people on this planet who havehad a powerful UFO experience. They cannot and will not be silencedindefinitely. We are today living in a period of such dramatic change –technologically, politically, socially, culturally – that I believe it is only amatter of time before something gives way.And what of them ? Those beings, intelligences – people? – who are behind thephenomenon itself? I have spoken about the silence of the human structure ofpower, but the beings who are traversing the skies, oceans, and space above theEarth are not landing on the proverbial White House lawn. They have an agenda,an interest, which they are not willing to share, at least not publicly. Manypeople claim to have had private communications with some of these beings, whichrun the gamut from the hellish to the divine. Regarding their nature and agenda,we enter of necessity the realm of speculation. Matters of exopolitics , that isthe study of our relationship with “them,” will always be premature under suchcircumstances.Still, it is not outrageous to consider that, having mastered certaintechnologies that we ourselves may soon be acquiring – or even certain mattersof mental or spiritual attainment – that multiple groups are interested in ourbeautiful blue orb and its abundance of life. The human species should be ofprime interest to them, especially now. Consider the changes we have made toourselves and the world within a mere century. From a world of horse-drawncarriages to cars, airplanes, radio, television, atomic weapons, guidedmissiles, integrated circuits, computers, and internet. An object weighing justa few ounces can let you speak, text, or see anyone in the world, hold thousandsof songs, give you instant directions to anywhere, and connect you to theworld’s largest libraries. Experts in artificial intelligence believe we arejust a few years away from having computers that will claim to be conscious insome manner, and will seem like they are, whatever the nature of thatconsciousness may truly be. Then there is the matter of nanotechnology andquantum computing, the results of which are expected to transform our world evenmore completely than the internet revolution already has.In other words, humanity is in the process of reinventing itself. Any observingintelligence must be well aware that we are poised, knowingly or not, to leapinto their world. We have probably been there all along, only asleep. Now we areabout to wake up. Chapter 1 Global Strangeness1973-1975 To our utter amazement, it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off theplane I told Nancy all about it ... And we read up on the long history of UFOs.― Ronald Reagan, describing his UFO sighting, 1974 It was faster than anything I’ve ever seen. I’ve observed enough launchings toknow we have nothing that can compare to the speed of this thing.― Major Claude Riddle, U.S. Army, on UFO encounter while piloting a helicopter,1975. The difference between what the most and the least learned people know isinexpressibly trivial in relation to that which is unknown.― Albert Einstein Inexplicable TechnologyOn October 25, 1973, during a wave of UFO sightings in the United States, twoU.S. Navy personnel reported something incredible on the other side of theworld. Lieutenant Commander “M” was driving from a restricted National SecurityAgency (NSA) and Naval Communications Station in North West Cape, WesternAustralia. At 7:15 p.m., he saw “a large black airborne object” about 5 milesaway to the west, at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. In his written report, hestated that the object simply hovered, giving off no noise or exhaust. Then,“after about 20-25 seconds the craft accelerated at unbelievable speeds anddisappeared to the north.” Its acceleration was “beyond belief.”Another navy man, Fire Captain Bill L., saw the same thing from a differentvantage point. He said the object “was completely stationary,” except for arevolving or pulsating halo around the center. After he watched it for fourminutes, it took off at “tremendous speed” toward the north and disappearedwithin seconds. He thought it was about 30 feet in diameter and hovering at1,000 feet over the hills west of the base. The object appeared black, and didnot show any lights.Australian UFO researcher Bill Chalker investigated this case. He discoveredthat on this date the North West Cape NSA base was communicating a general U.S.alert to conventional and nuclear forces in the region – this was during the YomKippur War, involving Israel, Egypt, and Syria. i[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1775528]This event highlights the complexity and intrigue of the modern UFO phenomenon.We have two descriptions of an extraordinary aerial phenomenon which appears tobe technological. There was not in 1973, nor is there today, any craft that issupposed to be able to do this. Moreover, these witnesses were American militarypersonnel whose base was secretly engaged in high stakes military activity withglobal impact.So what exactly was going on? What was that black object? Was it spying on theAmericans? If so, who controlled it? With a technology so far beyond anything weknow of, it is not hard to see this as an intimate surveillance of humanmilitary activity by a non-human civilization.Perhaps one might object that such a speculation is premature. Maybe the objectwas made by the U.S. military-industrial complex in deep secrecy. If so, morequestions arise. Was such technology developed with the aid of reverseengineering studies done on alien craft? Or was it fully “in-house?” Or was itdeveloped by a human group, but one so secret that it would be in effect anothercivilization. For those who get their news from CNN, this might be hard toswallow – a secret civilization? Indeed, but – to adapt a statement by Dr. CarlSagan – extraordinary phenomena require extraordinary hypotheses.Regardless of the object’s origin, it demonstrates for the umpteenth time thatunexplained and supremely advanced technology is traversing the skies of thisworld. The State of UfologyThe “wave” of late 1973 is often said to have signaled a return of the UFOphenomenon, after a relative decline for several years prior. While sightingstatistics bear this out, in all likelihood we will never truly know if this isso, considering the inexact nature of the UFO statistics themselves. Not thatthe massive amount of collected data on this subject is of no value; rather, itis simply woefully incomplete, and always has been. Of the hundreds of UFOwitnesses this author has spoken to, perhaps five went so far as to report theirsighting to some agency (the Air Force, the police, a UFO organization, etc.).Most never even wrote a personal account.During the 1950s and 1960s, there had been Project Blue Book, the Air Force’s“UFO Desk.” J. Allen Hynek, consultant to Blue Book, suspected that it was thetip of an iceberg, that perhaps only ten percent of actual UFO sightings wereever reported. Jacques Vallee thought the percentage was even lower. ii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1775815] That was whenAmericans had a government agency that would take such reports. After 1969, theAir Force closed Blue Book, an event closely linked with the Air Force sponsoredscientific study of UFOs conducted by the University of Colorado in the late1960s. Known as the Condon Committee, the study dismissed UFO phenomena as “notworthy of scientific study.” With Blue Book gone, only a few small, privateorganizations accepted UFO reports. This fact as much as anything else couldexplain the drop in UFO sightings during the very early 1970s. By the end of1973, private UFO research was beginning to recover. At this point, there werefour research groups in the U.S., small though they were, that could have someclaim as a “national” organization.One was the National Investigative Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), basedout of Washington, D.C. For years, NICAP had challenged the Air Force positionon UFOs and tried to jump-start open congressional hearings on the matter. ButNICAP in the 1970s was circling the drain. Its longtime director, USMC MajorDonald E. Keyhoe (Ret.), had been ousted in 1969 by Col. Joseph J. Bryan III, aman later discovered to have once headed the CIA’s Psychological Warfaredivision. Leadership of NICAP passed to John Acuff, who had been the head of theSociety of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (SPSE), a group with strongties to military intelligence and the CIA. Acuff ended NICAP’s criticism ofgovernment UFO policy. More significantly, he destroyed its investigative andreporting network. Acuff also plundered the organization personally, payinghimself more than $20,000 per year for his “services.” This was essentially allthe money the organization had. The situation continued until he resigned thedirectorship in 1978. iii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1776107] For years, NICAP’s main rival was the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization (APRO), based out of Tucson, Arizona. Founded in 1952 by James andCoral Lorenzen, it had developed an impressive structure. A typical APROBulletin of the late 1960s listed some 40 or more Ph.D.s or M.D.s on theorganization’s consulting panels in biological sciences, medical sciences,physical sciences, and social sciences, as well as representatives from 40 to 50nations. It was a worldwide network subsisting on memberships of less than $10per year. Coral Lorenzen had a long history of frosty relationships with otherUFO organizations. During the 1960s, she frequently criticized NICAP forpoliticizing the UFO issue. She argued that UFOs should be approachedscientifically, without Keyhoe’s conspiracy-mongering.Thus, with Keyhoe’s ouster and NICAP’s willfully incompetent leadership, APROwas primed to lead American ufology. But APRO received its own unwelcome shockin 1969, when one of its regional officers, Walter Andrus, took many APROmembers with him to form the Midwest UFO Network based out of Seguin, Texas.Disillusioned NICAP members also joined. Soon renamed the Mutual UFO Network,MUFON quickly became a leading UFO research group. Coral Lorenzen seemed to havetaken this personally. Although she was usually polite in public, she neverdeveloped a cooperative relationship with MUFON, and at times engaged in verbalexchanges and sniping at Andrus (who, it must be said, never reciprocated).Instead, Andrus focused on building a grass-roots UFO investigativeorganization.In November 1973, another UFO organization joined the mix, when J. Allen Hynekco-founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) near Chicago with Sherman J.Larsen. Larsen’s background is as obscure as Hynek’s is famous. He was oncedescribed as little more than “a retired Glenview businessman.” iv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1776340] In fact,Larsen seems almost certainly to have been in the U.S. Army Counter IntelligenceCorps (CIC). During World War Two and its immediate aftermath, CIC was one ofthe elite U.S. intelligence agencies, the spy-catchers of the American military.Leonard Stringfield, who was a friend of Larsen’s, mentioned in a 1977 book thatLarsen had worked for CIC, and had even told him where CIC’s headquarters werein the Chicago area. v[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1776499] Larsen hadgiven a sophisticated presentation at a 1971 MUFON Symposium regardinggovernment documents that demonstrated strong interest in UFOs. Larsen and anassociate named Bill Laub had contacts at the RAND Corporation who obtained UFOdocuments that had been created for the Air Force. Specifically, Larsen saidthat he and Laub had “developed a technique to secure credible sources who haveprovided us with documents that have previously been unknown, priced out of themarket, or while not classified were nevertheless unavailable.” vi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1776681] Far from beinga “naive businessman,” Larsen seems very quietly to have been a sophisticatedplayer within the U.S. intelligence community.Hynek was the most famous name in ufology, due to his longtime connection withBlue Book. As far as Coral Lorenzen was concerned, fame did not equal quality.She never forgot that for years he was comfortably paid as an Air Forceconsultant. She and her husband long believed the government was spying on them,and they knew that the CIA-sponsored 1953 Robertson Panel, of which Hynek was ajunior member, had recommended monitoring their organization. Nor was CoralLorenzen the only one with a problem about Hynek: many MUFON members alsodistrusted him.In early 1974, Hynek was seeking cooperative relationships with the other UFOgroups. Andrus pledged MUFON’s support, but Hynek only deepened Coral Lorenzen’ssuspicions when he visited APRO’s Tucson headquarters in February. As CoralLorenzen put it, he “made a pitch to be handed a list of APRO’s FieldInvestigators along with their addresses and telephone numbers.” Perhaps thiswas only an attempt at professional collaboration. Considering Coral Lorenzen’slongstanding attitude, however, one might raise an eyebrow at Hynek’s diplomaticconfidence. She was “somewhat taken aback” when Hynek told her that fate hadplaced him at center stage of the UFO situation. Hynek did not get the list. vii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1777002]Such were the four major American groups receiving UFO reports, conductinginvestigations, and trying to understand the mystery. Memberships were low. APROand MUFON had no more than two or three thousand members each, CUFOS was in itsinfancy, and NICAP was hemorrhaging. NICAP had the most obvious connections tothe world of spooks, but all of them had prominent members with past or currentties to the U.S. military or intelligence community. One might argue this wasbecause the previous line of work of these individuals had stimulated aninterest in the subject. On the other hand, given that surveillance of the UFOresearch community had been going on for years, suspicions like those of CoralLorenzen seem justified to some degree.Despite the personality clashes, all the groups promoted “scientific ufology.”Hynek made it the guiding principle of CUFOS, and MUFON stressed it just asmuch. Its proponents argued that, in order for “ufology” to gain respectability,it needed to be conducted scientifically. MUFON was slowly developing aninvestigative methodology and a network of trained investigators. This was theideal; reality often lagged behind. But there were MUFON investigators whorigorously investigated baffling UFO cases: doing the legwork, interviewingwitnesses, analyzing possible landing sites, preparing thorough reports.The goal of scientific ufology is surely laudable, and considering the state ofaffairs after the Condon Committee Report, understandable. It also served tode-politicize the issue to a large extent. Cover-ups and conspiracies weredefinitely out . So were such “simplistic” answers to the UFO mystery as theExtraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH). Considering the Condon Committee’s strongslap against the ETH, this too is understandable. More important, though, it wasbecoming obvious that there were simply too many bizarre reports which did noteasily lead to a “nuts and bolts” explanation of alien creatures inside spaceships coming from another planet.Much of the influence behind this new perspective came from Jacques Vallee andJohn A. Keel. Both argued that UFOs could not possibly be extraterrestrialspacecraft. Vallee later postulated “Five Arguments” against the ETH. First,there were too many UFO close encounters to explain them as a physical survey ofthe earth. Second, the humanoid body structure of the alleged “aliens” wasunlikely to have originated elsewhere and was not biologically adapted to spacetravel. Third, the behavior as described in so many abduction reportscontradicted the idea that advanced aliens were conducting genetic or scientificexperiments. Fourth, the phenomenon seemed to have been recorded throughouthuman history. Fifth, the apparent ability of UFOs to manipulate space and timesuggested different and richer alternatives to mere extraterrestrials. viii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1777214] Thus, notaliens in flying saucers, but intelligences from other dimensions, wereinteracting with humanity, according to this hypothesis. By the early 1970s, theidea was widespread among researchers, and has continued as a significant schoolof thought to the present day. Even the astronomer Hynek, who worked closelywith Vallee during the 1970s, accepted a good portion of it. ix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1777485] UFO research, in a word, was reinventing itself at the same time that it soughtto establish itself on a firm intellectual footing. This was difficult enough,but researchers could not have foreseen just how intellectually active theirfield would become, nor how much more arduous the task of finding a commonphilosophical outlook and the scientific principles upon which to base theirwork. UFO Crash in WalesThe United States generated few memorable UFO reports in 1974, but matters weredifferent elsewhere, especially in Europe. Early in the year, “mysteryhelicopters” and cigar-shaped objects were reported in northern England,especially near the Pennine Mountains. x[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1777696] Enough reportsaccumulated that on January 15, police there announced they were on the alertfor unusual helicopter movements. xi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1777891] The following week, on January 23, 1974, a possible UFO crashed at CaderBronwen, a 2,000 foot peak in northern Wales. Around 8:30 p.m., witnesses saw abright object followed by a long, luminous tail and (according to one witness) ablinking blue light. The object seemed to be motionless for several minutes,during which it dimmed and then became very bright. One person described it as“an electric bulb shape, except that it seemed to have rough edges.” When itcrashed, police stations up to sixty miles away received calls about an earthtremor or quake. Police and a Royal Air Force (RAF) mountain rescue team bothresponded quickly. Two RAF aircraft took photographs, and the RAF said nothingwas found. The Royal Geological Institute said the object was a meteor.Several odd sightings followed the event. Ninety minutes after the crash, a manwatched a “luminous sphere” descend into the sea near the Dee Estuary, about 25miles north of the crash. The next night, while the rescue team was in action,three family members saw a bright object in the sky near Cader Bronwen. Throughfield glasses they saw a disc-shaped object which seemed to be divided into red,green, yellow, and purple sections. Presumably this was not a flare. After tenminutes they called the police, and the object disappeared behind a cloud.A local resident named Margaret Fry investigated the event and found a nurse whosaid she clearly saw the crashed UFO. The nurse had assumed an aircraft had gonedown and drove out to help, accompanied by her two teenaged daughters. She toldFry that she saw the object fully intact, but was turned back by police and armypersonnel.Twenty years later, British researcher Nick Redfern was able to corroborate thatBritish Army units arrived. Redfern interviewed one soldier (pseudonym “JamesPrescott”) who said he was ordered to the area with four others, and loaded twooblong boxes into their armored truck. They then drove the material about 150miles southeast, into England, to the Chemical and Biological DefenceEstablishment at Porton Down, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. The men were understrict orders not to stop for anything. According to Prescott, “the boxes wereopened by staff at the facility in our presence. We were startled to see twocreatures which had been placed inside decontamination suits.... It was obviousthat the creatures were not of this Earth, and, when examined, were found tohave died.” These were not little “greys.” Prescott said the bodies were “aboutfive to six feet tall, humanoid in shape, but so that they looked almostskeletal with a covering skin.” He did not see a craft at the crash site, but“was informed that a large craft had crashed and was retrieved by other(British) military units.”Redfern speculated that a British version of Project Moon Dust was activated forthis, which could also explain the reports of mysterious helicopters. As a 1961U.S. defense document put it, Moon Dust was a program designed “to locate,recover, and deliver descended foreign space vehicles.” The UFO connection toMoon Dust is certainly not out of the question. Of course, if the helicoptersseen in the prior weeks were part of a Moon Dust type of operation, this impliessome level of foreknowledge of a crash – unless there had been other, unknowncrashes. Another piece to this case may have been added by British researcherJenny Randles, who learned from a former British government official that acrashed UFO was kept at a military base somewhere in South Wales.The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) has steadfastly refused to comment on thecrash in Wales, although the mystery helicopter sightings in Britain largelyceased after this point. xii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1778127] The French Minister of DefenseFrom January through March of 1974, French radio journalist, Jean-ClaudeBourret, aired a series of 40 radio programs about UFOs. These were broadcast onFrench national radio (France-Inter). One of Bourret’s guests was the currentFrench Minister of Defense, Robert Galley, who dropped a true bombshell onFebruary 21. Galley spoke of the widespread nature of the UFO phenomenon, thestrong quality of evidence, and how he was “deeply convinced” that people neededto regard UFOs with a “completely open mind.” It was undeniable, he said, “thatthere are facts that are unexplained or badly explained.”Galley confirmed that the French military had a strong interest in UFOs since1954, a year of numerous sightings throughout France. He added that the militaryrecords contained “accounts of some baffling radar/visual incidents.” Mostsignificantly of all, Galley stated:I must say that if your listeners could see for themselves the mass of reportscoming in from airborne gendarmerie, from the mobile gendarmerie, and from thegendarmerie charged with the job of conducting investigations, all of whichreports are being forwarded by us to the CNES (National Center for SpaceStudies), then they would see that it is all pretty disturbing.That a Minister of Defense of a major power in the 1970s could tell a journalistthat some UFO reports were “pretty disturbing” – this is a startling revelation,to say the least. One can hardly imagine such a statement coming from an activeAmerican Defense Secretary. There does not appear to have been any major followup on this statement within media or government circles. xiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1778351] The Wave in SpainCurrent events supported Galley’s statement about the “disturbing” nature of UFOreports. The Wales UFO crash was serious enough, but a major wave of sightingsalso took place in Western Europe. A portion of these events involved sightingsof alleged aliens. On January 7, while driving in the Belgian town of Warnetonnear the French border, a man’s car suddenly died. He saw a landed UFO, slightlyglowing and shaped like a British World War One helmet. Two humanoid beingsapproached him. They had pear-shaped heads, slits for mouths, round eyes, simplenoses, and long arms. They wore internally lighted helmets, grey jumpsuit-typeclothes, and gloves. One was about 4 feet tall, the other somewhat taller; athird being remained near the craft. The taller being came to within 12-15 feetof the motorist’s vehicle, then opened and closed its mouth. The witness felt akind of shock to the back of his head and heard a low-pitched sound. The twobeings quickly returned to their craft, which now pulsated with an electric bluecolor, and quickly departed. xiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1778907] An odd phenomenon was photographed in Italy, between Milan and Bologna,on January 18, 1974. A motorist named Giuseppe Cardelli saw a “strange shiningball” in the sky in the afternoon. He got out of his car and photographed it. Hesubmitted the image to America’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA), which replied with a letter dated June 18 that it had no solution to theimage. A NASA photographic specialist said it was “very interesting,” but he hadno idea what it was. A consultant wondered whether the object was a reflectionin a car window (although the witness had claimed to have taken the photographoutside the car). Still, he found the “wiggly clouds to the right” interesting.No other conclusions were made regarding the photo. xv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1779068] Several interesting aerial encounters also come from this period. OnJanuary 26, near Lisbon, Portugal, an airline crew reported seeing a V-formationof 10-15 luminous orange discs. The captain, Lars Berglund, ruled out thepossibility that they could be a satellite reentry. The distances andconfiguration were too precise. After the formation had passed, anotherPortugese aircraft reported to ground control at Lisbon that they had seen thesame formation. A Norwegian and British aircraft crew also reported the sameobservation. Visibility was good that day. xvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1779239] Another aerialcase occurred in Milan, Italy, on March 9, in which a Fiat Corporation pilotchased a luminous saucer-shaped object with colored rings, an event that wastracked by Milan radar. xvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1779482] On March 23, a very odd object was allegedly photographed in Albiosc,France, not far from Marseilles and Monaco. This was a color slide of a UFO,showing a red object resembling a domed disc and four bright beamlikeextensions. UFO investigator, Jean Bedet, received this slide anonymously, alongwith a note stating a date of March 23. Bedet said that his wife and others hadseen a UFO of this description at 11 p.m. on that very date. He showed them theslide, an Another case, just as interesting, happened in Sweden on thesame date, at probably around the same time. This was the “Anders” abductioncase. A man walking along a dark road at night was surrounded by light and‘sucked up’ into a UFO. A “typical” abduction experience ensued: entities,medical examination, and a probe inserted into his temple. At home, the man bledfrom wounds in his forehead, and his cheek burned. Extraordinary abilitiesappeared to follow, such as the ability to disrupt a compass needle, see vibrantauras, and telepathy. As bizarre as this sounds, the event appears to have beenpartially witnessed; the UFO was reported by another man a short distance away.The Swedish Home Guard assigned 50 of its personnel to work with 15 ufologiststo examine the region. The group reported odd lights in the sky, but noentities. xviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1779653]During the first half of 1974, the most intense area of reported UFO activitywas in Spain. The Spanish wave is interesting for several reasons. First, theintrinsic nature of the reports themselves, which frequently involved closeencounters by credible and sometimes prominent individuals, and some of whichincluded descriptions of apparent aliens. Second, the U.S. military had someinterest in this, as Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) documents provide summarydescriptions of dozens of these cases gathered from local newspaper clippings.Third, the attitude of the Spanish military toward UFOs is instructive.The main concentration of Spanish UFO sightings was between March and June of1974, a large portion of which occurred in a narrow longitudinal strip (5 and 6degrees West) in the central and western portions of the country. Sightings wereas far north as the Atlantic coast and as far south as Gibraltar, but in generalalong this narrow strip. Most of the descriptions of these sightings aretruncated, as they are in the form of brief intelligence summaries by U.S.Defense Attache Office. Despite this, some are very distinctive. xix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1779818]The entry for March 23, for instance, describes an event near Castillo de lasGuardas, in the province of Seville: “Mother ship–aluminum, 150-200 meters long.Three smaller ships resembling mushrooms. Flew silently, had no windows buttowers above and below.” The witness was a salesman from Seville who “waspursued by one of the smaller ships, which disappeared as observer enteredvillage.” The report described another sighting from that day, fifty miles tothe south at the Gulf of Cadiz. In this case, the chauffeur of the President ofthe Cadiz Provincial Commission was driving on the highway at 3 a.m. when he sawa “luminous, metal-like” object which “moved upward with great brilliancy.” Ashe approached it, he felt a “strange sensation.” His car then came to a nearstop, “wavering back and forth like a feather.”The next day in Cordoba, two teenagers saw a “round, luminous, pink [object],not very large.” The report stated the object “came with great speed at the twochildren, who fled behind a lamp-post. Being further pursued, they ran into ahouse. Object ascended and flew away.”The Defense Attache papers also describe a close encounter from the night ofMarch 26-27 in Valdehijaderos (about 100 miles west of Madrid). A truck driverclaimed to see “three silver ships on the highway with light similar tofloodlight.” Figures approached him, he ran, they followed. He threw himselfonto the road, and they approached to within six feet. The witness saw that theywere tall (two meters, or six and a half feet), had arms and legs, but he couldnot see their faces. They returned to their ships and left. The next day thepolice investigated and found a hole in the ground, which the truck driverclaimed he had not made. More sightings in Cordoba were mentioned for March 27and 28, but with little detail.On March 30, in Hombreiro, Lugo, the Defense Attache papers describe a “blindinglight from hovering object, car engine quit, lights went out. Object flew awaywith whistling sound, car then functioned normally.” On the morning of April 4,at the northern town of Estrada, two 12-year-old girls saw a “metallic,noiseless [object], size of a bus, [with] a reflector in turret. Grey oraluminum in color.” The object “stopped a few seconds about 10 or 12 meters fromthe ground and 100 meters from observers, then went out of sight.”Close encounters were reported from San Pedro on April 11, and Herrera deAlcantara on April 14 (involving a Professor, his wife, and a student). Then, onApril 15, came an intriguing report from the Straights of Gibraltar, between thetowns of Ceuta and Algeciras. Passengers on a ferry between the two cities saw a“round intense torch-like light. . . . Rose out of the water near a huge rock,traveled at low altitude, then fell into the water again. This happened twice.”The same day, at the northwest coastal city of La Coruña, a newspaperphotographer took four photos of a round UFO, which were published in a localnewspaper. Another photograph was taken on the 21st at Hogar de Arriola (Malaga)of a triangular or conical UFO, which also appeared in a local newspaper.Fewer sightings appeared in May, but several involved groups of people whoreported objects flying over their cars. One occurred on May 10 in Alto deCabrejas (one of the few sightings from the eastern part of the country).Another such incident was reported on May 15 in Pedroche. Then, on May 22 on thesmall island of Ibiza, off the Mediterranean coast, the wife of a journalistphotographed an object described in the U.S. Defense report as “somewhat like atop. . . Remained stationary in space for some time, then rose and disappeared.”In June, more reports of tall alien figures appeared. On the 14th in Medellin, a“pot-shaped” craft hovered over a farmhouse while three tall beings with helmetswere visible in a turret at the top of the vehicle. Although it was 4:30 a.m.,the craft illuminated the area “like day.” The defense report described an eventin Caceres on the 16th in which a motorist was pursued for several miles at highspeed by an object giving off “brilliant light.” Three tall figures were seenstanding inside the object. When the witness turned off his car lights, theobject moved away. When he turned them on again, the object rapidly approachedto some 70 meters over his car, following him home until he turned off his carlights again, whereupon it slowly flew away.It is not clear what the U.S. military thought about all this. The reports weretaken from newspaper clippings and forwarded to the Pentagon, “strictly forinformation of those parties interested.” American intelligence specialists didfind it “of interest” to report that in April, “teams of extra sensoryperception specialists held a meeting for the purpose of scientifically studyingthe UFOs seen in that vicinity. Results of this meeting unknown.” The U.S.military’s interest in matters psychic extended beyond mere spectating, but wasalready moving along at high speed, as we shall see. On occasion, the “remoteviewers” of the U.S. defense community even seemed to be bumping into aliens.In addition to the cases in the official documentation from Spain are someunconfirmed ones from elsewhere in Europe, reported years later. A disturbingone concerns a British defense facility in the town of Frimley, near London.This was the Marconi facility, which dealt with classified radar-related defenseprojects. While at work in April 1974, a military employee learned that abreak-in had occurred the night before. Initially, she knew only that the guardon duty suffered a nervous breakdown, was taken to an unnamed hospital, and notseen again. Later, she overheard a discussion in her supervisor’s office andmany years later repeated it “near verbatim” to Nick Redfern: “We have no way ofkeeping these beings out; we just don’t know what to do next. If they can get inhere, they can get in anywhere.” She said she learned that the guard had seen analien sifting through files and papers. A blue light emanated from its helmet,and the being quickly dematerialized before the guard’s eyes. xx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1780116]Another unconfirmed incident from April 1974 is said to have occurred at theIncirlik Air Base in Turkey, about 20 miles northeast of Ankara. This was duringa period of tension between Greece and Turkey. A U.S. serviceman claimed thatwhile on duty at 3 a.m., he saw “a white glowing UFO hover[ing] silently overthe nuclear storage area . . . approximately 500 feet above the ground.” Theobject appeared to be the size of a small car and hovered for about an hour.Then it silently accelerated towards the city of Adana. The witness was abouttwo miles away from the object, but other security personnel were closer. Thefollowing day they told him that the only measures taken “were to set up theirM-60 machines guns, and that they were not to fire on the object unless itinitiated a hostile act.” xxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1780271] To be sure, April 1974 was an interesting month in the ufological history ofEurope.Analyzing the wave as a whole is challenging, if for no other reason than theinability to confirm some of these events with official government records.While the U.S. Defense reports do mean something, they are in the final analysisderived from newspaper clippings. Of course, one may ask why U.S. intelligencepersonnel took the time and effort to forward such reports to the Pentagon.Someone felt they were worthy of note. In addition, there is a consistency amongmany of these cases which transcends national borders, and the quality of atleast some of these witnesses appears to have been high.A word on the value (or lack thereof) of uncorroborated independent testimonymight be in order at this point. The UFO phenomena does not usually affordresearchers the luxury of restraining the observed objects for laboratory studyand universally applicable protocols. Sometimes all one has to work with is areported observation, and this often includes military reports. Different peoplehave different thresholds of what constitutes valid data. Some people discardall testimony that lacks official, government sanction. Others discard allsingle-witness accounts. Others discard cases lacking physical evidence –something you could hold in your hand, for instance. Others eliminate cases thatseem too strange, or simply “impossible.”But the UFO phenomenon is too strange by conventional wisdom, and often involvessolely the claim of a reported witness. If one chooses to consider such reportsworthy of study (and this author does) then the value of the report often comesdown to the quality of the witness and the competence of the investigator. Inthe case of the alleged intrusion of the British defense installation, we haveat least the benefit of an in-depth interview performed by a serious researcher.This surely is better than an anonymous posting to an Internet site, such as thealleged incident in Turkey. Both cases may be true, or neither may be. The sameapplies to the other cases from this wave. Yet, their credibility as somethinganomalous is enhanced by common features they share with each other, as well aswith prior cases. Seen in this light, it is fair to say that something importantwas going on in Europe during the spring of 1974.Such a conclusion is amplified by the statement of Spanish General Carlos CastroCavero, divisional general commanding the air zone of the Canary Islands. InJune 1976, he told journalist J. J. Benitez from La Gaceta del Norte that UFOswere being taken seriously at high levels. The Spanish Air Force, he said, hadabout twenty cases that were “thoroughly inexplicable.” This included Air Forcepilot encounters. He also made the statement that “the nations of the world arecurrently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There isan international exchange of data.” This is an astonishing admission from ageneral of a NATO country, on par with Robert Galley’s remarks from 1974. Caverosaid that “maybe when this group of nations acquire more precise and definiteinformation, it will be possible to release the news to the world.” Of course,one might ask how many years, or decades, would be required before “more preciseand definite information” would be obtained, particularly when the general hadjust admitted that there was a secret, international, collaborative programregarding UFOs. Presumably these intelligent people had been working togetherfor some time by then.Cavero offered his personal belief that “UFOs are spaceships or extraterrestrialcraft.” He even described a personal daylight sighting of a UFO at his ranchnear Zaragoza. The event lasted for more than an hour. “It was an extremelybright object, which remained stationary there for that length of time and thenshot off towards Egea de los Caballeros, covering the distance of twentykilometers in less than two seconds. No human device is capable of such aspeed.” xxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1780486] ET in the Himalayas?Generally speaking, until the 21st century, African and Asian UFO sightings hadbeen little more than addenda to the events reported in more developed parts ofthe world. Undoubtedly, this is due more to industrial development thananomalous activity, translating into better reporting systems for witnesses,although there is also good reason to hypothesize that UFO occupants areinterested in human technology. Statistician Donald Johnson, Ph.D., of CUFOS,for example, conducted a study to determine whether a relationship existedbetween UFO sightings and nuclear facilities. He concluded it did. xxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1780803] During the first half of 1974, there were a few interesting reportsemanating from the world’s two largest continents. Mostly, these were from moredeveloped regions: a March 17 aerial encounter by a TWA airliner over Taiwanxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1781021] ; anunusual crash of a Japanese F-4E Phantom in June which appears to have beenrelated to an encounter with a bright UFO; xxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1781187] a closeencounter and possible abduction case in Rhodesia (modern Zimbabwe) in late May.xxvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1781386] But it was the June 15 sighting of a UFO by a Tibetan mountain climberin the Himalayan Mountains that could be the most interesting of the Third Worldat that time. While inspecting a rock formation on the upper slopes of MountDahjar, Keo Wha Unan emerged from a cave to see a “silvery disc hovering behinda crest of high rocks.” Keo said the object was “windowless . . . shiny,silvery, spotless.” It looked perfectly smooth, with no ridges or protrusions.Keo saw the object hovering about four feet off the ground, surrounded by three“humanoid” beings. They appeared to be gathering snow, ice, and rocks andputting them in their craft. He observed the activity for five minutes, when“they climbed aboard by means of a ladder-like device that descended from thecenter of the thing (saucer), and when they were inside, the machine started tohum.” The object rose a little bit into the air and “like a flash, shot straightup and disappeared behind a variety of thick snow clouds.” xxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1781596] The story is interesting on its own merits, but also because of the history ofthe region. Tibetan UFO stories go back into ancient times. One of the earliestsightings of the twentieth century occurred nearby in 1926. In the 1990s andinto the 21st century, reports of UFO activity in the Himalayas would increase,accompanying rumors of permanent underground alien activity. Landed UFOs in AlbuquerqueWhile Western Europe was undergoing actividad extraña in 1974, little ofinterest was recorded by America’s four major UFO organizations. However, asignificant event appears to have occurred near Albuquerque, New Mexico, on May28, 1974, although it was barely remarked upon at the time. On that clear andsunny day, a resident of Albuquerque observed a large glowing object movingacross the western face of the Sandia Mountains. It was so bright that he couldnot discern its structure. He opened his window and heard no sound coming fromit. The object appeared to land on a nearby hill where it remained for over anhour. It then shot into the air and vanished. Some time later, an Albuquerquewoman looking out her kitchen window saw an object cruising along a northerlycourse over the low hills near her home. She called to her husband to watch itwith her; together they watched the object now flying easterly at an altitude ofabout two thousand feet.NICAP, although no longer a very active investigative organization, did lookinto this incident. The couple told the investigator that they believed thecraft was flat, “like viewing a coin on end,” and perhaps 50 to 75 feet indiameter. It was greyish and did not reflect the afternoon sunlight. It appearedto be rotating around a central axis. NICAP checked with county police andlearned that no reports were made. xxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1781858] Years later, TV producer and investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe delvedfurther into this matter, discovering that the area had experienced a number ofsightings of unusual aerial vehicles during the month of May 1974. She alsointerviewed several Albuquerque eyewitnesses who reported startling accountsfrom the date of May 28, 1974.Three young men, each about twenty years old, were camping fairly high up on theSandia Mountains. Around noon, through binoculars, they watched an area betweenMenaul and Copper, on the dirt trail side of Tramway Boulevard. There, they sawa silver-white disc resting on the ground. Next to it was a silvertriangular-shaped craft that had odd rune-like symbols cut into one of thepointed ends. These men ended up in military detainment at Kirtland AFB, wherethey were interrogated by civilian intelligence agents wearing suits. Theinterrogators asked many questions about the symbols and told the young men theyhad seen a “Soviet incident,” and were to keep their mouths shut. To back uptheir threat of retaliation if the men ever talked, the agents stressed thattheir communications would be monitored at all times, including phone calls.Only one of the three was willing to talk with Howe in 2008, thirty-four yearsafter the Sandia event.Howe’s investigation also led her to a family which saw a large, glowing,football-shaped disc later that evening, at around 9 p.m. The object was movingfrom the south of Albuquerque to the northeast, slowly and steadily downward tothe Sandia Mountain foothills on the eastern edge of the city. Excited, they gotinto their car and followed dirt roads off Menaul and Tramway Boulevard as faras they could go, until they were stopped by a state patrol officer. Beyond theofficer, the family was astonished to see the glowing craft hovering low to theside of a rocky hill. It was surrounded by armed military security personnelwhich faced the object. xxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1782052] Was this a recovery – or operation – of one or more UFOs? All Quiet in the WestOther than the Albuquerque incident, very little UFO activity of anysignificance was recorded in the western hemisphere. One of the few interestingAmerican cases of the year took place on February 14, about 55 miles north ofEly, Nevada. This is close to Utah, and about 150 miles from the Nevada TestSite. Two brothers were transporting their parents’ furniture in a U-haul truckwhen, at 4:15 a.m., they noticed a round orange object that seemed at first topace them, and then to approach. They described feeling as though they had “beenhit by a blast of wind or force field.” The engine and lights went out, steeringwas gone, and – they claimed – the truck floated momentarily, came back down andcoasted to a stop. Ahead of them to the left, just over a hill, they saw a largespherical object with a domed top and sharp wings. At the same time, a hugelighted object– perhaps the original orange object – approached. It was stillfairly dark, so one brother directed his flashlight at it (although shining aflashlight at a bright object makes little sense). At this point the brothershad a sensation of intense isolation from the rest of the world which lasted forperhaps twenty minutes. The disjointed nature of their account leads to theconclusion that they either concocted one hell of a story, or else had an evenmore bizarre experience not fully related. In any event, their truck was badlydamaged, and they eventually flagged down a passing driver. When a tow truckhauled it away, the rear wheels of the damaged truck fell off. Upon examination,it needed new tires, a new rear axle, new outside housing, and gears. xxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1782285] Elsewhere in the west, a few odd air encounters occurred, such as aMarch 13 event on an Argentine Airlines flight, when an airliner en route fromSan Juan to Argentina was flanked by two glowing objects which paced it forseveral minutes, then sped away. xxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1782537] Anotherairliner sighting occurred in July near Quebec City, Canada, when a ScandinavianAirlines reported a triangular-shaped object; the Bagotville Airport in Quebecreportedly experienced radio frequency interference. xxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1782703] On October 10,another air encounter occurred over Newfoundland, when Canadian Armed Forcespilot John Breen reported being paced by a green, pulsating, triangular object.The object did not track on radar, but it reflected in the water below. xxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1782858] A few UFO sightings by police agencies were reported during the year.Two came from the same area within a month of each other, describing what seemedto be the same object. On July 9 in Kingston, New York, an elliptical objectwith body lights hovered low and moved toward a police car. When an officerturned a spotlight on the object, a brilliant white beam lit up his patrol car.On August 11 in the nearby area of Tilton and Concord, New Hampshire, two policeofficers saw a domed elliptical object approach their car, then veer away. xxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1783059] There is norecord as to how either police force dealt with these encounters.Back in 1967 there had been an account of a strangely mutilated horse inconnection with possible UFO activity. A few similar events were occasionallyreported over the next couple of years. By 1974, mutilations were receiving moremedia attention. An Associated Press (AP) wire service story on April 30, 1974,mentioned that some people were connecting mutilations to UFOs, although mostUFO researchers remained hesitant. xxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1783222] Anotherinteresting cattle connection – although not a mutilation case – occurred onSeptember 1, 1974, in Langenburg, Saskatchewan, when a man saw five dome-shapedobjects either landed or hovering low over a pasture. They took off in formationand climbed into the clouds. Cattle nearby were bellowing and broke through afence. At the landing area were five rings of depressed grass swirled in acounterclockwise fashion; there was no evidence of heat or burning. The RoyalCanadian Mounted Police looked into this case, and did not believe this was ahoax. “Something was there,” one officer told the press. Other circles werefound in the area later that month. Researcher Jerome Clark called this a“classic case.” xxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1783459] An interesting story from the autumn of 1974 was described in a June1989 issue of Soviet Military Review , in an article entitled “UFOs andSecurity.” The article stated:. . . a metal disk some 100 metres (sic) across approached a South Koreananti-aircraft short battery. The commander launched a Hawk guided missile whichwas immediately shot down by a ‘white ray’ from the UFO. A second ray wasdirected at the battery, melting the remaining two Hawk missiles into anunrecognisable (sic) mess. xxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1783739]The story lacks confirmation from separate sources, but it is one of many thatwere reported in the Soviet Union during the period of openness that precededthe collapse of that government. It is comparable to the many stories from theWest (both confirmed and unconfirmed) describing hostile encounters by militaryaircraft with UFOs.In November, an interesting UFO event occurred at the Yakima Indian reservation,a place with a long history of anomalous sightings. This is in centralWashington, not far from Mt. Rainier where Kenneth Arnold saw flying discs in1947. The undated November 1974 sighting took place at about 8 p.m., when somepeople who were getting together for a visit saw a yellowish glowing object inthe distance. Not thinking much about it, they went inside. Two hours later,some of them stepped outside to notice that the light was closer now, positionedon the ground, and more intense. No one knew what to do. At 11 p.m., as thevisitors were leaving and everyone stepped out on the porch, they saw a cylindersuspended in the air only ten feet away from the porch and about fifteen feetabove the ground. It was about three feet long and over a foot in diameter, in avertical orientation, and slowly rotating clockwise. Two thirds up from thebottom of the cylinder, and projecting out at a 90 degree angle, was a long,narrow beam of light about 2 inches in diameter and 3 feet long. This went onfor ten minutes. Not wanting to approach the object, everyone went back inside.Thirty minutes later, the object was gone. For years Yakima continued to be thescene of anomalous lights and objects. xxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1783968]One final case from 1974 bears mentioning. This occurred on December 18, and isrecorded in a U.S. Defense memo – courtesy of a Freedom of Information Actrequest a few years later. The document describes what could well have been acovert military exercise or experiment. In the region bordered by Pakistan,Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union, many witnesses saw a strange light. The memostated that “a phenomenon appeared in the sky” near Peshawar, Pakistan, forabout fifteen minutes that evening. It appeared as “an immense half ball ofyellowish brown smoke silhouetted against the black sky.” No one could tell howdistant it was, or whether it was even over Afghanistan or the Soviet Union.xxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1784220] Somespeculation followed that this might have been a barium cloud experiment. Eightdays after this event, the area was struck by an earthquake. xl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1784490] Interesting,but not evidence of anything truly anomalous. Nixon, Gleason, and Alien BodiesThe UFO phenomenon provides not only an endless supply of instances in whichpeople see things that defy all common sense, but an endless supply of intrigue,as well. During any year, almost at any time, something interesting andimportant concerning the topic occurs out of public view, becoming yet anotherpart of humanity’s secret history. In such a context, the question arises as towhat extent Richard Nixon can be connected to the phenomenon. As all Presidentsbefore him, he never made any controversial statements on the matter during histime in office. There is, however, one Nixon UFO story worth noting.Nixon was in Florida in February 1973. While there, he met with Jackie Gleasonat the Inverness Golf and Country Club. The two men were friends, and Gleasonhad a deep interest in UFOs (including a collection of 1,700 books on UFOs andrelated topics). Some years later, Gleason’s second wife, Beverly McKittrick,wrote an unpublished manuscript in which she claimed Gleason returned home veryshaken that night. He told her that the President had taken him to a heavilysecured area at Homestead AFB and showed him the remains of small aliens in asecret repository.The story was certainly dynamite, and others tried to follow up. UFO researcherLarry Bryant filed a FOIA request with Homestead, asking to see documentation onthe repository and Gleason’s alleged visit. He received the reply that “no suchrecords existed.” Bryant also sent an advertisement to the Homestead basenewspaper seeking to contact anyone who could provide information about alienbodies or Gleason’s visit. The base public affairs officer prevented thepublication of the ad.McKittrick’s claim was repeated by Larry Warren, who himself had witnessed a UFOat an American military base in Britain, the 1980 Bentwaters case. Warren saidthat Gleason told him the Homestead story in May 1986 during a private meeting.After a few drinks, Gleason said, “I want to tell you something very amazingthat will probably come out some day anyway. We’ve got em!” “Got what,” askedWarren. “Aliens!,” said Gleason. He told Warren that near midnight, followingNixon’s public appearance with Gleason, Nixon showed up at his house – alone,without secret service agents. The two drove to the far end of the HomesteadAFB, to a well-guarded building. The security police “just sort of moved back aswe passed them and entered the structure.” They passed several labs, and thenentered an area where Nixon pointed out wreckage from what he said was a flyingsaucer, enclosed in several large cases. Gleason asked if this was a joke.Apparently not.They entered an inner room with six or eight glass-topped freezers. Inside, saidGleason, “were the mangled remains of what I took to be children.” Upon closerinspection, he saw that some of the figures looked old and as though they hadbeen injured. Gleason could not remember if the aliens had three or four fingerson each hand, but he was certain they were not human. For three weeks after thesecret visit, Gleason could not sleep or eat. He later learned that the secretservice had been “going absolutely crazy trying to find out where Nixon was.”UFO researcher Grant Cameron asked, how could the most protected man in theworld elude his secret service detail? According to Lewis Merletti, the SecretService Director under President Clinton, the idea is nonsense, and only happensin the movies. However, Marty Venker, a secret service agent under PresidentsFord and Carter, believed otherwise. Venker described in his book how somePresidents were able to get some privacy. Nixon, said Venker, felt almostsuffocated by his secret service, often tried to elude them, and even tried tocut his protection in 1973. xli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1784642] Cameron, whose “Presidential UFO” website analyzes the modern AmericanPresidency in relation to UFOs, concedes that there is no proof that Nixon andGleason saw alien bodies at Homestead. “But everything checked out indicates itcould very well have happened.” xlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1784857] The Ronald Reagan UFO SightingAlthough the event has been ignored by academic historians, Ronald Reagan had agenuine UFO sighting as Governor of California in 1974. Reagan and his pilotBull Paynter both made statements; although neither supplied a specific date,the event probably occurred during the summer. Looking out the window of aCessna Citation between 9 and 10 p.m., Reagan saw a bright white lightzigzagging across the sky. He asked Paynter if he had ever seen anything likeit. Paynter had not. “Let’s follow it!,” said Reagan, which they did for severalminutes. Then, according to Reagan, “to our utter amazement, it went straight upinto the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it . . . Andwe read up on the long history of UFOs.” Indeed, a week later Reagan sat next toNorman Miller of the Wall Street Journal while on another flight, and told himabout the sighting with great animation and enthusiasm. “Governor,” Millarasked, “are you telling me that you saw a UFO?” As Miller later recalled thesituation, Reagan realized that he was talking to a reporter. “This look crossedhis face,” said Miller, “and he said let’s just say that I’m agnostic.”Bull Paynter gave more detail when he was interviewed about it. They were nearBakersfield, Paynter said, when they saw the object. “It appeared to be severalhundred yards away,” he said, “It was a fairly steady light until it began toaccelerate, then it appeared to elongate. Then the light took off. It went up ata 45-degree angle at a high rate of speed. Everyone on the plane was surprised.Governor Reagan expressed amazement.” Paynter told the others he did not knowwhat the object was. “The UFO went from a normal cruise speed to a fantasticspeed instantly. . . If you give an airplane power it will accelerate – but notlike a hot rod, and that's what this was like.” According to Paynter, he andReagan discussed their UFO sighting “from time to time” in the following years,but they never filed a report “because for a long time they considered you a nutif you saw a UFO....” xliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1785051]This story sat quietly for many years before it leaked out in 1988, as afootnote in a book dealing with Reagan’s second Presidential term. The authorsof that study learned of it from Norman Miller, who had never reported theconversation in the Wall Street Journal because he “could not figure out how toget a whole column out of it.” This is an odd claim: even a brief statement fromthe current President on an exciting UFO encounter – one vastly more interestingthan the Jimmy Carter sighting of 1969 – would merit worldwide attention. Whatseems more likely is that the Wall Street Journal , a newspaper very sympatheticto President Reagan during his eight years in the White House, simply decidedthat running such a story would be counterproductive. Certainly, Reagan’s staffworked hard to conceal potentially embarrassing family tidbits from leaking tothe public, whether it be Ronald (and daughter Maureen) Reagan’s belief that aghost inhabited the Lincoln Bedroom, Nancy Reagan’s longtime reliance onastrology, or Ronald Reagan’s 1974 UFO sighting. xliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1785526] Reagan’s interest in UFOs preceded his 1974 sighting. Anotherjournalist, Bill Boyarsky of the Los Angeles Times , told of a conversation hehad with Reagan in 1965. “We were looking up at the stars and Reagan told me hebelieved in flying saucers. He said he had a friend who’d actually seen one.”xlv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1785733] Perhaps that “friend” was Reagan himself, for there is another storyconcerning a Reagan UFO sighting which allegedly took place not long afterRonald and Nancy were married in 1952. They were expected at a dinner party inHollywood and showed up late, ashen and upset. They told the others that theyhad seen a UFO. In one version that was told to the author by a former friend ofReagan, they said an object landed in front of them on the road. Not much moreis known of the story. xlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1785910] When Ronald Reagan became President of the United States in 1981, he showed anunusual interest in the matter of UFOs, as well as all matters paranormal. Political Crisis and Freedom of InformationWithin the U.S., the important developments in 1974 were not ufological butpolitical. Most important was the resignation of President Nixon on August 8,the only time an American President ever resigned from office. Nixon’sresignation was a combination of Congressional authority reasserting itselfagainst the Executive, and a probable ouster orchestrated by other elementswithin the American power structure.By 1974, America had already come a long way toward replacing its traditionalrepublican institutions with an unaccountable national security apparatus. Backin 1947, the National Security Act created an array of intelligence groups andexecutive bodies without active congressional oversight. This not only includedthe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA), butmost military intelligence agencies. Several powerful intelligence agencies,such as the NSA and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), existed for yearswithout congressional knowledge. The war in Vietnam further weakenedcongressional authority. Not only were more than half a million U.S. troopsfighting on the other side of the world without a legal declaration of war, butCongress had rubber stamped President Johnson’s Gulf of Tonkin resolution, thede facto declaration of war, based upon intelligence that was deeply flawed and(in the opinion of some historians) intentionally deceptive.When it became clear that the Vietnam War was a disaster, the backlash wasstrong. By the early 1970s came the release of the infamous Pentagon Papers,revelations of FBI “black bag” jobs, and ultimately the Watergate scandal, inwhich it became painfully obvious that the President had authorized an illegalbreak-in of the Democratic Party Campaign Headquarters. Watergate was in alllikelihood allowed to occur, and quite possibly made to occur. Several keygroups, not just Congress, benefitted from Nixon’s downfall. Author Peter DaleScott pointed out that media institutions such as the Washington Post and majortelevision networks thought they were fighting for their lives and felt they hadto take Nixon down. The CIA connection was also important. Nixon had never beenhappy with the CIA. In 1970, he unsuccessfully tried to overhaul the U.S.intelligence community, and in 1972 unceremoniously fired CIA director RichardHelms. The CIA probably infiltrated Nixon’s infamous “plumbers unit” in thepersons of E. Howard Hunt and James McCord. One observer remarked that the CIAwas engaged in a ‘coup d’etat in the making,’ an elite battle at the summit ofAmerican politics. xlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1786136] There was also a populist element in Nixon’s downfall. The civil rightsmovement had already challenged long-established truths about how Americansociety should be structured. Now open-government advocates added their voice inan attempt to bring “power to the people.” An important result was thestrengthening of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as an amendment to thePrivacy Act of July 4, 1974, during the death throes of the Nixonadministration. Agencies were now instructed to release requested documentspromptly and at reasonable cost. Each federal agency had to file an annualreport on its FOIA requests to Congress, an important help for proper oversight.Citizens could also petition courts to render decisions on whether or not torelease documents from agencies. xlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1786419] FOIA soon disproved the longstanding denial of interest in UFOs by the CIA,FBI, and military agencies. Eventually, tens of thousands of UFO-relateddocuments were released from America’s national security establishment. Whilethere would be no single confirmed document proving beyond a shadow of a doubtthe existence of an alien presence on Earth – the ultimate memo from thePresident, for instance – there would be several that were certainly suggestive.In particular, several documents described violations of sensitive air space byunusual and extraordinary objects which, often enough, looked like flyingsaucers. FOIA enabled UFO researchers to demonstrate that such militaryencounters occurred quite a few times.But FOIA also had limitations. Congressional oversight and agency reporting wereusually superficial. Funding was poor and compliance worse. As one journalistput it, “FOIA simply doesn’t work most of the time . . . . There are few newsorganizations and reporters who have the patience, money, and determination towork through what seems an inevitable series of appeals, requests, and otherroadblocks.” UFO researchers found the same problems. During the 1990s, BarryGreenwood, a researcher with extensive FOIA experience, commented that “requestsnow often take months or even years to fulfill. High search fees have beenlevied, from hundreds of dollars to as much as a quarter of a million dollars.”xlix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1786670] A newtradition of government intransigence tried to prevent the release ofinformation through hundreds of court cases. Paul McMasters, a former nationalpresident of the Society of Professional Journalists, pointed out that “with fewexceptions, court decisions have favored the agencies, especially in cases thatinvolve personal privacy or national security.” l[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1786898] UFO cases come to mind, as they so frequently have involved nationalsecurity. Adding to the problem were a number of obvious exemptions to FOIA,such as the NSA and North American Air Defense (NORAD). li[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1787117] Of thethousands of released UFO documents, only the smallest handful had beenclassified at the level of “Top Secret,” such as several infamous blacked-outNSA documents. Most of the released documents were classified at lower levels,such as “Secret,” “Restricted,” or “Confidential.” While these still had value,it became evident that the truly sensitive documents were simply not beingreleased. Especially so since one 1949 FBI document stated that the topic offlying saucers was considered “top secret by Intelligence Officers of both theArmy and the Air Forces.” lii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1787292]Thus, as UFO researchers would learn over the next few years, FOIA was no magicbullet. But such disappointment still lay in the future. In 1974, there was muchto hope for. Behind the Scenes: The Elite OrganizationsRichard Nixon’s resignation resulted in the ascendency of Gerald R. Ford to theWhite House. It was the first time a man who was not elected to either thePresidency or Vice Presidency had ever become President. Nixon had selected Fordfor his Vice President when Spiro Agnew resigned amidst a corruption scandal.Ford had previously received scant public attention; he was known primarily as aCongressman from Michigan who had been a member of the 1966 Warren Commission.That charade had been headed by former CIA Director Allen Dulles to investigatethe assassination of President John F. Kennedy.Gerald Ford was a man with the right connections, deeply connected to people andgroups at the pinnacle of world power. He was a 33rd Degree Freemason, a memberof the influential Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), and had attended fiveannual meetings of the secretive and powerful Bilderberg Group (1962, 1964,1965, 1966, and 1970).What were these organizations? Did the Bilderbergers, CFR, and other closedsocieties exert an important covert influence on the American and worldpolitics, as has often been alleged? Is the answer relevant in understanding theUFO phenomenon and cover-up? The unsettling answer to both questions appears tobe ‘yes,’ although finding direct links to the UFO cover-up will not be easy.The CFR, founded in 1921, is generally considered to be the most powerfulprivate organization to influence U.S. foreign policy. Founded by Elihu Root(the attorney for J. P. Morgan), it has represented the wealthiest and mostpowerful interests in the U.S. Indeed, the presence of the Rockefeller familyhas been the most important feature of the organization’s history. John D.Rockefeller, Jr. was a major benefactor. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund providedmajor funding for decades. David Rockefeller joined the Council as itsyoungest-ever director in 1949 and was chairman of the board from 1970 to 1985.The CFR’s internal think tank is called The David Rockefeller Studies Program.The CFR describes itself as “an American nonpartisan foreign policy membershiporganization,” with the mission of “promoting understanding of foreign policyand the United States’ role in the world.” Journalist Joseph Kraft, a former CFRmember, more accurately described it as coming “close to being an organ of whatC. Wright Mills has called the Power Elite – a group of men, similar in interestand outlook, shaping events from invulnerable positions behind the scenes.” CFRmembers have dominated every Presidential administration since the days ofFranklin Delano Roosevelt, whether Republican or Democrat.The main thrust of all CFR policies is the promotion of a stable internationalorder under a single governing body. Whether one calls it conspiracy or not,calling it a form of “world government” is fair enough. Prominent CFR membershave often stated the matter openly. James P. Warburg, a major banker,economist, and member of FDR’s administration, told a Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee in 1950 that “we shall have world government whether or not we likeit. The only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquestor consent.” A half century later, David Rockefeller was saying the same thing:Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the bestinterests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as“internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build amore integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if youwill. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it. liii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1787483]Indeed, at least as early as 1976 if not earlier, the phrase “New World Order”was being used in connection with the goals of the Rockefeller family.Researcher Gary Allen wrote that the Rockefeller brothers themselves used thisphrase to describe their global vision. liv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1787653]The Bilderbergers are an international and more powerful version of the CFR,again dominated by David Rockefeller, but also with major influence by membersof European royal families and the Rothschilde banking dynasty. Its firstmeeting was in 1954 at the Bilderberg Hotel in the Netherlands (hence thegroup’s name), and was said to be founded by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,a man with prior connections to the Nazis and a major figure in Shell Oil. Thegroup’s true driving force was Joseph Retinger, a member of the London-basedPolish government-in-exile during World War II and also – for what it is worth –a 33rd degree Mason. According to investigator Daniel Estulin, who has doneextensive work on the Bilderbergers, Retinger wanted “to unite the world inpeace” through the imposition of supranational, powerful organizations.Prevailing economic ideologies were irrelevant to Retinger. Multinationalorganizations could overcome any differences by dictating and applying economicand military policies. lv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1787827] The Bilderberg Group is managed by a small nucleus, made up of aEuropean Chairman, a European and American Secretary General, and a Treasurer.They invite only those with “special knowledge, personal contacts and influencein national and international circles, [who] can amplify the objectives andresources of the Bilderberg Group.” lvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1788157] If by“resources” one can assume “money,” then the Bilderbergers actively seek toincrease their own wealth by influencing major geopolitical events and trends.According to Estulin, “every U.S. President since ‘Ike’ Eisenhower has belongedto the Bilderberg Group, not that they have all attended the meetingspersonally, but all have sent their representatives.” lvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1788346] The annualBilderberg meetings are notorious for their absolute secrecy. Media coverage isabsolutely off-limits, despite the regular attendance of important journalists(as participants). The gathering of 150 of arguably the world’s most influentialpeople is easily of equal or greater importance than a G-20 summit. Although itwould be inconceivable for the G-20 to convene without any press coverage, theBilderbergers have avoided it for more than half a century.Returning to the Presidency of Gerald Ford, it may now seem unsurprising that heselected New York State Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be his Vice President.Perhaps in retrospect it is also less of a surprise that Gerald Ford was subjectto not one but two assassination attempts during his short tenure as President.They are interesting as a study in contrasts. On September 5, 1975, Lynette“Squeaky” Fromme, a one-time member of the Charles Manson “family,” approachedFord in California at Sacramento’s Capitol Park, dressed in a red robe and armedwith a .45 Colt automatic pistol. Although she pointed the gun at Ford with fourrounds in the gun’s magazine, none were in the firing chamber. She later toldthe press that she had deliberately ejected the cartridge before leaving homethat morning; it was later found by investigators in her bathroom.Fromme’s “non-assassination attempt” became the one that the public rememberedbest. In fact, a real assassination attempt occurred against Gerald Ford laterthat month in San Francisco on September 22 by another woman, Sara Jane Moore.Moore was 40 feet away from Ford when she fired a shot at him with a .38 caliberpistol. The bullet missed Ford because a bystander pulled her to the ground. Shelater said she was trying to expose America’s “phony system of government” byelevating Nelson Rockefeller to the Presidency. She made strange hints of aconspiracy – which somehow was not a conspiracy – during an interview withPlayboy in June 1976.[There is] a part that I don’t think I can talk about. I just haven’t figuredout a way to talk about it and protect everyone. I’m not saying that anyonehelped me plan it. I’m not just saying that there are other things. . . whichmeans there are other people, though not in terms of a conspiracy. There areareas I’m not willing to talk about for a lot of reasons.Moore’s statement was positively odd. Were there other people involved, or not?She did not say, but the Rockefeller connection must give one pause. Adding tothe mystery was the action of U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who sealed allthe evidence pertaining to the case. lviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1788544] Perhaps thiswas all part of the Rockefeller family’s plan to get Nelson into the WhiteHouse, something they are alleged to have whimsically planned for many years.Or, perhaps it was just “one of those things.”Whether or not traditional UFO researchers have seen the relevance, such“behind-the-scenes” groups as the Bilderbergers, the CFR, and the TrilateralCommission have an important influence on conventional geopolitics. If there isa UFO cover-up of any sort, one must accept the possibility that they wield anunseen hand here, too. Logically, a topic of such extraordinary and far-reachingimplications as this one would be of great interest to them. One can imaginethat they would also be interested in deriving as much profit from it aspossible. The Emenegger-Sandler Intrigue1974 appears to have been the year of an abortive attempt at releasing aufological bombshell on the public, by none other than the United States AirForce. The story goes back to the previous May (1973), when film makers RobertEmenegger and Alan Sandler were making a UFO documentary. The two were contactedby Colonel Robert Coleman, a former spokesperson for the defunct Project BlueBook, and Colonel George Weinbrenner, who had previously commanded the AirTechnical Intelligence Center (ATIC) at Wright-Patterson AFB.The colonels told the producers that the government was planning to release UFOinformation to the public, and that this documentary would be the first step inthat process. They said they could provide extraordinary documents and images,including film footage of an alien accompanied by an Air Force officer (thealien had survived a 1949 crash and was kept at a safe house in Los Alamos untilit died in 1952), a memo discussing an encounter between six CIA officers and analien by the name of “Affa,” secret photos of UFOs taken by astronauts, andmore. The colonels also promised 800 feet of film showing an encounter betweenthree aliens and officials at Holloman AFB in New Mexico. This had allegedlyoccurred in May 1971 (although other testimony has placed a landing there inApril 1964).The colonels then took Emenegger and Sandler – still in May 1973 – on a tour ofthe CIA’s National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC), and then theproducers went to Norton AFB in California. While there, they met with PaulShartle, former head of security and chief of requirements for the audiovisualprogram at the base. Shartle promised them that he would get them the Hollomanfootage for their documentary.But then nothing happened. Months went by, the colonels never followed up, andthe film makers were left wondering what happened. Meanwhile, they continuedmaking their film. Finally, Emenegger received a call from Coleman, who told himthat “the timing was politically inappropriate, due to the Watergate scandal.”Emenegger went to Wright-Patterson to talk to Weinbrenner. Inside the colonel’soffice, Weinbrenner walked around and loudly complained about the “damn MIG25s.” Meanwhile, he walked to his bookshelf, picked out J. Allen Hynek’s The UFOExperience , and showed Emenegger Hynek’s personal dedication to Weinbrenner onthe inside cover. As Emenegger understood it, Weinbrenner did not want to beoverheard in a bugged office, but was “confirming the reality of the [Holloman]film.”UFOs: Past, Present, and Future was released in 1974. Because the Hollomanfootage was not forthcoming, the producers used stock footage of Holloman and an“elaborate drawing of the so-called aliens.” The film showed a “landing” byaliens at a hypothetical military base while narrator Rod Serling said “let uslook at an incident that might happen in the future, or perhaps could havehappened already.”The film became the topic of discussion among researchers. Then, on a 1988television documentary, “UFO Cover-up: Live!”, Emenegger declared, “what I sawand heard was enough to convince me that the phenomenon of UFOs is real, veryreal.” Shartle also appeared in that documentary and described the Hollomanlanding footage. He said it showed “three disc-shaped craft.” He continued:“One of the craft landed and two of them went away . . . It appeared to be introuble because it oscillated all the way down to the ground. However, it didland on three pods. A sliding door opened, a ramp was extended, and out camethree aliens . . . They were human size. They had odd grey complexions and apronounced nose. They wore tight-fitting jump suits, thin headdresses thatappeared to be communications devices, and in their hands they held atranslator, I was told. The Holloman base commander and other Air Force officerswent out to meet them . . . ”Another tidbit from Shartle and Emenegger was that 12 seconds of the film usedin the documentary had been actual film of the Holloman landing. The film“slipped through the security net,” said Shartle.What do we make of this story? UFO researcher Grant Cameron, who looked intothis extensively, believed that this was in all likelihood an abortive attemptat some form of UFO disclosure by government insiders. Since there was no publicpressure on the government to do this, it was apparently all on insiderinitiative. He noted that several important groups were involved in covertfunding for the film, such as the John MacArthur Foundation. Foundations have along history of serving as fronts for intelligence operations to help protectidentities. Cameron also pointed to a number of statements from the early- andmid-1970s claiming that there would soon be a release of UFO information: a 1974APRO statement (“the government will release all its (UFO) information withinthe next three years,”); a National Examiner piece from late 1974 stating that “. . . the government is almost ready to release some of the [UFO] information ithas reportedly withheld from the public”; and predictions by various UFO authorsof “definite proof” being provided within the next year or two. The sum total ofthese separate facts and statements, argued Cameron, leaves the impression thatthere was a genuine behind-the-scenes effort by the government at UFOdisclosure.Perhaps, but it is also possible that something else was going on. Since the1950s, the UFO field has been filled with a nearly non-stop barrage of rumorspredicting an imminent government disclosure. It could be that this reflects anongoing, start-and-stop, series of efforts to release the information, orwishful thinking combined with fantasy and disinformation, or a combination ofboth. There can be no question, however, that – like the claim of the apostlePaul regarding the imminent return of Christ – the claim of imminent governmentdisclosure has become one of ufology’s ‘never ending stories.’ lix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1788849] On the other hand, a suggestive element about the Emenegger-Sandler film is howthe drama seems to parallel some of the key events concerning Richard Nixon.Nixon and Gleason allegedly saw dead aliens at Homestead AFB in February 1973.Three months later, Emmeneger and Sandler were told that the government wasplanning to release UFO data. Later, during the collapse of Nixon’s politicalpower, the film makers were told that Watergate had made the incipient UFOdisclosure initiative unviable at the moment. Could it be that Nixon himselfgave an order to initiate the process of UFO disclosure? Could the order havecome from elsewhere? 1975: An Extraordinary YearWhereas 1974 had moments of great UFO activity as well as fairly quiet periods,1975 was one of the most significant years in the modern history of thephenomenon. Several major themes emerge from a review of that year.The UFO research community was busy. A new “psycho-social” school began toexplain UFOs as psychologically and socially significant – but not asobjectively real. Meanwhile, other researchers used the Freedom of InformationAct to petition government agencies for UFO-related documents, an approach thatincreasingly focused on real events and real technology. Abduction research,long relegated to the peripheries, also became more prevalent. Indeed, severalimportant abduction cases were reported during the year, including one of themost spectacular ever, the “fire in the sky” case of Travis Walton.The phenomenon itself displayed all its variety and complexity during the year,and the United States was definitely where the action was. Many of the sightingsinvolved U.S. military forces, including cases in which sensitive airspace wasviolated and attempted interceptions failed. 1975 also marked a large increasein the number of animal mutilations reported in the United States and Canada.The unusual animal deaths had been reported since the 1960s, often linked byrancher and law enforcement eyewitnesses to unidentified lights, beams, oraerial craft. But in 1975, another new development emerged that was linked toboth animal deaths and UFOs: mysterious black helicopters. These were oftenblack and unmarked, appearing at the scene where mutilations had either justoccurred or were about to occur. They often flew along paths with littleprevious air traffic, and sometimes acted in scary ways – like hovering directlyover people’s homes in sparsely populated areas. No agency ever tookresponsibility for them, and their official status remains unknown.The question arises whether secret military technologies could have accountedfor the events of 1975. A “yes” answer would be only marginally less explosivethan a “no,” for it would have to explain why such extraordinary technology hasremained secret for so long. It would also have to explain why such a secretoperation would antagonize military forces charged with operating nuclearmissiles. Finally, some funding questions would need to be answered, to wit:where would the money have come from to pay for such amazingly extravaganttechnology?There is, of course, another line of speculation, that the dramatic UFOsightings of the year were caused by an entirely separate group. Presumably thiswould mean “alien,” although – who knows? – could there be a rogue society withaccess to incredible wealth and technology? Or could aliens be using humans fortheir purposes in some capacity, perhaps breeding their own human population,perhaps enhancing them as appropriate for their specific needs?The author concedes that above thoughts are quite candid attempts to speculate.Speculation is not a bad thing, however, as long as it proceeds from what isknown. That is, from fact. With this in mind, let us tell the story of 1975. 1975: UFOs and the Spanish Military AgainAlthough the most remarkable UFO sightings occurred during the latter half of1975, perplexing events happened year-round. Spain entered the new year with twoUFO encounters by military personnel. The first occurred about ten miles fromthe town of Burgos, in the northern part of the country on the same longitude asMadrid. Four individuals who had been celebrating New Year’s eve were returningto their military base academy. Although they had been enjoying themselves, nonewere drunk and one had taken no alcohol at all. At 6:45 a.m., the driver sawsomething fall from the sky, and he stopped the car. A quarter mile distant, thefour men saw a luminous body “with the form of a truncated cone,” which appearedto be hovering low over the ground. The object’s light then went out and wasreplaced by four lights. The men were nervous, and the driver had troublestarting the vehicle before he drove away. Through the windows, the soldierswatched the lights, and noticed that two other vehicles behind them were nearthe phenomenon.Almost immediately, the story reached the academy’s director and his assistant,a Major Llorente. The Major met with the four men the very afternoon of January1, and they traveled to the location. Behind a line of bushes they found a largespot of burned grass about 100 feet long and 15 feet wide. Local farmers saidthe burning of fields had been done several months before, but this lookedrecent. According to Major Llorente, the four men were “completely trustworthysoldiers.” As to what they saw, “that is something neither they nor I, norperhaps anyone, knows.” lx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1789150] One hundred miles to the east, on the night of January 2, Spanishmilitary personnel had another UFO sighting. At 11:30 p.m., an officer andseveral soldiers saw two luminous, dome-shaped objects either land or hover verylow on the firing range at Las Bardenas Reales near Zaragoza Airbase in Navarra,not far from the French border. The objects had orange and white body lights,and moved very close to ground at low speed. Suddenly they accelerated andclimbed away. The Spanish Air Force investigation showed ‘no contradictions’ inthe reports. The encounter is interesting also because it derives fromdeclassified Spanish military UFO files. lxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1789318] UFOs Over Montana MissilesThe rest of January was uneventful, but February included two unusual eventsfrom the Indian Ocean. On February 14, 1975, on the tiny French island ofReunion, about 450 miles east of Madagascar, a man named Antoine Severin claimedto see the landing of a small domed object in a field. He said that severalsmall entities left the object and fired a white beam of light at him, knockinghim out. For several days he had poor vision, impaired speech, and a medicaldiagnosis of shock. Police investigated the case and believed he was mentallysound and sincere. Many strongly supportive character statements on Severin wereobtained by investigators. Apparently, no one involved in the case realized thatthe details were a perfect fit with a wave of sightings that occurred in Franceduring the autumn of 1954, and was also reminiscent of a 1965 French case whichinvolved claims of paralysis caused by a beam emitted by alien entities. Thefact that Reunion was a French island leads one to wonder what cultural orlinguistic connections were going on here. Is this an instance in which thewitness knew of the prior cases and perpetrated a “copycat?” Based on thedetailed investigation that took place, it would seem the answer is no, and thatthe experience was genuine. lxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1789649] The case admittedly is not the strongest in the long history of UFOs.Yet, this type of craft has long been reported around the world. Just two weekslater, on February 26, on the other side of the ocean, an object similar inappearance was seen at Lake Sorell, Tasmania. A domed disc with an intenseorange glow emitted a beam of light down on the lake. The witness said it spedaway at “colossal speed.” lxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1790241] These caseswould be easier to dismiss if they were less common.On March 2, 1975, another disc-shaped craft was reported, this time by a policeofficer in Phillips, Wisconsin. This was a five-minute-long event. The officerinitially heard strange noises on his patrol car radio; in his words, “it wentwild.” He then saw a disc-shaped object with a rounded hump on its top andbottom, along with red and orange lights on its bottom edge. The officerestimated the object to be about 30 feet in diameter. When he directed hisspotlight on the object, it rapidly ascended into the sky. The case was recordedby Dr. Richard Haines, a UFO researcher with expertise in interactions andapparent communication between human beings and UFOs. lxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1790419] Throughout 1975 and well into 1976, UFOs were seen over many military bases.One such case took place on February 17, near Harlowton in central Montana. Ataround 9 p.m., several local officials from multiple locations saw a brightobject hovering and maneuvering about 500 feet above the “Kilo One”Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) base. One county deputy, LarryClifford, reported that as he drove to within a mile of the object, it suddenlyshot up to about 2,000 feet, stopped, and then disappeared into clouds. Stategame warden Gene Tierney was with Clifford during some of the observation. “Idon’t know what it was,” he offered, “but it wasn’t an aircraft.” The countycommissioner, Edgar Langston, observed the object through binoculars about 15miles to the south. “It climbed at one hell of an angle, moving too fast andsteeply to be an aircraft.” He saw what looked like antennae at the top of theobject. Deputy Herb Lynn saw the object plunge down and then shoot straight up,while another deputy, Russ Mull, was within a mile of the site and saw abright object bobbing up and down. Base radar reported nothing, althoughsecurity guards reported their own sightings. lxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1790675] If the basewas truthful in stating that they tracked nothing on radar, then the object wascombining astonishing performance with fully operational stealth technology.Moreover, if it was a military test, one might wonder why it was going on at anICBM missile site.Around this time, unusual craft were being seen in Algeria, tracked visually andon radar by the Algerian military, often with multiple witnesses. A March 7report from the American embassy in Algiers, sent to U.S. Secretary of StateHenry Kissinger, stated the “machines” were being seen near militaryinstallations since January – that is, nearly two months. The objects weredescribed as very bright, maneuverable, and were seen to land and take off. TheAlgerian military inquired about this with the U.S. embassy, which assured theAlgerian military “categorically” that no objects whatsoever would be flying inAlgerian air space without explicit permission of Algerian authorities. Still,the embassy checked with Kissinger to obtain a straight answer. Part of theAlgerian curiosity was that the sightings coincided with the arrival of severalAmerican journalists who were covering the expected arrival of a balloon by thefamous publisher and avid balloonist, Malcolm Forbes. However, the flight hadbeen aborted at the last minute, so these sightings seemed rather puzzling.Unfortunately, no answers on this mystery have been released by the StateDepartment. lxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1790849] Enter the TrianglesA month later, a concentration of sightings took place in North Carolina. It wasthe first time that boomerang-shaped or triangular aircraft were seen in largenumbers. To be sure, such shapes had been seen before. Occasional reports oftriangular-shaped UFOs turned up as early as the 1950s in the records of NICAPand Project Blue Book. Victor Kean, a British researcher who initiated ProjectTriangle, found sightings of triangular craft from the early 1960s. Also, thereports of the National UFO Reporting Center include early sightings oftriangular craft.But the concentration in North Carolina from April 3 to April 9, 1975 was thefirst known “flap” of such sightings, encompassing 57 separate events. Most ofthese reports revealed unusual aerial characteristics, such as the ability tohover silently at low altitudes, instantly accelerate, and turn without banking.The objects were often seen at treetop level, often with a bright andmaneuverable spotlight. Among the witnesses were 48 police officers.The first report was from the town of Lumberton on April 3. At 1:45 a.m., threepolice officers saw a V-shaped object flying at 200 to 300 feet above theground. It had a row of red lights on one side, a row of green lights on theother, and two spotlights. They contacted police in St. Paul’s, 15 miles north,and told them to be on the alert for the object. Indeed, two officers in St.Paul’s soon saw the object hovering a mere 20 feet above the ground, which theydescribed as a blinding flash of light. One of the officers said it “just lit upthe woods like a giant flashbulb.” The object rose to about 300 feet anddeparted at an estimated speed of 200 mph. Although it was the size of a smallaircraft, it made no sound. It left no traces in the fields and woods where ithad been.Later that morning, presumably the same object was reported in Hoke County,northwest of St. Paul’s, near the Fort Bragg Military Reservation. Police therefollowed a lighted V-shaped craft as it traveled east into Cumberland County. Itcontinued east into Sampson County to the town of Roseboro. An officer therenamed Jim Driver said the object passed 100 feet above him, slow and absolutelysilent. When he got out of his car, a spotlight came on and intensified. Thecraft then took off at high speed. The driver followed it to the town ofGarland, 14 miles southeast, where he broke off the chase. The craft was nextreported at Elizabethtown in Bladen County, 24 miles east of Lumberton. Anotherpolice officer confirmed the sighting there, and residents claimed the object’ssearch lights lit the town like daylight. From there, the object moved southwhere it was seen in Columbus County five minutes before sunrise, at 6:55 a.m..The next important night was Friday evening, April 4, as the dispatcher with theRobson County Sheriff’s Department, Ronald Thompson, claimed he saw a flyingobject at 9:15 p.m. near Midway. He said the object approached from thesoutheast, then stopped and hovered about 300 feet away. He shut off his engineand flashed his headlights at the craft, and it flashed a searchlight backbefore taking off to the west behind some trees. The craft appears to have beenthe same as seen previously. It was silent, V-shaped, about 30 feet in diameter,illuminated from the inside, and with two searchlights. That same night at WhiteLake, police Chief Gary Moore reported that he was driving on a lakeside roadwhen a lighted V-shaped object came down and lit up an area of about 500 feet oneither side of the road, “like it was daylight.” Moore stopped his car, got out,and studied the object through binoculars. He was dumbstruck: “I couldn’t sayanything for a second or two. I said if they want me, they’re going to come andget me, but they didn’t seem to want me.” Several other drivers stopped by andwatched the object through Moore’s binoculars during the five minutes that thecraft was hovering. Moore retrieved an airplane landing light that he carried inhis patrol car, and pointed it at the object. “I blinked the light and itblinked back,” he recalled. The object then moved west toward Lumberton, andMoore tried to follow it. For two miles he drove as fast as 85 mph, but theobject pulled away, blinked its lights, and “went straight up and out” at about200 mph. The encounters continued that night. At about 2 a.m. (Saturday, April5), a state patrolman reported a slow-moving flying craft near the town ofSaddletree. He got to within 300 yards of the object, and described it as havingbrilliant orange-red lights.On April 6, Sunday, a daylight sighting and verified landing occurred at 5:15p.m., although this object did not appear to be a triangle. Ray Strickland, aPembroke State University campus policeman was driving with his wife andchildren just north of Pembroke, when his family saw five lights in a closecircular formation, light red in color, traveling at about 50 mph and about 100feet off the ground. It appeared to the family that the lights were about tocrash into a nearby house. Instead, the lights descended into a potato field,and the Stricklands drove home to contact authorities. Dispatcher RonaldThompson arrived from the sheriff’s office with a photographer, but all that wasleft were five circular ash patches of a “strange blue color,” each one about afoot in diameter, in a pattern similar to the formation the family had seen. TedPhillips investigated the case for CUFOS and found other witnesses who told himthey saw a chrome-like attachment between each light, so it was apparently asingle object. Phillips was puzzled by several things, including what exactlycould have caused such strange ash, and why no one had seen the UFO leave thesite. lxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1791111]Sightings continued throughout the week, primarily of triangular objects. RonaldThompson said that as the county sheriff’s dispatcher, he did not give anydescription of the UFO when notifying other units, and that he was “amazed” atthe similarity of descriptions radioed back to him. There were no radartrackings of unknown craft that week, according to the Fayetteville Airport. TheFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially tried to explain the UFOsightings as a Piedmont Airlines Boeing Delta jet making test runs. Later theFAA revised the statement saying there were no airplanes in the area at the timeof the sightings.A detailed review of the North Carolina mini-wave of UFO sightings would seem torule out naturalistic explanations such as unusual atmospheric phenomena. Weappear to be talking about a craft of some sort. The question is “whose?” Thetop speed of the objects seen was well within the capabilities of ordinary lightaircraft. But the reported shape of the object, combined with silent hoveringand extremely rapid acceleration, make this difficult to explain in terms ofwhat was then possible in aviation technology – officially, at least. More onthis later. May 3, 1975: A Forgotten DayAlthough the North Carolina triangles received no major media attention,America’s UFO research organizations did their best to investigate with limitedresources. This was also true regarding a Mexican case from May 3, atTequesquitengo Lake, near Mexico City. Shortly after 11:30 a.m., a young pilotnamed Carlos de los Santos, flying a Piper aircraft, reported being surroundedby three domed disc-shaped objects, one on each wingtip and the other beneathhim (which struck the bottom of his plane leaving dents and scratches). Thisevent was tracked by air traffic controllers who confirmed that unknown objectswere near his plane. His controls failed, and the pilot felt his aircraft beingpulled or lifted. The objects then departed – two of them making an incrediblysharp high-speed turn observed by the air traffic controllers. Representativesof CUFOS, MUFON, and APRO investigated the case, including J. Allen Hynek andWalter Andrus. All investigators found the young man to be credible. lxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1791361]On the very same day, in the same part of the world, a craft very close indescription interfered with the operation of a truck. At 9:15 p.m., AloisOlenick was driving his pickup truck south of San Antonio, Texas, when a domed,disc-shaped craft approached and directed a spotlight down on him. Somehow itnearly knocked his truck off the road. When it hovered over his truck, its lightbecame an intense red, and the truck’s lights and engine died. It then passed byat enough of an angle that Olenick saw two non-human beings inside a transparentdome at the top. He stated:They appeared to be just as interested in me as I was in them. One of theoccupants . . . had his hands on what looked like controls. He was looking upand away from me. The other occupant looked directly at me . . . and appeared tobe observing me. I got a good look at both of them. They weren’t human beingslike we see here.The beings were bald, seemed rather small, had slits for eyes, large noses, andgreyish skin. The object left rapidly, and a strong wind rocked his truck. lxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1791793] No one appears to have seen a connection between the two encounters of May 3,1975, and they were quickly forgotten. Yet, it is not hard to imagine that, hadthey been promptly reported by American news agencies, the events could wellhave developed into a larger story – although the De Los Santos case did receivesome press coverage in Mexico.Incidentally, there was a strange follow-up to the De Los Santos case, oneinvolving the legendary “men in black.” Two weeks after the event, De Los Santoswas scheduled to appear on a television program. As he drove on the highway tothe interview, he was forced to the side of the road by two new-looking, blackGalaxie limousines. Immediately, four large men jumped out of their cars andapproached him. They wore black suits and had extremely pale skin. One of themheld his hand to the door of De Los Santos’s car and spoke rapidly in a“mechanical” tone. “Look boy,” he said, “if you value your life and yourfamily’s too, don’t talk any more about this sighting of yours.” Too frightenedto reply, De Los Santos turned around and went home.He told a friend about the incident, who assured him everything would be fine,and convinced him to do another interview, which De Los Santos did. A monthafter the incident with the limousines, De Los Santos met with Hynek while thelatter was in Mexico. Hynek then invited him for a follow-up interview in hishotel. De Los Santos got up early the next morning. On his way to the interview,he stopped at Mexicana Airlines to fill out an employment application. Then, onhis way up the stairs at Hynek’s hotel, he encountered one of the men who hadthreatened him. “You were already warned once,” the man told him. “You are notto talk about your experience.” This time De Los Santos spoke back. “All I didwas accept an invitation. Dr. Hynek wants to know what I saw and I thought thatmaybe I could understand it better myself if I talked with him.”The man pushed him back several feet. “I don’t want you to make problems foryourself,” he said. “And why did you leave your house at six this morning? Doyou work for Mexicana Airlines? Get out of here, and don’t come back.” De LosSantos promptly left.Two years later, UFO researchers Jerome Clark and Richard Heiden interviewed DeLos Santos and learned of his encounter with these strange men. While unable toprove his claim one way or the other, they acknowledged he seemed completelysincere. He remarked to them that the men “were very strange. They were huge,taller than Mexicans are, and they were so white.” Strangest of all, said De LosSantos, is that he never saw them blink. lxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1791995] More Military EncountersOn June 23, 1975, a British naval vessel was stationary off the west coast ofIreland in a thick fog, when a radar operator picked up an echo, presumably asurface vessel closing in on the ship. However, the object then accelerated toan “impossible” speed. The operator notified the captain, who filed a report.The case was investigated by the Ministry of Defence, later by private BritishUFO researchers. Temperature inversions and surface turbulence were ruled out ascauses. lxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1792213] An encounter by NATO personnel with a UFO occurred off the island ofSardinia at an unknown date in 1975, according to a report that was sent toretired Major Colman Von Keviczky from an anonymous captain in the NATO officesin Brussels. The report itself was dated November 3, 1976, and stated thatsoldiers of a missile battery were on duty on Sardinia when they saw a UFOhovering over the Mediterranean. Motion picture film of the object showed it tobe a large domed disc, emitting light. Orders were given to fire missiles at it,but they appeared to hit “an invisible bulwark.” This was surely a dynamitelead, and Von Keviczky pursued it. He contacted the Italian Ministry of Defense,which suggested that he contact Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe. There, hewas informed in a letter signed by Brigadier General Fernando Buttelli that thefilm was not available due to the “national security policy of Italy.” lxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1792374] Another military encounter, taking place amid a spate of UFO sightings innorthern California, was investigated by MUFON. On August 14 at 9:35 p.m., MajorClaude Riddle was flying a helicopter at 900 feet while approaching the StocktonMetropolitan Airport. Suddenly, air traffic controller Joe Savage saw flashinglights closing in on a collision course. When he advised Riddle to take evasiveaction, the object turned an orange color and shot up to an altitude of 5,000feet, where it hovered. Riddle meanwhile looked behind him and saw a light thatseemed to be tailing his chopper a mile or so away. When he swung around, he sawit “shimmering like a diamond.” He described it as big as a jetliner, ovalshaped, and radiating a bright orange glow from the top. Two blue beams came outfrom the sides. Another air traffic controller, Dan Long, saw the glowing objectthrough field glasses and said it looked “like a flying saucer.”As Riddle maneuvered his chopper to keep the object in sight, it drifted overthe airport and hovered there. He said he “wasn’t really interested in gettingtoo close.” After about five minutes of hovering, the object suddenly turnedbright red and shot off. According to Riddle, “it was faster than anything I’veever seen. I’ve observed enough launchings to know we have nothing that cancompare to the speed of this thing.” An air controller named John Paul Ammiratawatched through binoculars as the object departed. Within “five or six seconds,”the object ascended to 260,000 feet and faded from view. If true, that would benearly 30,000 mph. MUFON reported the details of the case, as did thesensationalist National Enquirer . lxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1792662] 1975: The State of TechnologyHow likely is it that some of the preceding sightings resulted from classifiedor experimental technology? One might assume that technologies which wereexperimental in 1975 would be operational and declassified by the 21st century.Not absolutely certain, of course, but a reasonable assumption for a reasonableworld. Even now, there are no obvious candidates that would account for, say,the February 17, 1975 sighting over the Montana ICBM – a round object that couldaccelerate silently to an amazing speed from a hovering position, as well asavoid radar detection. Or the domed discs of May 3, which causedelectro-magnetic disturbances and silently zoomed away.The triangles over North Carolina during April are another story, although theytoo remain a challenge to explain. According to some UFO researchers and allegedinsiders, triangular craft have been secretly manufactured since – depending onwho makes the claims – the 1990s, 1980s, 1970s, or even 1960s. Severaltriangular craft have been suspected as culprits for the North Carolinasightings. One is the Aereon 26, manufactured by the Aereon Corporation inPrinceton, New Jersey, which first flew in 1970. This was an experimentalaircraft that combined the lifting capabilities of conventional aircraft withthe lighter than air capabilities of a blimp. It was 26 feet long and powered bya piston engine which turned a propeller. Photographs of it show alozenge-shaped fuselage with delta-shaped wings, giving a roughly triangularappearance. It did not require lighter-than-air buoyancy to take-off, althoughlarger versions were envisaged to contain helium. The Aereon 26 did operatequietly and could fly at a slow speed, but apparently could not acceleraterapidly, as some of the reported triangles did. Frankly, its description andcapabilities seem no better than a distant stretch.Another possibility is the legendary, mythical – and possibly real – TR-3A,otherwise known as the Black Manta. It is said to be the size of a B-2 bomber,about 45 feet long and 15 feet high, with a 65-foot wingspan. British aviationwriter Tim Matthews suggested that many of the triangle sightings of the latertwentieth century were in all likelihood the TR-3A, or the much larger TR-3B, orsome other deeply classified vehicle. Matthews argued that the TR-3B is alighter-than-air vehicle using advanced composite materials in construction.They could be used for “covert insertion of troops, reconnaissance, moving ofclassified materials and other unspecified missions.” The smaller version, hesuggested, could be used as a stealthy, unmanned, combat aerial vehicle. Whilesuch triangles are probably capable of slow and silent maneuvering, the questionof going from hovering to rapid acceleration – while remaining silent – presentsa challenge even in the early 21st century. Also, it must be emphasized thatalthough many aviation industry observers believe something like these craft doexist, their existence has never been officially acknowledged, and some analystsflat-out do not believe in them. Finally, even proponents do not claim the BlackManta or other triangular aircraft were operational as early as 1975. lxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1792877]For now, we need not solve the riddle of the triangles; they will recurthroughout this book. Let us also for the moment leave aside unverified claimsof black-world breakthroughs in such exotic technologies as field propulsion(e.g. anti-gravity). This too will be explored later, particularly regardingclaims of reverse-engineered alien technology at the Groom Lake facility inNevada. For now, let us simply look at fully confirmed technological researchfrom the mid-1970s."},{"pageContent":"In the aviation field, the most interesting breakthrough was in stealth. As farback as the mid-1960s, the Northrop Corporation was looking for ways to reduceor even eliminate an aircraft’s radar signature, otherwise known as Radar CrossSection or RCS. The solution was understood to come from new shapes andmaterials, but the devil is always in the details. Meanwhile, the Pentagon wasless concerned about reducing RCS and more interested in developing aircraftthat were quiet. In 1966, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),a Pentagon organization charged with pursuing advanced projects, funded aLockheed program to develop ultra-quiet reconnaissance aircraft. Out of thiscame the QT-2, the Q-Star, and the YO-3A, which used silenced piston enginescombined with large, low speed propellers. These aircraft proved to be veryquiet on missions in Vietnam during the late 1960s and early 1970s. lxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1793434] Stealth as we typically interpret it – the reduction or elimination ofan aircraft’s RCS – was still just an idea as the 1970s began. By then, however,a few aircraft designers and specialists were developing the radical idea of a“stealth fighter.” As early as 1972, progress had been made in reducing RCS, andby 1974 the very word “stealth” was secret. lxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1793737] By 1975, DARPAasked General Dynamics and Northrop to propose designs for an ultra-low RCSaircraft, but Lockheed won the day with an unsolicited proposal for an aircraftdesign “like a cut diamond” whose unusual shape scattered radar signals. In thesummer of 1976, at Groom Lake in Nevada, Lockheed made a breakthrough with theHave Blue demonstrator. This aircraft achieved the RCS of a ball bearing – aneighth of an inch in diameter. With that breakthrough, every defensive system inthe world, including that of the United States, became obsolete. Within a year,Lockheed developed the basic design of the F-117 Nighthawk, the world’s firststealth fighter. lxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1794022] Stealth had not really been possible until the mid-1970s – speed andperformance had always been its natural enemies. An unconventional design couldreduce RCS, but it also hampered the aircraft’s performance, and the trade-offnever seemed worth it. Lockheed could take the path it did because advances incomputing technology finally made it possible to “fly-by-wire.” That is,on-board computers could make enough adjustments each second to stabilize evenan aircraft with an unconventional design. lxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1794410]What is true of the stealth fighter should also logically be true of thetriangles. That is, if fly-by-wire was not possible until the mid-1970s, thenrealistically the triangles should not have been practical due to theirinherently unstable design. The first widespread appearance of the triangles in1975 would seem – just barely – to be within the timeframe of an operationalfly-by-wire system. Still, it seems unlikely that such technology was matureenough by 1975 to have accounted for many of the UFO reports generated duringthe first half of that year. And the best was still yet to come. Of course, whatone makes of the scattered triangle sightings of the 1960s, to say nothing ofother types of UFOs such as flying saucers, is another matter entirely. Indeed,UFOs had a long history of radar invisibility going back through the 1940s and1950s. Could secret U.S. stealth technology have accounted for that?Stealth was not the only story in aviation circa 1975. Some of the most advancedprototypes at that time were the Northrop YF-17 (the progenitor of the Navy’sF/A-18 Hornet) and the Rockwell B-1A bomber. In January 1975, the USAF announcedthe F-16 as the winner of its lightweight fighter technology evaluation program.lxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1794655] Each ofthese aircraft are triumphs of engineering and innovation, although none couldbe confused for UFOs. The Air Force, in fact, had at this time limited fundswith which to develop new weapons systems. Money flowed much more liberallyduring the 1980s under President Reagan, but for now funds were relativelytight. According to an official history of the United States Air Force, newweapons systems during the 1970s were a rare event, and “older systems such asthe B-52 required [the Air Force] to modify them continuously to keep them inservice.” lxxx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1794821]This is simply one more argument against the likelihood that a majorbreakthrough occurred in the mid-1970s which allowed for the advent of a true“flying saucer” technology.There were a few people at this time studying more exotic means of gettingobjects into the air. One of these was Eric Laithwaite, Emeritus Professor ofHeavy Electrical Engineering at Imperial College London, who is credited withthe development of the “mag-lev” rail system in the 1960s. In 1974, Laithwaitedemonstrated to the prestigious Royal Institution the apparent weight loss of aheavy gyroscope apparatus, weighing over fifty pounds. He struggled to lift iteven to waist-height, but when an electric motor rotated the wheel at highspeed, he was able to lift it with one hand, without any apparent effort. Itappeared that his apparatus had somehow lost weight. For the first time in twohundred years, the Royal Institution refused to publish its proceedings. In thewords of one writer, “in an unprecedented case of academic Stalinism, the RoyalInstitution simply banished the memory of Professor Laithwaite, his gyroscopesthat became lighter, his lecture, even his existence.” lxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1794982] The real issue is not the small mindedness of scientists andacademicians. Rather, we may wonder how likely it is that deep-black programs,far removed from the public oversight, might have pursued an interest inapparent phenomena such as this. Let us recall a statement issued on September10, 2001 – one day before the most infamous date in American history – by U.S.Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld. Speaking of the need to reform thePentagon’s wasteful spending, Rumsfeld made the astonishing statement that,“according to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions.”lxxxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1795264] When one considers that the FY 2001 budget of the Department of Defensewas $310 billion, the mind reels. This is approximately seven and a half timesthe amount of the official annual budget. Jim Minnery, of the Defense Financeand Accounting Service, added, “we know it’s gone. But we don't know what theyspent it on.” lxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1795646] Aside from thesimple question of how is it even possible to lose that much money, it should beevident that such a figure cannot accrue overnight, but must be the product of along process. In all likelihood, some of this money slipped away during the1970s. It is surely plausible that a large sum of unvouchered money went into“deep black” scientific research and development programs, perhaps more exoticthan stealth. Such a discussion brings us inevitably to the matter of the “blackbudget.” More on this later.As far as we can tell, aviation technology circa 1975 does not appear to explainthe key UFO sightings of the time. Perhaps we should qualify this statement bychanging it to “official aviation technology.” Even so, the behavior of the UFOsis difficult to square with the testing of classified or experimentaltechnology. While we acknowledge the possibility that human technology may bebehind the UFO events of 1975, we are still left with (a) the lack of hardevidence supporting such a conclusion, and (b) the nagging feeling that such anexplanation has gaping holes. Something more extraordinary appeared to have beenat work. The Nazi UFO ConnectionThere is one especially intriguing twist to the idea of man-made UFOs. This isthe “Nazi connection,” an idea that has lurked in the background of UFO researchfor many years. It is an idea that took a long time to germinate. During the1950s and 1960s, it was still very much a faux pas to discuss post-warcollaboration with Nazis. Project Paperclip, the American operation to bring inNazi scientists and intelligence experts, was a potentially explosive secret.The U.S. intelligence community gave these men new identification papers andbackgrounds, hiding them not just from the American public, but the U.S. StateDepartment (which made it a felony to bring Nazis into the United States).Britain and the Soviet Union were also involved in this activity. The fact thatsuch individuals had reprehensible political beliefs did not stop these nationsfrom recognizing their ability to contribute to the post-war geopolitical chessgame. lxxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1795879]From the beginning of the UFO phenomenon there had been speculation that theobjects were some sort of secret project, whether American or Soviet. This waslogical. The Wright brothers had flown a mere half-century before, and sciencefiction had given the world Buck Rogers and flights to outer space. There seemedno limit to what human ingenuity could accomplish. Flying saucers could wellhave been the next step. American military analysts looked into the possibilitythat the Soviets, or the Americans themselves, had made a breakthrough toexplain the flying discs. They also knew that the Germans had been working oncertain very advanced concepts and technologies. The “V” rockets were wellknown, as was the excellent ME-163 rocket fighter. Less appreciated were theGerman developments in disc-shaped craft, for a long time dismissed as fantasy.Could flying saucers have truly been invented by the Germans during the SecondWorld War, a secret which would have been maintained and developed by theAmericans, British, and Soviets?Beyond vague and unverifiable leaks during the 1950s, there was not much to bemade of this argument until a book by the name Intercettateli Senza Sparare waspublished in Italy in 1968. It was translated and published in English under thetitle Intercept – But Don’t Shoot , then republished again in 1974. Its author,Renato Vesco, made the first comprehensive argument that flying saucers shouldbe understood as secret human technology, derived from the Nazis. lxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1796120]Vesco made a case that the Germans had developed alternative energy in the formof the gyroscope, vortex, and other ‘anti-gravity’ devices. Disc-shaped andtubular craft were built and tested towards the end of the war, the ‘foofighters’ being one of their experimental craft. After the war, many of theseconcepts made it to the Americans and Soviets and led directly to functionalflying saucers.Vesco’s work focused on German technology during the war, but barely discussedthe postwar transition to the U.S. and elsewhere. Later researchers argued thatvia Paperclip and similar other programs, these scientists came to work withindeep black structures in the U.S. Some argued that German groups succeeded inescaping to South America and even Antarctica (Neu Schwabenland) where, withtheir advanced technologies, they established secret bases. The fundamentalargument was that UFOs were top secret to all governments because they weresimply too significant. As Vesco put it, “the UFOs constitute too important atrump card not to wait until the proper time to make them felt upon the courseof history. History, therefore, goes on.” lxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1796496] Later authorsadded that UFOs utilized suppressed technology and revolutionary energy sourcesthat global elites have kept secret in order to protect current money makingresources, such as oil. lxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1796649]In the 1970s, these arguments had an extremely limited circulation. Much later,the story was re-investigated by British aviation writer Nick Cook. Cook arguedthat there was “a mounting body of evidence” that the Nazis had experimented“with a form of science the rest of the world had never remotely considered.”They were so far ahead of everybody else that the technology was suppressed forover fifty years. lxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1796895] What were some of the alleged Nazi achievements? The most famous claimis that a flying disc, the so-called V7, flew out of Prague on February 14,1945. Within minutes, it was said to have climbed to an altitude of about 40,000feet and reached a speed of 1,200 mph. It was allegedly destroyed in May 1945,although some said it was captured by the Soviets. lxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797135] Meanwhile,German scientist Viktor Schauberger had been investigating ‘free energyproduction’ and ‘levitational flight.’ During the war, his work and person weretaken over by the enigmatic and notorious S.S. General Hans Kammler. He appearsto have developed a number of prototypes of flying discs. In early May 1945,just as the European war was about to end, Schauberger’s team is said to havehad major success. According to one of Cook’s sources, a flying saucer prototyperose twice to the ceiling and then was wrecked. As it rose, it left a trail thatglowed turquoise and silver. The manner in which it worked “was whollyunconventional” and beyond current scientific knowledge. Schauberger wasimmediately captured by U.S. forces, which seized everything in his laboratory,and he was held in custody by U.S. intelligence until March 1946. xc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797298] Cook investigated other possibilities even more fantastic, including theso-called “Bell Experiment.” In the region of Lower Silesia, under theadministration of Kammler, work was underway that seemed to be related toantigravity technologies. It involved using large amounts of electricity feedinginto a below-ground chamber with two contra-rotating cylinders filled withmercury (said to produce terrible side effects on humans). Sixty-two scientistsworking on the program were allegedly shot by the S.S. a week or two before thesurrender of Germany. Cook’s research into this even suggested that the Bellexperiments were possibly efforts related to time travel. xci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797458]Cook started his research with low expectations, but he learned more than heexpected. Nothing amounted to a smoking gun, however. The story of the Pragueflying saucer traveling at 1,200 mph strains credulity. One wonders how a pilotwould have managed the feat of flying a wholly unconventional airframe at morethan twice the fastest speed of any previously manned aircraft. Many aspects of“The Legend” (as the story of Nazi UFOs is often called) present seriousproblems of believability. Still, it has become evident that the Germans wereindeed working on unconventional technologies and aviation designs, and that theAmericans were deeply interested in them. Kammler, incidentally, simplydisappeared at the war’s end. Did he go work for the Americans? Did he escapesomewhere else?Where does all this leave the UFO phenomenon? The evidence for a man-made UFOprogram going back to the 1940s is stronger than most earlier researchers hadsuspected. By the mid-1970s, this idea was just beginning to get seriousattention. But any explanation of “Nazi UFOs” has several hurdles to overcome.Why have UFOs consistently buzzed the military installations of the U.S. andother countries? Is one to believe that this was a demonstration of secret Nazipower emanating from Antarctica? No tangible evidence has ever emerged tosupport this thesis. Or, were all the early UFOs manufactured by the Americansand Soviets? If so, who was buzzing the American military pilots and bases withsuch regularity? Since there is no evidence that it was the Soviets, does thismean that a secret American flying saucer program was charged with provoking anunsuspecting American defense establishment? For more than fifty years? Noproponent of the man-made UFO thesis has been able to come to terms with thisissue, although one could do it by postulating the existence of a completelyseparate breakaway civilization. Even this, however, would not explain much ofthe strangeness of the UFO phenomenon, such as the many cases of alleged alienencounters.On the other hand, it is entirely conceivable that some “flying saucers,” evenduring the early years, were man-made. Toward this end, the contribution of Naziscience and technology programs might have been critically important – anuncomfortable fact which those in-the-know would want to keep hidden. From the1970s onward, it became increasingly difficult to dismiss all claims of man-madeUFOs. As the 1970s turned into the 1980s and beyond, the claims became strongerstill. UFO Research in 1975By 1975, UFO research was quite active. Several organizations were trying togrow nationwide and the field explored different intellectual avenues.“Scientific ufology” was the reigning ideology. Of course, modern science isexpensive, and the UFO groups never had much money. Even within financialconstraints, however, progress was made. In 1975, CUFOS received a computer fileof nearly 80,000 records of UFOs, called UFOCAT. This was a gift from Dr. DavidR. Saunders, former member of the Condon Committee, who had created it. UFOCATprovided a foundation of raw data that in the coming years would enable CUFOS togenerate statistical studies of UFO reports.Meanwhile, MUFON issued the second edition of its Field Investigator’s Manual.Edited by Raymond Fowler, it listed standard investigative procedures. xcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797628] MUFON wantedto develop an international organization of trained investigators who couldresearch sightings as scientifically as possible. Sometimes the reality did notmeet that ideal, but many MUFON investigators did rigorously investigatebaffling UFO cases. MUFON’s voice to the world was Skylook , a monthly journalabout 20 pages long containing descriptions of UFO sightings, as well ascommentary by researchers such as Richard Hall, Walter Andrus, Lucius Farish,Leonard Stringfield, Stanton Friedman, Ann Druffel, and others. Despite a barebones budget, it was a quality publication under the editorial guidance ofDwight Connelly. Considering its focus was UFOs, Skylook was quite conservative.One senses that the writers tried to avoid any hint of sensationalism orconspiratorial thinking. Skylook offered almost no political analysis. Thedrawback of this approach is that if UFOs were real, as most contributors toSkylook agreed, there would surely be important and far-reaching political andsocial implications. But then again, such analysis went beyond a strictlyscientific approach to the UFO problem. In fairness, this was quite enough of achallenge.An important contribution toward the establishment of a proper ufology was theappearance in 1975 of a scholarly work by Temple University Professor ofHistory, Dr. David Jacobs. The UFO Controversy in America was the first truehistory of the UFO phenomenon. Jacobs argued that the investigative efforts ofProject Blue Book were a sham, described the history of important organizationssuch as NICAP, and the history of the UFO phenomenon from the 1940s to the early1970s. Not having access to the many documents that later become declassified,his history reflected public sources such as newspapers and UFO journals. Still,the book remains valuable to this day, with a fine organization of the subjectmatter, clear writing, and an excellent bibliography.Although writing on the conspiracy was somewhat out of favor, research effortsin this direction increased after the amended Freedom of Information Act becameeffective on February 19, 1975. The declassification trend had already bornfruit a month earlier, when the CIA released the 1953 Robertson Panel documentto Ann Druffel. Back in 1966, Dr. James McDonald had discovered the reportduring a trip to Wright-Patterson AFB – it had been declassified by Blue Bookmanager Hector Quintanilla. McDonald shared his information with others, but theCIA re-classified the report before anyone could get an official copy. The AirForce later released a sanitized version of the report which expunged allreferences to the CIA. In late 1974 (“on a whim”) Druffel requested adeclassified copy from the CIA. To her surprise, the Agency told her that shecould get a 28- page declassified copy for ten cents per page. xciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797787] It proved thatthe CIA had indeed organized a classified scientific panel that had setgovernment UFO policy for decades. Seen from the perspective of the 21stcentury, it might seem utterly entry-level to ask whether the CIA had aninterest in UFOs, but until 1975 there had been no proof that this had been thecase.FOIA thus added a new dimension to UFO research, and a new group of researchersdedicated themselves to filing Freedom of Information requests with all publiclyknown government agencies and departments. A new organization, Ground SaucerWatch (GSW) of Phoenix, sprang into being led by William Spaulding and W. ToddZechel (the latter of whom was a former government employee with connection tothe NSA). In the summer of 1975, GSW filed for UFO-related documents from theCIA. The Agency replied that its UFO connection began and ended with theRobertson Panel. But this fight was just beginning, and events would eventuallydisprove the CIA’s assertion. xciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1797977] It looked like the secrecy dam might be about to crack. Watergate and theresignation of President Nixon were still fresh events, and it seemed possiblethat something just might give. Another bombshell, hinting of more to come, camefrom Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) who, in response to an inquiry about UFOs,wrote a remarkable letter on March 28, 1975:The subject of UFOs is one that has interested me for some time. About ten ortwelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building atWright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information is stored that has beencollected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It isstill classified above Top Secret. I have, however, heard that there is a planunder way to release some, if not all, of this material in the near future. I’mjust as anxious to see this material as you are, and I hope we will not have towait too much longer. xcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1798233] Back in 1964, which was around the time he tried to learn the AirForce’s UFO secrets, Goldwater was a military-friendly Republican Partycandidate for President. And yet he still was denied access. The person whoblocked him was his friend, USAF Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay. Goldwaterreferred to the UFO subject as “above Top Secret.” This accords with a statementfrom 1950 by Canadian government scientist Wilbert Smith, who was told by seniorAmerican scientists in Washington, D.C., that UFOs were “the most highlyclassified subject in the United States Government.” xcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1798481] Althoughconspiratorial thinking was out of fashion among ufologists, Goldwater’sstatement would reverberate over the years. What exactly was “above Top Secret”?And if someone of his stature was blocked from accessing UFO data, who did haveaccess? What was the data, anyway?Meanwhile, some students of UFOs concluded it was all, or at least mostly, inthe mind. Such was the conclusion of Jerome Clark and Loren Coleman in TheUnidentified . This work borrowed from Jungian psychology to interpret UFOs fromancient times to the modern day. They argued that UFO experiences were not theresult of an alien presence, but were “primarily subjective and its contentprimarily symbolic” – an unconscious projection of the human mind. Not merelyJung, but Freud is detectable in their statement that “UFO visions are thepsyche’s attempt to escape the stranglehold that strict rationalism has ontwentieth century humanity.” UFO experiences were not real in an objectivesense, they maintained, but were the product of unusual mental states. In time,both authors rejected their own conclusions which, as Clark later pointed out,ignored actual physical evidence of UFOs. But other proponents soon followed,resulting in what became known as the psycho-social school of ufology. xcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1798663] Richard Hall wasted no time in criticizing this new development as“subjective, mystical, and chaotic.” xcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1798943] But at leastpsycho-social writers held that UFOs were a legitimate topic of study. In adifferent category altogether was the 1974 offering by skeptic Philip J. Klass,UFOs Explained . Klass, an electrical engineer by training and a senior avionicseditor for the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology , had beenactively debunking the topic since the mid-1960s. He argued that all UFOsightings were amenable to logical, scientific explanations, provided of coursethat sufficient data was available. Strictly speaking, most UFO proponents wouldagree, but by “logical and scientific,” Klass excluded extraterrestrial or otherseemingly extraordinary explanations. The book used a handful of UFO cases as“remarkably accurate profiles of the whole” to demonstrate that the phenomenonwas in fact easily explainable. Klass advanced what he called the UfologicalPrinciple: that honest people, when exposed to unusual natural phenomena or anunexpected event, are often inaccurate in describing what they saw. Out of suchmisidentifications, he argued, grew the myth of flying saucers, the fascinationof which is essentially the adult’s recompense for the loss of Santa Claus. Manyof the cases Klass referred to were well known, such as the cigar-shaped objectdescribed by two 1948 Eastern Air Lines pilots – a case investigated by the U.S.Air Force and taken seriously – which Klass said was a meteor shower. He offereda similar explanation for the October 1973 sighting of a UFO by an Army Reservehelicopter crew: a fireball associated with the Orionid meteor shower. The 1964sighting of a landed craft by a New Mexico policeman was, in Klass’s estimation,probably a hoax. Readers either loved or despised Klass. In UFOs Explained , theprosaic explanations of a small sample of UFO cases left one either with theimpression that Klass had adequately explained UFOs as something conventional,or that he simply cherry-picked his cases, offering the catch-all explanation ofhuman fallibility or deception to account for the toughest ones. By now, StantonFriedman had emerged as Klass’s most persistent critic, and offered a rebuttalto Klass’s book (“pseudoscience”) in the pages of Skylook . xcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1799120] Friedman andKlass were developing the nasty relationship Klass previously had with JamesMcDonald.Another area of change was how researchers viewed the aliens themselves. Thenumber of alleged close encounters and abductions were growing, many of whichwere described by witnesses who claimed to have clear recollections of figuresseen near or inside UFOs. Frequently the entities were described as wearingtight fitting clothes, or some sort of silver spacesuit. Although there wasstill no widespread description of what would soon become known as the “greys,”one type of entity consistently reported was short in stature, often with darkeyes and enlarged heads. Another type, later often designated as “Nordic,” wastall and blonde, sometimes with large ears, and was often reported in Europe.Such beings usually looked “almost” human, or sometimes exactly so. The term“alien” was not yet widely used to describe these creatures. Researchers DavidWebb and Ted Bloecher, for instance, referred to large numbers of “humanoid”cases from the years 1973 and 1974; the term “UFO occupant” was also frequentlyused. c [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1799356] Few conclusions were being offered at this time regarding these apparentnon-humans. For years, many ufologists had assumed that the aliens wereconducting surveillance of the planet, possibly in advance of establishing anopen presence here on Earth. As the decades went by, this position becameincreasingly untenable. Adding to the confusion was the growing realization thatwhat people had been calling the UFO phenomenon might be very old indeed. If so,what exactly might they be doing here? Surely not conducting surveillance. Otherpossibilities would be discussed soon enough, for in 1975 a New York City artistnamed Budd Hopkins carried out his first UFO investigation. Within a few years,Hopkins would express forcefully that these aliens were in fact abducting manymore humans than researchers had previously thought.Despite the infighting that has always occurred in ufology, attempts were madeto foster cooperation through conferences. One of the early important ones tookplace in October 1975 in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Aptly, it was titled “United ForObjectivity.” The leaders of APRO, MUFON, CUFOS, and GSW participated, as wellas members of NASA and the FAA. Philip Klass was there, too. Some attendees werepersuaded that Klass was a sincere skeptic, a member of the “loyal opposition,”although others thought it over-the-top that he seemed to be tape-recordingnearly everything. The conference produced a joint resolution that each groupwould come to an agreement in the near future concerning their areas of basicemphasis for research. Predictably, this never happened, especially since eachorganization already had people specializing in a wide range of areas. ci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1799540] Soon after this conference, however, Allen Hynek began to organize hisown “secret” conference. He drew up a list of 138 attendees who, in his words,had “seriously investigated and reported” on UFOs “in an unprejudiced manner.”No offense to those left off the list, of course. Word got out immediately,rankling many UFO researchers who were left off Hynek’s secret and exclusionarylist. It seemed needlessly divisive. Why the secrecy? Why prevent others fromattending? Commenting on Hynek’s lack of diplomacy, Skylook editor DwightConnelly noted that UFO researchers were “almost paranoid in their suspicions ofeach other.” If people thought ufology was paranoid in 1975, they hadn’t seenanything yet. cii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1799703] Remote Viewing the AliensSome may consider the next topic “far out” even for a book on UFOs. Remoteviewing (RV) is roughly synonymous with clairvoyance or nonlocal awareness, butspecifically refers to the “psychic spying” program within the U.S. intelligencecommunity from the 1970s until the 1990s. In classified circles, teams oftrained individuals used extrasensory perception to help fight the cold war,often with examples of success that defied any conventional explanation.Sometimes, these remote viewers claimed to see UFOs or alien beings.For years, the CIA and many military units, along with their Sovietcounterparts, performed experiments to harness the human mind, including ways tocreate a programmed killer (e.g. a Manchurian Candidate). ciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1799830] So in 1972,when the CIA approached Dr. Harold Puthoff of Stanford Research Institute (SRI)in Menlo Park, California, to initiate a psi research program, it was simplyworking an old game with a new twist. If clairvoyance could really be used forespionage, one could spy on enemy installations at practically no cost. It wasat least worth a try, especially since it was known the Soviets were pursuingit.Puthoff invited New York City artist and psychic Ingo Swann to SRI to begin psiexperiments. Swann’s first day at Stanford University was nothing short ofastounding. He was brought by Puthoff and several skeptical scientists to abuilding where, several floors below, was a heavily shielded device called amagnetometer. Its sole function was to measure quarks. Swann had no idea what hewas going to be asked, when one of the scientists asked him if he could“perturb” the device. As Swann sat in his chair, simply trying to see the devicein his mind, a scientist monitoring the magnetometer informed the group thatsomething was wrong. The needle was moving wildly – the device wasmalfunctioning. This scene was repeated several more times, each time exactlywhen Swann was “seeing” the magnetometer. Coincidence, the skeptics argued;Puthoff was more intrigued.Swann had many amazing successes. In an October 1972 experiment, he correctlyidentified a moth inside a box: “small, brown, and irregular, sort of like aleaf, or something that resembles it, except that it seems very much alive, likeit’s even moving.” civ[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1800064] In April 1973,he suggested that perhaps during weekends and free time, he try something moreexciting. The Pioneer 10 space probe had been launched and would not reachJupiter for several months. Why not RV Jupiter? Monitored by Puthoff and fellowscientist Russell Targ, Swann yielded 13 specific factors about Jupiter, none ofwhich had been scientifically anticipated. Ultimately, 12 of these wereconfirmed, including the surprising existence of a planetary ring. cv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1800273] Another RV star was Pat Price, who joined the program in 1973 andaccurately remotely viewed a Soviet installation in the northern Ural Mountains.cvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1801154] In anotherseries of experiments, Puthoff and a skeptic at SRI named Earl Jones drove tonine separate metropolitan areas, all chosen by Jones. Back at the lab, Targmonitored Price, who described seven of those places accurately. In some cases,Price did this before Jones and Puthoff had reached their target, and beforeJones had even decided on a target. Price appeared to be moving not only throughspace, but through time. cvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1801352] Price also saw aliens. He told Puthoff that there were four major undergroundalien bases, each within a different mountain region. Price had done this on hisown and was simply giving his boss the data. The main purpose of the bases, hestated, was to “reinforce B.T.L. implants, transport of new recruits and overallmonitoring function.” Just what B.T.L. implants were Price did not know, norapparently does anyone today, although the phenomenon of alien abductioncertainly comes to mind. The inhabitants of the bases looked like normal humanbeings, said Price, although the heart, lungs, blood and eyes were different.The four sites were protected from discovery and had very advanced technology.Price also said the inhabitants of these bases used “thought transfer for motorcontrol of us.”The first base, said Price, was at Mt. Perdido in the Pyrenees Mountains,between France and Spain. It was guarded with a two-mile perimeter of detectors,and contained several craft, apparently using an electromagnetic fieldpropulsion system. Another was at Mount Inyangani, the highest mountain inRhodesia (now Zimbabwe). It looked like “a maintenance and tech center.” A thirdsite was at Mount Hayes, northeast of Anchorage, Alaska. This seemed to be aweather and geological center. In the event of discovery, “personnel aredeployed physically . . . to make sure of failure of that certain project. Thissite has also been responsible for strange activity and malfunction of U.S. andSoviet space projects.” The fourth site was at Mount Ziel, in Australia’sNorthern Territory. This base had the most personnel, including many from theother three sites, “like a rest and recreation area.” While viewing thislocation, Price thought he was detected, so he “left,” but then returned. Henoted the base was also the “homo sapiens introduction point.” Price did notthink aliens limited themselves to these four bases; he also sensed bases on theMoon, Mars, and under Earth’s oceans. cviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1801603]Incidentally, Puthoff later gave Price’s Mount Hayes folder to Lieutenant F.Holmes (“Skip”) Atwater, who tasked remote viewers for the Star Gate program, anextended remote viewing effort under the control of the U.S. Army. In 1982,Atwater asked his leading remote viewer, Joe McMoneagle, to target the area.McMoneagle perceived a mountainous region with underground tubes, tunnels, andball shaped objects. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said. “It’s likewalking into a place I have no familiarity with at all.” cix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1801914] Ingo Swann possibly had the most amazing ET-related experiences, the topper ofwhich concerns his encounters with a mysterious “Mr. Axelrod.” In February 1975,Swann received a phone call from a friend whom he described as “a certain highlyplaced functionary in Washington, D.C.” The friend told him that someone underthe pseudonym of “Mr. Axelrod” would soon telephone him, and that it was veryimportant Swann did “whatever he asks, and ask no questions.” Accustomed tounusual requests in his line of work, Swann agreed.A month later, Swann received a 3 a.m. phone call from Axelrod, who asked him tobe in Washington at noon that day. Swann was in New York City, but he made thetrip and arrived at the appointed spot: in front of the elephant at theSmithsonian Institution. Two very similar-looking men in military demeanor, withblue eyes and blonde crewcuts, approached him from behind. Their introductionconsisted of pre-written note cards, and they led him to a car. The femaledriver ignored him and, after a note card which apologized for thecloak-and-dagger routine, a bag was placed over Swann’s head. He was put on ahelicopter, flown for about a half hour, taken out and walked for a “longishdistance.” Then down an elevator for another long distance, taken out, walkedagain, and turned many times. Finally, the bag was removed.Ingo Swann was now face to face with Axelrod, who offered him $1,000 per day forhis work during the next few days. Regarding his agency, Axelrod said only “weexist without leaving a paper trail regarding our mission.” There were nodisclosure papers to sign, only a promise not to talk for ten years, after which“our mission will have ‘disappeared’ as it were.”The two became friendly. “Axel” said he knew all about Swann’s remote viewing ofJupiter, and asked Swann what he knew about the Moon. Not much, said Swann.“Well,” said Axelrod, “we want you to go to the Moon for us, and describe whatyou see.” He gave Swann about ten Moon coordinates, causing Swann to wonder ifAxelrod’s group was looking for places to hide a Moon base, or perhaps searchingfor a lost, secret, spacecraft.Swann “went” to the coordinates and saw a green haze, two rows of lights, andtowers. He apologized – clearly, he was perceiving Earth, not the Moon. Axelrodseemed perturbed and asked Swann if he was sure of what he saw. Eventually itdawned on Swann: “You mean, am I to think these lights are actually on theMoon?” No answer from Axelrod. “Have the Russians built a Moonbase orsomething?” Still no answer. They went through the coordinates again, and Swannsaw the light towers better this time, built on narrow struts. They were verytall, perhaps over 100 feet. He saw an even larger tower at the edge of acrater, as tall as a skyscraper. “Am I, then, to assume this stuff really is onthe Moon?” No answer. “Am I to assume this stuff is not ours? Not made onEarth?”Axelrod finally answered: “Quite a surprise, isn’t it?”Thus Ingo Swann remote viewed what he believed to be alien bases on the Moon.But his information did not seem to surprise Axelrod, and so Swann asked why hehad been brought in. Axelrod answered cryptically that “frankly, no one hasknown what to do, and many mistakes have been made.” Did the aliens tell us tostay away, Swann asked. Axelrod deflected that question, saying that Swann’sinformation “might provide a kind of check point in what you surely now realizemust be a mess of interpretations of the photographic and other evidence. It wasmy idea to find a psychic who did not know anything about the Moon, and see whatmight be seen there.” This sounds like a test of human psychic abilities todetect an alien presence.In other sessions, Swann saw more of the same – towers, machinery, roads,housing-like structures – and made many sketches for Axelrod. Finally, he sawwhat looked like humans “busy at work on something I could not figure out.”Swann told Axelrod that the beings had detected his presence. “Please quicklycome away from that place,” said Axelrod, and Swann left.After several days, Swann was asked to write his thoughts down on the nature ofpsi, three dimensionality, and communication across distances, and he gaveAxelrod 15 handwritten pages. Swann was then brought home, and Axelrod indicatedthat he would probably contact Swann again. More on that later. cx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1802173] Swann’s story is unsupported by what any historian would consider goodcorroborative evidence. But to the people who know Ingo Swann, some of whomserved with him in the remote viewing program, there is no question of hisintelligence, rationality, and honesty. “If Ingo said it, then it happened,” wasthe statement by one associate of Swann’s, with whom the author inquired.The small remote viewing community of the mid-1970s was of concern to certaincircles within the global intelligence community – American, Soviet, andprobably other nations. If one assumes the reality of an ET presence, and if onefurther supposes that the many accounts of alien telepathic ability have somevalidity, we might presume that the remote viewers were of interest to thealiens themselves. Indeed, it has been suggested to the author that Axelrod andhis blonde, blue-eyed helpers were perhaps not exactly human, either, butperforming their own counter-intelligence assessment of their vulnerabilities tohuman remote viewers.What is beyond dispute is that by 1975, the U.S. remote viewing program wasbumping into UFO-ET phenomena. Moreover, belief in an extraterrestrial presencebecame widespread among people involved in remote viewing. Major General AlbertStubblebine, who for years managed the Star Gate program, said “I will tell youfor the record that there are structures underneath the surface of Mars . . . .I will also tell you that there are machines under the surface of Mars that youcan look at.” cxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1802320]Last Hurrah of the Old RepublicThe remote viewing community was very secretive, and none of the precedinginformation would be public for many years. UFO researchers who brought FOIApetitions knew nothing about it. But the mid-1970s did experience a temporarybreakdown of decades of secrecy on a wide range of topics. Investigativereporter Seymour Hersh revealed in late 1974 that the CIA was not onlydestabilizing foreign governments, but was also conducting illegal intelligenceoperations against thousands of American citizens. On January 27, 1975, the U.S.Senate established a special body to investigate. Chaired by Senator FrankChurch (D-ID), with Senator John Tower (R-TX) as vice-chairman, the committeewas given nine months and 150 staffers to complete its work. They interviewed800 individuals, and conducted 250 executive and 21 public hearings. The topicsincluded assassination plots involving foreign leaders, secret storage of toxicagents, CIA domestic mail opening programs, activities of the National SecurityAgency, the FBI’s “Counterintelligence Program” (Cointelpro) and warrantlesselectronic surveillance, improper surveillance of American citizens by the U.S.military, the Internal Revenue Service as an intelligence resource andcollector, covert actions, and re-investigations of the assassinations of JohnF. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. cxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1802471] In many respects, this was the only time in American history that aSenate Committee looked critically and carefully into the U.S. intelligencecommunity. The NSA, for instance, had never before been subject to any oversightby Congress. An earlier investigation led by Vice President Nelson Rockefellerhad led to discovery of the NSA’s Operation Shamrock, which involved electronicmonitoring of Americans. Now, facing the Church Committee questions, the NSAeventually conceded that Shamrock ended not because of legal issues, but becauseit simply had not produced much of value. Pushed by Church, the committee votedto make its report public, over the objections of NSA, President Ford, and itsown Republican members. Church argued that there was a danger that NSA’stechnology “could be turned against the American people at a great cost toliberty. . . . no American would have any privacy left. . . . There would be noplace to hide.” cxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1802668] The committeecreated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which for the firsttime outlined what the NSA could and could not do. It outlawed the wholesale,warrantless acquisition of raw telegrams, such as had occurred under Shamrock.cxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1802910] In effect, the Old Republic was giving it one last hurrah against America’strue governing institution: the National Security State. Even so, resistance wasstrong. Although many of the committee recommendations were adopted, much wasthrown out by the 1980s, to say nothing of post-911 America. Thus, thecommittee’s conclusion that in all probability John F. Kennedy was assassinatedin some sort of conspiracy remained just that – a conclusion without any legalfollowup or prosecution. Some of the more egregious violations of law, whichincluded the FBI’s Cointelpro, the NSA’s Shamrock, or the CIA’s MK-Ultra, hadalready been terminated, then renamed and re-established under greater secrecy.Incidentally, when discussing any connection of then-president Gerald Ford withUFOs, attention is inevitably drawn to the fact that as a Congressman in 1966,Ford publicly discussed the topic before his colleagues, seeking to get someanswers. The question arises as to what, if any, UFO information he came acrossin his capacity as President. In truth, there is no public information makingany such connection. This is not the same, of course, as saying there was none.Many years later, UFO investigator and retired Air Force Major George Filerwrote to Ford about the existence of UFOs. Ford replied:During my public career in Congress, as Vice President and President, I madevarious requests for any information on UFOs. The official authorities alwaysdenied the UFO allegations. As a result I have no information that may behelpful to you.Filer, an experienced researcher familiar with the ways of the military andgovernment, concluded that “if Congress, like the President, uses its normalsources of intelligence such as CIA, DIA, NSA, NASA, they will likely get thesame answer as our Presidents claim they were given.” Filer suggested that U.S.government intelligence agencies “are not aware or responsive to UFO reports anda possible alien threat. We have a choice to assume they are incompetent,unaware or lying.” cxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1803068]One CIA document from 1975, obtained through FOIA, confirms that U.S. governmentagencies continued to collect data on UFOs. It describes a September 1975meeting of the International Congress of Space Medicine, attended by CIAoperatives. The memo stated that:US scientists believe that low magnetic fields, oscillating magnetic fields, andelectromagnetic fields can or do have considerable effect. There is a theorythat such fields are closely associated with superconductivity at very lowtemperatures, such as in space. This in turn is related to the possiblepropulsion system of UFOs. There is a rumor that fragments of a possible UFOfound in Brazil bore a relationship to superconductors and magnetohydrodynamics.cxvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1803205]The rest of the memo is blacked out. This of course does not mean that the CIAas an organization or analysts individually thought UFOs were “real.” But thetone of the memo is such that at least some members of the agency were takingthis topic seriously, as though it were real. It is hard to know for sure, sincenothing else of the document is available. UFOs Elsewhere in the WorldAs far as UFO sightings are concerned, American reports dominated the year. Asalways, however, the phenomenon was global. Canada was the scene of severallanding and trace cases, as well as one very interesting photographic case.During the early afternoon of March 18, 1975, Pat McCarthy, age 19, of Hamilton,Ontario was out trying to photograph hawks. His camera was a German-madePraktica Nova 1, with a 135 mm lens, and was loaded with Kodak Plus X ASA 125film. By 1:30 p.m., McCarthy had found no birds and was about to leave for home,when he saw an object resembling a frisbee. It moved too fast to be a bird, andhe decided to take photos of it. Because of its speed, he had difficulty infollowing it with his camera, but he eventually snapped four photos, capturingthe object three times. McCarthy had some knowledge of aircraft, and estimatedthe object to have been fairly large: twice the size of a DC-8 (which is roughly150 feet long, with a wingspan of 140 feet).Realizing he had photos of great potential significance, he immediately took thecamera to the local newspaper, the Hamilton Spectator . The film was stillundeveloped in his camera, and was processed there in the newspaper’s owndarkroom. APRO investigated the case, finding the witness credible, and alsonoting that the images bore a striking similarity to photographs taken in Brazilin 1959. cxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1803471]Several apparent landing cases took place in Canada during the spring and summerof 1975. On April 26, 1975 at 2 a.m. in Chomeday, Laval, Quebec, a light wasseen to descend briefly behind a school, apparently leaving behind a piece ofmetal and a hole in the ground. The case was investigated by LeonardStringfield. A similar case took place on May 10 in the town of Carman,Manitoba. According to a Canadian representative of CUFOS, Dan Bjarnason, a UFOwas said to have landed in a field. Employees from the Winnipeg planetariuminvestigated and found radioactivity four times higher than that of thesurrounding land. Late in the evening two days later, in Peesane, Saskatchewan,two witnesses saw an unusual object with a green light for about ten minutes,which then moved away to the east. A perfectly round circle was found in thearea, five feet in diameter, with a ring width of six inches. The Royal CanadianMounted Police took soil samples and photographs. On July 6 at 5 p.m. in MountPleasant, Ontario, a man named Joe Borda saw a metallic cylinder in a fieldabout 800 feet away. When he examined the ground later, an area fifty feetacross was slightly burned, and an oily substance was found. Ted Phillips ofCUFOS investigated. The same month in Sharon, Ontario, another ring was found,also investigated by CUFOS. cxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1803640] Southern Africa experienced a rash of unusual events beginning in mid-July. Onesuch case which elicited government attention occurred at a prison in Khami,Bulawayo, in Southwestern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Incidentally, this is on theother side of the country from Mount Inyangani, where Pat Price said an alienbase was located. On July 15, at about 8:15 p.m., prison officials saw an orangeobject, almost circular with a flat bottom and rounded top, approximately one ortwo miles away. Thirty minutes later, another officer saw a similar object inthe same place. Nothing more was reported that evening. The following night at7:30 p.m., a bright, round, silvery object was seen hovering motionless two orthree miles northeast of the prison. It then moved rapidly to the east. Late inJuly, a Member of Parliament asked the government to set up a committee toinvestigate the sightings; Rhodesian Minister of Transport and Power, RogerHawkins, agreed that the matter deserved attention. A spokesperson for theRhodesian Air Force, however, said that nothing showed up on radar, and addedthat the U.S. Air Force had found explanations for most UFO reports, a referenceto the Condon Committee study of the 1960s.On July 28, in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), two police officersdrove toward an object hovering 500 feet above the ground, while three otherofficers watched from the roof of their station. When the two approached, theobject moved away. After midnight, a motorist reported, a “big bright light”twice the apparent size of the sun, with an indentation on top, and whichfollowed his car as he drove. The following day, in South Africa at the southerntip of the continent in the city of Joubertina, a silvery sphere crashed toEarth, just missing a farmhouse and shattering a hard boulder. Later reportsindicated that it may have been Russian space hardware. cxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1803834] Astartling case occurred on July 31 in Loxton, South Africa. At 7:30 a.m., afarmer named Danie van Graan went out to inspect his sheep herd and saw asilver, oval-shaped object resting on legs. Van Graan approached to within 15feet. Through a large window he saw four beings, three of whom seemed to beexamining some device, while the other stood near a panel of flashing lights.They were thin, pale, and seemed to be about five feet tall. They had lightcolored hair, slanted eyes, sharp pointed chins, and wore white coveralls withhoods. Van Graan heard a “tick” sound, and the beings became aware of hispresence. A beam of light immediately hit him in the face; his nose bled and hevomited. The object made a humming sound and took off sharply. Cynthia Hind ofMUFON South Africa investigated and found a circle 30 feet in diameter with fourmarks on the outside perimeter. Near the center was a deposit of small greengranules, later determined to be carbon thaumasite, a water-retaining substancenot common to the area. Nothing grew in the affected area for some timeafterwards. cxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1804031] More SouthAfrican sightings occurred throughout August.Europe had its share of weirdness. On August 13, 1975, near Haderslev, Denmark,a police officer driving home at about 10:50 p.m. found himself engulfed in abright light. His headlights and engine died, and it became hot inside the car.Shielding his eyes, he reached for a microphone and tried to call his station,but the radio was dead. He looked up and saw a beam of light from an opening atthe bottom of a circular object, about 35 feet in diameter, hovering perhaps 60feet above the ground. He took three pictures of it before it rose straight upand was gone. It had been silent the whole time. The photographs captured a“light source,” and the officer turned the film over to the Danish Air Force.According to Richard Hall, no follow-up reports or images are available. cxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1804203] SummaryConsidering that 1974 and the first half of 1975 receive so little attentionfrom UFO researchers, the two years were significant for many reasons. Firstwere the many interesting sightings of objects supposed to be impossible, someof which were well documented and investigated. The existence of such sightingsstands as a monument to the disparity between “official” and “real” truth.Something unusual was going on in Earth’s skies. Second were the politicaldevelopments, the most important of which allowed for greater public access intogovernment records, fruits of which were just beginning to be seen by 1975,proving that there was indeed a secret government interest in UFOs. Along theselines were several startling statements on UFO secrecy from leading politicaland military figures from France, Spain, and the U.S. Third were the stridesmade by researchers, particularly in America, which had by far the largest andmost sophisticated civilian-based UFO investigative and reporting network in theworld. American UFO research became a much more serious endeavor during thisperiod, spurred on by the goal of ‘scientific ufology.’ The field developed anattractive combination of rigor and intellectual daring.Ufology was in a crescendo that would continue through most of the 1970s. It isfor this reason only that these early years have faded from memory. For theyears that followed would have more of everything.Chapter 2 Intruder Alert1975-1976 The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation ofthe UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data.― General Carlos Castro Cavero (Spain), 1976 ... object headed for the F-4 at a very fast rate of speed. The pilot attemptedto fire an AIM-9 missile at the object but at that instant his weapons controlpanel went off and he lost all communications.― Defense Intelligence Agency memo on UFO encounter over Tehran, 1976. Helicopters and Mutilations in the American WestFour themes dominated the second half of 1975: cattle mutilations, blackhelicopters, abduction cases, and violations of U.S. military air space by UFOs.There was a good deal of overlap and apparent inter-relationships among thesephenomena.Mutilations of many types of animals (not just cattle) had been noted throughoutmuch of the U.S. and Canada since 1967, although the phenomenon spiked sharplyat the end of 1974 and throughout 1975. cxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1804462] Such animalshad certain typical features. Usually, an animal would be found dead, lying onits side, with no predator tracks anywhere, and no sign of struggle. An earwould be missing, along with a circle of flesh around the eye and eyeball. Muchof the flesh covering the jaw would also be completely gone, leaving the boneexposed, and occasionally the teeth and jawbone itself were neatly removed. Inmost cases, the tongue was smoothly cut from deep within the throat, and a fewnecropsies confirmed the removal of the larynx and trachea. The genitals wereusually cut cleanly away, leaving a flat, oval shape. In nearly all cases,rectal tissue would be removed in a hole about four inches wide and six tofourteen inches deep.Law enforcement officers were also puzzled by the massive loss of blood, and yetno obvious place where the blood could have gone. Adding to the aura of mystery,ranchers and law enforcement officials would often see predators such ascoyotes, wolves, and bears approach a mutilated animal, only to stop severalfeet away and circle the carcass as if an invisible barrier were present. Mostdramatically, some necropsies confirmed an absence of heart tissue, and yet noevidence of cuts or tears of the clear membrane that surrounded a cow’s heart.In other words, it appeared that someone was able to remove the large organwithout cutting into the chest wall. Some veterinarians who studied theseanimals marveled, and the braver ones said that the work was done withinstruments not available to them.In her investigation of animal mutilation tissues with John Altshuler, M.D.,pathologist and hematologist in Denver, Colorado, television producer andinvestigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe was able to confirm that excisionsin several mutilated animals were cut with high heat. Further, when Altshulerexamined mutilation tissues under microscopes, he found no carbon black. AllEarth creatures are carbon-based life forms. If the cutting instrument were alaser or other form of electrical cautery, there would be “black pepper grain”evidence of carbon at the excisions. Altshuler told Howe, “I know we’re lookingat tissue exposed to heat that has cauterized, but I don’t know what the cuttinginstrument is because lasers would leave carbon residue. Yet, there is none.”cxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1805185] A number of the mutilation cases were accompanied by reports of UFOs,strange helicopters, possible landing traces, and burned tree tops. A researchernamed Tom Adams was the first to track not only the cases of mutilation, butalso the mystery helicopter phenomenon. During the spring and summer of 1975, herecorded more than 200 cases of helicopters near or at mutilation sites. Notsimply helicopters, however. Some individuals claimed to see stranger objects,in other words UFOs, near mutilation sites. cxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1805486]The event that seems to have “kicked off” the new wave of mutilations occurredin December 1974, when a heifer was found inside a perfect circle of melted snowin Kimball, Minnesota. The animal’s eyes, left ear, tongue, and part of its lipwere removed. No footprints, tracks, or blood were found. Matters became reallystrange when a pilot and photographer flew over the area. A quarter mile southof the mutilation site, they saw dozens of circles in random patterns spreadover several acres. The St. Paul, Minnesota Dispatch featured one of thephotographs in an article, “UFOs Zapping Cows?” cxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1805773] From January to May 1975, eastern Texas generated many reports of“mutes,” helicopters, and UFOs. Most of these cases occurred in a corridor about50 miles wide and 200 miles long, running between Dallas and Austin and pointingnortheast toward Arkansas. cxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1805999] A particularlyinteresting incident, recalling the Kimball case, came from Cochran County onMarch 10. There, a mutilated heifer was found in the center of a perfectly roundcircle 30 feet in diameter. Its head was twisted straight up in the air, thebottom of its jaw was cut back, the tongue was gone, sex organs were cut off andmissing, and the naval was cut out in a circle. The animal was drained of bloodand its meat was untouched. Stranger still, a mutilated steer was found in thecenter of another 30 foot circle only a quarter of a mile away. A team fromReese AFB came to the site to check for abnormal radioactivity, but foundnothing. cxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1806348] Texans were claiming that unmarked helicopters were flying low andharassing their livestock. One citizen asked the Federal Aviation Administrationto investigate. Documents obtained through FOIA indicate that the FAA quietlycontacted Fort Hood and Bergstrom AFB, the two closest military bases, both ofwhich denied any knowledge of the helicopter flights. There is no evidence ofany follow-up, either by the FAA or any other agency, although in a logicalworld one would assume the matter deserved an investigation. cxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1806562] By April, unmarked helicopters were reported in Kansas and Colorado.Some of these were linked with mutilation cases, such as a May 29 incident justoutside Denver. cxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1806795] Much of theactivity was taking place near military installations in the central Coloradoarea, near the home of the U.S. Air Force Academy and NORAD headquarters. OnJuly 6, a mutilated pregnant cow was found next to a high security NORADentrance gate, and the sheriff’s office determined that it was not caused by apredator. cxxx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1806959]On July 17, three girls on horseback near Colorado Springs claimed to have beenchased by a helicopter. On July 23, in nearby Elbert County, Undersheriff BillWaugh saw a silent helicopter through his binoculars. This could be significant,but there is not enough detail to know just what happened. A silent helicopterin 1975 would be very important. What we do know is that local police wereconcerned about these helicopters, as on the very same night, they undertook asearch for a helicopter which had appeared several times in Teller County (whichby then had already reported forty cattle mutilations).The phenomenon was also being recorded in northern New Mexico, with a heavyconcentration in the small town of Dulce. Gabriel Valdez, a decorated statepolice officer, investigated cattle mutilations as well as reports of anomalousflying lights. Neither he nor ranchers found tracks of any creature near themutilated animals. Occasionally, they found tripod-like tracks, as well astracks that appeared to come from small tractors. Other items and materials werealso found, such as whitish powdered substances, torn and crumpled pieces ofpaper, and even a gas mask. Some of the cattle had marks on one hind leg, andmany had broken bones, which led to the theory that they had been lifted with arope or cable and then dropped. This would seem to point to some sort of human,covert activity connected to the mutes. Years later, this became Valdez’sconclusion, after he rejected his earlier position that this was somethingalien. cxxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1807122]Yet, Dulce remained the scene of numerous sightings of unusual nocturnal lightsfor years, including sightings of objects that certainly appeared to be UFOs.Such activity suggests that the mutilations may have had more than one source.By the late 1970s, rumors would develop of an underground base – possibly alien– under nearby Mount Archuleta.As in Texas, the people of New Mexico demanded justice, not just for themutilations, but for the harassment of the phantom helicopters. In the summer of1975, the FAA announced it would investigate. Tom Adams tried to determinethrough FOIA whether this in fact happened. Instead the relevant FAA officesdenied any knowledge of such an investigation, even after he provided them witha newspaper account announcing the start of the probe. As to what they may haveactually found, Adams concluded “apparently, [they found] reasons not toannounce their findings.” cxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1807304] A New Pattern in AbductionsIn the words of Coral Lorenzen, Sergeant Charles (“Chuck”) Moody was a “big,likable man” who had previously laughed off UFO stories. He was a decoratedVietnam veteran with fourteen years active duty in the Air Force, and in 1975was stationed at Holloman AFB in Alamogordo, New Mexico. On the night of August12/13, Moody decided to see some of the Perseid meteor shower after his shift.Shortly after 12:30 a.m., he drove about fifteen minutes out of town into thequiet night country of the American southwest. The meteor shower was notespecially spectacular, but at 1:20 a.m., Moody saw something else. An objectabout 50 feet in diameter descended from the sky and hovered a mere 20 feet offthe ground. It glowed slightly, wobbled for a short time, then became stationaryand made a buzzing sound. Moody was 300 feet away from it, and through a lightedrectangular window in the craft he saw human-shaped forms moving about.Frightened, he got back into his car, but the battery was dead. When the buzzingstopped, he felt an odd sense of calm, then saw the object ascend into the sky.Thankfully, he could now start his car. The only problem was that the time onhis watch read 2:45 a.m. Eighty-five minutes had passed, and Moody could notunderstand why. He arrived home at 3 a.m., where his wife was waiting for him.He told her about the UFO, but not about the missing time.The next day, Moody felt lower back pain, and wondered what had happened to him.On the 14th, he bought a copy of a magazine called “Official UFO,” and wrote tothe editor, hoping for some help. The editor forwarded his information to theLorenzens at APRO, who received it on August 20th. By now, Moody’s back pain hadworsened, and he had developed a rash on his lower body. James Lorenzen talkedwith Moody by phone, and then visited him in person accompanied by UFOresearcher (and former military pilot) Wendelle Stevens. Coral Lorenzen alsointerviewed the Moodys several times. Before the Lorenzens could arrange ahypnotic regression for Moody, an old friend of his, Dr. Abraham Goldman,formerly an Air Force flight surgeon and a practicing neurosurgeon consultant,suggested a method of self-hypnosis. This appeared to work by bits and pieces.By the first week of October, Moody had some recall of the incident, which herelated to the Lorenzens.Moody remembered his captors being close to six feet tall, although the leaderwas less than five feet tall. They were “very much like us,” he said, “excepttheir heads were larger and hairless, their ears were very small, eyes a littlelarger than ours, nose small, and the mouth had very thin lips.” They were also“very thin,” and seemed to communicate telepathically. In fact, Moody never sawtheir lips move. He remembered fighting with the beings before being taken,perhaps accounting for his soreness. To disable him, they used a type of lightor sound frequency. He then found himself on a table, although he did notdescribe any medical procedure. He felt they looked at him in a stern yet gentlemanner. After a while, they let him down from the table, and he asked to see thepropulsion unit, which they showed him near the underside of the craft, stillfrom the inside. It contained three diamond or crystal like structures, and barsor rods, but Moody was unable to receive (or remember) any technicalexplanation. He could not understand how the various large rooms could fit intothe craft. The ship was very clean, and at times smelled like a kind of burnedsugar. For at least some of his time on board, Moody’s breathing was labored.There was a fair amount of communication between Moody and these beings. Helearned that the ship he was on was used for “observing,” while their main craftwas 400 miles above the earth. They told him there were a number of races fromdifferent places who were working together. Their craft could be destroyed bynuclear weapons, and radar was a problem for them, as it acted to jam theirnavigation. Moody told the Lorenzens that “in the near future there will becontact made with this planet – limited contact. It is not for us as a humanrace to accept them, but them, for these beings, to accept us.... Possibly therewill be twenty years of very limited contact and then, and only then, after deepconsideration on their part, would we even be accepted.” cxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1807548] Moody’s account was uncommon in 1975, but immediately following his abduction,two similar cases in the American west took place. One was on August 26 in NorthDakota. A woman named Sandra Larson had left Fargo at 3:15 a.m. with herdaughter Jackie, and a man named Terry who drove them west toward Bismarck onInterstate 94. She was on her way to take a real estate exam that morning. At3:30 a.m., still not far from Fargo, they heard a noise like thunder, but“louder than any thunder imaginable.” The sky lit up and eight or ten glowingobjects, like orange balls, came down. Terry pulled over, but at this pointmemories became vague. Somehow Jackie, who had been in the front seat betweenTerry and her mother, was now in the back seat, although no one seemed to noticeat the time. They drove on and caught up with another vehicle on the road.Sandra rolled down her window to ask, “Did you see that?” The man and woman inthe other car said yes. Terry asked them to pull over, but the passenger in theother vehicle said, “We’re getting the hell out of here.”The three soon realized they had about an hour of missing time. Sandra andJackie were later put under hypnosis by APRO consultant Dr. Leo Sprinkle,Director of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.Sandra recalled being taken aboard a UFO, stripped, and given a medical exam(including her sexual organs) by a creature “with elastic bandages for a head,or elastic bandages around its head.” She remembered a sharp instrument beingpushed up her nose, and claimed that her chronic sinus condition was gone afterthis encounter. At one point she felt as if her brain had been “taken out,” hadsomething done to it, and then placed back in her head. She also saw Terry beingexamined, but not Jackie. Jackie was regressed several times, and only recalledbeing “left stranded in a field.” APRO investigator Jerome Clark investigatedthe case, and learned that two other witnesses had reported a UFO to the statepolice at the time that Sandra, Jackie, and Terry were having their experience.Allen Hynek also met with Sandra and Jackie, and although he did not becomeespecially involved in the case, told United Press International (UPI) thatLarson “seemed to live through a frightening experience (i.e. through hypnosis).I believe she thinks she was taken aboard a UFO. I don’t think she is lying, inother words.” Terry, for his part, wanted no part in any investigation of theaffair.One especially interesting aspect of this case is that the regressions hinted atmultiple abduction experiences for Sandra and Jackie. Sandra said the beingstold her they would be back, while Jackie vaguely recalled an unsettling bedroomscenario in December, some months after the initial experience. Under hypnosis,she remembered seeing shadowy figures come to her bedroom, and many othersoutside her house. Clark wondered if there was a psychological explanation, butno one posited the simple proposition that mother and daughter were multiple“experiencers.” In 1975, abductions were still considered peripheral to the UFOphenomenon, if they were even believed at all. cxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1807990]The other major abduction case to take place in the western U.S. was the TravisWalton abduction, more on which later. The FBI Backs AwayUFO sightings, unmarked helicopters, and mutilations continued on a crescendothroughout September, October, and November. Trying to make sense of thesesightings is difficult, given a near-complete silence from government agencies.No group ever claimed the helicopters, yet they seemed connected to themutilations. Researchers Lawrence Fawcett and Barry Greenwood speculated thatthe helicopters were a paramilitary “quick response unit” to check areas of highUFO and mutilation activity. One well-placed source told them that “some of themutilations were UFO-related.” However, the source “could not discuss thedetails of the cases because the information is classified.” Although theauthors would not reveal the source’s identity, they said they knew who he wasand his standing within the government. cxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1808253] Some public figures discussed the mutilations. In August 1975, SenatorFloyd Haskell of Colorado asked the FBI for help. cxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1808431] On September4, the Governor of Colorado, Richard D. Lamm, said it was “no longer possible toblame [natural] predators for the mutilations.” A special investigator for thestate, Carl Whiteside, agreed. cxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1808589] Apparently,the FBI was not impressed. On September 24, the bureau announced it would notassist Colorado in investigating the mutilations, that local law enforcement wasup to the job. cxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1808755]The FBI had no motivation to investigate. Prospects for solving the mystery didnot look good. It had been going on hot and heavy for most of the year, and nota single culprit had been caught. Moreover, the mutilations were alreadybecoming associated in the public mind with UFOs, and this was a no-no for anyfederal agency. And what if the FBI did investigate, and concluded that themutilations showed evidence of advanced technology, including portable lasersand covert transport of cattle? Then, it would have to deal with that problem.How to do that? Far better to pass this hot potato to local agencies. At leastthe matter had a chance of dying down and going far, far away. One could onlyhope.Going Crazy in the WestNot all helicopter sightings were connected to the mutes. On September 3 in thetown of Tujunga, about 15 miles from Los Angeles, three witnesses observed twohelicopters following a colorful UFO. The top of the object was a vibrantblue-green, the middle portion white, and the bottom glowed red. It appeared tochange its shape into a “classic saucer” and zigzagged across the sky. The eventlasted from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m., and shortly before the end, the witnesses sawthe lights go on at the Nike missile base in the mountains near their location.This was a very rare occurrence. Afterwards, the eyes of all three witnesseswere painful and red; one of them reported the incident and was eventually ledto MUFON investigator Ann Druffel. Druffel contacted every known facilityinvolving official or private helicopters within a 300 mile radius of the area.None admitted to seeing a UFO, but the Los Angeles Police Department said one ofits helicopters had been in the area that night; its pilot reported nothingunusual. Druffel also learned that the Nike missile base had been phased out theprevious year and turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers. Why the lightswent on at the base during the UFO sighting was never determined. cxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1808915] Farther west, in the State of Washington, many UFOs were being reportedthroughout September. On the 26th, two F-106 fighters from the 318th FighterInterceptor Squadron were scrambled from McChord AFB, near Tacoma, in search ofthem. In an unusual admission, an Air Force spokesman said the interceptors weresent in response to the many UFO reports over Tacoma, although neither pilotreported anything unusual. However, McChord’s radar was tracking somethingduring this period of time – the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department stated thatMcChord had notified them that their radar was tracking an unidentified objecthovering over Tacoma at 18,000 feet, although the date on this was notspecified. cxl [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809109] Back in 1967, Malmstrom AFB in Montana had been the scene of anawe-inspiring display by a reddish glowing object that disabled over twentyICBMs at two separate sites. Now, in 1975, the region was again subjected toaerial craft with an interest in America’s missiles. During mid-September, UFOsdescribed as huge orange or red glowing discs were being seen over Minutemanmissile sites at Malmstrom. Helicopters were frequently seen, as well. InLewiston, Montana, about 100 miles southeast of Great Falls, police notified thesheriff’s department that several spotlight-equipped helicopters were flyingover Minuteman missile sites in that area. Authorities at Malmstrom denied thesereports. According to researcher Terry Hansen, a friend later told him thatduring this period he had lived in Montana and owned a VHF scanning radio. Withthe radio, Hansen’s friend heard reports that UFOs were being seen overMinuteman ICBM silos around Great Falls, “to the great distress of regionalsecurity personnel and law enforcement officials.” The U.S. nuclear arsenalappeared to be a target of interest, and there was little the Air Force could doabout it. The friend heard a sheriff discussing missile silos near the town ofPower, Montana. He heard a statement that Great Falls radar was tracking aparticular UFO, and an inquiry as to whether the Air Force’s Havre radar wastracking it. Havre’s reply was, sometimes yes, and sometimes no. One sheriff’sdeputy said over the radio, “If Havre can’t see these on radar we’re in bigtrouble.” cxli [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809280] It is not clear what these objects were, but low-flying helicopters werebeing seen throughout the Great Falls area all through September, October, andNovember. Frequently they flew at night and would hover or remain in an area foran unusually long period of time. More than once they were so low that theycaused homes to vibrate. cxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809441] Matters were becoming intense. On October 5, county sheriff officers inColorado’s Alamosa County performed a 3 a.m. chase of a helicopter that hadbright search lights. cxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809621] Around thistime, in Wyoming’s Uinta County, a reserve lawman engaged in a shootout with anaggressive military helicopter. cxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809808] Bymid-October, Montana was afire with mutilations, low-flying helicopters, andUFOs. A particularly disturbing mutilation case occurred near Great Falls onOctober 16. A cow had been in a securely locked pasture, yet its left jaw wasskinned, its tongue cut out, and its right eye removed – not merely from thesocket, but through the bone directly above the eye. The cow had been alive theprevious evening, and no tracks were seen. cxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1809986] Then, on thenight of October 18/19, Malmstrom AFB received nine UFO reports, most of whichcame from south of Great Falls, between 9 p.m. and 7:45 a.m. At 4:20 a.m. onOctober 19, the Shelby Sheriff’s office reported that police had seen afast-moving UFO which they estimated to be at an altitude of 2,000 feet.Military radar tracked this object; NORAD and Malmstrom AFB both confirmed thatit was not a conventional aircraft. cxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1810214] Unlike the mutilation mystery, which had been getting media attention, UFOsightings such as these received only sporadic local media coverage. TerryHansen carefully studied this development, and noted that Reuters, AssociatedPress, and the major networks simply did not pick these stories up, essentiallychoking them off at the national level. NORAD’s Top AlertAccording to the research of investigator Francis Ridge, NORAD appears to havegone on top alert status during late October 1975. Some years later, Ridge cameinto contact with a person who had witnessed a strange event that had takenplace at NORAD. This was a full-scale Security Option 5 Alert, and according toinformation Ridge received, UFOs and investigators from the “Air Force UFOdivision” were part of the picture. The date unfortunately was not preciselygiven.The first thing Ridge’s informant told him was “We weren’t drunk!” The men wereall employed at NORAD’s installation in Cheyenne Mountain, just outside ColoradoSprings. They had been hunting all day, had a late night fire going, and weregetting ready to sleep. Close to midnight, one of the men thought he saw ashooting star. Fifteen minutes later, someone else said, “Well, there’s two ofthem!” A moment later they saw a third. The lights moved separately to variouspoints in the sky, but eventually lined up and moved directly toward CheyenneMountain. Within a few minutes, they heard the buzzers indicating an alertstatus. The men packed their gear and headed back to their posts – although onleave, they were still on call. They drove to the mountain at top speed andentered the gate at 2:10 a.m., still in their hunting gear. They took theirweapons and went to their security posts while the base stayed on alert until 6a.m. Ridge’s informant had radar duty, and later told his friends that hetracked UFOs for “a good 20 minutes.” The men also learned that a significantnumber of jet interceptors had been scrambled.Within a few days, some of the men started checking into records regarding thesecurity alert. To their surprise, they found that nothing was filed, or perhapsthat the key material had been pulled. Apparently their snooping caused AirForce investigators to show up; Ridge’s informant referred to them as the AirForce “UFO people.” These men interviewed the group one by one, and told theradar operator to file a report with them. They then told the group that whatthey had seen had been aircraft landing lights. Even so, the men were told toignore the incident, go about their business, and never mention it again.Within two months each man in the group received a written reprimand fordrinking on duty – which was untrue, and in fact they had not even been on dutyat the time of the sighting. Ridge’s informant showed him the reprimanddocuments, along with a letter from a Colonel Terrence C. James, USAF, Directorof Administration, stating that the information pertaining to the overflight “isproperly and currently classified and is exempt from disclosure under Public Law90-23, 5 USC 552b(1).” cxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1810503] Up a Notch: Loring Air Force BaseThe NORAD case investigated by Ridge, while appearing to be legitimate, remainsofficially unconfirmed by available U.S. Defense records. Not so concerningintrusions of military airspace across nearly the entire U.S. northern border.These events left a paper trail that became partially declassified a few yearslater. There is no reasonable argument one can make to dispute their reality.What exactly these objects were remains unknown.The first confirmed case occurred far away from all the activity in the westernU.S. – at Loring AFB in northern Maine. On the evening of October 27, 1975, thebase control tower tracked a low flying craft on radar as it approached from thenortheast (in Canada), but could not establish contact with it. At 7:45 p.m.,Staff Sgt. Danny K. Lewis, on munitions security, saw a low flying craft movingalong the northern perimeter of the base. It then penetrated the perimeter at analtitude of about 300 feet. The object had a white strobe light and whatappeared to be a red navigation light. Once inside the base, it began to circle,and at one point came to within 300 yards of the nuclear weapons area, droppingits altitude to 150 feet. The Commander of the 42nd Bomb Wing, Colonel RichardE. Chapman, was notified of the situation, and brought the base to major alertstatus.This object was inside the base for quite some time, as it was observed by towerpatrol at 8:45 p.m. Other units of the 42nd police entered the scene. ColonelChapman requested fighter coverage from the 21st NORAD Region at Hancock Field,New York, as well as the 22nd NORAD Region at North Bay, Ontario, Canada. Inother words, jet interceptors. Interestingly, both groups denied the request.Chapman then had little recourse but to ask for help from Maine State Police.Meanwhile, he increased the base security presence and attempted to identify thecraft from his resources at hand. All attempts failed. The craft, which had beenin a circling pattern, began to move back toward the northeast. Radar maintainedcontact until it reached Grand Falls, New Brunswick, about 12 miles away.Canadian authorities were not notified, but the base sent priority messages toNational Military Command Center in Washington, D.C., the USAF Chief of Staff,the USAF Forward Operations Division at Fort Ritchie in Maryland, and StrategicAir Command (SAC) Headquarters at the 8th Air Force. Loring remained in a stateof high alert well into the morning hours.The scene at Loring was repeated just twenty-four hours later. At 7:45 p.m. onOctober 28, three security personnel at the munitions storage area saw an objectapproaching from the north at an altitude of 3,000 feet. For the nextthirty-five minutes, it was under constant visual and radar observation. It hada flashing white light and a solid amber light, and also seemed to have certainstealth characteristics, as it disappeared from view several times.Once again, Commander Chapman requested air support. This time he received itfrom a National Guard helicopter and crew; although permission was granted onlyfor tracking and identification, not apprehension, nor for crossing the Canadianborder. Chapman must have been feeling frustrated by now, and protested. Whybother authorizing a chopper if it cannot cross the border a mere twelve milesaway? 1 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1764121] Formuch of its time under observation, the object kept a distance of at least threemiles from the base. But somehow it penetrated security, for suddenly itappeared over the end of the runway at altitude of 150 feet.Researchers Fawcett and Greenwood reported that a crew chief of a B-52 bomber,along with other members of his crew, saw the object when it was over the flightline. The object appeared red and orange, resembling a “stretched-out football.”The crew chief said the object hovered in mid-air as everyone stared. It thenturned off its lights and “disappeared.” One would have to wonder how a normalobject could disappear simply by putting out its lights. A low flying object,even without lights, should have been visible at night if the observer knewwhere to look. The object reappeared over the north end of the runway. It firstmoved in “jerky motions,” then simply hovered. Although this was a restrictedarea, the crew drove toward the object anyway, getting to within 300 feet of it.They were afraid of trouble and decided not to report their sighting, but theytold the researchers that they saw the object clearly. It seemed as though itwas practically on the ground, hovering “without movement or noise.” It wasabout “four car lengths long,” and described by one witness as looking “like allthe colors were blending together, as if you were looking at a desert scene. Yousee waves of heat rising off the desert floor. . . . The object was solid and wecould not hear any noise coming from it.” No noise, nor did the witnesses seeany doors, windows, propellers, or engines. At this time the base was on highalert, replete with the sound of sirens filling the air and police vehiclesspeeding around the base.Again the lights of the object went off. When they came back on again, theobject had moved close to the weapons storage area, perhaps within a quarter ofa mile, still at an altitude of 150 feet. According to a Defense Departmentmemo, this happened near 1 a.m., which would mean the encounter had been goingon for more than five hours. At this time an Army National Guard helicopterattempted to “contact and identify” the intruder, but was “unsuccessful.” Notmuch detail is offered in these Defense memos, but we learn that the object(termed an “unidentified helicopter” in the memos) remained inside the base forat least another two hours.At 3 a.m., it was seen over the weapons storage area, completely unlit, but itsdark shape visible to ground personnel. Once again, the Army National Guardhelicopter responded, but crew members were unable to see the object – afrustrating experience for ground personnel, who could plainly see both objectsfrom their vantage point. Finally, at some point (the exact time is blackedout), “all contact was lost” with the unknown, although radar once again brieflytracked the object moving toward Grand Falls.This event lasted no less than seven hours. Seven highly unusual hours, in whichan object that invaded the air space of a U.S. base with nuclear weapons wasnever apprehended, nor even identified. The memo states:It is our opinion that the unknown helicopter has demonstrated a clear intent inthe weapons storage area, is smart and a most capable aviator. Local securityhas been increased. We anticipate further incidents. Accordingly, we willrequest the continued presence of air guard helicopters. We plan to pursue intoCanada if necessary. We have coordinated with Maine State Police and RoyalCanadian Mounted Police and have been assured of complete cooperation of both.RCMP will respond to any landing site in Canadian territory... cxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1810700] Another intrusion occurred at Loring on October 31. Less is known aboutthe specifics, except that this seems more confidently to have been ahelicopter. cxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1810969] The DefenseDepartment memo stated that three security policemen reported seeing and hearinga helicopter over the base proper, although the target could not be confirmed byradar. Canadian officials were alerted to check for possible landing sites, butno request was made for a fighter launch. The memo’s distribution list includedthe State Department, Defense Intelligence Agency, CIA, the White House, AirDefense Command, and more. cl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1811149] A letter fromthe base commander stated, “this incident closely parallels a similar helicoptersighting earlier this year,” which was said to have occurred in January 1975.However, that claim met with a denial from the Air Force Office of SpecialInvestigation (AFOSI), which stated their records revealed no such events fromthat period. Researchers Fawcett and Greenwood could find nothing else on theincident. cli [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1811326] One reason no action was taken against the objects over Loring was thefear over their proximity to the nuclear weapons. Greenwood later stated that“instructions at the time were not to put searchlights on these aircraft becausethey were afraid of blinding the pilot and causing him to crash into one of thebuildings and creating an accident, nuclear or otherwise.” clii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1811501] Somespeculated about a narcotics trafficking operation, although it is not clear whya narcotics trafficking operation would provoke a military base into a majoralert.Meanwhile, the obvious question is, what flew over Loring? The dominantassumption seems to have been helicopter. The object did appear to be similar insize to a helicopter and to some extent moved like one: hovering and droppingstraight down below the radar sweeps. Of course, it makes less sense consideringthat no sound was reported during the first two intrusions, even at lowaltitude. What kind of low flying helicopter cannot be easily heard on theground? In 1975? And what of the apparent helicopter heard on the third night?cliii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1811654]"},{"pageContent":" While Loring was being visited by an unknown intruder, Fawcett andGreenwood learned of a possible intrusion of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, onthe other side of Maine. According to Robert Kinn, he and a fellow student ofBowdoin College were near the Naval Air Station at the end of October, when theysaw an object come in very low from the ocean. It was much larger than ahelicopter, he said, could make ninety-degree turns, and could fly “very fast.”The two witnesses thought the object might have been a vertical takeoff plane,except for the fact that the naval base “lighted up like a Christmas tree ....the excitement on the base was way out of the usual.” The object remained overthe base for five or ten minutes and then moved back over the Atlantic Ocean. ABrunswick spokesman denied any UFO sightings for that time. Fawcett andGreenwood found no evidence that the witnesses had known anything about theactivity at Loring. cliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1811887] Making matters even stranger was an alleged abduction experience that occurredon October 27 in central Maine at the town of Norway – less than forty milesfrom the Brunswick Naval Air Station, and the same date of the first intrusionat Loring. This concerned two young men named David Stephens and Glen Gray.Early in the morning, while driving on Route 26 toward the town of Oxford, anunknown force wrenched the wheel of their car, taking them at speeds up to 100mph. They saw two bright lights in a field at the town of Poland – the lightsbegan to rise above the trees and swerved silently in front of their car, wherethey made out an enormous cigar-shaped object with red, green and blue lights onthe side. The men drove away, but a light struck the car and they blacked out,causing them to miss several hours of time. They woke up and continued to drivewhen, just before dawn, they arrived at Tripp Pond and encountered a huge UFO,possibly the same object as before, along with two other domed saucer-shapedobjects above the pond. The two saucers skimmed low over the water and releaseda grey smoke which surrounded their car. They saw the large UFO high in the airthrough the smoke. Then, suddenly, all the objects disappeared, even the smoke.The event seemed utterly unbelievable, but both men had physiological effects(swollen hands and feet, loose teeth, red rings around the neck, and chills) andtook it upon themselves to speak to the local sheriff the following day. Thesheriff was skeptical of their story, but over the next few months Stephens metwith Dr. Herbert Hopkins, a trained hypnotherapist. He underwent eightregression sessions which revealed an abduction experience. He recalled shorthumanoid creatures between four and five feet tall, with large heads, slantedeyes, no hair or visible mouths, and wearing dark robes. Five or six suchentities stood around a long table and had Stephens get on the table to preparefor an examination. Stephens resisted and struck one of the creatures, with noeffect. He remembered a small square machine with an extension arm and probetaking samples of his skin, nails, hair, and blood. The encounter seemed to beimpossible to believe, and yet offered no easy prosaic explanation. In otherwords, it was a fairly standard UFO abduction story. clv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1812066] The Wurtsmith AFB EncounterThe confirmed Loring events occurred on October 27, 28, and 31. Meanwhile, onOctober 30, another UFO entered restricted space at Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan, aSAC base on Michigan’s lower peninsula two miles west of Lake Huron. Once again,an object that resembled a helicopter – but then again not exactly –demonstrated interest in the weapons storage facilities.Just after 10 p.m., an airman in the housing area at the southeastern portion ofthe base saw what looked like running lights of a low flying craft near the baseperimeter south of his position. It had one light pointing down and two redlights near the back. At least part of the time this object hovered and moved upand down somewhat erratically. The witness heard no sound from this object, butdid manage to hear a more distant B-52 to the north.A few minutes later, an on-duty airman near the main gate saw several lightsclose to his position, near the western edge of the base. He heard no sound andwatched the lights turn north and appear to lose altitude. This may or may nothave been the same object. Then, three times within the space of eleven minutes,security police at the back gate reported that an unidentified helicopter withno lights entered the base itself. It was low over the ground and seen near theweapons storage area.As in the case at Loring, no one could confidently identify this craft as ahelicopter. One sergeant said he heard the sound of a “possible helicopter”coming from an area off the base toward the north. He heard this briefly, thenthe noise was drowned out by a military jet. When the jet passed out of range,the original noise was gone and nothing more was heard.While these visual sightings were occurring, radar personnel reported low flyingobjects (plural) in the area. It happened that a KC-135 tanker with sixpersonnel on board was then entering the area and was ordered to intercept andidentify the object or objects. Vectored by the base control tower, the planepursued what at first appeared to be a single craft for 35 miles southeast,traveling a little faster than 200 miles per hour. After some time, the crewdecided they were seeing two objects. The lights on these objects flashedirregularly, making it appear that they were in communication with each other.No one could be sure, however, and radar returns could not be held for longerthan ten seconds at a time. They were only about a mile behind, but every timethe crew increased speed to close the distance, the object(s) simply pulledaway.At Saginaw Bay, the tanker crew lost their quarry among fishing boat lights. Asthey started back, it became clear that they were involved in a cat-and-mousegame. The object (apparently it was one object) began following them.Here is an account of what happened, as told to the official base historian:On the way back, we picked the UFO up again at our eight o’clock position. Weturned away, and it proceeded to follow us. Finally, we turned back in thedirection of the UFO and it really took off back in the direction of the Bayarea. I know this might sound crazy, but I would estimate that the UFO sped awayfrom us doing approximately 1,000 knots.That happens to be more than 1,000 mph. As the plane approached the base, lightsagain were seen near the weapons storage area. From available records, it isunclear how this matter resolved itself, but obviously the object left at somepoint. Following the mission, the crew was cautioned “not to discuss theincident.” clvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1812366] To the extent that anyone tries to explain this incident, “helicopter” is mosttypically offered as the culprit. But, what helicopter can travel faster than1,000 mph?Looking into the matter a bit further, we find that the U.S. military test-flewa very important helicopter for the very first time on September 30, 1975,shortly before all this airspace violation business began. That was the HughesYAH-64, a prototype of the Apache helicopter – one of the world’s premier attackhelicopters. Although it is ludicrous to explain the Wurtsmith case with theYAH-64/Apache, it is instructive to understand some of the capabilities of thisvery impressive helicopter. In the first place, during late 1975, there wereonly two flying models of the YAH-64. Both were in California. By January 1976,these two models had completed a total of roughly 65 flight hours. A full scaledevelopment contract did not come until later that year, and Apaches were notdelivered to the U.S. Army until 1984. From its inception, the Apache was toughunder combat, and reasonably quiet, although it was never silent by any means.(Major strides in helicopter noise reduction were still ten years away, when thebenefits of a five-blade design were accidentally discovered.) clvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1812543] It couldachieve a top speed of roughly 190 mph, with a range of about 300 miles. Thisrange could be extended with external fuel tanks, which however would reduce thespeed and general performance of the helicopter. Even the Apache of the 21stcentury, with its various upgrades and modifications, cannot do the things thatwere being reported by base personnel in 1975. clviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1812746] What remain are reports of a silent or near-silent aircraft able to hover andmaneuver like a helicopter and accelerate like a jet fighter, engaging inconfrontational behavior within sensitive U.S. military installations – in 1975.From Bad to WorseIf the military encounters with UFOs had ended at this point, they would stillremain a bizarre and unexplained part of U.S. military history. But thesituation worsened in November. Sightings of strange mysterious helicopters,UFOs, and animal mutilations continued. clix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1813013] Two events were recorded at military bases on November 3. One turned outto be a completely “ordinary” security violation at Grand Forks AFB in NorthDakota. According to a Department of Defense (DoD) memo, unknown personspenetrated the flight line and “at least two KC-135 aircraft were hit by smallarms fire.” Security forces pursued the attackers but apparently did notapprehend them. The event seemed to have no connection to the UFO intrusions,although the Air Force frequently referred to it in public statements. Not onlydid this deflect attention from the genuinely mysterious cases, but it led tothe idea that protesters or terrorists were involved instead of actual UFOs. clx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1813270] On the same date, an entry in the log of an Air Force IntelligenceService Alert Officer reported a UFO in Alaska. Further FOIA requests by Fawcettand Greenwood came up empty, however. According to what they were told,information on the event was not kept. “Whatever happened,” they wrote, “musthave been interesting!” clxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1813509]The lack of truly comprehensive and publicly available records make it difficultto tell for sure where the densest UFO activity was at this time, but the bestguess for early November 1975 is Montana. On November 2, near Fort Benton, anon-duty police officer saw a very bright UFO flying irregularly for about 30minutes. The sheriff’s department contacted Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) butwas told nothing was seen on radar. On November 5, east of Great Falls, a manreported seeing six UFOs in formation at 4:10 a.m. One dropped down nearly tothe level of his truck. On November 7, this time west of Great Falls, anotherearly morning sighting took place. In this case, two women traveling on thehighway at 3:38 a.m. reported being followed by a bright light, greyish in colorwith occasional blue lights. clxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1813688] Malmstrom Air Force Base, MontanaWhich brings us to the inexplicable events of November 7, 1975 at Malmstrom AirForce Base in Montana. At approximately 3 p.m., electronic sensors at the basedetected a violation of missile site security in an area designated as K-7. Analarm was automatically triggered. Since there were no surveillance cameras inthe area, a Sabotage Alert Team (SAT) was ordered to investigate. As the SATcame to within a mile of K-7, members reported by radio that they could see abrightly glowing orange disc, as large as a football field, hovering over themissile site. Presumably, the helicopter explanation can be dispensed with inthis case.As the members of the SAT watched the strange phenomenon, launch control orderedthem to proceed to the site. Surprisingly, the men refused. From their safedistance, they noticed it begin to rise. When it reached an altitude of 1,000feet, it registered on NORAD radar, and F-106 interceptors were promptlyscrambled from Malmstrom.This was clearly not an ordinary object, as it continued to rise, and rise, andrise. It eventually reached the incredible altitude of 200,000 feet (more thandouble the ceiling of the ultra-high-flying U-2 spy plane). At that point itdisappeared from NORAD radar, and the F-106 jets arrived too late to see it.Afterwards, members of the SAT received a psychological examination whichindicated that they had been through a traumatic experience. The missile at K-7showed indications that its computer targeting system had been tampered with,and it had to be removed. It was later revealed that six other Launch ControlCenters reported UFOs that day.UFOs returned to Malmstrom the following night. NORAD radar detected unknownsheading south-southwest at 1,200 feet. Once again, two F-106s were scrambled.Sabotage Alert Teams at five areas reported seeing objects at low altitudes.Again, a pattern of cat-and-mouse emerged. Ground witnesses reported that theUFOs turned off their lights and became invisible as the intercepting jetsapproached, and turned their lights back on after the jets departed. At onepoint, teams in four different locations could see both the F-106s and the UFOs.Finally, the unknown objects rose rapidly until they were, in the words of thememo, “indistinguishable from the stars.”Throughout November, 1975, UFOs continued to enter U.S. military air space withimpunity. On November 10, according to a NORAD report, a bright, silent objectbuzzed by Minot AFB in North Dakota at the altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 feet.Three base personnel saw it and notified the National Command Center Operations.clxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1813868] OffutAir Force Base in Nebraska also reported intrusions. A November 10 memo noted“several recent sightings of unidentified aircraft/helicopters flying/hoveringover Priority A restricted areas during the hours of darkness.” As in theintrusions elsewhere, however, “all attempts to identify these aircraft have metwith negative results.” clxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1814187] The next day, November 11, a police captain and deputy were driving fromMissoula, Montana to Great Falls when a large orange light descended, lightingup the road. The officers described the object as traveling at “incrediblespeed,” as low as 200 feet in altitude, but silent. They reported the event toMalmstrom AFB. On the same day, an employee of the Montana Fish and GameDepartment saw a B-52 bomber flying over Freezeout Lake (northwest of GreatFalls) being paced by an unknown object. This object briefly attached itself tothe bomber, detached itself, and then climbed out of sight. Choteau CountySheriff, Pete Howard, took the report, and conducted follow-up interviews withmilitary. Although the Air Force denied knowledge, military personnel confirmedthe event and added that the plane’s radar equipment went out as the objectattached itself. clxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1814395] FOIA documents also confirm a UFO intrusion on November 11 atFalconbridge, Ontario, site of a NORAD installation with nuclear weapons.Shortly after 4 p.m., civilians, police, military, and NORAD radar saw andtracked a UFO that hovered and maneuvered at high speed. According to the NORADdocument, ground observers thought the object looked like a very bright star,but much closer. This was confirmed when radar picked up an object in the areaat 26,000 feet. Two F-106 jets were sent from Selfridge Air National Guard Basein Michigan, but reported no contact either visually or on radar. Yet, the NORADreport states that with binoculars, “the object appeared as a 100 ft diametersphere and appeared to have craters around the outside.” clxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1814574] This was the one instance in which NORAD personnel immediately andopenly admitted they tracked a UFO. Captain Gordon Hilchie, Director of PublicAffairs for Canadian NORAD Headquarters, stated “yes, we saw this so-called UFOat the same time people outside were saying they saw it, too.” He added that theUFO zoomed upward from 26,000 feet to 45,000 feet, “stopped awhile, and thenmoved up very quickly to 72,000 feet.” Lieutenant Colonel Brian Wooding,Director of the 22nd NORAD Region Control Center, agreed. Del Kindschi,spokesperson for NORAD Headquarters in Colorado Springs, added that the UFO wastracked intermittently on radar for six hours. Furthermore, the Base CommandingOfficer, Major Robert Oliver, openly stated that he and five others at the basesaw not one but three mysterious objects in the sky. “I think both the UnitedStates and Canada collect [UFO] information,” he said, “and I do believe theyinvestigate the more serious ones.” When told that the U.S. government claimedit no longer investigated UFOs, he replied, “I find that strange, because inaccordance with the normal procedures I classified the UFO report going toColorado Springs as secret.” Shortly afterwards, USAF General Daniel James, theCommanding General of NORAD, asked him to declassify the report. “ApparentlyGeneral James wanted to provide information to people who were interested init,” said Oliver. clxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1814925]Three years later the Canadian National Research Council announced that the UFOsseen over Ontario had been layers of crystallized ice in the atmosphere. clxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1815178] General Jamesapparently did not think so. In his November 11 memo, he tells units throughoutNorth America about “numerous reports of suspicious objects” at Loring,Wurtsmith, Malmstrom, Minot, and Falconbridge bases. He stated that many ofthese sightings were probably helicopters, but he added that “to date efforts byAir Guard helicopters, SAC helicopters and NORAD F-106s have failed to produce apositive ID.” One supposes that helicopters might be more plausible than icecrystals, but skepticism is nevertheless in order considering that neither F-106pilots, ground observers, radar operators, nor any other witnesses ever actuallyidentified these objects as helicopters. How could so many witnesses fail to doso? The Commander expressed his concern about preventing “overreaction by thepublic to reports by the media that may be blown out of proportion.” Presumablyunknown objects over nuclear weapons facilities was not a very big deal. clxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1815432] Meanwhile, military personnel continued to encounter UFOs. On November12, RAPCON was contacted regarding a UFO sighting east of Fairfield, Montana,although witnesses were told nothing was being tracked on radar. On the same dayat Falconbridge, two lighted objects were seen moving erratically through brokenclouds, but were not tracked on radar. On the 15th at Falconbridge, a NORADreport described a bright yellow object seen visually, but not tracked on radar.On November 16, witnesses in Caribou, Maine, including police and base personnelat Loring, reported a bright light that hovered for a long while, primarily withblinking green and red lights, but often changing colors. Smoke or exhaust wasalso seen. On the 17th, a NORAD report described a large, stationary, orangeball in the sky near “River Court, Ontario.” In fact, there is no town inOntario named River Court, although there is an area in the city of Hamilton,Ontario, called River Court. The object had two red lights and was not picked upon radar. On the same day from Manitoulin Island, Ontario, two oval shapedobjects with two yellow flashing lights were seen by witnesses; again, radar didnot track them. clxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1815652] Around November 19, another strange “helicopter” wave took place inMontana, in Cascade, Teton, Pondera, and Chouteau counties. At least twohelicopters were reported over a missile site, and Malmstrom AFB verifiedunidentified helicopters in the area. Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Judd,Director of Public Affairs for the 24th NORAD region, conceded that “some kindof phenomenon” had been reported on six or seven occasions by SAC employees atMinuteman bases near Harlowton and Fort Benton. Incredibly, he added that thesedid not represent “anything that’s a threat.” clxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1815831]This type of activity went on into December. At 8:47 p.m. on December 2, missilecrews at Malmstrom AFB reported a low-flying helicopter near the Juliet missilesite, near the town of Brady, Montana. By 9:31, Malmstrom notified CascadeCounty sheriff’s department that two craft were being reported from differentmissile sites. Reports of helicopters and UFOs poured into the sheriff’s officeand Malmstrom. The same event recurred on December 3 with widespread helicoptersightings. At least two unknown objects were reported at the same time over amissile site, a fact verified by Malmstrom AFB. clxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1816054] It is hard to conceive of any responsible officer not considering theseto be a threat, or at least a serious problem that needed to be investigated. Itis equally hard to imagine how a responsible officer would openly admit theseconcerns to the general public. We know these events were investigated by theAir Force and most likely by other relevant agencies, but no conclusions areavailable. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) issued a memorandum onNovember 13 requesting a “Temperature Inversion Analysis” to determine ifweather conditions could be responsible for the sightings. On the face of it,weather seems an implausible culprit, and certainly within a few years (by1981), the Air Force stopped requiring temperature inversion analyses.Presumably they had been of little use in investigating UFOs. clxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1816278] The real question is how a responsible news media could miss, or would ignore,the story of UFOs over military bases. The military was simply trying to do itsjob, and public panic would only impede its work. But Americans relied upon thenews media as their “watch dog.” The American news media, particularly at thenational levels, failed to report these astonishing and dramatic events. One isleft only with two possibilities: news media incompetence or complicity withnational security groups – or some combination of both. It should be added thatat no time during this wave of activity did the U.S. Senate or House ofRepresentatives discuss the matter. Indeed, there is no evidence that eitherbody was informed of what was going on.The wave of air space violations was not publicly known for two years. Aftersome documentation on these events reached the public in the late 1970s, UFOresearchers inquired with Malmstrom officials, hoping to obtain moreinformation. They were told that all documentation had been destroyed inaccordance with Air Force directives. clxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1816515] A final point to remember about these various NORAD cases is that we only havethe tip of the probable iceberg, at least in terms of documentation. Judgingfrom the serious nature of the confirmed reports, one should have expected manyfollow-up reports, but none are available. What we do have indicates that theU.S. and Canadian militaries had provocative UFO encounters through theremainder of the year, and well into 1976. Moreover, that the militaryauthorities succeeded in keeping the news media, elected officials, and generalpublic out of the loop. If not for a few dogged UFO researchers, the story wouldprobably have never been known at all. Some Unconfirmed EncountersIn addition to the confirmed events of late 1975, several unconfirmed reportshave trickled in over the years, reported to various UFO researchers andwebsites.One was a reported close encounter which occurred in Colorado in early November1975. No precise date was given, but the encounter occurred on a Sunday, so inall likelihood either November 2 or 9. Bill and Cheryl Jackson were driving withtheir young child home to Sterling, just east of the Rocky Mountains. (As anaside, Bill Jackson was a reporter for the Sterling Journal Advocate and hadwritten about the cattle mutilation phenomenon.) Between 8 and 9 p.m., twentymiles north of the town of Otis, a red light appeared in the overcast sky,becoming larger. Bill assumed it was an aircraft, except that it seemedunusually large. He thought the pilot was reckless, since it was comingdangerously close to the ground. He got out of the car while Cheryl watched frominside. Once outside, he realized the object was making no sound, and comingdirectly toward their position. It continued to approach, then passed directlyover them in complete silence at a speed of less than 50 mph. It was so low thatJackson felt he could have hit it with a stone. He said it had “row after rowafter row of lights ... at least a dozen rows ... hundreds and hundreds oflights; red, orange, green, white, all colors.... That sucker was huge!” Cheryldescribed it as an enormous elongated object with many indentations across thebottom. She also said it was silent and that its altitude was less than 100feet. The two were curious about the object, and wondered how it could havestayed in the air at such a slow speed, but as Cheryl put it, “common senseprevailed and we took off at high speed.” The entire event lasted four or fiveminutes. UFO researcher Richard Sigismond later interviewed the couple anddescribed them as intelligent and sincere. clxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1816693] Three more events from this period were reported years after the fact to thewebsite of Canadian researcher Brian Vike. The reader is reminded that these arenot confirmed accounts, and the last one involves some information which isthird-hand. They are offered here as provisional stories which are consistentwith the confirmed events related previously.One was said to have taken place at Warren AFB in southeastern Wyoming, justnorth of the Colorado border. It is reminiscent of the situation at MalmstromAFB from November 8. The writer stated it occurred while he was on duty betweenJune 1975 and June 1976, but since he describes snow on the ground, this wouldmost likely be during the winter of 1975/76. He said he was a non-commissionedofficer working in Keys and Codes, which issued codes for access to unmannedMinuteman missiles, and was located within Central Security Control (CSC). Onenight a missile launch crew reported that alarms were triggered at a Minutemansilo. Above ground from the launch center, a security police team saw “a brightwhite object lighting up the countryside and hovering over the silo.” At thispoint, the team refused to respond. CSC then asked the launch crew what theythought about the situation and why the security police refused to respond. Thelaunch crew replied that they would get back to CSC. According to the writer,“we never heard back from them during the remainder of our shift.” He statedthat maintenance crews reported seeing large foot prints in the snow near thesilos, and that security police reported colored balls of light drifting throughtheir sleeping quarters at the launch center sites during the night. The writerof the report received no answer as to what had happened. clxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1816895] Another event concerned a UFO sighting over the McAlester Naval Depot inOklahoma, said to have occurred sometime in 1975. The writer was a militarypoliceman on patrol, driving a pickup truck. At about 7 p.m., the truck engineand radio died for no apparent reason. He saw a flashing red light, initiallythought to be a tower light, but which then moved very rapidly – he estimatedperhaps 500 mph or even “thousands” of miles per hour – to different locationsaround the base, and “then back to the start position.” He wrote that severalother individuals saw this. The witness added that during this period there were“reports coming in all the time,” including reports of strange lights beingbeamed down on the bunkers. clxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1817147] The third report to Vike stems from late 1975 or early 1976, andoccurred at Clark AFB in the Philippines. The witness worked as an assistantshift leader in the base fuels distribution office, dispatching trucks. Nearmidnight, a truck arrived with personnel returning from a shift who were visiblyshaken. They said they had been followed by a glowing orange ball about threefeet in diameter. The ball had followed the truck, rising up and then droppinglower. About halfway back to the base, the object rose and disappeared. Thewitness later met with another individual who worked at Clark, and who related aUFO story from the same night (although one wonders how the witness knew it wasthe same night when we have no dates for the story). This other person receiveda report from a security policeman on the flight line directly in front of thecontrol tower. The policeman had seen an orange disc directly over him, perhaps75 or 100 feet in diameter. The disc hovered for a few seconds, “then shotstraight up, disappearing almost immediately.” The person receiving the reportcalled the security police commander, who asked if he had logged the event. Whenhe answered “no,” the commander said not to bother, and “to forget that theincident ever happened.” clxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1817361] Fire in the Sky - The Travis Walton AbductionAs we have seen, amid the unexplained UFO sightings and animal mutilations thatso gripped the western U.S., several interesting cases of alleged alienabduction also occurred. The one which has left the deepest impression on thepublic imagination is the Travis Walton abduction case. clxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1817548] The fact thatit occurred within a major wave of activity concerning UFOs, black helicopters,and animal mutilations, deserves a nod of acknowledgment.On Wednesday, November 5, 1975, in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest,northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, a logging crew was preparing to end their day ofwork. Mike Rogers, 28, was the foreman. He supervised six forestry employees,including his close friend, 22 year old Travis Walton. The other men on the crewwere Ken Peterson, John Goulette, Steve Pierce, Allen Dalis and Dwayne Smith.All lived in the small town of Snowflake, Arizona.On this day of work, however, they returned without Travis. What Rogers and therest of the crew told the police was that they had seen a UFO and that theybelieved Walton had been taken by its occupants. According to their account, atabout 6:15 p.m., as they were in the truck preparing to go home, all seven mensaw a glowing silver object hovering 15 or 20 feet above the ground. No oneactually saw the UFO move – it simply was there. “It looked like two pie pans,”Rogers said. He estimated it to be about 15 feet in diameter and 8 feet high. Ithad markings, “too complicated to describe,” and the object seemed to light upthe area. It gave off a sound, described as “electrical, high and low pitch.”Walton, in the front passenger seat, got out of the truck and impulsively walkedtoward the object. The object began to wobble from side to side, and struck himdirectly on the chest with a beam of bluish white light, perhaps two feet thick.Ken Peterson said that the light beam “kind of lifted him up off the ground. Hisarms were outstretched and he was knocked to the ground.” In panic, hiscompanions drove off, fearing Walton was dead and that the disc was chasingthem. After a few minutes, they regained enough composure to return to thescene. But neither Walton nor the object were there. The six men drove fifteenmiles north to Heber and reported the experience to officer Chuck Ellison atabout 7:35 p.m. Ellison later said the men were very upset and one was weeping.He did not know what to make of such a fantastic story, but said that if thewitnesses were lying, “they were damned good actors.” Sheriff Marlin Gillespie,along with officer Ken Coplan, soon met with the men. Rogers wanted an immediatesearch party organized, with tracking dogs. No dogs were available at themoment, but the officers and some of the crew went back out to look – three crewmembers were too upset to go.At the scene, no physical evidence was found, and the officers wondered ifWalton had been murdered. Even if Walton were alive, his jeans, tee shirt, anddenim jacket would not protect him from a bitterly cold November night. Thatevening, Rogers and Coplan visited Snowflake to see Walton’s mother, Mary WaltonKellett. Rogers told her what happened, and she asked him to repeat it. She thencalmly asked whether anyone else other than the witnesses and police had heardthe story. Coplan thought this was rather odd behavior. Defenders of Kellettmaintained that she was a guarded person, a single mother of six children, andwas trying her best not to fly apart. At 3 a.m., she phoned her second oldestchild, Duane Walton, who drove to see her.By the morning of November 6, there was still no trace of Travis, and policesuspicions grew. Rogers was adamant that they continue the search. This time,helicopters, mounted police, and jeeps were used. Still no sign of TravisWalton.The news began to spread, and UFO researchers came to see what was going on. Onewas Fred Sylvanus of Phoenix, who recorded interviews with Mike Rogers and DuaneWalton on November 8. Some of their statements were later used by skeptics tocast suspicion on the case, Duane Walton, for instance, remarked that he andTravis were interested in UFOs (and that many years in the past Duane had seen aUFO). He also suggested that Travis would not be injured by the aliens, because“they don’t harm people.” William Spaulding of Ground Saucer Watch alsointerviewed Duane and offered the services of a doctor to examine Travis, if heever returned. Spaulding told the press that if this case was a hoax, it was thebest he had ever seen.The weekend brought no news of Travis, and on Monday, November 10, all six crewmembers took polygraph examinations administered by Cy Gilson of the ArizonaDepartment of Public Safety. Gilson asked straightforward questions: did theycause harm to Travis (or know who had harmed him), did they know where Travis’sbody was buried, and did they tell the truth about seeing a UFO. The men alldenied harming Travis or knowing who had harmed him. They also denied knowingwhere his body was, and they maintained they had seen a UFO. One man, AllenDalis, was extremely agitated and did not complete his exam, rendering itinvalid. (It was later learned that he was hiding a criminal record). For therest, however, Gilson stated that the men’s results were conclusive. “Thesepolygraph examinations,” he wrote, “prove that these five men did see someobject they believed to be a UFO, and that Travis Walton was not injured ormurdered by any of these men on that Wednesday.” The tests apparently made abeliever out of Gillespie, who seemed to accept the UFO story and said, “There’sno doubt they’re telling the truth.”Regarding this polygraph, one commentator, Geoff Price, wrote:The significance of the unanimous passing of competently administered CQTexaminations by all six witnesses is considerable. Assuming independent tests,the odds of gross hoax (all participants lying about the UFO encounter) is lessthan one-tenth of a percent using the reasonably conservative figure of 70% fortest accuracy, and on the order of one in a million using the 90% figuresuggested by field tests. In short, relatively strong evidence that some kind ofreal event took place. clxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1818698] Travis Walton reappeared on November 10. Close to midnight, he called hisbrother-in-law, Grant Neff, from a phone booth. Neff and Duane Walton drove outand found Travis, still in the phone booth, looking exhausted, confused, andwith a heavy growth of beard. He was wearing the same clothing from the weekbefore. He complained of chest pain, which he said was from tests performed onhim while he was aboard a UFO. When told he had been missing for five days, heseemed stunned by the news. He said all he could remember was about two hours.After returning to his mother’s home, Travis said he bathed and tried to eat,but was unable to keep from vomiting.Surprisingly, Duane did not report Travis’s return immediately. He said this wasbecause of his brother’s fragile condition, but the decision only caused moreproblems later, fueling suspicions that he was covering up a hoax. Duane didremember Spaulding’s suggestion to keep a sample of Travis’s first urinationfollowing his return, and remembered the promise of a confidential medical exam.So, on the following morning (and still not having notified authorities ofTravis’s return), Duane drove his brother to Phoenix to meet with Dr. LesterSteward. It turned out that Steward was not a licensed doctor at all, but ahypnotherapist. What happened at this meeting is disputed. The Waltons claimedthey spent 45 minutes at his office, nearly all of which was wasted trying todetermine his qualifications. Steward and Spaulding stated that the Waltons hadbeen there for more than two hours.After they returned to Snowflake, Spaulding phoned Duane, who told him not tocontact them again. After this, Spaulding began calling the case a hoax. CoralLorenzen of APRO also spoke with Duane, promising an examination for Travis bytwo medical doctors at Duane’s home. Duane agreed, and the exam began later onthe afternoon of November 11. The examination revealed that Travis was in goodhealth, but with two unusual features. First, a small red spot at the crease ofhis right elbow that was consistent with a hypodermic injection, although thespot was not near a vein and there was no sign of drugs in his system. Second,Walton’s urine revealed a lack of acetones. This was odd, since his significantweight loss suggested he had not been eating, and his body should have begunbreaking down fats in order to survive, which would lead to high levels ofacetone in his urine.Another factor entered the already complex picture. The National Enquirertabloid had contacted APRO, offering to finance an investigation in exchange for“cooperation and access to the Waltons.” Coral and Jim Lorenzen agreed. There isno question that the money helped APRO get certain things done; no question alsothat the involvement of the tabloid brought harm to the case. It is true thatduring the mid-1970s, The Enquirer engaged in some legitimate journalism,including on the UFO topic. But it was still a sensationalist tabloid with verylittle respectability. Placing the Walton story at the supermarket check-outline was not a good sign.Later on the 11th, Sheriff Gillespie finally learned of Travis’s return and metwith the Waltons. Travis told him of his encounter, which involved two kinds ofbeings: one type was human, the other was not. He had been examined by hairlessbeings in tight-fitting blue clothing in a white room. He tried to talk withthem but they made no sound. When he moved to get up, they tried to hold himdown, and he took a swing at one of them. The creatures simply left the room.Walton then got up and went into another room which contained a chair. He sat init and pressed some buttons on the arms of the chair, at which point the ceilingslid back and he could see stars going by. A being wearing a helmet entered theroom, smiled and silently escorted him to a large room where he saw a parkedspacecraft. A device like an oxygen mask was placed on his face by people withlong hair. The next thing Walton remembered was lying on the pavement near thetown of Heber on the highway. A disc-shaped craft was hovering just above, thenshot away. He then made his telephone call to Neff.Travis said he would gladly take any kind of test Gillespie wanted. Gillespiesaid he would arrange for a polygraph, and promised to keep it secret to avoidthe media circus. The two brothers then drove to Scottsdale, where they met withAPRO consultant James Harder. Harder hypnotized Travis, but little more cameout, and Walton believed he would “die” if the regression continued. AnotherAPRO consultant, Dr. Gene Rosenbaum, performed “a comprehensive battery ofpsychiatric and medical exams.” Rosenbaum’s “absolute” conclusion was that “thisyoung man is not lying, that there is no collusion involved.” clxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1818987] As promised, Gillespie arranged for a polygraph, but word quickly leakedand Duane canceled it, assuming Gillespie was responsible. Not true, counteredGillespie. The affair was already a circus – everything leaks in such asituation. As a result, The National Enquirer quickly arranged for a polygraph,after Duane insisted that he and Travis have the power to veto any publicdisclosure of the results. Harder expressed concern that Travis was too agitatedto take a polygraph, but the examiner, John J. McCarthy of the Arizona PolygraphLaboratory, said this was not a problem.Thus, on the 15th of November, McCarthy administered a polygraph examination toTravis Walton. Prior to the exam, McCarthy learned that Travis had occasionallysmoked marijuana, and also that he and Rogers’s younger brother had oncecommitted check fraud some years earlier. It was Walton’s only brush with thelaw in his life, and he was not proud of it. McCarthy then administered thetest. Walton was agitated and McCarthy was hostile. He interrupted Walton 28times during the questioning, at one point berated him when Walton was confusedabout dates, and actually said, “Where have you been, in a vacuum?”McCarthy concluded Walton was engaging in “gross deception,” but the conclusionwas withheld publicly for many months. The Waltons, APRO and the NationalEnquirer agreed to keep the results a secret because (they maintained) theydoubted McCarthy’s methods and objectivity. Coral Lorenzen essentially calledMcCarthy biased and incompetent. She, Travis, and Duane believed that he hadintentionally asked Travis embarrassing and irrelevant questions in order tocreate conditions more likely to produce a negative result.In the spring of 1976, aviation writer and UFO skeptic Phillip J. Klass receiveda tip on the polygraph and wrote about it. This damaged Walton’s standing withmany UFO researchers, to say nothing of the general public. Klass launched acampaign against Walton that lasted for many years, arguing that there was astrong financial motive to the hoax. He argued that Mike Rogers knew he wouldfail to complete his contract with the Forest Service, and created a scheme toinvoke the contract’s Act of God clause. He mentioned the Walton family’salleged prior interest in UFOs, which he said brought their claims intoquestion. He noted that NBC had aired “The UFO Incident” just a few weeks beforeTravis’s disappearance. This made-for-television film described the famous 1961abduction account of Betty and Barney Hill. Klass stated that Walton hadprobably been inspired by the program. And of course, Klass never tired ofpointing out that Walton had flunked McCarthy’s polygraph test.There were counter arguments to each of these points. Travis Walton said he hadnot seen the television special. And Jerome Clark pointed out that Walton’saccount of his time on the UFO is very different from the Hill account, anyway.clxxxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1819160]Regarding Mike Rogers, he had completed many Forest Service contracts, and ontwo occasions had failed to complete them. This had not been a serious problem,and he continued to get rehired. More tellingly, Rogers never tried to invoke anAct of God clause after Walton disappeared, nor ever.Causing more strife was the lack of cooperation and even infighting among UFOorganizations regarding this case. There was a certain irony to this,considering the organizations had for some time been talking about the need forbetter coordinating their efforts. Yet, during the Walton affair, MUFON, APRO,NICAP, CUFOS, and GSW competed with each other and withheld information far morethan they assisted one another.With the results of the McCarthy test public, APRO quickly arranged for afollow-up examination of Walton by another polygraph administrator, GeorgePfeifer. Pfeifer tested Travis, Duane, and their mother, concluding that allwere truthful in their accounts.Years later, in 1993, prior to the release of the movie Fire in the Sky , aboutthe Walton experience, a skeptical investigator named Jerry Black reopened thecase and arranged for yet another polygraph test. Cy Gilson, the man who hadperformed the initial polygraph of Walton’s six co-workers in 1975, was broughtin again to administer tests to Travis, Mike Rogers, and Allen Dalis (who hadoriginally tested inconclusively). All three passed.The Walton case, like so many other UFO and abduction cases, is like a housewith many different sides, having a different appearance depending on where oneis standing. For a physical scientist interested in hard proof of alienabduction, this case cannot pass the test. There was precious little that couldactually count as physical evidence (Walton’s puncture mark, one supposes);certainly nothing that could be analyzed and studied. The polygraph studies canbe seen as helpful or not helpful, depending on how one views the McCarthy test.It does seem like a stretch to discount the testimony of Walton’s crew memberswho all claimed that they saw a UFO issue a beam of light, striking Walton andrendering him unconscious. Although Klass did question the competence of Gilsonon that very point, no polygraph expert has supported the contention that somany people could successfully lie on the same question.If Mike Rogers and the rest of the crew were telling the truth, and they did seea UFO, it certainly would lend support to Travis Walton’s own claim. Thecontention argued by some at the time, that there had probably been a UFOsighting but no abduction, seems rather silly in retrospect. If a UFO had shownup, where would Walton have gone? Everyone in town was looking for him, and heclearly seemed much the worse for wear upon his return. Some people noted thatWalton’s abduction account differs in significant ways from the “standard”abduction account of being probed by little grey aliens with big black eyes.Walton instead described beings that looked decidedly human, along withcreatures that looked alien. Then again, do all aliens have to look like theGreys? Do all UFOs have to be piloted by aliens?Regarding the presence of humans and aliens together, there are many avenues ofspeculation. One might concern humans that had been “bred” by non-human groups.What if “others” had arrived to Earth but could not simply walk around on thesurface of the planet due to the myriad of biohazards that might exist. Would itnot be convenient to have a personal supply of humans (genetically modified andperhaps enhanced artificially) at one’s disposal for all types of missions? Theidea admittedly has no hard evidence to support it, but within the context ofthe paradigm shattering reality of UFOs, it is not necessarily illogical orimplausible. clxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1819313] Summing Up 1975In the history of UFOs, 1975 does not capture the imagination of the generalpublic the way that 1947 does. Yet the year was nothing short of spectacular.Unlike 1947, 1952, or 1966, when UFO sightings received a great deal of coverageby the U.S. media, the events of this year – as well as 1974, for that matter –received scarcely any attention at all. In 1952 and 1966, the U.S. military madeformal, public statements on UFOs. Nothing of the sort occurred in 1975, eventhough the situation was more grave. It is understandable that an entrenchedbureaucracy would not want to make matters worse by telling the public what wasgoing on. Whoever was behind the air space violations of 1975 – be they human oralien – had technology that the U.S. military feared, and the confidence to flybrazenly into restricted areas containing nuclear weapons, and then confidentlyfly away. How does one tell the public that?The question of Human vs. Alien in this instance is clearly important. If wechoose to consider that the offending aircraft were of human origin, we mustask, which humans? That is, an official military unit – even one that might havebeen deep black – conducting some sort of readiness exercise or testing newtechnology? There is little evidence supporting this position, and just aslittle logic. The objects that flew over U.S. and Canadian bases were neveridentified. Within an era of explosive technological growth, several decadeshave passed and there is yet no candidate within the U.S. military’s stable ofaircraft that could account for the events of 1975. If they were secret U.S.prototypes, they have never been used in any known military engagement, despitetheir obvious superiority to American aircraft of the day.Could they be of human origin, but not under the strict control of the U.S.military? Such a scenario seems plausible when considering the position of somepeople – like retired New Mexico State Trooper Gabriel Valdez – who argued thatthe cattle mutilation phenomenon was entirely due to covert human action, ablack-world operation essentially beyond the law. Could such a program could berun so secretly, but with such money behind it, that it would be essentiallyindependent of formal government control? If so, why fly exotic aircraft oversensitive U.S. bases again and again? With what technology? If one sees theseviolations as purely human in origin, presumably the alleged cases of alienabduction that occurred in their midst would be dismissed either as fantasy,hoax, or an ultra-clandestine mind control program conducted for purposesunknown.Then there is the alien scenario, in which the questions are surprisinglysimilar. If aliens were harassing these American bases, it would not beinconceivable to suppose they were interested in the nuclear weapons. One couldfurther imagine that in their various enterprises here, from time to time theymight check in on the natives. Where might such aliens be living most of thetime? Perhaps, if some remote viewers were correct, under the surface of theEarth, secure from bio-hazards and frightened (dangerous? pesky?) humans. Thereis no lack of observational reports to conclude that something very bizarre hasbeen traversing the skies and oceans of the world. If not a secret human group,then ...Divining the response to this crisis by the U.S. military is possible only bynoting the gravity of the few documents available with the utter lack offollow-up documentation. It is not credible and indeed not possible that theseair space violations did not receive thorough and detailed follow-up, and yet noconclusions of any sort are available to us. The only reasonable conclusion isthat the findings remain deeply hidden.The mid-1970s were an unusual period in American history, because they representthe “high water tide” of 20th century American progressive culture, when itactually was political and before it devolved into mere “political correctness.”In 1975, Americans could say with some justification (and many qualifications)that their political system “worked.” They had chased a corrupt President fromoffice, new laws promoting Freedom of Information had been passed, and itappeared that a new era of government openness might just come to pass.But openness is relative. For even in 1975, the national security apparatus ofthe United States budged only a little bit, and then no more. The law on Freedomof Information had been passed, yes. But other than obtaining the CIA’s reporton the Robertson Panel, no one had yet forced any military or intelligenceagency to give away UFO secrets. As far as the public knew in 1975, the FBI,CIA, and all the military groups were not collecting UFO data. The truth aboutthis would be revealed soon enough, although not without major resistance andspin control. 1976: The State of UFO ResearchNot all UFO researchers were talking about cover-ups, or even extraterrestrials.Jacques Vallee’s The Invisible College continued in the vein of his “fivearguments against the ETH,” suggesting that “a powerful force has influenced thehuman race in the past and is again influencing it now. Does this forcerepresent alien intervention, or does it originate entirely within humanconsciousness?” During the spring of 1976, Vallee and Hynek co-authored The Edgeof Reality , which discussed UFOs in a similar manner. Both conveyed the feelingthat the ETH could not fully explain UFOs. Although they acknowledged thephenomenon was real, its reality skirted the edges of accepted science. Some oftheir specifics were muddy, as when Hynek discussed “psychic projection” toresolve violations of the laws of physics. Portions of the book accused otherUFO groups and researchers of amateurism and of not producing scientific papers.This was somewhat ironic, since Hynek’s CUFOS had done less investigation andresearch to that point than any of the other groups.Many members of MUFON were already becoming uneasy with Hynek, despite theefforts of Walter Andrus and Richard Hall to promote good relations (like it ornot, said Hall, CUFOS was a rallying point for scientists who took UFOsseriously). clxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1819685] But now uneasetransformed into open hostility. Skylook editor Dwight Connolly called theattacks on MUFON and other groups “one of the more controversial, illconsidered, and inaccurate sections of the book.” When Hynek replied thatConnelly’s criticism was excessive, Connelly responded that Hynek seemed to feelhe was beyond reproach. Indeed, said Connelly, Hynek happily criticized others,was uncooperative with other groups, and gained his public renown not fromcompetent UFO investigation, but from Air Force publicity. In fact, he said,Hynek “has actually done far less with far less expertise than a great manyothers,” and was “a walking organizational and public- relations disaster....his own worst enemy.” clxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1819863]Two board members of MUFON even resigned early in 1976, in part because of theirobjection to MUFON’s close association with Hynek. One of these was DeputyDirector John Schuessler, who had been disheartened by the “total lack ofanything worthwhile coming out of CUFOS.” When Hynek initially sent out theprivate invitations to his conference, many leading MUFON researchers were leftoff, including apparently Schuessler (although Walter Andrus interceded onSchuessler’s behalf). The bad blood was compounded when MUFON’s Board invitedHynek to speak at their 1976 symposium. Schuessler wondered why the leadershipwas so accommodating not merely to Hynek, but to open debunkers as Philip Klass.Schuessler’s departure was brief. He soon returned – and in later yearssucceeded Andrus as MUFON’s Director. clxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1820051] Interestingly,Connolly resigned from Skylook in June 1976, for reasons which he said werepersonal and not related to his feud with Hynek. clxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1820288] For all the criticisms, Hynek was trying to breathe life into CUFOS. Hewas active in forming the group’s journal, the International UFO Reporter , andhad arranged for CUFOS to employ full-time investigator Allen Hendry. Meanwhile,Hynek was Ufology’s front man, speaking to media, hailed as the “Galileo” ofufology, and always in the hunt for funding. On April 30, 1976, the muchanticipated private conference was held in Chicago. It was intended as a kind ofthink tank for researchers, featuring presentations on sighting waves,“exosociology,” reports of aliens (“humanoids”), and more. Presenters includedTed Bloecher, Ann Druffel, Loren Gross, Richard Hall, David Jacobs, JamesMcCampbell, David Saunders, R. Leo Sprinkle, David Webb, Ray Stanford, andothers. In fact, considering all the build-up, the 1976 CUFOS Conference, as itbecame known, was a disappointment. The erudite Lucius Farish of MUFON calledthe published proceedings “utter dullsville.” Lots of technical information withsome value, but which made for truly boring reading. This was accurate, if a bitharsh. For better and for worse, the conference proceedings read very much likeacademic proceedings from any other discipline, which had obviously been Hynek’sgoal. clxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1820438] The first issue of the International UFO Reporter appeared in November1976, with Hynek as editor-in-chief and Allen Hendry as managing editor. Hynekwrote an “Estimate of the Situation,” describing his philosophy of UFOs: heemphasized that they were unexplained , although noteworthy for the consistencyof reports about them, and for a frequency of sightings far greater than mostpeople realized. He chided the scientific community for ignoring the subject,but also distanced himself from the “untutored and the ‘mentally tilted’” whowere unfortunately associated with the subject. He wrote that the IUR would notallow any particular theory (such as the extraterrestrial hypothesis) toobfuscate the “open study of the phenomenon.” After all, “there might be anotheranswer – even several answers!” clxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1820765] Hynek was clearly trying to put the brakes on the ETH. This position, as muchas anything else, was behind his friction with other UFO researchers. WasHynek’s dissatisfaction with the ETH purely the result of detached judgment? Orwere other factors involved: the ingrained conservatism of a lifelongacademician, or the result of his longstanding connection with the U.S.intelligence community? The suspicions about Hynek’s motives, held by differentUFO researchers in the 1950s and 1960s during his Blue Book days, dogged himthrough the 1970s and beyond.The main thrust of UFO research, in any case, came not from Hynek, but from FOIAresearchers such as Brad Sparks, Robert Todd, William Spaulding, and W. ToddZechel, all of whom filed requests with U.S. government agencies regarding UFOdata. Obstructionism still reigned supreme. In March 1976, the CIA toldSpaulding that it had no interest in UFOs; Todd received the same answer fromthe NSA. Undeterred, they continued filing more requests. cxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1820967] Zechel alsofocused on the CIA with no initial result. In April 1976, he contacted his localcongressional representative, Robert Kastenmeier, (D-Wis.). Stalling wastypical, Kastenmeier said, when it came to FOIA requests – the CIA was evenunresponsive with Congress in this regard. Legal action, he told Zechel, was theonly real answer. Thus, Zechel began looking for financial backing to generatelawsuits against the CIA. cxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1821315] In early 1976, another researcher began to leave his mark. LeonardStringfield had been a UFO researcher since the 1950s, but had not written much.Now for Skylook, he began writing research pieces focusing on militaryconnections to UFOs. As a former military man with an easygoing personality, hedeveloped many inside sources of information. One of his early sources told himthe military had designed a sophisticated radar system solely to detect UFOs,and that nuclear submarines were being equipped with comparable instrumentation.cxcii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1821527] This wasjust the beginning. For the next decade, Stringfield delved into thesubterranean world of the military, coming back with more information thananyone could have anticipated.Meanwhile, other people contributed in other ways. Captain Keith Wolverton, adeputy sheriff for Cascade County, Montana, co-authored a book with journalistRoberta Donovan on cattle mutilations, mystery helicopters, and UFOs. Thehelicopters and UFOs may or may not be related to the mutes, they argued, buteither way top government officials knew what was going on. cxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1821708] 1976 PoliticsUFO researchers had hope that the secrecy might end; the American politicalscene seemed to justify such thinking. Throughout 1976 the U.S. Senate’s ChurchCommittee inquired into secret activities of the national security apparatus.Resistance remained strong, as when Senator Frank Church (D-ID) proposedrevealing the size of the black budget. This was defense and intelligencespending that, in contradiction to the Constitution, was kept secret even fromCapitol Hill. The new Director of the CIA, George Bush, argued that therevelation would be a disaster and would compromise the CIA beyond repair. By aone vote margin the matter was referred to the Senate, where it never reachedthe floor. cxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1821939] 1976 was the year that Jimmy Carter ran for President of the UnitedStates. As early as the spring, Carter was talking openly about how he had seena UFO with a large group of people in 1969. During a campaign stop on March 31,he was asked whether he would reveal “behind-closed-doors” information regardingUFOs. He replied that although he did not know what to make of UFOs, he would“make these kinds of data available to the public ... to help resolve themystery about it.” cxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1822142] On June 8,1976, the National Enquirer ran a story on Carter entitled, “The Night I Saw aUFO,” in which he was quoted as saying, “If I become President, I’ll make everypiece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to thepublic and the scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I’ve seenone.” Although such a statement from a Presidential candidate is certainly news,Carter was more cautious than some have interpreted. His position was that hewould make existing information available, assuming that some UFO data wasclassified (a correct assumption, as FOIA was demonstrating). When asked whetherhe would re-establish a new UFO-investigative body, Carter answered, “I don’tknow yet.” cxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1822295] There was, however, one politician pushing openly for UFO disclosure.This was the Prime Minister of the tiny Caribbean nation of Granada, Sir EricGairy. Like Carter, Gairy had seen a UFO years before. But he was also far lessconstrained by political pressures than someone who was running for the U.S.Presidency. Gairy addressed the U.N. General Assembly on October 7, 1976, urgingrecognition of UFOs as a serious international scientific problem. “Onewonders,” he said “why the existence of UFOs, or ‘flying saucers’ as they aresometimes called, continue to remain a secret ....” cxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1822558] The U.N. tookno action as a result of his statement, but this was only the beginning of SirEric Gairy’s inquiries into UFOs at the U.N.UFOs in the USA: 1976Regarding the UFOs themselves, the late 1970s were generally down years comparedwith 1975. But “down” is not “dead.” 1976 had some very interesting UFOencounters, many of which – as during the previous year – involved the military.One dates from January 21, 1976, according to a National Military Command Centerreport. This occurred at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, at 3:55 a.m. According to thedocument:Two UFOs are reported near the flight line at Cannon AFB, New Mexico. SecurityPolice observing them reported the UFOs to be 25 yards in diameter, gold orsilver in color with blue light on top, hole in the middle and red light onbottom. Air Force is checking with radar. Additional, checking weather inversiondataA fairly detailed description. As for checking weather data, one assumes the‘CYA’ rule applies here. cxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1822767] This event appears to have been part of a larger mini-flap of sightings.Less than 10 miles away, near the town of Clovis, New Mexico, a series of UFOsightings lasted from January 21 to January 23. More than 30 silent objects withpulsating lights were reported during night hours by civilians and policeofficers, and was reported on UPI wire services. On one occasion, severalcallers reported a group of 20 objects hovering over the Sandia ElementarySchool. Meanwhile, in the town of Texaco, Town Marshall Willie Ronquillo said hefollowed up on a report and saw a silent object hovering about 900 feet abovethe town. It had green, yellow, and blue lights. He gave chase when it beganmoving northward, and several police officers reported what appeared to be thesame object. A spokesman at Reese AFB, 90 miles east of Clovis, said thatnothing unusual had been picked up on base radar. A major at Cannon AFB, who wascommand post controller for the day, said the base had received numerousinquiries, but that “as far as the military is concerned, it is strictly nocomment.” A photograph taken by a reporter for the Clovis News Journal showed anunusual and bent streak of light, later determined by Ray Stanford a UFOresearcher and photo analyst, to be an unfocused image of the planet Saturn.cxcix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1822995] Perhaps the image was Saturn, but it appears something strange was goingon in eastern New Mexico. Years later, Brian Vike collected several UFO reportsfrom former servicemen who worked at Cannon AFB. All the men said they sawunknown objects over the base in January 1976. One wrote that he was in theflight tower and saw approximately a dozen UFOs through a Starlight Scope.“Flight Ops was concerned enough to scramble two F-111s to give chase.” He addedthat there were several burned circles in a farmer’s fields nearby, two of whichhe saw. Each was about thirty feet across and had “a dead cow in the center,”typical mutilation cases. The writer claimed he spoke with an individual fromWashington, D.C. about the events. cc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1823230] The preceding report is unconfirmed, but the encounter on January 31,1976 at Eglin AFB in Florida is well documented. According to a NationalMilitary Command Center report later obtained through FOIA, security policemenbetween 4:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. “spotted lights from what they called a UFO near anEglin radar site.” One description indicated “a row of lights with a centralwhite light,” although another report stated the lights were believed to be partof a building. Photographs were taken, but not released. cci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1823403] Several CIA documents from 1976, also recovered through FOIA, show aninterest in UFO phenomena and research. A document from January 21 entitled“International Congress of Space Medicine” deals with UFOs briefly. It is nearlyentirely censored. Speaking of magnetic fields, it states, “There is a theorythat such fields are closely associated with superconductivity at very lowtemperatures, such as in space. This in turn is related to the possiblepropulsion system of UFOs. There is a rumor that fragments of a possible UFOfound in Brazil bore a relationship to superconductors andmagnetohydrodynamics,” certainly a reference to the “Ubatuba case” from 1957.Since the document was reporting on a conference, the reference to UFO“propulsion systems” was clearly a restatement of what was discussed there.Still, the matter-of-fact nature of the description, combined with the heavyredaction, give cause for wonder. ccii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1823673] Other memos from 1976 confirm CIA interest in UFOs. One heavily censoreddocument dated April 14 references a “UFO Study” dated five days earlier, andmentions a request from a source who was seeking guidance “from CIA UFO expertsas to material in his report that should remain classified.” cciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1823952] An undateddocument from April states that the UFO study was turned over to “Dr.[redacted], who was also briefed on the developments to date.” Another documentfrom April 26 remarks:. . . it does not seem that the government has any formal program in progressfor the identification/solution of the UFO phenomena. Dr. [redacted] feels thatthe efforts of independent researchers . . . are vital for further progress inthis area. At the present time, there are offices and personnel within theagency who are monitoring the UFO phenomena, but again, this is not currently onan official basis. Dr. [redacted] feels that the best approach would be to keepthe agency/community informed of any new developments. In particular, anyinformation which might indicate a threat potential would be of interest, aswould specific indications of foreign developments or applications of UFOrelated research.This is quite interesting. The CIA had several offices studying UFOs, but “noton an official basis.” A CIA analyst and apparent authority on UFOs believedthat “independent researchers” were “vital” for further progress in the study ofthe phenomenon. Finally, the reference to “applications of UFO related research”would indicate that there were those in the CIA who assumed the UFO phenomenonhad tangible value in its ability to spur scientific and technical progress.Other CIA documents from this period have surfaced, including a memo statingthat the Domestic Collections Division “has been receiving UFO related material”from Science and Technology sources “and their credentials removed them from the‘nut’ variety.” cciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1824204] Anotherdocument from May 27 states, “as before we are faced with the problem of havingUFO related data which is deemed potentially important for the US by our[Science & Technology] sources, evaluated.” ccv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1824462]Whatever kind of UFO material was arriving at the CIA’s DCD, it appears that theAgency was actively researching the topic during the 1970s, and was interestedin keeping its connection as unofficial as possible.Somebody Else Is On the Moon - and Other Interesting LeaksMeanwhile, remote viewer Ingo Swann continued his interesting adventures. Duringthe summer of 1976, he received a plain package in the mail, lacking even apostmark (although it did have stamps). The package contained a book and nothingmore: Somebody Else is On the Moon , by George Leonard. Leonard was a formerNASA scientist and photo analyst who had obtained photographs of the Moon,several of which he published in his book, unfortunately of small size and poorresolution. But he did describe original prints, which he said were huge, and hepublished the identifying code numbers of the photos. Some of the images andaccompanying sketches were very close to Swann’s drawings for Axelrod. One photoshowed a diamond shaped enclosure containing an ‘L’ shaped construction within.Leonard argued that NASA secretly knew of alien activity on the Moon. He alsoclaimed that President Kennedy’s initiative to put Americans on the Moon wasdriven by secret discoveries made from earth-based telescopes during the 1950s,virtually proving activity on the Moon. Years later, the images continued togenerate opinions ranging from “crackpot interpretation” to “outstanding.”Critics maintained the images show anomalies merely because of low resolution,that higher resolution images show them to be natural formations. ccvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1824615] Leonard’s thesis received some support during the 1990s, when someone elseclaimed to have seen clear NASA photos of structures and machinery on the Moon.In 1979, Vito Saccheri, an industrial engineer, was shown a copy of Leonard’sbook by another engineer named Lester Howes. The two arranged to go to Houston’sNASA headquarters and asked to see the photos. Since this was a first, NASAchecked with Langley, Virginia (presumably the CIA). But the NASA photo archive,which housed over two million images, was legally available, and the two menwere admitted to review it. “There were, however, strict rules,” according toSaccheri. They had three eight-hour business days to review the material. Theywere not allowed any writing or recording devices of any kind, and could not beleft alone with the photos.According to Saccheri, the images were highly suggestive of anomalies, far moreobvious than in Leonard’s book. Some examples included:... obvious machinery on the surface, showing bolted sections; three dilapidated‘bridges’ crossing a chasm that reminded me of the Grand Canyon ... threesurprising pyramids that prompted me later to closely study the Egyptian Gizapyramid complex; apparent pipelines criss-crossing the surface, running to andfrom craters; a UFO rising from the surface and photographed directly above acrater; and perhaps the most memorable, the unmistakable figure of a rectangularstructure placed squarely in the biggest crater pictured – the structure lookedeither very old or under construction, but the crater had to be miles wide, andthe camera angle gave a perfect three-dimensional view.The best came at the end. On their last day, Saccheri was allowed by thelibrarian to examine a series of binders detailing NASA’s scientific experimentsconducted in space, as well as transcripts of the manned space flights,including the Moon landings. While browsing the transcripts, Saccheri’s eyeswidened:“Houston, we’ve got a bogey at two o’clock.”“Roger that, Apollo. Switching to alpha. Roll eight degrees and beginsequence...”Saccheri could not believe what he was reading. Looking through other missiontranscripts, he found similar dialogue:“Mission Control, we’ve got Santa Claus coming over the hill...”“Roger, Apollo. Hold your fix. Switching bravo. Do you copy?”“Roger, Houston. Bravo link...”Saccheri later learned from a Moon photo researcher named Marvin Czarnick thatcode words such as alpha and bravo referred to special switching stations aroundthe country that ‘switched’ broadcast reception away from Houston and MissionControl to missile bases in the northwest portion of the country, as they wereequipped with “secured communications equipment.”During the 1990s, UFO researcher Michael Lindemann noted that the only spacemission to the Moon since the Apollo missions had been the classified,military-funded Clementine unmanned probe, which conducted hi-resolutionphotography of the entire lunar surface. “Almost none of those photos have beenreleased to public view,” he stated. ccvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1824885] UFOs in the Summer of 1976Meanwhile, American UFO sightings continued throughout the summer of 1976. Amemorandum described a sighting at another military base on July 30, this timeFort Ritchie, Maryland. Between 1:30 a.m. and 3:45 a.m. patrols at differentlocations saw objects over the base that were not supposed to be there. One crewreported “[three] oblong objects with a reddish tint.” Another saw a UFO overthe ammunition storage area – at the low altitude of 300 to 600 feet. From athird location, an Army police sergeant reported an aerial object estimated tobe the size of a two and a half-ton truck.It is not known what these sightings were, but we do know that the militaryconducted a “temperature inversion analysis,” presumably to determine whetherthese were atmospheric phenomena. The analysis revealed two temperatureinversions, one at 1,000 feet and another at 27,000 feet. An inversion is simplythe trapping of a layer of cool air beneath warmer air (normally air cools athigher altitudes), and can cause visual or radar anomalies. It is also knownthat the witnesses were requested to write a statement on their sightings, butnone are available. ccviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1825578]One of the most intriguing cattle mutilation cases – connected to evidence of anunknown craft – occurred on June 13 in New Mexico, and was described at lengthin a report by the New Mexico State Police (later declassified). The reportnoted the removal of body parts with “what appeared to be a sharp preciseinstrument ...” It stated that “a suspected aircraft of some type had landedtwice, leaving three pod marks positioned in a triangular shape. The diameter ofeach pod was 14\". The perimeter around the three pods was 16½”. There were alsosmaller tripod impressions, which appeared to follow the cow for approximately600 yards, and were all around the dead cow. Some of the grass around the podmarks was scorched. ccix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1825793] The most sensational UFO case of the summer took place in northern Maine. Thiswas the abduction of four young men on a fishing trip, known ever since as theAllagash Abductions. On August 20, four art students in their early twentiesleft Boston for a canoe and camping trip in a wilderness area of Northern Mainealong the Allagash River. Two were identical twins, Jack and Jim Weiner; theywere accompanied by Charlie Foltz and Chuck Rak. On the evening of Thursday,August 26, they reached Eagle Lake, set up camp and built a blazing campfirewhich they expected to burn all night long. They decided to fish for trout inthe canoe.Out on the water, Charlie began to feel that the four were being watched. Heturned around and saw “a large bright sphere of colored light hoveringmotionless and soundless” about 200 to 300 feet above the southeastern rim ofthe cove. All the men saw it and adjusted their eyes to the intense light. Theythen noticed a “gyroscopic motion” to the object, as if energy flowedhorizontally and vertically, dividing it into four sections. The colorscontinually changed between red, green, and yellow, oscillating “like a thicksauce does as it starts to boil,” in the words of investigator Raymond Fowler.This object was no star; it was large enough that the men estimated its diameterat 80 feet, a substantial size. As it came closer to them, Foltz signaled an SOSwith his flashlight. It then silently moved toward them. The men panicked andbegan to paddle away when light from the object engulfed them. The next thingthey knew, they were standing on the bank again. Foltz pointed his flashlighttoward the object, which ascended and disappeared. Only a few minutes seemed tohave passed, but the campfire had nearly burned out. They did not discuss thisoddity, and instead went to sleep without any discussion.For years afterward, all four men experienced nightmares. In Jack Weiner’sdreams, beings with long necks, large heads, large glowing eyes, andfour-fingered hands examined his arm, while his companions sat nearby. The otherthree men experienced similar dreams. In 1988, Jim Weiner attended a UFOconference hosted by Raymond Fowler. Afterward, he related his encounter toFowler, who suggested regressive hypnosis. Under separately conducted sessions,each man recalled being abducted and subjected to physical examinations,including the taking of skin and fluid samples. Their description of the aliens,the craft, and examining instruments was consistent. The men also tookpsychiatric examinations (all four were deemed mentally stable) and passedpolygraph tests. Other than the Betty and Barney Hill incident from 14 yearsbefore, theirs was among the first well-documented, multiple abduction cases.ccx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1826012] As intriguing and well-corroborated as the Allagash abduction was, it remainsin the same category as all other alleged abductions: it lacks the kind ofphysical proof necessary to convince a scientist used to working with physicalevidence. One would hope that a competent scientist would avoid jumping to theconclusion that therefore the event did not happen; rather, that measuring andproving the event scientifically is simply not yet possible. Mundaneexplanations, such as hoax or shared fantasy, fall flat in this case. Theobvious hurdle is accepting the reality of the UFO phenomenon as somethingalien. If one accepts that premise, then the conclusion that these four men wereforcibly abducted by alien entities becomes the most logical. ET over the Canary Islands?As interesting as some of the American cases were, activity was more significantelsewhere. Several came from the Mediterranean region, including an astonishingcase from the Canary Islands, while the Middle East had an “all-time classic”military encounter with a UFO.There were also quite a few frightening aviation encounters. On March 3 nearTours, France, the pilot of a French military TE-33 saw a bright light in thedistance which was rapidly approaching him. His plane was then surrounded by agreen phosphorescent light that lit up his aircraft. The radar controller pickedup nothing, although two other pilots saw the object. This case was laterincluded in the 1999 Cometa Report, issued by members of the French military anddefense establishment. ccxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1826401] Eight dayslater, on March 11, an Iberian Airlines pilot saw a bright, elongated, objectwith “windows” which paced his aircraft near Palma de Majorca, Spain. ccxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1826613] This wasfollowed by a more dramatic incident on March 15 at Simon Bolivar Airport inCaracus, Venezuela. The newspaper El Nacional in Caracas reported that two UFOswere tracked on radar at the airport at 10:14 p.m. They attracted attention bytheir sudden appearance and extraordinary speed. Tower operators asked theunidentified craft to identify themselves, and instead they took off and“disappeared at a supersonic speed” over the Caribbean. Apparently, they crossedover the landing strips at the astounding speed of 5,000 kph (roughly 3,000mph). ccxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1826774] Later that spring, the Canary Islands experienced a spate of UFO sightings,some of which involved the Spanish military, others civilian. Without questionthe most spectacular occurred on the night of June 22. Many witnesses fromseparate locations saw what can only be described as an enormous, transparentspherical craft containing two very tall human-like figures.Dr. Francisco Julio Padron was being driven to the town of Galdar, on thenorthwest coast of Grand Canary Island, by his driver, Francisco Estevez. Asthey rounded a bend in the road they saw a large spherical object hovering justabove the ground, about 60 yards off the road. Estevez brought the car to ascreeching halt. Padron described the object as “about the size of the 3-storybuilding, and as perfectly round as if drawn by a compass.” It was transparentenough that stars were visible through it. More amazing, he saw two human-likefigures toward the center of the sphere. They were “well over” 6 feet tall, worebright red garments, and a cloth-like helmet or some sort of turban. They seemedto be studying a control panel, and their heads appeared to glow. Estevez saidthat “they had two very bright, large eyes. I can swear that this was somethingout of this world. My nerves are shattered – I’ll never forget this as long as Ilive.”The car radio went dead, and the two men experienced an intense feeling of cold.The sphere then began to rise and expand to an incredible size – the witnessessaid it became comparable to a twenty story building. It then changed shape tothat of spindle surrounded by a halo, and shot off at an amazing speed whilethey watched in terror.They drove to a nearby farmhouse and learned that at least one of the residentshad seen the object. A farmer said to them that he saw it as “a bright bluishsphere with two red objects inside that looked like human forms.”Understandably, he dived to the floor, covered his head, and yelled to his wifeto do the same. They stayed in that position until the doctor and driver arrived– just before the two arrived, the farmer’s television went out.Other witnesses saw this object. A group of friends near the town of Galdar sawsomething “very strange in the sky.” They ran to the roof and were astonished tosee a perfectly round, transparent sphere in the center of which was somethingthey discerned to be long, bright and red. The object was stationary and seemedto expand gradually. The group watched it for 30 minutes. A tourist apparentlyphotographed the object.Astronomers saw it. Dr. Francisco Sanchez, director of the astrophysicalobservatory on Monte Izana, Canary Islands, said that several scientists at theobservatory saw the object with their unaided eyes, but it was below the line ofsight of their telescopes. It was very brilliant, “definitely not a planet, abloom or smoke. I had no scientific explanation for it,” said Sanchez. One ofthe astronomers, Dr. Fernando Bello, said the object seemed to approach theobservatory until it paused for a moment, “made an abrupt 90 degree right turnand took off like a streak of light. We had it under observation for three tofive minutes.”Finally, what appears to be the same object was also seen by the crew of theSpanish naval vessel, Atrevida , which was about several miles offshore.According to the ship’s captain, they saw “an intense yellowish-bluish light”moving from the shore toward their position. The crew initially believed it wasan ordinary aircraft until it stopped, turned off its light, and emitted arotating beam of light for two minutes. It then resumed its intense halo ofyellowish and bluish light, remaining in its position for 40 minutes. The lightthen appeared to split in half; the upper half performed a rapid spiral climband vanished. The glow from the halo continued to light up parts of the land andthe ocean. The ship’s surface radar never detected an object.This case is dramatic and difficult to deal with. Multiple witnesses, includingmilitary, seeing the same object with several witnesses describing beingsinside, who looked like very tall humans. Could the sighting have been anentirely terrestrial secret program? The figures inside did look human, afterall, although the technology would appear to be inexplicable – unless deep-blacktechnology is indeed decades ahead of the “white” world, as some have claimed.Or, could this have been the sighting of a truly alien technology, but one inwhich humans – or genetically modified humans – were employed as “workers”? Ordid the good doctor and his driver simply misinterpret, rather severely,something more mundane? If so, what could the sighting have been? James Oberg,formerly of U.S. Air Force Intelligence, and employed at NASA’s Johnson SpaceCenter on the Space Shuttle program, attributed this sighting to the launchingof Poseidon ballistic missiles by the U.S. Navy within its Eastern U.S. TestRange, an enormous area covering most of the Atlantic Ocean. Oberg conceded thatwhile the exact position of the submarines was classified, he confirmed that amissile launch did occur that day. Some have argued this proves the event wassimply a missile launch. ccxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1827081] Given thehistory of UFO sightings over U.S. missile sites, however, is it not at least aslikely that the UFO appeared as a result of the missile launch?On June 25, the Commanding General of the Canaries Air Zone designated aninvestigator for this and other UFO cases in the Canaries. Although thedepositions were confidential, a Spanish Air Force General later gave copies tojournalist J. J. Benitez (subsequently published in his book UFOs: OfficialDocuments of the Spanish Government ). The investigator determined there were nocivilian or military aircraft that could account for what the Spanish Navy saw.The final report concluded, with a level of circumlocution impressive even for amilitary bureaucracy, “we would have to face seriously the hypothesis that acraft of unknown origin and driven by an energy likewise unknown is operatingfreely in the skies above the Canary Islands.” ccxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1827378] It was at this time that the Spanish Divisional General commanding theAir Zone of the Canary Islands, General Carlos Castro Cavero, gave his interviewon UFOs to La Gaceta del Norte (discussed in the previous chapter). Smallwonder, as the sightings in the Canary Islands were inexplicable from aconventional point of view. It is curious why the interview was given at all.Perhaps the best reason was the death in 1975 of long-time dictator FranciscoFranco, who had ruled the country since 1939. A major regime change often bringsabout sense of new possibility, new openness. After all, Spain had experienced aUFO wave in 1974, but no public statements were made at that time. Even in 1976,the Spanish military investigations were kept confidential, and not until 1992did the Spanish Air Force begin a major declassification effort. ccxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1827941] Other UFOs were seen over the water in the eastern Atlantic and theMediterranean at this time. For instance, in July, a British Airways Tri-Star ona return flight from Portugal was involved in an incident which led to thescrambling of fighter jets to chase four objects – two of which were round andbrilliant white, two of which were cigar-shaped – 18 miles north of Faro, at thesouthern coast of Portugal. The captain was so alarmed by what he and thepassengers had seen that he reported the sighting to air traffic controllers atLisbon and Heathrow. According to British MoD files released many years later,fighters were immediately scrambled from Lisbon. Shortly afterwards, anotherTri-Star crew on the same flight path reported a bright UFO between Fatima andFarom, while later that month two Tri-Star co-pilots and five of their cabincrew reported “passing underneath a bright white circular object.” ccxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1828164] UFO reports emanated from Tunisia between August 3 and 9, during which aseries of unknown objects, seen visually and often tracked on radar, werereported at various points in the country. These sightings were dramatic enoughto result in a confidential memo from the U.S. Embassy stating that Tunisia’smilitary leadership was “very concerned.” None of these reports indicatednecessarily unusual performance capabilities or designs, but they did perplexthe Tunisian authorities to the point where they asked the U.S. Sixth Fleet,stationed in the Mediterranean, for any light it could shed. No follow-up reportis available. ccxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1828388] Incident Over TehranOn the night of September 18, 1976, the Iranian Air Force was involved in one ofthe most dramatic UFO events in modern history. Not only was the case itselfextraordinary, but so was the documentation: namely, a four-page U.S. DefenseIntelligence Agency report. ccxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1828570] It was firstreported in the English language Kayhan International , published in Tehran onSeptember 25 and soon afterwards headlined the APRO Bulletin . Charles Huffer,an American in West Germany, learned about it and requested information from theU.S. Department of Defense. This was denied on July 5, 1977, but his appealsucceeded in obtaining the release of a document on August 31, 1977 via theDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA).The strangeness began between 10:30 p.m. and 11:15 p.m. on September 18 when thecontrol tower at Mehrabad Airport received calls about an unknown objecthovering at 1,000 feet in the northern section of Teheran. The radar system wasunder repair and unavailable. After the fourth call, the tower supervisor,Hossain Perouzi, went out with binoculars. He saw a rectangular or cylindricalobject. In his words, “the two ends were pulsating with a whitish blue color.Around the mid-section was this small red light that kept going in a circle....I was amazed.” ccxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1829471] Perouzi called the Air Force Command, which reached General Nader Yousefi, baseoperations commander of Shahrokhi Air Force Base, nearly 200 miles away to thesouthwest. He gave the order to scramble an F-4 Phantom, which took off at 1:30a.m. on the morning of September 19. The object was intensely brilliant and“easily visible” at a distance of 70 miles. As the pilot came to within 25nautical miles (about 29 statute miles), his aircraft “lost all instrumentationand communications.” He broke off the intercept and headed back, at which pointhis aircraft regained all instrumentation.The General had already authorized a second F-4. When the second pilot reached adistance of 27 NM, he obtained a substantial radar return, “comparable to thatof a 707 tanker.” At this point, the UFO began to move away from the F-4 at thesame speed. It was extremely bright and gave off flashing strobe lights arrangedin a rectangular pattern. The colors alternated blue-green, red, and orange,although the sequence was so fast that they were almost simultaneous.The UFO then released a bright object, “estimated to be one half to one thirdthe apparent size of the Moon.” It headed straight toward the F-4 “at a veryfast rate of speed.” The pilot tried to fire an AIM-9 missile at it, “but atthat instant his weapons control panel went off and he lost all communications.”Seeking to evade, he dove and turned away, but the object followed him andturned inside his own turn. It then returned to the main object “for a perfectrejoin.” The F-4 pilot then regained communications and weapons control.At this point, another object came out of the main object and rapidly descended.The F-4 crew observed this, anticipating an explosion. Instead, the objectappeared to rest gently on the Earth and cast a very bright light over an areaof about 2 miles. The crew noted the object’s position and then headed back.Before landing, they circled Mehrabad Airport several times, receiving frequentinterference and losing communications. A civil airliner approaching Mehrabadalso experienced communications failure, but saw nothing. On its final approach,the F-4 crew saw a cylinder shaped object with bright steady lights on each endand a flasher in the middle. They inquired with the tower, which replied thatthere was no other known traffic in the area.The next morning, the F-4 crew was taken in a helicopter to the area where theUFO was thought to have landed – a dry lake bed. They saw nothing, but picked upa beeper signal west of the area. At the point where the return was the loudestwas a small house with a garden. They landed and asked the residents if they hadnoticed anything strange the previous night. The people mentioned a loud noiseand a bright light, “like lightning.”Although the DIA memo indicated more information would be forwarded, nofollow-up military documents ever came to light. Researchers Barry Greenwood andLawrence Fawcett stated, “reliable sources have told us the Iranian case wasabout one and a half inches thick, yet absolutely no admission to having thisfile has come from any government agency with a possible connection to thecase.” ccxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1829743]Nevertheless, taped testimonies in later years by Iranian Air Force generalsNader Yousefi and Mahmoud Sabahat reveal that General Richard Secord, chief ofthe USAF mission in Iran, attended a high level briefing with Iranianauthorities and the pilots. Furthermore, Lt. General Abdulah Azarbarzin of theIranian Imperial Air Force admitted to U.S. reporters that the UFO encounter hadbeen carefully documented and passed on to the USAF. “This was the request fromthe U.S. They have the procedure, if we have some information on UFOs, we’rejust exchanging all this information, and we did it.” ccxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1829923] In 2005, oneof the Iranian pilots, General Parviz Jafari, confirmed the facts of the chasein an interview with Whitley Strieber and Dr. Roger Leir. ccxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1830170] U.S. intelligence analysts found the case to be spectacular. An evaluation inthe DIA files stated:An outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets all the criterianecessary for a valid study of the UFO phenomenon: a) the object was seen bymultiple witnesses from different locations ... and viewpoints. b) thecredibility of many of the witnesses was high (an Air Force general, qualifiedair crews, and experienced radar operators). c) visual sightings were confirmedby radar. d) similar electromagnetic effects (EME) were reported by threeseparate aircraft. e) there were physiological effects on some crew members(i.e. loss of night vision due to the brightness of the object). f) aninordinate amount of maneuverability was displayed by the UFOs. ccxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1830361] During the 1990s, Lee Graham and Ron Regehr of Aero-Jet in Californiaconfirmed that the UFO sighting over Tehran was tracked by the U.S. military’sDefense Support Program (DSP) satellite. This is a deep space platform primarilyused to detect the launch of ballistic missiles. It can distinguish differentaircraft by comparing their infrared signature with a comprehensive database ofknown aircraft. Graham and Regehr obtained print-outs showing that the DSPdetected an anomalous object in Iranian air space at that time. ccxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1830535] The obvious question is, who was operating the object over Teheran?Based on the all that is known, it makes no sense to claim that this wasAmerican technology. Why would the Americans confront the Air Force of such akey ally within its own air space? Nor has there ever been any indication insubsequent years that the Soviet Union created technology responsible for this –to say nothing of the fact that for the Soviets to have engaged Iranian F-4sover Tehran in 1976 would have been even more provocative than if the U.S. haddone so. Indeed, after the encounter, the Iranian government asked thegovernments of the USSR and the U.S. whether this had been a test of theirmilitary equipment. Neither nation claimed responsibility. ccxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1830917] The real problem is that this object so clearly outperformed American-madefighter jets. Some agency – or civilization – was responsible for it. Henry Kissinger’s UFO MemoOn the same night as the Tehran incident, the American embassy in Rabat,Morocco, forwarded a message to the U.S. State Department regarding UFOs overMorocco. Widely separated locations saw a silver, luminous, circular object inthe southwest moving on a northeasterly course, leaving trails of bright sparksand fragments. This occurred between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., on September 19 –because of time zone differences, four hours later than the Iranianincident. The object was believed to be at about 3,000 feet altitude and made“absolutely no sound.” The U.S. embassy writer stated, “I frankly do not knowwhat to make of these sightings.” It took Secretary of State Henry Kissinger amonth to reply. Interestingly, he referenced the 1969 Condon Committee report,which he said demonstrated UFOs were not alien spaceships. He said he wasunaware of any aircraft or satellite activity that could be responsible, but didnot preclude “aircraft flights of other countries or unusual atmosphericconditions or events as a possible cause.” He concluded that “one would tend tobelieve that the event was a meteor, and probably a spectacular one, or ...[possibly] a decaying satellite part of which there is no precise re-entryrecord. Kissinger.” The description of the object, which included a slow speed,surely precludes that of a meteor. It has been speculated that Kissinger’s replywas delayed because he received a briefing on the UFO subject. Obviously, heintended his answer as an end to the inquiry and conversation. ccxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1831115] A few unusual encounters by commercial airliners filled out the rest of1976. The most interesting took place at Japan’s Akita Airport on October 17,when the air traffic controller observed a glowing, hovering object throughbinoculars that looked like “two plates placed together.” A pilot about to takeoff also noticed it. He described it as “a strange looking disc shaped object5,000 ft. from the ground. It was something I had never seen before.” The objectfinally flew away toward the sea. ccxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1831397] Summary1975 was one of the most spectacular years in the history of UFOs, and manyevents of 1976 were equally dramatic. Researchers were fortunate in being ableto obtain solid documentation on many military encounters with UFOs, some ofwhich are the most important ever recorded. Certainly the 1975 encounters alongthe northern U.S. border, as well as the Iranian Air Force encounter of 1976,fall into this category. In addition, the abduction phenomenon was brought to aprominence that it had not had since the publicity of the Betty and Barney Hillcase of the 1960s. But the Hill case had been considered an isolated incident.Abductions were not supposed to be all that common. During the mid-1970s,however, there were quite a few abduction cases that did not easily admit ofprosaic explanations. Researchers were taking notice.A sense of optimism prevailed. A new President was going to enter the WhiteHouse, one who was not only more liberal in his attitude regarding the public’sright to Freedom of Information, but who had openly admitted to being a UFOwitness. Jimmy Carter had even promised to try to open government records onUFOs. Could it be that there might be a formal government ‘disclosure’ of theUFO reality?Chapter 3 Great Expectations1976-1978 [President Jimmy Carter] told me many times . . . that it was true, that therewere crafts, that he believed there were occupants . . .― Actress Shirley MacLaine, on The Larry King Show, 1995. . . . he said he’s not allowed to talk about it, and that he will telleverything he knows after President Carter makes an announcement.”― Wife of military witness of three small humanoid bodies stored atWright-Patterson AFB, speaking to Leonard Stringfield, 1977. I sincerely hope that you are successful in preventing a reopening of UFOinvestigations.― Colonel Charles Senn, Chief of USAF Community Relations Division,letter to Lt. General Duward Crow of NASA, 1977. Jimmy Carter and the Trilateral CommissionOn November 2, 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected President of the United States. Hehad campaigned on a liberal platform which included a friendly attitude towardFreedom of Information and government openness. One can overstate the emphasisthat Carter gave to the UFO question, but that he discussed it at all was a signof the times, even a backlash against the negativism of the Condon Committeefrom the prior decade.Carter was perceived as a Washington outsider, but he had help getting to theWhite House. That help was named David Rockefeller, one of the richest and mostpowerful men in the world. ccxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1831665] It was jokedthat, for Rockefeller, becoming U.S. President would be a demotion. ccxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1832017] Rockefeller’spower was such that, in 1976 when Australian President Malcolm Fraser visitedthe United States, Fraser met with Rockefeller before meeting President GeraldFord. ccxxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1832238]In the year 1973 alone, Rockefeller met with 27 heads of state, including theleaders of the Soviet Union and Communist China. ccxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1832388] He was adedicated internationalist, a longtime Chairman of the Council on ForeignRelations, and had been a leading force of the Bilderberg Group since itsinception in 1954. Both groups, however, had developed shortcomings: theBilderberg Group lacked Asian members, while the CFR had been divided over U.S.policy in Vietnam. Rockefeller wanted a better instrument to manage theinternational realities of the day, and he certainly did not want it to be thehighly public United Nations. For a “unified world polity,” one needed freemarket forces that transcended national boundaries. The world had becomeinextricably interconnected, America’s relative power was waning, and it couldnot by itself be the military policeman of the world. ccxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1832565]Columbia University professor Zbigniew Brzezinski had meanwhile called for a“community of developed nations,” one which would include the Atlantic states(e.g. North America and Western Europe), “the more advanced European communiststates,” and Japan. Such a community could be an elite policy-planning group ofthe advanced capitalist nations. ccxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1832902] Rockefellerliked this idea, and under his initiative this became the Trilateral Commissionin 1973, with Brzezinski as its first Chairman. Rockefeller then walked into theoffice of Henry Kissinger and informed him that an organization had been createdto “help” the Nixon Administration take a proper course. (Rockefeller had lostpatience with Nixon’s economic policies of higher tariffs along with wage andprice controls.) Kissinger immediately acquiesced. ccxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1833148] Nixon’ssuccessor, Gerald Ford, had sought to accommodate the new reality, appointingtwo Trilateralists to his cabinet and selecting Nelson Rockefeller as his VicePresident. David was nonetheless unsatisfied with Ford, perhaps exacerbated whenFord dropped Nelson from the 1976 election ticket. Thus he cultivated Carter, anactive Trilateralist.During his presidential campaign, Carter benefitted from Rockefeller’s financialconnections and support, strong media coverage, and even speeches written byBrzezinski (who became his National Security Advisor). ccxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1833483] Carter statedthat it was time to replace “balance-of-power politics with world orderpolitics” and to “seek a partnership between North America, Western Europe andJapan.” He appointed 26 Trilateralists to senior positions in hisadministration. He even offered David Rockefeller the positions of TreasurySecretary and Federal Reserve Chairman, although Rockefeller politely declinedboth. More than a decade before the fall of the Soviet Union, America’scommitment to globalization was fully under way. ccxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1833748] While none of the above is particularly challenging history, it marked yetanother step toward the obsolescence of national sovereignty. The creation ofthe Commission is a case study in the divestiture of public power to powerfulprivate groups, which in turn formulate public policies to advance those verysame private interests. The development is relevant to the study of UFOphenomena. If powerful private groups can so easily dominate nationalgovernments, how implausible is it that they could assume control over the UFOsecret? Subsequent events indicate this almost certainly happened.Considering Carter’s previous statements on UFOs, it would not be surprisingthat he might inquire about them under the right circumstances. Shortly afterhis election victory, CIA Director George Bush telephoned Carter, offering hiscongratulations and tendering his resignation. Carter’s reply to the latter wasambiguous. In the telephone conversation, Bush proposed they get together inorder to discuss certain “exotic and very closely held items relating to sourcesand methods.” They did so on November 19, 1976. Incidentally, this was not thefirst time the two had met for an intelligence briefing; Carter had already metwith Bush twice before as a candidate, proving himself to be an exceptionallysophisticated and quick learner. At one point early on in the November briefing,Bush and his assistant Jennifer Fitzgerald took Carter and Vice President-ElectWalter Mondale aside to provide especially sensitive information. Just what the‘exotic’ items under discussion happened to be were not explained in the CIA’sofficial history of the meeting, except that Bush described “more than a dozensensitive CIA programs and issues.” Bush did make a play to try to maintain hisposition as Director of the CIA, suggesting that he might be helpful in Carter’stransition to the White House, but Carter rejected the offer. ccxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1834085] Daniel Sheehan, an attorney who had worked on the cases of DanielEllsberg and Karen Silkwood, claims to have learned from Marcia Smith (a spacepolicy senior analyst at the Congressional Research Service in Washington,D.C.), that Carter had asked Bush for, “the information that we have on UFOs andextraterrestrial intelligence.” Carter wanted to know about this “as President.”According to what Smith told Sheehan, Bush rejected this request, and said “thiswas information that existed on a need to know basis only. Simple curiosity onthe part of the President wasn’t adequate.” According to Sheehan, Bush toldCarter that he would consider handing over the CIA’s UFO material if Carterwould retain Bush as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Otherwise, saidBush, Carter’s best strategy for UFO material would be to approach the Scienceand Technology Committee of the House of Representatives. ccxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1834518]Upon entering the White House, Carter immediately replaced Bush with his oldfriend, Admiral Stansfield Turner. It is possible that Carter hoped to gethonest answers about the UFO issue. This, at least, is what he implied yearslater to UFO researcher Stanton Friedman when both were at Boston’s LoganAirport. Friedman was briefly able to mention his difficulties in obtaining UFOdata from the NSA and CIA, and Carter discussed his removal of Bush. Accordingto Friedman, “[Carter] indicated that the reason he chose his CIA director(Stansfield Turner) was that they were Annapolis classmates and therefore hethought that he could be trusted to tell him the truth . . . [the] implicationwas that other DCIs had not informed their presidents fully.” ccxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1835023] Freedom of InformationTrilateralist or not, Jimmy Carter came to the White House with certain beliefs.Following his inauguration on January 20, 1977, Carter spoke out against nuclearweapons and government corruption while supporting human rights and freedom ofinformation. This spirit blew like fresh air through a musty house. During hisfirst year as President, Carter permitted the release of documents describingillegal military and government activities. ccxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1835249] The new spiritcontinued to influence Congress, resulting in a Senate Intelligence OversightCommittee with its own staff and files, and a House investigation on the CIA’smind control programs – indicating that mind control was still a very activepursuit in certain quarters of the Agency. ccxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1835402] But Carter distanced himself from the UFO topic. Researcher GrantCameron studied the evolution of Carter’s pledge, noting that it changed slowlyuntil it completely disappeared. In fact, the UFO ‘pledge,’ while made in publicand in front of the cameras, never made it to Carter’s 214-page compilation ofcampaign pledges. Carter’s science advisor, Dr. Frank Press, was blunt: “I’m notparticularly interested in UFOs. I’m the President’s assistant, and I’ll work onanything he asks me to work on. But I can’t take on every problem that comes inhere.” ccxliii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1835604] This turned out to be a lost opportunity, for in January 1977 came therelease of a study on UFO sightings and beliefs of professional Americanastronomers by Peter Sturrock of Stanford University. Sturrock mailed out 2,611questionnaires, with half (1,356) being completed and returned. Sixty-tworespondents – nearly 5% – said they had witnessed or obtained an instrumentalrecord of an event that they could not identify and which they thought might berelated to UFOs. Moreover, 80% favored additional scientific study of UFOs.ccxliv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1836094] Inother words, a pretext was there for Carter to have used, had he tried to pressthe matter.The ‘pledge’ generated an enormous amount of mail from citizens urging thePresident to follow through. An early letter came from researcher Larry W.Bryant, who worked in the Pentagon as a writer for U.S. Army publications. Hisrequest of February 6, 1977 encouraged Carter to look into the roles played bythe major military and intelligence agencies in the UFO cover-up, and to makehis findings public. Carter’s staff were utterly unable to process the volume ofmail. Ten days later, Bryant received the standard USAF letter, stating that theAir Force no longer investigated UFOs and that all Project Blue Book recordscould be viewed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. ccxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1836424] Quietly, however, the White House inquired into the allegations of a UFOcover-up. Carter’s Press Secretary Jody Powell and Science Advisor Frank Pressseem to have done the most work on this matter. Within the first few months ofthe new administration, they asked the CIA and Pentagon if they were withholdingdocuments; both agencies said no. But Press also learned that military securityworked on a “need to know” basis. If military censors determined that the WhiteHouse did not have a need to know, the President would not be told. ccxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1836720] Powell,meanwhile, was the source of a surprising statement carried in the April U.S.News and World Report :Before the year is out, the Government - perhaps the President - is expected tomake what are described as ‘unsettling disclosures’ about UFOs unidentifiedflying objects. Such revelations, based on information from the CIA, would be areversal of official policy that in the past has downgraded UFO incidents.Where Powell got this information is not known, but Phillip Klass immediatelywrote to the magazine, offering 100 to 1 odds that there would be no “unsettlingdisclosures” before the year’s end.Struck by Powell’s statement, Todd Zechel traveled to Washington to visit ArthurLundahl, a former high ranking CIA official. Lundahl had reportedly briefed atleast three Presidents on UFOs. Regarding the U.S. News story, Lundahl toldZechel that he would check with “the boys,” which Zechel assumed to be formerCIA Directors William Colby and Richard Helms. However, according to Zechel,Lundahl “did not pry loose much specific information of the CIA’s involvementwith UFOs.” Ultimately, the U.S. News story was denied by the White House as a“misunderstanding” by Powell. ccxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1836875] All this UFO news was making for an interesting year. Researchers wererequesting increasingly large numbers of UFO files from the CIA, Air Force, andother departments. Bruce Maccabee had particularly good fortune with the FBI; bythe end of the year, he had received some 400 pages of UFO related documentsfrom the Bureau, mostly generated between 1947 and 1955, with thousands moreidentified and requested. Several of the reports provided detailed descriptionsof military encounters with UFOs. ccxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1837031]Although stonewalling remained the rule, it is interesting that the JointArmy-Navy-Air Force Publication (JANAP) 146 (E) was re-released on May 17, 1977.As in prior releases going back to the 1940s, the document mentioned“unidentified flying objects” as something that must be reported by militarypersonnel, and distinguished UFOs from other specific types of objects (e.g.“aircraft,” “missiles,” “submarines,” “military surface vessels,” “surfacevessels, submarines, or aircraft of unconventional design,” or other“unexplained or unusual activity....” In other words, UFOs continued to be alegitimate target of observation and reporting by U.S. military personnel.ccxlix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1837253]Finally, the new ‘freedom of information’ extended to UFO researchersthemselves, in the sense that conferences now became a regular part of theirculture, and went a long way toward raising standards of professionalism.Whereas the publicity for such gatherings was always limited, the benefits ofresearchers meeting with each other in person cannot be underestimated. ccl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1837620] By the end of1977, at least four major UFO conferences were held – the highest total ever upto that point. It was becoming evident that conferences were now competing witheach other for the time and money of attendees. Thus, MUFON’s leadershipactually expressed contentment in 1978 that theirs was the only major conferencethat year in America. ccli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1837888] Before long, amere four conferences per year would seem inconsequential. Daniel Sheehan and the VaultSeveral unverified stories add intrigue to the matter of Jimmy Carter and UFOs.Sheehan provided another through his connection with Marcia Smith. In January1977, Sheehan, then General Counsel to the U.S. Jesuit National Headquarters inWashington D.C., was approached by Smith, who told him that Carter’s people hadasked the Library of Congress Research Service to study the question of whetherextraterrestrial intelligence existed in the galaxy, and whether the UFOphenomenon might be related to extraterrestrial intelligence. As a result, sheasked for his participation, starting with a presentation on the religiousimplications of extraterrestrial contact at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inCalifornia. Sheehan agreed, but asked for access to the data to which Smithnormally had access. In particular, he wanted to see “the classified sections ofthe Project Blue Book.” Officially, there was no such thing as a classifiedportion of Blue Book, although rumors had always existed. Smith replied that shewould try and, to her surprise, the Pentagon people she spoke to agreed.According to public statements he made in later years, on a Saturday afternoonearly in 1977, Sheehan went to the Madison Building. He was led into a basementvault area built for the Library of Congress with armed guards stationed at theentrance. The building was so new that it had not yet opened to the public. Hewent to a secured room, showed his identification, was told to leave hisbriefcase behind, and that he was not to take notes. But Sheehan kept a yellowpad tucked under his arm, which apparently went unnoticed by the guards as heentered the room alone.The room had a reel-to-reel film machine through which Sheehan looked at filmsof unidentified vehicles. He eventually found a series of “unmistakable”photographs of a classic flying saucer embedded in snow and surrounded by AirForce personnel wearing parkas. The photos were so clear he could read the nametags. Some photos were of symbols on the side of the craft, which he carefullyand nervously traced to his yellow legal pad. He then closed his notepad andwalked out. As he came through the door, the desk officer asked to look at itand flipped through the pages. He never looked at the inside cardboard backing,which was where Sheehan had made his drawings, and returned the notepad.Sheehan told Smith what he saw. She later drafted two reports for the HouseScience and Technology Committee, both of which went to President Carter.Sheehan said he saw them both: one on extraterrestrial intelligence, the otheron UFOs. The report on extraterrestrial intelligence concluded there wereprobably between two and six intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxymore technologically developed than the human race. 2[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1764325] The UFO reportshowed “drawings of different shapes of UFOs,” and concluded there were manycases in which official USAF investigations could not rule out the possibilitythat some of these vehicles were in fact extraterrestrial.Sheehan retains custody of the symbols he drew. He has never published them,although he presented them at the UFO Expo in Santa Clara, California, inSeptember 2001. According to Grant Cameron, who attended, they resembled acombination of slashes and dots. The written language that approximates thismost is probably Tibetan. cclii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1838048] White House UFO ProjectIn 1977, Alfred Webre was a Senior Policy Analyst at the Center for the Study ofSocial Policy at Stanford Research Institute, where a great deal ofintelligence-related research was contracted – including remote viewing work.When he arrived there in January 1977, he stated his intention to develop an“extraterrestrial communication” project with White House backing, and wasted notime in getting started. Webre assumed that, given some of Carter’s publicstatements from the previous year, a research project sponsored by the WhiteHouse (and perhaps collaborating with agencies such as the National ScienceFoundation or NASA), might be able to withstand challenges from elsewhere.He planned three phases to the project. First would be the creation of acomprehensive UFO database. Next, scientific advisers would evaluate the dataand construct interpretive models, including but not limited to theextraterrestrial and interdimensional model. Finally, a report and policyrecommendations would be made, possibly resulting in the creation of apermanent, open, global database under independent control. Webre alsoenvisioned a recommendation for ending the military and intelligence secrecy onthe subject.He made inquiries among White House staffers, and was eventually referred to aperson whose name he has not remembered in subsequent years, referred to in alater affidavit as “Jane Doe.” This person was a staff member of the White HouseDomestic Policy Staff (under Stuart Eisenstadt) and, according to Webre, wassupportive of his proposal when he met with her that spring in Washington D.C.He returned to SRI, further developed his proposal, and received corporateapproval. Before long, he flew back to Washington to meet with Jane Doe again.She told him his concept had been approved, he gave her a copy of the proposal,and they discussed the contract research process, as SRI would have to beawarded a research contract for the study. She then said she would get theproposal to her superiors. Although she did not name who these people were,Webre was unconcerned as it was still early in the discussion. Little did heknow that he would not meet with his White House contact again. ccliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1838415] At this time, the White House was dealing with publicity from an articlein The Star , a national tabloid. Its May 3 issue discussed Carter’s 1969 UFOsighting and his administration’s interest in the topic. This sparked anotherwave of mail to the White House. The White House lacked the staff to answerthese letters, much less provide relevant information. Inquiries about UFOscontinued to be referred to the Air Force. Few missed the irony. ccliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1838624] Things Go SouthThe Carter UFO initiative, such as it was, quickly approached its climax. Someindividuals maintain that the President was given a UFO briefing at the WhiteHouse on June 14, 1977, and afterwards was bound to secrecy. According to formerUSAF Captain Robert Collins, “a lone MJ-12 briefing officer” met with thePresident, accompanied by several independent sources. Together these sourcesproduced a “reconstruction” of what was told to Carter, and this became known asthe “Executive Briefing: Project Aquarius” document. It was later leaked to UFOresearcher William Moore through a member of the Defense Intelligence Agencyknown only as the Falcon. Moore said that the notes he received were a typedcopy of handwritten notes that had been used by the officer during the briefing.The memo itself gives the (now standard) account of multiple retrievals of alientechnology. cclv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1838778] Grant Cameronnoted that a review of the schedule on June 14, 1977 shows that a meeting in theCabinet room between 1:35 p.m. and 3:15 p.m., to “discuss appropriations forintelligence affairs in the 1979 Budget of the U.S.” could have been a cover foranother meeting which did not appear in the diary of President Carter. However,there remains no hard evidence to support the claims that a briefing took place,and no proof has shown the documents to be either legitimate or a forgery.In this context, the author can relate an anecdote told to him privately by awell-placed source. In June 1977, a presidential aide who was “very, very closeto Carter” walked into the Oval Office following a briefing that the aide knewhad concerned the topic of UFOs. Carter was sobbing, with his head in his hands,nearly on his desk. Although the aide did not learn the precise reasons forCarter’s emotional state, he said that a few of Carter’s phrases made it clearhe was deeply upset about the topic.Probably the most dramatic UFO-related statement attributed to Jimmy Carter wasmade public in 1995. During a television appearance, the actor Nicholas Cage hadmentioned a conversation he had with actress Shirley MacLaine. He said MacLainehad told him about various conversations she had with former President Carter,including Carter’s statement to her that he had seen a crashed flying saucer andthe occupants. Shortly after this, MacLaine was a guest on the Larry Kingtelevision show, and a caller asked her about Cage’s statement. MacLaineresponded by saying:[Carter] didn’t tell me that, but he told me many times that when I first wroteOut On A Limb [in 1983] that he would support me, that it was true, that therewere crafts, that he believed there were occupants, [and] why should we be theonly people in the universe? He wanted to shine the sunshine laws onintelligence, to expose it, to see how the people would react, but he didn’t andwouldn’t and couldn’t as he explained to me.The statement is interesting because it seems to indicate that Carter wastelling her more than his simple belief or opinion. The statement that “it wastrue, that there were crafts” seems extremely specific, especially one made by aformer President. Both Grant Cameron and this author have asked Ms. MacLaine forelaboration on this statement, but she has not done so officially. However, inconversation with this author, she did confirm that she was on friendly termswith the President and that he had discussed UFOs with her in very seriousterms. cclvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839032] All through the spring and summer of 1977, the UFO letters kept coming.By early July, Carter’s science officials were calling the situation a“nightmare.” Eventually, the Congressional Liaison Office, directed by FrankMoore, received over 9,000 letters. There is no evidence that Carter read any ofthem; none were answered personally, although a large pile was photographed. AsScience Advisor Frank Press looked into how to answer all the mail, he observedthat people interested in UFOs were being ignored, and that there was no uniformmanner in which federal agencies responded to UFO inquiries. cclvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839244] On July 21, Press wrote to Dr. Robert A. Frosch, NASA Administrator,suggesting that NASA become the “focal point for the UFO question,” answeringall UFO-related mail and also conducting an active research program on UFOs.Essentially, he was asking NASA to create a new Project Blue Book. “Since it hasbeen nearly a decade since the Condon report,” wrote Press, “I believe that asmall panel of inquiry could be formed to see if there are any new significantfindings.” cclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839399] This was animportant letter coming from a man who had previously expressed no interested inthe subject of UFOs. At the same time, Press’s office made statements to thejournal Science that the classification of UFO data was one of the things that“keeps alive this belief in the cover-up. Policies like these . . . need reviewand perhaps changing.” This appeared to support what many UFO researchers hadlong been saying: that there was a cover-up. Philip Klass immediately took issuewith this and contacted the author of the article, telling her she had been“badly misinformed” about a cover-up. cclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839621] By this time, Klass was affiliated with a new organization, founded theprevious year by the American Humanist Association. This was the Committee forScientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). Stating that itsgoal was to combat the rise of “pseudoscience,” CSICOP argued it would “not ...reject on a priori grounds, antecedent to inquiry, any or all (paranormal)claims, but rather to examine them openly, completely, objectively andcarefully.” Before long, it became evident that CSICOP engaged in very littleinvestigation. The organization did excel at public relations, however. Membersquickly published articles on behalf of CSICOP in Smithsonian , Reader’s Digest, Omni , and elsewhere. What soon separated a CSICOP article from thosesubmitted by academicians or scientists was typically the tone, which overtlyemployed standard propaganda tactics. Many offerings referred to UFO believersas “kooks” or “hoaxers,” used words like “pseudoscientific” or “nonsense” inreference to UFOs, and frequently appealed to established authorities such as“scientists” or simply “authorities.” All these are methods of propaganda, notof science, tools of public relations rather than detached inquiry. Stringfield’s LeaksDuring 1977, no UFO researcher made a more dramatic contribution to the fieldthan Leonard Stringfield. In May, his book Situation Red: The UFO Siege wasreleased. It became one of ufology’s most historically significant books. Asmall but important segment of the book supported the thesis that, over theyears, the U.S. military had retrieved extraterrestrial hardware and possiblybodies. Not since Frank Scully’s Behind the Flying Saucers – published in 1950 –had a UFO researcher openly supported such a claim. The book immediatelyprompted dozens of alleged first hand witnesses of crashed UFOs or alien bodiesto contact Stringfield with their stories. Undoubtedly Stringfield’s formermilitary career helped inspire the confidence of his informants, many of whomwere former military intelligence personnel. By and large, Stringfield foundthem credible.Although Stringfield usually confirmed the identities of his informants, alldemanded anonymity. One of his informants was a doctor (“Doctor X”), who said hehad conducted tests on alien bodies at a medical facility in the eastern U.S.Stringfield eventually met with him at the medical facility where he worked.Doctor X did not answer all of Stringfield’s questions, but did describe thealiens physically: they were four feet tall, forty pounds in weight, had a largehead, heavy brow ridge, round eyes, no pupils, apertures rather than ears, atiny nose, and an apparently non-functional slit-like mouth without lips orteeth. In addition, they had slender torsos, long thin arms, tan or greyish skinthat was elastic and reptile-like, colorless liquid prevalent in their body, butno red blood cells. They appeared to lack reproductive organs and seemedclone-like in appearance. Doctor X thought they were possibly androids. cclx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839775] During the summer of 1977, Stringfield gave a lecture on UFOs at theCincinnati Chapter of the World Wings. Afterwards, a pilot told him that he hadseen three alien bodies in crates at a hangar at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953after a UFO crash in Arizona. He had also heard rumors that a UFO was retrievedin England during the Second World War. Stringfield’s check on the pilot didprove that he had an extensive military career, but little more. cclxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1839941] In earlyAugust, Stringfield was contacted by a woman whose husband was in the Air Forceat Wright-Patterson AFB in 1973. The husband told her he was once blindfoldedand taken to a secure location where he stood guard for several high-rankingofficers and scientists who were viewing three small humanoid bodies. The beingshad large heads and were approximately 3 feet tall. The woman told Stringfield“he said he’s not allowed to talk about it, and that he will tell everything heknows after President Carter makes an announcement.” cclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1840191] In the Fall,another military informant told Stringfield of his second-hand knowledge of a1948 retrieval of a metallic disc-shaped UFO that crashed somewhere in a desertregion. The only details indicated that the craft had suffered severe damage onimpact and was retrieved by military units. cclxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1840397] As intriguing as these early accounts were, much more was to come. NASA’s Troubles, and The Grenada InitiativeThe UFO topic had not been a happy subject for the Carter White House. Within amere few months, it had prompted a deluge of citizen letters, sparked futileinquiries within the national security establishment, generated unwelcometabloid press attention, and encouraged some serious leaks.By the fall of 1977, matters were fast approaching a climax and resolution. OnSeptember 14, Frank Press of the White House once again asked NASA administratorRobert Frosch for help with the UFO mail problem. This was unwelcome enough, butPress then compounded his ufopaux by repeating his suggestion from July, thatmaybe the time was right for another study of the UFO issue. Perhaps a panel ofprominent scientists might “conduct an investigation of the validity andsignificance of UFO reports.” cclxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1840596] Frosch’sshudders were enough to keep NASA out of this, but the CIA and Air Force hadalso been advising NASA to steer clear. Two weeks earlier, on September 1,Colonel Charles Senn, Chief of USAF Community Relations Division, wrote to Lt.General Duward Crow of NASA, “I sincerely hope that you are successful inpreventing a reopening of UFO investigations.” cclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1840751] Everyone knewthat this had been a twenty-year public relations headache for the Air Force.NASA’s hierarchy essentially agreed with the Condon Committee report. Despitethe political and fiscal dangers in opposing the President, NASA’s institutionalinstinct was to run far, and run fast. NASA did grudgingly take on additionalletter-answering duties, but the Carter administration lacked the desire to pushany harder for an actual investigative body on UFOs.This is evident in the termination of Alfred Webre’s proposed extraterrestrialcommunications project, which Webre had worked on at Stanford Research Institutethrough the summer of 1977, and for which he was counting on White Housesupport. There is some disagreement as to how this actually happened, but thereis no question that Webre did propose the project, and that it was terminated inSeptember. The open question is why.Webre maintained that he attended a meeting at SRI with his supervisor, senioradministrator Peter Schwartz. In addition were two other individuals, whosenames Webre could not remember in later years. One of these was another seniorSRI official, which Webre indicated in an affidavit as “John Doe I.” The otherhe said was a Pentagon liaison with SRI, indicated as “John Doe II.” Accordingto Webre, the Pentagon liaison issued a warning: if the extraterrestrial studywent forward, SRI’s many contracts with the Pentagon would be terminated. Thereason given by the Pentagon liaison: “there are no UFOs.” Webre objected, to noavail. cclxvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1840949]He later contended that his proposed study “was nipped in the bud by the U.S.National Security State.” cclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841103] Peter Schwartzconceded that Webre’s scenario had some elements of truth, but was“substantially wrong.” There was never any formal inquiry, Schwartz maintained,nor any threat to SRI to cut off funding. “There were people at SRI who wereunhappy about anything controversial that might bring negative attention to theinstitute, but we were never threatened by DoD.” cclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841261]Whether Webre’s proposal was shut down by the Pentagon or by SRI, it is evidentthat the White House itself was never committed to it. The White House staffernever contacted Webre after their meeting several months before. If the WhiteHouse had truly wanted this project, one assumes it would have happened.Meanwhile, the White House had to contend with a visit from a head of state whoopenly intended to end UFO secrecy. Luckily for the White House, Sir Eric Gairywas only from Grenada. On September 9, Gairy met with Jimmy Carter for a45-minute meeting. Carter’s actions remain unknown, except that he gave Gairy acopy of the 1969 Condon Committee report on UFOs. It would appear that the WhiteHouse attempted to erase this meeting from history; archivists at the CarterLibrary have found no notes pertaining to it. Indeed, the files of Carter’sNational Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezenski, who attended the meeting, arestill classified more than four decades later. In a subsequent interview, Gairyavoided details of the meeting, but acknowledged that UFOs were discussed.Indeed, it is obvious what Gairy wanted. Gairy was planning a return to theUnited Nations to press for UFO disclosure. As the leader of a politicallypowerless Caribbean nation, the U.N. was his best forum, and he obviously wanteda politically friendly White House. He appears to have failed to get the supporthe wanted. cclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841422]Gairy delivered his speech on October 7, which was prepared with the help ofLeonard Stringfield. cclxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841642] Gairy told thedelegates that he had once seen a UFO and was “totally overwhelmed” by theexperience. “One wonders,” he continued:... why the existence of UFOs, or flying saucers as they are sometimes called,continue to remain a secret to those whose archives repose useful informationand other data. While we appreciate that some countries consider this to be inthe interest of military expedience, I now urge that a different view be takenbecause it is my firm conviction that the world is ready, willing and ripeenough to accept these phenomena in relation to man and his existence on theearth planet and life in outer space. cclxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841782] Gairy recommended that the U.N. establish a permanent agency to study UFOs andfacilitate the exchange of data among the world’s nations. A formal resolutionwas now needed, and this was scheduled for November 28. On the morning of the28th, Grenada’s U.N. Ambassador, Dr. Wellington Friday, received a phone callfrom a U.S. delegate, Coast Guard Commander John Feigle, who expressed “hopefulsupport,” but said the U.S. position was based on the Condon Report of 1969.Friday replied that new data had made that study “invalid.” Later that day,Wellington Friday gave an hour-long speech – “a moment for history,” asStringfield called it. He suggested the U.N. study UFO sightings, allegedcontacts with aliens, and work to make UFO data more accessible. He appealed toU.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim to convene UFO hearings.This request was audacious, risky, even revolutionary. If accepted, it wouldmean virtual acknowledgment of an extraterrestrial presence by one of theworld’s most politically important institutions. But it bounced harmlessly offthe structure of the United Nations. Waldheim assured the Grenadans that thematter would be addressed as soon as “126 global issues ranging fromdisarmament, to human rights and terrorism had been shelved...” cclxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1841937] The U.S.delegation told the Grenadans they could not support the resolution, especiallya segment that suggested governments share their UFO data. Britain agreed, andarranged for a closed-door session during which it was decided that the Grenadanproposal would be too time consuming and expensive to implement.The rest was denouement. On December 13, the U.N. General Assembly adoptedDecision 32/424, which acknowledged Gairy’s resolution, forwarded it tointerested member states, and shelved the matter until the next general assemblyconvened, which was a year later. In theory, this allowed time for membernations to evaluate their UFO data. Some, like Stringfield, hoped that by thenGairy’s views might have made an impact on the world community. In reality, thedecision was a failure for the Grenada delegation. Only three governments(India, Luxembourg, and Seychelles) and two specialized agencies (InternationalCivil Aviation Organization and UNESCO) even bothered to respond, essentiallywith no comments. Even so, Gairy did not intend to give up. cclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1842093]Meanwhile, NASA had already decided that it was not going to investigate UFOs.In late October, NASA scientist Herbert Rowe wrote to MUFON that “at the presenttime” NASA lacked the resources. “Should we arrive at the point where outsideassistance is desired,” Rowe stated, “we will be in touch with you.” cclxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1842391] Two monthslater, on December 21, 1977, Robert Frosch told White House advisor Frank Pressthat, based on a check with the CIA, it knew of no evidence of UFO reality. Heemphasized the problem of devising a “sound scientific procedure” to investigatewhat could clearly be an elusive phenomenon. While NASA would continue torespond to UFO-related mail, it would not conduct any research into the matteruntil hard evidence were to arise from a credible source. Frosch closed bystressing that NASA as an institution had not come to a conclusion about UFOs(“we retain an open mind”) but that the problem was one of devising appropriatescientific protocols. cclxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1842587]Dr. Dave Williamson, NASA Assistant for Special Projects, put the matter thisway:... we’re not anxious to do it because we’re not sure what we can do. It’s mypersonal opinion that it’s not wise to do research on something that is not ameasurable phenomena. Spending public money for such research is questionable.There is no measurable UFO evidence such as a piece of metal, flash or cloth. Wedon’t even have any radio signals. A photograph is not a measurement .... giveme one little green man – not a theory or memory of one – and we can have amultimillion dollar program.... cclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1842759] Considering the evasiveness and difficulties presented by the UFO phenomenon,there is merit in this position. Yet, Stringfield’s research was beginning tohint that actual alien craft and bodies were available for study in deeplyclassified “need to know” circles, although certainly not public institutionssuch as NASA. The claim, too, that “a photograph is not a measurement” is pithy,memorable, and wrong. Precisely because photographs do provide accurate,measurable data is why photographic analysis commands resources and respect fromintelligence agencies and scientific organizations around the world.A White House press release on December 27 made it official, stating that itaccepted NASA’s evaluation of the situation and would not pursue the matter anyfurther. As 1977 came to a close, the Carter UFO initiative was dead, and thevarious efforts to create an institutional foundation for UFO research had allfailed. Movies and the MediaNot only were political initiatives for disclosure stirring the pot; UFOs werealso receiving attention in the media. Dominating the news was StevenSpielberg’s movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind , released in December1977, which dealt with the UFO phenomenon in a manner that reflected somegenuine research. Even the title was derived from Allen Hynek’s typology of UFOsightings. Spielberg had sought cooperation from NASA; the agency sent him a20-page letter hoping to talk him out of the project. That was when he “found[his] faith” – if NASA was so opposed to his movie, he assumed he was ontosomething. This was no 1950s “alien invasion” flick. Spielberg portrayed thealiens as benign and even with smiles. Well before its release, the moviereceived quite a few bad reviews, with several pundits predicting “flop.” But itsucceeded wildly, ultimately receiving many positive reviews, albeit as a workof drama rather than something based on reality. The movie unquestionably strucka resonant chord with a worldwide public.UFOs were also receiving media attention of a different sort, in this case thetabloid publication, The National Enquirer . For some time, the paper had beenmixing its standard tabloid fare with UFO stories that reflected genuineinvestigation. On October 31, the Enquirer sent a series of questions to the AirForce about the intrusion of alleged unidentified “helicopters” over Loring AFBfrom late 1975. cclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1842952] Why not theNew York Times, Washington Post , CBS, or other mainstream news agencies? Whythe Enquirer ?Years later, journalist Terry Hansen interviewed Bob Pratt, the Enquirer ’sreporter on the story. Pratt acknowledged that the tipoff appeared to have beenan anonymous phone caller, possibly “with the intention of discrediting theinformation.” After searching his notes, Pratt found a type-written statementwith the name of UFO researcher Brad Sparks on the bottom, stating that on May17, 1977, an anonymous caller had contacted the Enquirer about the overflights.Pratt had no recollection of this, nor of having worked with Sparks.What makes this more interesting is that the Enquirer publisher, Gene Pope, hadbeen a CIA agent during the early 1950s. What he did there remains classified,except that he was involved in the Agency’s Psychological Warfare Unit. Hansen’sresearch suggested that the CIA helped to fund the Enquirer when Pope took itover, most likely to provide sensationalistic coverage to certain stories asneeded – a kind of ‘inoculation,’ just as a doctor gives a touch of disease tothe patient to stimulate a reaction from the immune system. Even soberlyresearched UFO stories would be discredited within the confines of a tabloiddedicated to horoscopes and celebrity gossip. cclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1843116] In fact, Pratt’s article, “UFOs Spotted at Nuclear Bases and MissileSites,” which appeared on December 13, 1977, was well researched. He listednames and dates that could be used for a FOIA request, which Barry Greenwoodpromptly filed. While the inside tip may have been an attempt to create astillborn, it is conceivable that this was a genuine lead from someone in theintelligence community, using a reliable CIA conduit such as Pope. Theintelligence establishment is not monolithic; factions and conflicting agendashave always proliferated within it. cclxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1843280] The Enquirer was helpful in this case. Yet, its continued associationwith the UFO topic poisoned the field. UFO articles appeared in other“unrespectable” publications as well, such as men’s magazines like Playboy andOui (which featured an interview with Allen Hynek by Jerome Clark). Such asetting ensured continued disdain and ridicule from academic and scientificcircles. Some UFO researchers were aware of the problem, Richard Hall being themost vocal. Others, such as Walter Andrus and Coral Lorenzen, seemed to abide bythe adage that there was no such thing as bad publicity. The virtues of takingthe high road on such matters may seem obvious, but it can be difficult to avoidtemptation when all other avenues are shut off, year after year. cclxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1843483] Government Policies ElsewhereWhile 1977 was a year when the U.S. President apparently failed to break throughthe secrecy surrounding UFOs, Britain maintained its status quo with less fuss,largely thanks to a law that kept government documents secret for 30 years. In1977, this effectively ruled out the entire modern era of UFOs. Over the nextfew years, when British researchers applied for UFO documents created prior to1950, they were told the reports had been re-filed with all reports for 1955 –essentially, “come back in 1985.” This game continued into the early 1980s, whenresearchers learned that now there were no files prior to 1960. cclxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1843668] Other nations had different policies. In May 1977, France establishedthe Groupe d’Etude des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non-Identifies (GEPAN)specifically for the study of UFOs. Under the direction of Dr. Claude Poher, thegroup was part of the French National Space Agency. French President ValeryGiscard d’Estaing expressed interest in the project. The organization was sooninvestigating current cases, alerted by teletype from the French National PoliceForce. In 1978, from 11 case studies, GEPAN concluded that in 9 of them, theorigin, propulsion, and method of operation were beyond human knowledge. Evenso, GEPAN appeared to be as much public relations as actual study, and manyresearchers believed that the high strangeness cases went to other agencies. Bythe 1980s, GEPAN’s activities and status had become uncertain, even among Frenchresearchers. cclxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1843909] Two additional statements from 1977, both from Japan, bear mention. Thefirst was by Japanese Major General Hideki Komura, advisor to the CabinetResearch Office (equivalent to the CIA), who stated that there had been highlevel official Japanese UFO investigations during the 1950s and 1960s. Thisstudy had been based on the American Project Blue Book and cooperated closelywith the United States. However, the study collapsed, he said. This was becausethere were too many non-credible cases being received alongside the morecredible data. One might wonder why an intelligence operation would close downsimply because not all the data it received was valid. Such is a universalproblem in intelligence collection. cclxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1844168] In September1977, another Japanese General made a dramatically different statement regardingUFOs. Lieutenant General Akira Hirano, Chief of Staff of the Japan AirSelf-Defense Force, stated “we frequently see unidentified objects in the skies.We are quietly investigating them.” This statement was quickly countered by hisstaff, which denied that he mentioned any official investigation. cclxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1844331] 1977: A Year of Aerial EncountersUFO statistics, never complete even today, were woefully inadequate during mostof the twentieth century. During the 1970s, entire regions of the world stilllacked a reliable infrastructure for reports. The Soviet Union, Eastern Europe,China, Middle East, Africa, and much of the Pacific region remained ufologically‘dark.’ Even so, based on the reports that have come to light, it is clear that1977 was a very active year in terms of UFO sightings.While the year was rich in sightings of all types, many cases involved UFOsprovocatively buzzing commercial and military aircraft. This happened with suchconsistency and frequency in all regions of the world that an objective analystis hard pressed to find any explanation other than that some agency wasoperating extremely advanced aerial technology in a direct attempt to get theattention of the world’s military authorities.One such case took place in Colombian air space on January 21. Avianca Flight132 had just taken off from El Dorado Airport, Bogota, and had climbed to itscruise altitude of 20,000 feet when Captain Gustavo Ferreira and his four crewmembers noticed a bright light approaching them. Ferreira discussed this withhis first officer, then called air traffic control at Bogota. Hoping to get theattention of the oncoming object, he turned on his plane’s landing lights. Whenhe did so, the UFO appeared to respond by changing color from white to red.Startled, Ferreira decided to turn off all of his airplane’s lights, leaving itin total darkness, and then turned them back on. Again, the object seemed torespond: it flashed green lights, changed its direction, and was soon gone. Asit disappeared visually, the radar operator stated, “I’ve lost it!” The objecthad performed a ninety degree turn at “fantastic speed” and left his scope.cclxxxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1844489] Similar events occurred in Europe. In February, a UFO followed anItalian F-104 for 23 minutes, according to a report that was later declassifiedby the Italian Defense Ministry. The pilot stated that the object was brighterthan the Moon, and remained a mere 800 or 900 yards from his aircraft. “Ialerted the nearest base,” he said, “and was authorised to intercept it. When Ibegan to show my intentions, climbing to 12,000 feet, the object kept itsdistance unchanged, then disappeared.” cclxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1844782] On March 7,1977, a French Mirage IV bomber aircraft was approached by a UFO, an event seenvisually, tracked on radar, and included in the COMETA report years later.Flying near Dijon at 31,500 feet just under the speed of sound, the pilot andnavigator saw a bright light rapidly approach. Despite their evasive maneuvers,it tailed them at a distance of less than a mile, then sped away at supersonicspeed. Less than a minute later, the scenario repeated. At no point was theobject tracked on radar. cclxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1845019]Three days later, on the other side of the world, another UFO buzzed by anIndonesian offshore Arjuna oil field. On March 10, at 7:40 p.m., crews from twotanker vessels saw a large dark object with a red light approach from the westbeneath the clouds, circle the oil field twice, emit beams of light, then flyaway to the east. An Indonesian Air Force officer reported the case to CUFOS.cclxxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1845269] On June 17, the Portuguese Air Force engaged UFOs. Sergeant Jose Rodriguez wasflying a Dornier aircraft over Castelo de Bodedam when he saw a dark objectapproach. He notified ground control, which reported no other nearby traffic. Asthe object closed in, he estimated its diameter to be between 40 and 50 feet,and saw that its upper section was black, while the lower section had some sortof paneling. After it vanished at high speed, Rodriguez’s directional electricgyroscope rotated wildly, and his plane started to dive out of control. Heregained control at treetop level, and was so disturbed that he had difficultyspeaking afterward. While independent ground witnesses could not confirm theUFO, they did confirm the dramatic dive of the aircraft and the apparent powersurge when he regained control of the aircraft. The Portuguese Air Force offeredno explanation for the event. cclxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1845464] One of the most intriguing stories of 1977 occurred on July 1, at NATO’s AvianoAir Base, located northeast of Venice, and operated by the USAF under thecontrol of the Italian Defense Ministry. The case was described by Timothy Goodin the 1980s, and received extensive followup by USAF Lt. Colonel Jerry Rowles.Good reported that an American soldier named James Blake saw a large, brightlight hovering at low altitude in an alert zone where two military aircraft werebeing kept. Many soldiers saw the object, which appeared to be domed, spinning,changing colors, 150 feet in diameter, and making a noise like “a swarm ofbees.” According to this account, the event lasted for a full hour and caused amassive black out on the base. A few seconds after the object left, the baselights went back on. The official explanation was that the event “must beattributed to a reflection of the Moon on some low clouds.” ccxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1845726]During the 1990s, Rowles re-investigated the event, corroborating and correctingGood’s account. He obtained information from a new witness, a decorated basesergeant named Robert A. Furry, who said that at 3 a.m. in clear weather, basesensors detected an object which triggered several alarms. Part of the facilitylost power, and backup systems engaged. A security policeman noticed a light (orlights) beyond the northwest perimeter fence. Furry notified the command postthat a security response team had been dispatched to apprehend possibleintruders. He then went outside to look, and saw a very bright, circular lightthat appeared to be about 30 feet above the ground, some 200 meters beyond thefence. The light was so intense, said Furry, “especially around the rim,” thatdetails were difficult to see. Yet he discerned a physical structure behind it,and heard a sound like “bees buzzing, or a humming sound.” According to Furry,the object did not hover directly over the base (which was what Good hadreported). U.S. Air Force security and a unit from the Italian National Policewere dispatched to determine the nature of the object, but it left before theunits arrived. “It just gradually inclined and took off towards the corner ofthe mountains,” said Furry.In Furry’s judgment, the craft had simply been watching the base. “We certainlytook no hostile actions toward it,” he said. “Those of us who observed it werein a standoff mode.” No one contacted Furry about the matter, he signed nosecurity oaths, and the incident received no publicity. For a while, there wasspeculation around the base about the UFO, “but the talk just kind of dried awayand the incident was more or less ignored.” For his part, Furry favored anextraterrestrial answer. He did not believe any classified, experimental craftwould have “floated in unannounced and then hover” next to an active alertfacility.Rowles also spoke to a base historian who found no references to the incident.Yet, Rowles pointed out, administrators have little flexibility in preparingunit histories. Since no intrusion or hostile actions were made, Rowles found it“logical and consistent with administrative procedures” that the event would notmake it into the unit history. ccxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1845879] Shortly after Rowles published his analysis of the Aviano event, ageophysicist named John Derr offered that it “was clearly an electricalphenomenon, most likely an intense plasma similar to ball lightning, butgenerated by strain release in the earth.” Derr pointed out that this period oftime coincided with a series of earthquakes in the area from the year before,and that aftershocks were still occurring in 1977. ccxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1846081] Furry rejectedthis explanation, countering that he saw a structured craft, not simply lights.ccxciii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1846255] Even accounting for the variations in the story as told by different witnesses,it is clear that something important happened at Aviano, important enough tocreate a phenomenon (or object) that gave off intensely bright light for anextended period of time, disable the air base’s electrical power system, triggera major security alert, appear to move intelligently, and evade identification.Until a geophysicist can show how the earth can generate “an intense plasma”that can do all these things, the case remains inexplicable by any conventionalstandards.Later that month, another UFO event was recorded at a European military base.While the event has official confirmation, the precise date is vague. RAFBoulmer is in the north of England, facing the North Sea, not far from Scotland.In July 1977, a flight lieutenant named A.M. Wood reported seeing two luminous,round objects, four to five times the size of a helicopter, three miles out tosea, hovering at around 5,000 feet altitude. Two other base personnel, aCorporal Torrington and a Sergeant Graham, watched the objects with Wood foralmost two hours, which were also tracked by base radar and another radarfacility at RAF Staxton Wold. According to a report that was released in 2005,“the objects separated. Then one went west of the other, as it maneuvered itchanged shape to become body-shaped with projections like arms and legs.” Thisevent was considered so sensitive to the national interest that the MoD delayedits release for an extra three years beyond its normal declassificationschedule. But under the British Freedom of Information Act, which came intoforce on January 1, 2005, the file was finally declassified. ccxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1846439] These European reports showed a pattern of unknown objects behaving inextraordinary and provocative ways that stopped short of belligerent. Elsewhere,they had become deadly. UFOs that KillChina’s long history of isolation from the West, rigidly imposed by its leadersover many centuries, ended during the 1970s. In 1972, U.S. President RichardNixon initiated diplomatic relations. Four years later, Communist Party ChairmanMao Zedong died. In July 1977, the Party rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping, who hadadvocated greater economic openness. Now the leader himself, Deng saw links withthe U.S. as a vital means of acquiring technical aid and helping the economy tomodernize. Meanwhile, Chinese ufology thrived, and Chinese UFO reports becamefrequent. Many of these were recorded by researcher Paul Dong, including severaldozen for the summer of 1977.A spectacular case occurred on July 7, seen by many witnesses in the Zhang PoCounty of Fujian Province. This is in the south, across the water from Taiwan.At about 8:30 p.m., nearly 3,000 people were watching an outdoor screening of amovie, when the crowd saw two orange luminous objects, a mere ten feet apartfrom each other, descend toward them. These objects passed so low that they were“almost scraping the ground.” Although perfectly silent, they emitted anintensely bright light and gave off heat as they passed over the crowd. Theobjects then ascended rapidly and disappeared within ten seconds. The sightingcaused panic and a stampede: two children died and 200 others were injured.Although authorities initially suspected an optical illusion somehow connectedto the film, they determined this was not so. No explanation was ever given.ccxcv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1846688] Dong reported another UFO encounter from an unspecified date that year,involving what appears to be the same type of object in the same region, thistime directly involving the Chinese military. On the country’s southeasternshore, people saw a luminous globe approach silently from the direction ofTaiwan, fly over the mainland, and come down to rest on a hill. A nearbygarrison was alerted, and a company of 150 soldiers surrounded the hill. Thecaptain assumed the object was a secret American weapon. As the troopsapproached, it became extremely bright and gave off a “fearful noise.” Thecaptain ordered his men to fire, but bullets had no effect. The object rose offthe ground, “lighting up the whole vicinity.” Within twenty seconds, it wasgone. ccxcvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1847009] Many of these Chinese sightings were reported in local newspapers andended up in CIA files. ccxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1847196] As reportingand collection methods improved in the next few years, their numbers continuedto increase.In August, in South America, Brazil began experiencing a dramatic spate ofsightings, including many close encounters which extended into 1978. Reportscame from at least 30 villages at the mouth of the Amazon River, near theAtlantic coast. Years later, UFO researchers Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luceinvestigated these. One of their contacts, a retired Brazilian Air ForceLieutenant Colonel named Uyrange Hollanda, told them an extraordinary story. Atabout 7 p.m. one evening in late 1977, a large disc-shaped object simplyappeared directly above him and his men at an altitude of about 150 feet. Therehad been no warning whatsoever. He and his men were terrified. The object had apulsating yellow glow and sounded “like an air conditioner.” At its center weresmall yellow and orange lights; these eventually became light blue, and thendimmed. The object then disappeared toward the sea “with incredible speed.”Hollanda went to the commander of the base in Belem for instructions on what todo. He was given a team of technicians, photographers and other specialists toassist him in a classified investigation. They spent four months in Colares,Baia do Sol, and other villages north of Belem, interviewing nearly 300 peoplewho had claimed to have had close encounters. In dozens of cases, people hadbeen burned by UFOs, with at least two fatalities being reported. The teamitself saw strange lights “almost every night” during the investigation. Theytook many photographs, none of which turned out well. “I had no proof of theflying saucers,” Hollanda told Pratt and Luce, “only my visual information.” Hedescribed several types of UFOs: domed, discs (with windows), triangular,rectangular, pyramid-like, jetliner-like, and a huge mother-ship craft. Some ofthe objects were seen leaving the water. Hollanda stated that some peoplereported seeing occupants in the objects, usually four to five feet tall,although on two occasions the beings were taller and looked ordinary.Hollanda turned in his reports and never saw them again. Nobody ever followed upwith him, although after one of his queries he was told the reports were beingkept indefinitely and he was ordered to “keep quiet.” For several months afterhis official investigation ended, he continued to look into the matterprivately. Hollanda said the U.S. Air Force was “interested” in the sightings,and several times he quietly met with American military attachés over drinks todiscuss his investigation.Although Pratt and Luce could not confirm the full scope of Hollanda’s story,Pratt did speak to an area doctor who confirmed UFO-related fatalities from1977. In 2004, documents from the Brazilian Air Force’s secret service revealedsome of the records of the 1977 investigation. The report, called OperationSaucer, was partially released to the public, although the public portion didnot offer any conclusions regarding the events of 1977. It is noteworthy that astory so amazing has found at least some corroboration via officially releaseddocuments. More research remains to confirm the details fully. ccxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1847433] The Return and Departure of Mr. AxelrodWithin the United States, the first half of 1977 was something of a “slowseason” for UFOs. The most striking event, moreover, was not even an officialreport, but the final chapter in the saga of remote viewer Ingo Swann and themysterious Mr. Axelrod.Swann spent much of that summer at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) inMenlo Park, California, where Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ managed the remoteviewing program, and where Alfred Webre was trying to establish hisextraterrestrial communications proposal. One Friday in July, Axelrod wassomehow able to enter the secured facility. To say the least, this was not aneasy thing to do. He thereupon found Swann and convinced him to leave with him.They took a Lear jet from the San Jose Airport, accompanied by “the twins” – asSwann described Alexrod’s two blond-haired, blue-eyed, military-lookingassistants. The four flew up the west coast to where Swann believed was in theAlaskan wilderness, although Axelrod would not say (“it’s better that you notknow.”) They found a landing area deep in the forest, seemingly for their ownuse, got out and trekked for a long time, finally settling in to camp for thenight. The twins wore special goggles over their eyes, while Axelrod instructedSwann simply to observe. They came to a small lake, and Axelrod said that asdawn approached, Swann would be able to see “it” through the pines. “We now waitand hope we are lucky. Say nothing, do not make any noise.... they detect heat,noise, motion like mad.”Dawn arrived, and Swann saw a fog developing over the lake. This went on forfive minutes, until the fog developed a luminous neon-blue color. Then,according to Swann, the color changed to an “angry purple.” Axelrod and one ofthe twins each placed a hand firmly on Swann’s shoulders while “a network ofpurple, red, and yellow lightning bolts shot in all crazy directions through the‘cloud’.” Swann said he would have jumped if the two had not held him down. Hesaw an object, almost transparent at first, but then “solidly visible over thelake.” It was triangular or diamond-shaped, growing in size. Swann, in terrorand amazement, heard a strong wind moving past, rustling the pine trees so muchthat some cones and branches fell on them. The object then began to shoot out“ruby red laser-like beams” as it continued to grow even more in size whilemaintaining its position over the lake. Very quietly, one of the twins said,“Shit! They’re enveloping the area. They’re going to spot us.”As Swann later recalled the event, some of the red laser beams from the objectwere “blasting” pine trees, and he could hear low frequency pulsations. Axelrodwhispered to Swann that the beams were probably honing in on deer or otherforest creatures, as they sense biological body heat. “They’re sure to hone inon us,” he told Swann. Just then, one of the twins literally lifted and draggedSwann away, but not before Swann noticed the water of the lake surging upward,“like a waterfall going upward, as if being sucked into the ‘machine.’” The fourran quickly and at great length, sustaining minor cuts and bruises. Eventuallythey stopped, breathing hard, and waited for more than thirty minutes, until oneof the twins said all was clear.Axelrod then asked Swann whether he could ‘sense’ anything from the craft. Swannburst out laughing. “You’re completely nuts, Axel! I have to be calm, cool,collected, and in good shape to sense anything.” But Swann offered the insightthat the craft was “a drone of some kind, unmanned, controlled from somewhereelse.” Axelrod asked him what it was doing there, to which Swann replied “Well,for chrissakes! It was thirsty! Taking on water, obviously. Someone, somewhereneeds water ... so I suppose they just come and get it. You don’t need to be apsychic to see that.” Essentially, said Swann, “they” treated Earth as theneighborhood supermarket.Before taking Swann back, Axelrod said, “I shouldn’t tell you, but our missionwill be disbanded shortly and the work picked up by others, because of strategicsecurity reasons involved ...” “Others,” said Swann, “who will not mix in withpsychics, I take it.” “You got it,” Axelrod replied. Swann last saw Axelrod atthe San Jose Airport, and never heard from him again. ccxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1847805] For years, Swann told no one of his encounters with Axelrod. He hadsigned no secrecy agreement; Axelrod had simply asked him to keep silence for atleast ten years. During the 1990s, Swann recounted his experiences in theself-published book, Penetration . Although it will be impossible to prove theveracity of his extraordinary claims, the reader should be mindful of Swann’srecord of service, the documented accuracy of his predictions about Jupiter, therespect he earned from those who knew him, and the fact that none of hiscolleagues ever expressed doubt over the truth of his story. A Global Aerial CrescendoAs 1977 progressed, Britain, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the United Statesgenerated the most and best UFO cases. On the night of August 3-4, three controltower employees at Naples Airport saw a circular UFO giving off intense whitelight. The report was declassified two years later by the Italian government.ccc [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1847956] On August28, shortly after midnight, a large object with lights was seen near Windermere,Cumbria. For more than twenty minutes, British police and citizens observed it,which resembled “the shape of a stingray fish,” apparently triangular in shape.It flew slowly at about 1,500 feet altitude, hovering at times. All witnessesdescribed it as silent, except one person who heard a “quiet hum.” ccci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1848122] In the earlyfall, an anonymous British police officer in Sussex saw a UFO on a bright daywhile off duty and waiting for a bus. The object looked like a domed saucer, hadthe look of polished metal, was green-greyish in color, and had a blue-greenlight on top. She saw a thick black circular section on the bottom of the craft,and heard no sound. She waved to the object, which then came closer. Her memoryseemed unclear after this, but when the bus arrived, she felt numb anduncoordinated. The object was gone, and she had unaccountably lost twentyminutes of time. cccii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1848283] During theevening of September 30, a large and silent triangular craft was seen in Britainby a witness near Newington, who described “two very bright white beams, likeheadlights, [which] emanated from the object.” ccciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1848442] Quiet during most of 1977, the U.S. suddenly experienced a flurry ofstrange aviation encounters, primarily in the American West. One case occurrednear Billings, Montana on September 4, when a commercial pilot reported seeing aglowing oval object. Two more unusual incidents were reported on September 22.One was over El Paso, Texas, when a pilot saw an object overtake his airliner,make a 90-degree turn, and soar away straight up. The other occurred in Omaha,Nebraska, when four radar controllers tracked a large, extremely fast formationof large objects. “We kept watching these things,” a controller said, “and theywere gone from our scope in less than a minute.” He calculated their speed to bean astonishing 17,000 mph. ccciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1848601] Behind the dreaded ‘iron curtain,’ Soviet citizens were seeing UFOsthroughout the year. Some of these cases were reported in the West by JacquesVallee and later by Paul Stonehill, occasionally lacking specific dates or otherdesirable details. The most important Soviet case of 1977 took place near theFinnish border on September 20. Military personnel at Petrozavodsk saw a largeobject glowing in the sky at 4 a.m. For fifteen minutes it showered down beamsof light, giving the effect of a downpour of rain. It then moved west towardFinland. At least 170 people saw this phenomenon, including police, navypersonnel, pilots, and scientists. Troops and police found that their radiofrequencies were jammed and their telephones did not work. The phenomenon wasobserved for 10-12 minutes. Somehow, typical Soviet censorship broke down, andIzvestia described the event in detail.Because of the inexplicable and dramatic nature of the encounter, as well as thenationwide publicity it received, it was impossible to ignore. In October,representatives of the Soviet Academy of Sciences met with Kremlin officials. Ameeting was held in the Kremlin, the result of which was to organize a studyprogram of “paranormal phenomena” with participation of the Soviet military. By1978 this would evolve into two parallel UFO research programs: Setka-MO, run bythe Ministry of Defense, and Setka-AN, run by the Academy of Sciences.It was later pointed out that the Petrozavodsk event coincided with the firingof a Kosmos 955 satellite and its carrier rocket, Vostok, launched from thePlesetsk Cosmodrome. That might appear to explain it. Yet, as so often happenswith UFOs, matters were not that simple. Unusual and bright objects were seenover a vast area in the northwestern Soviet Union. Several hours before thelaunch, for instance, a disc-shaped UFO was reported by pilots of an airplanebound for Riga, who had to maneuver their aircraft to avoid a collision. Inanother instance that night a spherical object about 65 feet in diameter wasseen to land on a hill along the Petrozavodsk-Leningrad highway, and then vanishfrom view. At the western edge of Lake Lagoda, near Leningrad, a witness saw aUFO that emitted a bright sphere which landed in the forest and gave off abright glow. Another witness, employed as a scientist and writer, saw severalUFOs through a telescope that night, one of which hovered, turned around, thendisappeared. At 3:30 a.m. (thirty minutes before the launch), two very large,glowing spherical objects were seen maneuvering in the sky over the town ofPrimorsk. This is about 700 miles southwest of Petrozavodsk. The objects movedtoward Onezhsky Lake, hovered, then vanished at great speed. Soviet UFOresearcher Felix Zigel compiled data from the many sightings of that night andearly morning, and determined that the Petrozavodsk sighting was only one ofmany which occurred within a huge region between Denmark and Mongolia. Zigelconcluded that neither natural phenomena nor human technology were responsiblefor most of these sightings. cccv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1848846]Still, not everyone believed there was a mystery here. In a jointly authoredpaper, two former Soviet government officials involved in the Setka programsargued that “a number of additional effects accompanying this phenomenon [were]connected with the failure in launching a ballistic rocket. The launching of therocket took place in the same region and almost at the same time” as the strangephenomena. Unfortunately, no further detail was offered in their explanation. Itwould seem odd that a rocket launch could jam radios and interfere withtelephones. cccvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1849144]One other Soviet account from 1977, officially unconfirmed, remains suggestiveafter many years, and was said to have involved a submarine repair ship. OnOctober 7, the Volga was at sea when nine disc-shaped objects circled around itfor nearly 20 minutes. During this time, all electronic equipment on the shipwent “berserk.” The Captain, named Tarantin, told his men, “I want you toobserve this carefully and to remember it. I want you to take pictures and drawit, so that when we return to the Soviet Union no one will be able to say thatyour captain was drunk or crazy.” According to Jacques Vallee, who wrote aboutthe event, the report was either classified or never made public. cccvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1849419] Italian and American cases dominated the final months of the year. OnOctober 27, an air traffic controller at Cagliari-Elmas airport in Sardinia,stated that he saw a UFO that flew at the speed of a jet, “at some 926 kph.” Theobject was behind a helicopter that was participating in military maneuvers.According to an Italian military report, the sighting caused a feverish exchangeof messages among personnel at Elmas, the NATO base in Decimomannu, the USaircraft carrier Saratoga , and several military planes in flight. Some fighterplanes also saw the UFO at the very low altitude of 500 meters for severalminutes. cccviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1849636]"},{"pageContent":" In late October or early November, Italian Air Corps helicopter pilotMajor Francesco Zoppi and his co-pilot were on a training mission when theyencountered a bright orange circle ahead of them, matching their speed. Otherhelicopters in the squadron saw the object, although it was not detected onradar. It then vanished at “a speed impossible for any aircraft of this world toequal.” The story leaked to the press, although many details were not provided.cccix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1849807] Meanwhile, in the United States more aerial close encounters were beingreported. Flying through Texas on October 26 between Abilene and Dallas at19,000 feet, the pilot and passenger of a small aircraft saw a bright, red,stationary sphere straight ahead of them. As they closed on the object, theplane’s navigation instruments become erratic and the radio stopped working. Thesphere then changed its color from red to white, performed a high speed verticalclimb, and vanished into space. According to the pilot, “as soon as the sphereleft we got all of our radio gear back. Our navigation came back, and we wereoff course.” A two-man crew of an Air Force T-38 flying in the same area alsosaw the object. According to that pilot, “the bright red glowing object ...appeared to be closing very rapidly.” They considered an evasive maneuver, butthe closing ceased. One Air Force crew member experienced considerable staticover his headset at the time. cccx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1849962] Over the next month or two, similar occurrences were reported in thecentral and western U.S. On November 18, the pilot of a small aircraft flying atnight between Vichy and Troy, Missouri noticed a bright white light quickly movealongside him, pace his aircraft for three minutes, then rapidly move away. Oneof his transponders stopped working during those minutes, then resumed normaloperation. cccxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1850157] On December 8, two UFO sightings occurred near Oxnard, California. At 8p.m., air traffic controllers tracked four unidentified objects about three tofive miles north of Laguna Peak. “We watched the targets on the scope for nearlythree hours,” said one controller. The speed and maneuverability of the objectscaused one controller to remark, “I’ve never seen anything like this in all thetwenty years that I have worked as an air traffic controller.” At around 9 p.m.,while the controllers were still tracking the UFOs, a Golden West commuteraircraft was flying from Oxnard to Los Angeles International Airport when twolarge, bright lights maneuvered around it for 15 minutes. The speed andmaneuverability of these objects was described as extraordinary. “Like you wouldjust snap your fingers and it was there,” said the commercial pilot. “It got soclose it scared the hell out of me.” cccxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1850353] On December 17, at 3:34 a.m., radar facilities in Colorado and SouthDakota tracked two UFOs that gave “strong” and “unmistakable” returns, moving atthe fighter-jet speed of over 1,000 mph. The objects were tracked for the next30 minutes, during which time one of the objects made a close head-on pass at anaircraft in the area. A third radar station was unable to function while theunknowns were in the area, and one of the two operational facilities was put outof service when the main shaft holding the radar antenna was severely bent by anunexplained force. cccxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1850550] The last interesting American UFO encounter of 1977 took place on December 27,a radar-visual case involving a police helicopter in Charlotte, North Carolina.At 10:54 p.m., a crew of two police officers on a routine helicopter patrol wereflying over Charlotte at 1,800 feet above sea level when they noticed two lightsapproaching from the northwest. The officers assumed these to be landing lightsof some aircraft or helicopter. But the lights continued to close on theirposition, and two minutes later shocked the officers by passing just 200 feetover them. The helicopter’s pilot, Ron Garey, asked the FAA control towerwhether they were painting any radar targets in the area. FAA operatorsconfirmed two unknowns. The police officers assumed they had just encounteredmilitary helicopters heading for Fort Bragg.Moments later, the officers again saw two lighted objects approaching them. Asif to make a point, one of them shot upward at a 45 degree angle to an estimated4,000 feet within three seconds (roughly 450 mph). The other light continued toapproach at 1,800 feet altitude. Garey executed a “pedal turn” to the left asthe object passed by. This is a pivot maneuver made in a stationary hover, andallowed for a closer inspection of the object as it passed by. Incredibly, as hedid this, the object made a radial turn around the helicopter, and the two menlost sight of it. Garey then turned the helicopter to the right, and bothofficers saw that the object was right behind them. Again, Garey turned thehelicopter to get a better view, and again the object outmaneuvered him.The officers realized they were encountering something very unusual. As theyobserved the object more carefully, it appeared to be a globular white lightwith a surrounding glow. Sparks were falling away from it, and the officers alsonoticed a silver parachute-like object attached to the light source, with somesort of transparent section in-between. The object began to move away to theeast, and the officers briefly gave chase, although it quickly outdistanced themand disappeared. At 11:02 p.m., FAA tower controller Ray Bader advised the crewthat the second unknown was over the downtown area. A minute later, the pilotssaw the object visually, but almost immediately it vanished – visually and onthe radar scope. Thus ended the extremely bizarre aerial encounter.MUFON investigators George D. Fawcett, P. Wayne Laporte, Henry H. Morton Jr.,and David M. Oldham studied this case in detail. There was an initial claim bylocal students that the objects were candle-lit balloons they had launched, andthat the unusual movements were due to the wind currents caused by thehelicopter rotors. The winds also caused the candle lights to blow out, claimedthe students, which would explain why one of the objects seemed to disappear. Totest this theory, the investigators launched the same type of balloon andconferred with individuals who had experience in military radar, balloonlaunchings, helicopters, and jet interception. The student explanation fellshort for many reasons. First, it was determined that balloons would not havebeen whipped around by the helicopter rotors, but sucked in. Second, the balloonhad no metal in its construction and could not have shown up on radar. Third,the horizontal speeds (over 200 mph) and altitude changes (even greater) of theunknown objects vastly exceeded the capabilities of a hot-air balloon. Theinvestigators concluded the police officers had encountered a genuine UFO.cccxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1850748]As 1977 turned into 1978, aerial encounters showed no sign of abating. 1978started off with a clear sighting on New Year’s Day by a reliable witness. FloydHallstrom, an experienced airplane and helicopter pilot, was flying a Cessna 178from Oxnard, California to San Diego. He was following a friend, Jim Victor, andthe two maintained radio contact. Visibility was excellent as he approachedSanta Monica, when he saw an object above the airport in Los Angeles. He thoughtthis was Victor, until the object rapidly approached him. Seeing no wings on it,he wondered if it was a helicopter, but its speed was too fast (he laterestimated it at 650 mph). When it passed below him and to his left, he saw itclearly as “the complete form of a saucer shape or round object.” There were 16to 20 equally spaced windows around its circumference. For all its speed, theobject was very steady, showing no sign of rotation or oscillation. It washighly polished and the sun reflected brightly off it. He immediately radioedVictor, then FAA authorities. The case reached the attention of various UFOgroups, and was investigated by Lt. Colonel Robert F. Bowker USAF (Ret). It wasnever made clear whether the object was seen on radar. cccxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1850962] Citizens Against UFO SecrecyThe year 1978 opened with a salvo intended to crack the wall of UFO secrecy: theformation of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS). Led by W. Todd Zechel, thegroup focused on using FOIA lawsuits to obtain UFO documents. The grouppublished an official newsletter, Just Cause . CAUS was essentially a three- manshow: Zechel, Brad Sparks, and attorney Peter Gersten, who had met Zechel whenthey worked for Ground Saucer Watch. The three were optimistic. “We had servedthe government notice,” Zechel later recalled. “We weren’t going to take theirstonewalling anymore, and if necessary, we would haul them into court.” cccxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1851217] During Januaryand February, CAUS filed requests with the State Department for classified UFOdocuments, receiving the reply that nothing could be found. Eventually, afterrepeatedly providing highly specific information regarding the desireddocuments, CAUS received several. Barry Greenwood, who later joined CAUS, saidthat “it seemed that the only way to get documents released was to have them inthe first place so that one could mail them back to the agency as proof thatthey existed.” cccxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1851479] Other researchers petitioned the U.S. government for documents.Greenwood was independently requesting from many agencies. Early in 1978, hereceived FOIA request replies from the FBI and the Department of Defense. TheFBI told him that it did not investigate UFOs other than during a limited timein the 1940s, while the DoD told him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff hadidentified 24 UFO-related documents which complied with his request. Upon hisreceipt of these documents, he noticed that several of them included the CIA ontheir distribution list. The only problem was that the Agency was stillinsisting that its involvement with UFOs ended with the Robertson Panel in 1953.cccxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1851659] BruceMaccabee had better luck with the FBI. By 1978, he had already netted severalhundred pages of UFO related data from the bureau, and would eventually receiveabout 1,000. Although the documents did not prove the existence of aliens, theyindicated strong FBI interest in many sightings, and also proved that the FBIhad lied to the public about this interest. cccxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1851843] In early June, Peter Gersten, on behalf of Ground Saucer Watch, filed adiscovery motion requesting UFO information from CIA files. His motion consistedof 635 interrogatory questions, almost 300 requests for documents, and included60 CIA documents attached as exhibits. These questions were specific enough, itwas assumed, that the CIA would either have to produce the documents beingrequested or acknowledge that their UFO information was classified. There was noreason to expect the CIA simply to roll over – the Agency had been contestingsuch motions for months already. cccxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1852138] Thus, it wassomewhat of a surprise when the CIA announced in August that it had found “1,000pages of additional material related to UFOs” which would be available forrelease. Soon after this, the Agency indicated it had found more than 10,000 UFOrelated documents in its files. Zechel immediately filed another suit with theCIA, Air Force, and other agencies. There was a hope that enough evidence couldbe brought forth to force a disclosure of the reality of UFOs. Perhaps militaryofficers and government officials could be compelled to testify under oath abouttheir knowledge of UFOs. Perhaps these might even lead to admissions about therecovery of an extraterrestrial vehicle and beings. In 1978, it all seemedpossible, and that one disclosure could lead to others. cccxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1852325]In November, the CIA inadvertently leaked the existence of NSA-related UFOdocuments, when it referred 15 documents (soon three more) to that agency fordeclassification review. cccxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1852606] On December22, Gersten filed a FOIA request on behalf of CAUS for 18 NSA documents. The NSAreplied that it was exempt from FOIA. Undeterred, several months later CAUSexpanded its request to include all NSA documents “relating to or pertaining tounidentified flying objects and the UFO phenomena.” This began the David andGoliath saga, CAUS vs. the NSA, which would be played out over several years.cccxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1852786] The Crash Retrieval SyndromeAlong with researchers making FOIA requests, Leonard Stringfield continued to bea key driver of UFO research in 1978, while Stanton Friedman made a discoverythat had a major impact on ufology.In January, while lecturing in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Friedman met the managerof a local television station who recommended that he meet a man who had handledone of those “flying saucers way back then.” Friedman looked the man up in thephone book – this was retired colonel Jesse Marcel, Sr. During their firstmeeting, Marcel described to Friedman what has since become known as the RoswellIncident. As an intelligence officer at the 509th Bomber Unit at Roswell ArmyAir Field, Marcel was dispatched to retrieve wreckage from a flying disc. Whilehe did not see any bodies, he was astounded by the debris, which includedfoil-like material of incredible toughness, equally strong I-beams that lookedflimsy but could not be bent or broken, and which had strange hieroglyphic-likewriting on them. The fragments were transported to Roswell Army Air Field, thento Fort Worth, Texas, then to Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, for analysis. Whileat Fort Worth, said Marcel, he had to lie to the press and “told them we wererecovering a downed weather balloon.” He was “certain” the object was not aballoon, nor any type of aircraft or rocket.Friedman was skeptical of the story until UFO researcher William Moore found theJuly 1947 press release which said the Air Force had recovered a flying disc, aswell as a press release from three hours later claiming the object had been anordinary weather balloon. Friedman and Moore were intrigued. Before long, theyinterviewed almost 100 people who knew something about the event. Most of themhad not discussed the case in years. cccxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1852967] So began the Roswell story. It would be a few years before it became thedominant issue in UFO research, and then a world icon and symbol for the UFOcover-up. In 1978, hardly anyone outside of Friedman, Moore, and Stringfieldknew about it. For the moment, the greatest strides in research were still beingmade by Stringfield, who continued to develop new sources regarding other UFOcrash retrievals.In April, Stringfield was led to a former sergeant of the 97th Bomber Wing. Thisman had learned about crashed UFOs and occupants from an Air Force general whohappened to be the father of an old girlfriend. The general had relatedfirst-hand knowledge to the sergeant of a UFO crash retrieval in the Americansouthwest in 1957. With great difficulty, four burned and damaged humanoidbodies were recovered, along with the craft, and brought to Wright-PattersonAFB. The general saw the bodies in a deep freeze. The bodies were about fivefeet tall and the heads were large, although badly disfigured. The general alsoshowed the sergeant a Top Secret memo concerning an incident at Nellis AFB in1968. The sergeant told Stringfield that the memo described how for three days alarge UFO hovered over the base. Three small craft then came out, one of whichlanded. A colonel and security detachment came to meet it. In a scenereminiscent of the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still , a humanoid being cameout of the craft, described in the memo as “short and stocky.” Then things wentvery wrong: a beam of light paralyzed the colonel, the security team tried toshoot, but their weapons jammed. The being re-entered the UFO, which then joinedthe large craft and departed. The colonel was hospitalized and could later onlyrecall the event in terms of mathematics, as though an attempt of communicationwas conducted in this manner. Stringfield did manage to confirm the existence ofthe general. He even obtained “additional corroborative” information about theNellis incident, but did not say what that was. Like most of his collectedmaterial, the accounts remained suggestive but unproven. cccxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1853396] In July, he met with yet another witness to alien bodies atWright-Patterson AFB, a lead he obtained from his son-in-law. While working inmilitary intelligence, the man had seen nine dead aliens, four feet tall andpreserved in deep freeze conditions. He had been told that the base held a totalof 30 alien bodies along with an alien craft. Furthermore, he told Stringfieldthat certain military bases contained mobile units ready to retrieve downed orcrashed UFOs anywhere in the United States. Information about all militaryencounters with UFOs was stored on a computer within Wright-Patterson, andduplicate files were secretly stored elsewhere. “Get the complete file dump,” hetold Stringfield, “both the master and the support backup files, and you’ve gotall the hidden UFO data.” cccxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1853604] Thus far, Stringfield had not publicized his information. Mindful of howexplosive this material was, he wanted to be confident in his sources. Far frompopular media portrayals as ‘eccentric believers,’ most UFO researchers duringthe 1970s were fairly conservative. A 1978 survey of MUFON members by aerospaceengineer Walt Greenawald gave a good sense of the typical UFO researcher: awell-educated, upper-middle class, politically conservative, 40-somethingprofessional who had personally witnessed a UFO. Most believed thatextraterrestrials were at the heart of the UFO phenomenon, and that the U.S.government was still studying UFOs, despite official denials. cccxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1853819]Still, there are many gradations of such a belief. Some researchers argued thatthe U.S. military never really figured out what the phenomenon was all about, orelse was guilty of incompetence – essentially, a “foul up,” as Allen Hynek oftenclaimed. Others believed there was a genuine cover-up in which certain officialsbelieved there was something significant to UFOs, perhaps even that aliens wereresponsible, but held back the information for fear of upsetting the public. Butsomething as radical as UFO crash retrievals was typically dismissed out ofhand. It is true that quiet rumors had circulated for years. Richard Hallremarked that NICAP had received ten to fifteen leads about crashed UFOs duringthe 1950s and 1960s, but the organization never followed up. cccxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1854013] It tookStringfield’s research to stretch the boundaries of the belief in a cover-upinto the far more radical position that crafts and bodies had been recovered andwere being secretly studied. The implications were dramatic. It would mean theexistence of a very deep, very secret cover-up, and the attempted exploitationof the acquired technology.Stringfield finally dropped the bombshell of his research at the MUFONInternational Symposium at the end of July. Significantly, the symposium washeld that year in Dayton, Ohio, home to Wright-Patterson AFB. Stringfieldannounced that he had more than fifty sources with “information relative to thesubject of retrievals or storage of alien craft, and/or deceased alien humanoidsrecovered from the craft.” He presented seventeen witness testimonies to anastonished audience, which suggested perhaps nine or ten retrievals of crashedor downed UFOs.He well understood the implications of his research. “We must now take an honestlook at the old rumors,” Stringfield said. “We must also take a new look,” hecontinued,... at the possibility of a grand official cover-up and why. If any one of theretrieval incidents is true, or if only one of my informants is telling thetruth, then humankind is in for a shock.... if it is true that alien humanoidshave been retrieved and are held in a preserved state at one or more militaryinstallations, then our government ... will have to explain their policy ofprolonged secrecy. We may then rightly ask, what else is hidden about the UFO ofa more frightening nature? cccxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1854236] Some criticized Stringfield as being overly gullible, others weresuspicious of his unwillingness to name his informants. To be fair, confirmingevery lead was not within Stringfield’s means; he mainly sought to collect anddisseminate the information. He conceded that some of his sources could havebeen hoaxing him, but he believed most were legitimate. Some of his leads, hepointed out, came to him via initial research performed by other researchers.Eventually, some flaws were found in Stringfield’s sources, although none thatcaused serious damage to the basic structure of his research. “Wherever there’ssmoke there’s fire,” he said at the symposium, “and from my position I certainlycan see a hell of a lot of smoke.” Not surprisingly, Air Force representativesat Wright-Patterson denied knowledge of any of Stringfield’s allegations. cccxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1854585] Moving Toward a Breakout?It seemed as though the wall of UFO secrecy could well come down. Popular beliefin the phenomenon was on the rise. A Canadian-based Gallup poll in Februaryindicated that 57% of adult Americans believed UFOs were “real,” while 46% ofCanadians felt the same way. (Interestingly, back in 1966, only 46% of Americanshad believed UFOs were “real”). The highest levels of belief came from thosewith a college education and people under 30. Ten percent of the Canadianrespondents, and nine percent of the Americans, believed that they had seen aUFO. cccxxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1854743]Several American public figures were also willing to state their beliefs inpublic, such as Mercury Astronaut Gordon Cooper. In April, Cooper appeared onthe Merv Griffin television show, discussing what he believed to be credible UFOstories from government insiders. Griffin asked him about rumors of “occupant”stories, and whether “our government was able to keep one alive...” Cooperthought that was credible, and added that from what he had learned, they looked“no different” from ordinary humans. He did not say he had been formally briefedon the matter, rather that “there’s a good possibility that this thing exists.... it makes you wonder.” Not all of Cooper’s colleagues were supportive:astronauts Tom Stafford, Michael Collins, and Donald Slayton all denied hearingsuch stories. cccxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1855005]Another step in the direction of open government came on June 28, 1978, with thesigning of Executive Order 12065 by President Carter pertaining to the Freedomof Information Act. In part, this was to promote the democratic principle of apublic right-to-know, but Carter also felt that over-classification workedagainst genuine national security. Excessive classification of documents (aprocess known as “classification escalation”) had made government less efficientto the point where routine paperwork was becoming classified. Carter’s ExecutiveOrder not only sought to eliminate this problem, but also to shorten the waitfor declassification review to twenty years. The order contained a provisionrequiring that the public’s need to know be an acknowledged part of thedeclassification process. Courts reviewing documents for release under FOIA, inother words, had to consider the public’s interest. Finally, the burden of prooffell to the government agencies to demonstrate that releasing requestedinformation would be “clearly harmful.” These were new developments, andultimately assisted in the release of many UFO-related documents.There was one loophole: a restriction which pertained to “protection oflegitimate national security secrets.” Information that had “defenseimplications that possibly should be safe-guarded against immediate and fulldisclosure” would not be released. This had clear implications regarding UFOdata, much of which affected national security in some fashion. cccxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1855232] The situation still looked very good, however, when on December 15approximately 900 pages of CIA documents pertaining to UFOs were released underthe provisions of FOIA, due to the suit by CAUS and GSW. These were documentswhich the CIA had previously denied, but which attested to a thirty-yearinterest in UFOs. Amid the cache, however, Peter Gersten noticed that, based onreferences in the released documents, the CIA failed to disclose the existenceof 200 or more documents. It appeared that there were many thousands ofclassified pages of documents still within the CIA. The challenge was finding away to pry them out. cccxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1856107]Not only FOIA, but also the United Nations continued to offer a potential avenuefor a “breakout.” On November 27, 1978, the U.N. Special Political Committeeheld meetings on UFOs. Following on the initiative by Grenada Prime MinisterEric Gairy, the idea was to create a public, worldwide program to collect andanalyze data on UFOs, then to determine the best response. Some of the peoplewho provided statements were Allen Hynek, Jacques Vallee, Stanton Friedman, Lt.Colonel Lawrence Coyne, and astronaut Gordon Cooper. Cooper described his 1951encounter over Germany with “groups of metallic, saucer-shaped vehicles at greataltitudes.” His group had tried to get close to the objects, but they “were ableto change direction faster than our fighters.” Cooper said he believed UFOsexist, “and the truly unexplained ones are from some other technically advancedcivilization.” He also said that most astronauts were reluctant to discuss UFOs,but stated that several did believe in them, and that some had even seen them.The meetings concluded on December 8, resulting in U.N. Decision 33/426 relatingto the “establishment of an agency or a department of the United Nations forundertaking, coordinating and disseminating the results of research intounidentified flying objects and related phenomena.” It asked members to developscientific research and investigation programs into extraterrestrial life,including UFOs, and to report back to the U.N. This was a challenge to the U.N.as well as the Carter White House, but nothing tangible came from it. Then,rather abruptly, the whole initiative went dead in the water. On March 13, 1979,while Gairy was at the U.N. yet again to talk about UFOs, he was ousted in acoup d’etat by Maurice Bishop. That was the end of the Grenada UFO initiative.cccxxxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1856357] But at the end of 1978, there was even a hint of a congressional attemptto look into the UFO matter. Congressman Samuel S. Stratton (D-NY), Chairman ofthe Armed Services Investigations Subcommittee, had read about the 1975 UFOintrusions. On December 28, 1978, he expressed concern about “the allegedability of unknown aircraft to penetrate airspace and hover over SAC bases,their weapons storage areas, missile sites, and launch control facilities, andthe inability of Air Force equipment and personnel to intercept and identifysuch aircraft.” The subcommittee requested all reports relating to these and“any similar incidents.” A letter was sent to several Air Force groups. The AirForce Legislative Liaison replied on February 9, 1979 informing the Congressmanthat UFO reports were “of transitory interest to the Air Force and permanentfiles are not maintained.” Stratton’s interest in this matter was purelyregarding national defense, certainly not to play the UFO card. He was the onlymember of Congress who ever inquired into the UFO flyovers from 1975, and henever followed up on his inquiry. cccxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1856762] The Fort Dix - McGuire AFB IncidentWhat follows is one of the most intriguing of all UFO/ET cases. Considering theclaim, it is not surprising that it remains disputed after many decades. What ismore surprising is how strong the case continues to look. The claim is that analien being was shot and killed by U.S. military forces.The main witness, Jeffrey Morse (pseudonym), was a security policeman at McGuireAFB in New Jersey on January 18, 1978. At 3 a.m., he was notified about UFOactivity over the Fort Dix army base, which adjoined McGuire AFB. He learnedthat a non-human entity had been shot. A Fort Dix military policeman had beenpursuing a low flying UFO which had hovered over his car. A small being with alarge head and slender body then appeared in front of his car, causing the MP topanic and shoot the alien several times with a .45 automatic pistol.The being was able to get as far as a deserted runway at McGuire, where it died.Morse and a companion found the body, then cordoned off the area in accordancewith standard procedure. “Blue Beret” forces arrived to take over. Later thatday, a team from Wright-Patterson AFB arrived in a C-141 cargo aircraft and tookthe body. Two days later, Morse was summoned to Wright-Patterson AFB andinterrogated about the event. He was warned to keep quiet and shortly thereafterwas transferred to Okinawa, Japan. Other colleagues of Morse who witnessed theevent in some fashion were also transferred.Morse contacted Leonard Stringfield in 1980, who interviewed him in person andby phone, as did Richard Hall. Both found him credible – in Hall’s words,“completely credible.” As the two men put it, “skepticism about crash/retrievalreports may be fully justified and entirely understandable on the part of UFO‘believers’ and ‘disbelievers’ alike – unless they have met Jeff Morse ....”Morse said he was harassed and threatened by officials for having discussed thematter. In 1987 he met again with Hall and Stringfield, as well as members ofthe Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), an organization established to providefunding for UFO research and investigations. Other FUFOR members attending wereBruce Maccabee, William H. Hall (brother of Richard), and Dr. John B. Carlson.All were impressed by Morse’s straightforwardness and lack of embellishment.cccxxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1856926] USAF Major George Filer, who worked at McGuire AFB at the time, corroboratedMorse’s claims. Filer was Deputy Director of Intelligence for the 21st AirForce, which included about 300 aircraft that were used for military troopcarrying missions, a portion of which flew the President and other dignitaries.On the day of the incident, Filer arrived at the base at 4:00 a.m. As he drovethrough the main gate at McGuire, he noticed red lights on the runway andassumed something was going on, but gave the matter little attention until hearrived at the 21st Air Force Command Post. The Head of the Command Post toldhim it had been a very exciting evening, with UFOs flying over McGuire “allnight.” One had apparently landed or crashed at Fort Dix. A military policemancame upon an alien and shot it, the officer said. When Filer heard the word“alien,” he replied, “a foreigner? That kind of alien?” “No,” came the reply,“an alien from outer space.”According to the officer, the creature had run away after being wounded, climbed(or went under) the fence between the two bases, and headed for McGuire, whereit died on the runway. Security police secured the body and were guarding it,and a C-141 from Wright-Patterson AFB was en route to acquire the body. Filerrecalled being surprised that Wright-Patterson had C-141s, and even moresurprised to learn that he was to give a standup briefing on the incident to theBase Commander later that morning. “You want me to tell General Tom Sadler andeverybody in the command post that we captured an alien?” he askedincredulously. Yes, came the answer.Filer contacted the 38th Military Airlift Wing Command Post to see whether theyreceived the same story. Yes, they had: an alien was found on the base, theytold Filer. He spoke to different colonels in the command post and intelligenceservice who told him they had heard the same story. Like him, they had not seenthe alien, but believed the story to be true. He also received a call thatmorning from “this sergeant who allegedly was there.” In fact, this was JeffreyMorse. The sergeant said he was “pretty sure” it was an alien – “a small person,not of this Earth.” The head was disproportionately large compared to a humanhead. Morse sounded very frightened to Filer.Filer readied himself to brief the General, but later that morning learned itwas not to be. No one ever said anything to him other than, “Don’t brief theGeneral.” Later that morning, however, while he was at the General’s office, henoticed extra activity taking place, including security police personnel whowere looking very disheveled. This was highly unusual, as the General was astickler for proper military attire. Filer assumed the commotion had somethingto do with the incident from that morning. cccxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1857252] During the 1980s, an incident report appeared which briefly described theevent. It is unclear how it surfaced, but it was dated January 18, 1978 andmentioned “reports of UFO sightings over the base and an incident in progress onthe Fort Dix installation.” Furthermore, the document stated that “one body ofunknown origin released to the care of OSI District Commander and SpecialRecovery team from Wright-Pat AFB.”The National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) examined the story,searching for corroborating witnesses and documentation. The organizationconfirmed that Morse had worked as an E-4 (sergeant) at McGuire AFB, but couldnot find him. They interviewed General Sadler, the security police commander onduty that night, the AFOSI detachment commander, the 21st Air-Force commander,and the individual said to have interrogated Morse. All denied any knowledge ofthe incident. NIDS also consulted a retired senior member of the 438th securitypolice squadron regarding the Incident Report. He said there were seven distinctdiscrepancies, which led him to believe the form “was probably a forgery.”NIDS’s “working hypothesis” was therefore that the event did not happen, and mayin fact have been a hoax. The organization conceded that being unable to locateMorse was a “major deficiency” in the investigation, and it avoided a finalconclusion on the case, pending further revelations. NIDS disbanded a few yearslater. What is astonishing is that the organization did not bother to interviewFiler, whose statements on the event were well known.NIDS’s conclusion, provisional though it may have been, was premature and naive,based on the fact that military personnel who had taken secrecy oaths (accordingto Morse and Filer) would not admit to the shooting of an alien being. Questionsabout the legitimacy of the document are valid, but the opinion of one (U.S.military) expert cannot possibly be expected to be the final word. Despite somefine work on other investigations, NIDS bungled this one. cccxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1857542] Spring SightingsMany UFO sightings were occurring in the north central U.S. During February andMarch 1978, unknown objects were seen in Detroit. Several sightings occurredvery low, inside airport fence lines, mostly at night. One witness, Dr. HarryWillnus, believed these UFOs were using the airport as a “hiding place,”camouflaged by the many lights typically seen at busy airports at night. cccxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1857798] In Minnesota,in addition to visual sightings of disc-shaped objects, cccxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1857938] an interestingradar case took place on February 19. At 1:20 p.m. (the exact location was notprovided), radar operators on two separate systems tracked a large UFO. When oneoperator obtained “a good solid signal,” he put the radar on manual in order tofocus on the target. As he did so, “the thing started going up rapidly.” Hefollowed it with his radar, and the object stopped, then descended. In hiswords, the object “appeared to be taking evasive action.” He stated the objecttraveled 5,000 feet (about a mile) in less than one second, and moved in avertical direction “instantaneously.” cccxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1858104] Another case took place that spring which, like the Fort Dix-McGuire AFBincident, hinted at serious conflict between UFOs and U.S. military forces. Whatis known is that on March 27, 1978, within a nine hour period (1) an F-14 Tomcatfighter plane went out of control and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 50 mileswest of San Diego; and (2) a nearby S-3A anti-submarine aircraft exploded andcrashed into the sea. The next day, a college instructor and shipping companyowner were talking on the phone when their line was interrupted by anotherconversation. Both heard what appeared to be a briefing given to a General,although they could only hear the one party, who said:... same footprints as before ... one spotting, Palm Springs, eight in threemonths ... they dug 8 feet down, everything in the area was dead ... they had iton radar for less than 2 seconds to touchdown ... they don’t know who they areor where they’re from ... they told the news media that it was a meteor ...Miramar lost three planes. Everything in the planes went haywire in the samepart of the stratosphere ... General Kelley is on his way out tomorrow.The UFO Report Center of Orange County followed up, found both men credible, andobtained nothing from any government agency about this event. CAUS located oneof the downed pilots, who said the accident was being attributed to “amalfunction unique to the Skyhawk.” cccxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1858302]There are two General Kelleys to which the conversation might have referred. Lt.General Robert E. Kelley at the time was vice commander, U.S. Air Force TacticalAir Warfare Center, Eglin Air Force Base, in Florida. Shortly after thisincident, he became commander of Tactical Training at Davis-Monthan Air ForceBase, then took command of the U.S. Air Force Tactical Fighter Weapons Center atNellis Air Force Base. Another possibility is Lt. General John R. Kelly, Jr.Near retirement in 1978, he was assigned to the Pentagon as assistant deputychief of staff, systems and logistics. One an expert in fighter tactics, theother assigned to the Pentagon, both had a plausible reason for overseeing theaftermath of the event.Thus, in early 1978, there appeared to be a distinct possibility that the U.S.military and UFO operators were not getting along especially well. The Bell Island ExplosionThe bizarre explosion at Bell Island, Newfoundland, on Sunday morning, April 2must be added to the list of mysterious events for 1978, although notnecessarily UFO-related. The explosion damaged several houses and electricalwires, scorched trees, and even caused television sets to explode. It was heard60 miles away. Witnesses said they saw balls of fire in the sky descending overthe island, along with “streaks of super bright silvery-white light.” Twocup-shaped holes about two feet deep and three feet wide marked the majorimpact. Initial suggestions by the U.S. military and others included balllightning, sonic boom, meteorite, or even “the volatility of the air itself,”but a U.S. Defense Memo gave these little credence. Nor were “atomic explosions”or “flying saucers” the answer, the memo stated, although “high performanceaircraft” were indicated as a possibility. Six weeks earlier, there had alsobeen an unexplained boom over Nova Scotia. Attempts to correlate the events withthe Concorde supersonic aircraft were “not conclusive,” according to the DIAmemo.The Bell Island flash was so intense that it was captured by an American Velasatellite, which registered it as a “potential nuclear blast,” and tworepresentatives from a weapons laboratory at Los Alamos arrived to investigate.Despite this, Canadian authorities suggested that lightning had struck atransformer and that the energy followed the wires to neighboring houses. Inlater years, researchers suggested secret electromagnetic pulse weapons, eitherSoviet or American, as the answer to the mystery. These would involve highenergy beams focused into the ionosphere, perhaps along the lines of the HighAltitude Auroral Research Program (HAARP), although HAARP did not officiallybegin until the 1990s. There has never been a satisfactory explanation for theBell Island explosion. cccxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1858487] U.S. Military UFO Sightings in 1978A more obviously UFO-related incident occurred on May 14, 1978. At 10 p.m., aresident near Ocala, Florida, telephoned the Pinecastle Electronic Warfare RangeTracking Station in Jackson, asking whether they were shooting flares. The dutyofficer, Robert Clark, said they were not, nor were there any Navy aircraft out.Soon after, Clark took another call about a UFO. This one was being seen bymultiple witnesses, described as an elongated flying object about fifty feet indiameter, “almost the color of the Moon” and with an intensely bright flashinglight at its center.It was now 11 p.m. “So we got out the binoculars and went up on the tower,”Clark said. To the north about three miles away they saw a stationary cluster ofglowing lights at roughly 1,500 feet altitude. They appeared to be attached to asingle object. It took twenty minutes to warm up the track radar. At 11:20 p.m.,radar locked on to the target. Then, after fifteen minutes, it abruptly vanishedfrom both sight and radar. “We locked in on it,” said Clark, “and then all of asudden it was gone.” Navy radar technician, Timothy Collins, said, “I’ve neverseen anything like it. And I don’t want to see anything like it again.” Fiveminutes after the object disappeared, at 11:40 p.m., the same or a similarobject appeared 15 degrees to the north. After a short while it disappearedsuddenly. Then, near midnight, another object appeared, demonstrating incredibleacceleration, deceleration, and hairpin turns. These events were seen visually,but this time radar could not track the objects. “The computer wouldn’t handleit,” said Lt. Commander John Sullivan, Commander of the Range.All in all, about a dozen Navy personnel had seen some or all of this activity,much of which was described in the International Herald Tribune. According toStonor, the Navy investigated, but came to no conclusions, at least nothingpublic. Allen Hendry of CUFOS also investigated, calling it a case of “highmerit.” CSICOP members Philip Klass and Robert Sheaffer each wrote piecesdebunking the sighting. Klass argued that the radar tracking was “ambiguous”;Sheaffer argued that the planets Venus and Jupiter, and then later the starCapella, caused the mistaken visuals. Hendry replied that the radar tracking was“an unambiguous ... confirmation” of the visual sighting, and that Venus andJupiter were in the wrong position in the sky. cccxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1858875]A month later, on June 11, another Navy UFO incident occurred, this time in NewShrewsbury, New Jersey at the U.S. Naval Ammunition Depot, Naval Weapons StationEarle. At 11:28 p.m., Gunnery Sergeant Brininger and Private First Class Johnsonwere on duty outside an 80 foot tall tower, when they saw a “distinctly-outlinedilluminated white ball with a short conical tail behind it.” They saw itinitially near the horizon to the south, but within five seconds it moved westof their position, and elevated its position to 30 degrees above the horizon.Brininger later said he thought the object was only 300 feet away and about 200feet off the ground. He turned on a Navy spotlight nearby and swung it towardthe object. When he did so, the object “abruptly changed course” from its rapidhorizontal flight, and instead turned away from them and flew due west, climbingaway. At this point, its center seemed darker with only its rim brighter. Oneresearcher raised the possibility of meteor, but conceded this seemed unlikely.The event is unexplained. Certainly on the face of it, it appears that asophisticated device took evasive action after conducting some sort ofsurveillance or covert activity near a U.S. military installation. cccxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1859490] Yet another military case, perhaps the most extraordinary of the summer,occurred on July 23 above Lake Michigan. Between 3:53 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.,personnel from four U.S. Coast Guard Stations, as well as civilians, saw andtracked a cigar-shaped object with colored lights and traveling at astonishingspeeds.At 3:53 a.m., the Two Rivers Coast Guard Station (CGS) in Wisconsin, received acall from the CGS Ludington in Michigan, requesting that they search for a UFOtraveling in their direction. Ludington observers said it had red, white,orange, and green flashing lights, and was moving very fast. Within minutes,personnel at Two Rivers did see it, just as described. The object headed westtoward Two Rivers until it disappeared. One minute later, at 4 a.m., personnelat CGS Sturgeon Bay in Wisconsin saw a UFO at an undetermined distance to thesouth. At 4:01 a.m., they saw a UFO rapidly heading west, described as havingred lights and an erratically flashing strobe-type light. At 4:04 a.m.,personnel at CGS Two Rivers saw an object of that description approaching. Itsoon passed by them. At 4:25 a.m., a light house in Green Bay reported the sameobject, and at 4:45 a.m., CGS Two Rivers reported a white light in the southernsky moving toward the station and blinking irregularly, which then changeddirection toward the northeast, and vanished going straight up. Other civiliansightings in the area were consistent with what the Coast Guard personnel wereseeing. Indeed, at 4:55 a.m., a civilian reported to CGS Ludington that a UFOhad been hovering over U.S. Route 31, and then moved rapidly to the west. Theobject had flashing white lights and an occasional red flash. Ludingtonpersonnel looked over the lake and saw the object, and personnel at CGS St.Joseph in Michigan took photographs of it.According to the NORAD Command Directors Log for the month of July 1978, theobject under observation at one point traveled 200 miles in three minutes, or4,000 mph, easily faster than the top speed of what was supposed to be theworld’s fastest aircraft, the SR-71 Blackbird. Moreover, this speed was attainedat the relatively low altitude of 6,000 feet, which should have made anear-splitting sound, although nothing of the sort was reported. UFO researcherRobert Todd requested the photographs through FOIA in 1980, but was told by theU.S. Coast Guard that the negatives had been lost in the mail in 1978. BarryGreenwood then inquired with the Coast Guard. He was initially advised that “ten35 mm photographs” were lost in the mail, then informed that the images weresold to the National Enquirer by the coast guard personnel who took them. He wasalso told that the “lost in the mail” explanation had been mistaken, andreferred to an unrelated incident. In any case, the Enquirer never published thephotos it supposedly had. cccxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1859734] What is remarkable about this case is the consistency with which all witnessesdescribed this object, as well as its extraordinary capabilities. The speedalone begs an explanation, but when combined with other features, such as itsexceptional maneuverability and lack of reported sound, we are once again leftto ponder: was this a covert U.S. technology program, or something else?Another U.S. military UFO encounter, lacking many details, was reported in theMUFON UFO Journal , and was said to have taken place on November 15, 1978 ineastern Washington State. It describes an interceptor pursuing “a green object.”Four aircraft were in the air when an unknown object was detected at 13,000feet, some 40 miles away. One of the jets at a higher altitude was ordered toapproach the object. The pilot had visual contact with it as well as a radarsignal, although he could not lock on. The object seemed to be stationary, andthe interceptor came to within eight miles of it, then was forced to turn awaydue to low fuel. It seems like an odd encounter, but no other details areavailable. cccxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1859915] These accounts do not exhaust the alleged U.S. military encounters with UFOsfor 1978. They are scattered among numerous sources, not all confirmed, nor evenmuch investigated, often turning up years after the fact when someone finallydecides to talk. Such is the nature of UFO reports, in particular those withmilitary connections. What seems clear, based even on these few accounts, isthat an unknown agency with access to extraordinary technology was having itsway very easily within U.S. airspace. Against this agency, the U.S. militaryappears to have been helpless. UFOs in the World, 1978UFO statistics are perennially unreliable, based on whim and circumstance of thewitnesses, the strengths and (usually) limitations of local UFO reportingsystems, the incomplete nature of most investigations, and the willingness ofgovernment agencies to release any of their own data. As such, claims of UFO“waves” and “flaps” should be accepted with caution. Still, having taken allthis into account, it appears that 1978 was an important year of UFO activityworldwide. In particular, parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Far Eastreported unusual and dramatic events during the second half of the year. Some ofthe Middle Eastern sightings appeared directly related to oil fields. Attemptedjet interceptions occurred, and several UFOs crashed in different parts of theworld. In nearly all cases, news coverage, when it existed at all, was local, sothat the impact of the wave of sightings went unnoticed by the mass media.Some people suggested that the increased UFO sightings were due largely toheightened awareness of the subject following the release of Close Encounters ofthe Third Kind . The movie was certainly a great success and made its mark onpopular culture. Moreover, one of the factors of UFO reporting must be publicawareness of the phenomena. It can be argued that pop culture generated visionsof flying saucers and aliens among the public, who then interpreted interestingbut mundane phenomena into something more exotic. The other side of thatargument is that people are less likely to see things they are not looking for,and more likely once they become aware of them. When it came to seeing strangelights in the night sky, it seems plausible that Close Encounters could haveturned these into alien spaceships in the minds of some witnesses. But in 1978as in all years, the most interesting reports are the most detailed. Laying thebulk of these at the doorstep of Steven Spielberg is merely to take the lazy,and probably wrong, path. cccxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1860115] 1978 also stands out as a year of unprecedented sightings of “humanoids”around the world. One researcher compiled over 300 cases in which witnessesclaimed to have close encounters with alien beings. cccl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1860530] The vastmajority of these were consciously recalled experiences (i.e., not viahypnosis), and many were multiple witness scenarios. There were a great varietyof reports from throughout the United States, Europe (with Italy leading theway), South America, Australia, and New Zealand. Reports also leaked out frombehind the Iron Curtain, especially the Soviet Union and Poland. This was true“high strangeness.” Their appearances fell within several distinct categories.Some were described as completely human looking and often “beautiful.” Otherswere described as the typical “greys,” i.e. short, large head, liquid blackeyes, slit-like mouth, and so on. Not surprisingly, other variations occurred.Several cases of “clones” were reported, in which multiple beings lookedidentical to each other. Some were described as robot-like, other reportsincluded alleged telepathic communication.Three major geographic areas did not generate many “humanoid” reports: Africa,China, and the Middle East. But even China and the Middle East had somespectacular “conventional” UFO reports during the year. It was a busy year forUFOs.Crashes and Dogfights in South AmericaMuch strangeness came from South America, including several cases ofalien-looking creatures, some suggesting abductions. cccli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1860737] But the twomost important cases of the year were of the more traditional sort: the crash ofa UFO in Bolivia in May, and the December UFO encounters by the Chilean AirForce.The Bolivian crash took place on May 6. At about 4:15 p.m., something slammedinto a mountain near El Taire on the Bermejo River, very close to the borderwith Argentina. It caused a supersonic bang that was heard up to 150 miles awayand cracked windows within a radius of thirty miles. Argentinian border policesearched for wreckage that might have fallen in their territory. This was adifficult, mountainous region, so reporters went to the town of Aguas Blancas toawait further developments and interview witnesses. The object was typicallydescribed as oval or cylindrical in shape and metallic-looking. Most witnesses,including those in the military, believed it was a UFO. Corporal Natalio FarfanRuiz, who led an Argentinian border police unit, said the object “made the earthtremble” as it passed over. “Just imagine what would have happened,” he said,“if the UFO had fallen on the houses!”The Bolivian Air Force dispatched three airplanes and discovered the crash siteon its side of the border, the southern slope of the El Taire Mountain. On May14, it was reported that the object had been found. The police chief of theBolivian city of Tarija said “our men have discovered the object and inspectedit, but have received no instructions for further action. It is a dull metalliccylinder twelve feet long with a few dents. No one knows what is inside it, andwe are awaiting the arrival of various technical commissions. A NASA expert isalso expected to arrive tomorrow morning.” No one from NASA arrived, but twoUSAF officers, Colonel Robert Simmons and Major John Heise, did. According toone newspaper account, they were officially on leave, but were instructed totake the object to the U.S. in a Hercules C-130 aircraft, waiting for them at LaPaz.When journalists tried to confirm this information with the American Embassy inBolivia, they received a denial. In fact, according to U.S. State Departmentrecords, Simmons and Heise were assigned to the military attaché of the U.S.Embassy in La Paz, and did fly to Tarija with an officer of the Bolivian AirForce. This was in connection with Project Moon Dust, an American program set upin 1961 to engage in rapid recovery of space vehicles of all types, includingunidentified flying objects. A telex sent by the U.S. Ambassador in Bolivia,Paul H. Boeker, to the State Department, asked the agency to inquire with“relevant agencies whether they could explain what this object could be.” Hementioned that “more and more UFO reports” were being generated. In a secrettelex on May 18, U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance replied that “appropriategovernment agencies” had been consulted, but that “no direct correlation withknown space objects that may have reentered the earth’s atmosphere near May 6can be made.” He referred Boeker to the classified State aerogram A-6343 of July26, 1973, “which provides background information and guidance for dealing withspace objects. In particular any information pertaining to the pre-impactobservations, direction of trajectory, number of objects observed, time ofimpact and detailed description, including any markings would be helpful.”Another document obtained through later FOIA requests was a classified “MoonDust Message” from the U.S. military attaché at La Paz. Project Moon Dust hadexisted since the early 1960s as a special operation designed to retrieve spacedebris, including UFOs. This document was dated May 24 and addressed to theForeign Technologies Division at the Wright-Patterson AFB and USAF Headquarters.The attaché said his office “had taken pains to verify the press reports” andhad met with the Bolivian Air Force and Army. The Army declared its troops had“found nothing,” and that there may or may not have been an object. The attachéadded that he would send two officials to Tarija, presumably Simmons and Heise.Nothing more is known of what Simmons and Heise learned in their investigation,but the activation of Moon Dust indicates that U.S. officials did not believethe object was a meteorite; nor did anyone else seem to think so. Thecomprehensive data bank by the Smithsonian Institution, which has carefullytracked every volcanic eruption, earthquake, and meteorite collision since 1973,contains no reference to a meteorite at the Bolivian-Argentinian border at thistime. If the object was not a meteorite, and not (in the words of Cyrus Vance) a“known space object,” what else could have caused a supersonic explosion andflurry of classified memos? ccclii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1860895] Once again, we are left to ponder the likelihood of an “unknown” space object.If so, it seems improbable that it was either Soviet or American, as this wasclearly an object of significant mass, and not some mere piece of forgottenspace junk.A few years after this event, researchers Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcettrecounted “reliable information” they had obtained from a source. This persontold them that one of the participants of the search team, a young Bolivianastronomer, had made several passes over the site with a Bolivian Air Forcepilot, and saw a rockslide that he believed was caused by the impact of theobject. Following this, a second expedition consisting of three BAF officers anda guide set out on horseback on May 23, reaching the rockslide on foot two dayslater. The officers told the informant that the rockslide looked recent, thatparallel to it was a 100-meter long trench, three to four meters wide at thetop. Some of the large rocks at the site appeared to have been burned, and thegrass around the sides and top of the slide area was brown and withered, whilegrass further away was green. cccliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1861125] Shades of Roswell.The aerial encounters in Chile at the end of the year remain South America’sother fascinating UFO event of 1978. Antonio Huneeus investigated many ofChile’s UFO encounters during 1978 and 1979, several of which were confirmed bythe Chilean military. cccliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1861309] The mostsignificant of these occurred on December 16, 1978, although for years, theevent was described in partial or vague terms, without doing justice to thetotality of the experience. It appears, however, that the Chilean Air Force hadtwo distinct encounters with an immense UFO in northern Chile, an event thatremains as mystifying today as it was at the time.At noon, two Chilean F-5 aircraft, piloted by captains Hernan Gabrieti Rojas andDanilo Catalan, were on a training mission near the town of Mejillones.According to a later interview with Rojas, both pilots saw an object which gavea radar return equal to 10 or more aircraft carriers, except that this objectwas in the air, not floating on the water. Rojas assumed his radar had faileduntil Catalan told him his radar had similarly “failed.” Ground radar at theCerro Moreno Airport in Antofagasta picked up the object and confirmed its hugesize. The pilots continued to fly south at an altitude between 30,000 and 35,000feet. At a distance of twenty miles, according to Rojas, the object looked “likea plantain banana ... swathed in smoke.” The pilots had no missiles or weaponswith which to defend themselves. “As you can imagine,” Rojas said, “the frightwas more or less considerable.” The pilots approached the object cautiously withtheir gun cameras. The UFO had been motionless, but as the F-5s approached, itdisappeared at an “unimaginable” speed to the west, heading towards EasterIsland. All at once, it vanished from all three radar screens. The incident hadlasted five minutes.At 8 p.m. that day, a second encounter occurred in the Antofagasta-Calama regionwhen radar detected a UFO at 10,000 feet. Three F-5Es were sent to intercept. Itwas a clear evening sky, and the object was seen visually by two of the pilots.The Commander described it as very bright, somehow “between round andtriangular” in shape, and about 50 times larger than an F-5E.The Chilean Air Force acknowledged the events of this day the following spring,but did not (or could not) explain what had happened. ccclv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1861681] After he hadretired with the rank of General, Rojas also described them. While he had notbeen on the second mission, he believed the UFO was different from what he hadencountered, mainly because of its triangular shape. He offered an insight intothe workings of military secrecy regarding UFOs: “It’s not that there’s anunwillingness to talk, but since it is an almost intangible piece of informationit cannot be handled, it cannot be processed. The base commander is informed andthen the page is turned and normal activity resumes.” ccclvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1861895] European EncountersEurope, too, had its mixture of ‘conventional’ and bizarre UFO reports,including claims of encounters with humanoid creatures. The most interestingcases were in Britain and Italy. The year was also noteworthy in that twoEuropean government sources released confirmed UFO data. In March, the ItalianMinistry of Defense published six unclassified reports of military encounterswith UFOs from the previous year. ccclvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1862100] More importantwas the report issued in June by GEPAN, the French government’s UFO study group.This was a 500-page study distributed on a limited basis to French governmentofficials, analyzing reports from the Gendarmerie from 1974 through 1978. Thereport focused primarily on 11 cases with “high strangeness” but also highcredibility in terms of the caliber of witnesses, physical evidence, and othercircumstances. Each case had been investigated by a four-person team whichincluded a psychologist. In ten of those cases, the report concluded that thewitness had seen a material phenomenon which could not be explained as naturalphenomenon or human technology. The report’s main conclusion:... there generally can be said to be a material phenomenon behind theobservations. In 60% of the cases reported here, the description of thisphenomenon is apparently one of a flying machine whose origin, modes of liftingand/or propulsion are totally outside our knowledge.GEPAN recommended that a “deep study” be undertaken with a “high degree ofpriority.” ccclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1862261]By contrast, the British Ministry of Defence continued to remain close mouthedabout UFOs, despite the fact that it received 750 reports and spent 11 millionpounds during the year to investigate them. ccclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1862511] Many of theMoD reports, released in later years, described close encounters. One was aJanuary sighting by three British police officers of a silent, slow, and glowingUFO that appeared to land in the woods near Skipton, Yorkshire. It looked like aclassic “Adamski” UFO from the 1950s, with spheres beneath spaced equidistantlyaround a hollow center. ccclx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1862719] Anotherlanding case was reported later that month from near Frodsham in Cheshire. Fourmen on the banks of the River Weaver saw a silver balloon-shaped object land ina nearby meadow. According to their story, entities emerged and paralyzed a cow,placing it in a cage. The men noticed a blue-green glow around the area,panicked and ran. One of the men developed sunburn-like marks on his leg. ccclxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1862923] Strangestories like these were reported all year in Britain.Meanwhile, European pilots and airports were encountering UFOs. On March 9,1978, several pilots between Milan and Venice reported a UFO. One of them toldMilan air traffic control that it looked “something like a green rocket ... veryluminous and a mile off.... I have the impression that they just made a passover us and then made a counter thrust. I didn’t say anything before because Ididn’t want anyone to think I was crazy.” Milan replied, “No, no, the news iscorroborated now. Other planes . . . are reporting a green flash, some beneaththem, others report it 15 miles away from them.” “Ours was very close,” repliedthe pilot. “A little too close.” ccclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1863083]Another Italian case occurred on July 4, a close encounter near Mount Etna bytwo Italian Air Force Sergeants, an Italian Navy officer, and another militaryman. All were off duty at 10:30 p.m., when they observed a triangular pattern ofbright red lights in the sky. One of the lights then detached from the group anddisappeared down a slope just 1,000 feet from the witnesses. They drove over toinvestigate, and saw a light behind a dip near the side of road. Looking overthe edge, they saw a saucer-shaped object resting on a rocky precipice,estimated to be about 40 feet in diameter, with a brightly lit yellow dome. Butthere was more than a craft. The witnesses saw five or six very tall (human)beings with blond hair wearing black, tight-fitting suits. Two of the beingsthen began to climb toward the witnesses, who were immobilized. The beings cameto within 15 feet of the witnesses and smiled at them. One of them then noddedtoward their craft, and they both returned. The craft glowed with multicoloredtiny points of light, darkened when a car drove by, then brightened again.Before long, the witnesses regained mobility and left before the craft departed.ccclxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1863264] A UFO was reported to be over Gatwick Airport on August 16, an eventdiscussed in the Daily Mirror and investigated by Timothy Good. Little is knownabout the details, except that an airport spokesman said that “the controllersdefinitely saw something, but they have clammed up over exactly what it was.”ccclxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1863445]Another sighting may have occurred over Heathrow Airport in September. Althougha spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority denied tracking a UFO on radar,he added, “It’s in the interest of national security that not too much fuss ismade about this sort of thing.” ccclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1863641] Other cases occurred in which UFOs were seen to land, alien creatureswere spotted, or in which physical effects were reported on automobiles. OnSeptember 17, near the town of Torrita di Siena in north central Italy, a womanand her son were driving when both saw a red ball descend and illuminate thearea. Area houselights went out. Soon after, another motorist experiencedelectrical failure while a bright object descended ahead of him. According tothe witness, it was a reddish domed disc, about ten feet wide, with three lightbeams extending to the road. A panel opened and two humanoid creatures about 4feet tall “floated” out. They wore green coverall-type garments and had helmetswith antennae. Still floating, they circled his car, then re-entered theircraft, which took off “in a flash of light and explosive sound.” Three scorchedcircles about 20 inches in diameter were found on the road surface. ccclxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1863847]Reports like these became a weekly, and at times daily, occurrence in Italy asthe year wore on, and to a lesser extent in Germany and France. ccclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1864432] Flurry in the Middle EastThe Middle East, in particular Iran and Kuwait, also produced baffling UFOreports. In April, while flying near Tehran at 24,000 feet, an Iranian pilot andco-pilot saw an enormous glowing object. The case was described in the Iranianpress and included in U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency files. A Mehrabad radarcontrol official said an object 20 times the size of a jumbo jet had beendetected several times – remarkably similar to the Chilean case later that year.In the Iranian case, the pilot was able to photograph the object, but “thesecurity division of the civil aviation authorities” prevented him fromreleasing the photo. A civil aviation organization official called for aninvestigation, but whether any was made is not known. ccclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1864594] A month later, on May 13, an Iranian teenager took a very goodphotograph of a UFO. Sixteen year old Jamshid Saiadipour was studying late forexams when at 4 a.m. he looked through the window of his Shiraz/Tehran home.Outside was a glowing, hat-shaped UFO, hovering motionless in the night sky. Hetook a picture of it, which was published on May 18, 1978 by Tehran Magazine .The article and photograph were included in U.S. DIA files, and released in 1980via FOIA. The claim has occasionally been made that the object was of interestto U.S. officials because it resembled the classified aircraft known as TacitBlue. There is a superficial resemblance, except for the fact that Tacit Bluedid not hover, did not glow, was tested in Nevada – not Iran – and was in alllikelihood not yet flying in 1978. In other words, there is no reason why TacitBlue should account for the interest in the Shiraz UFO – the object had quiteenough interest on its own merits. The real questions are, who manufactured it,and how was it able to fly as it did. ccclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1864987] On July 17, another UFO was seen in Iran, also reported in localnewspapers and filed with the U.S. DIA. In northern Tehran on a Sunday night,the hot weather prompted many people to sleep on the terraces of their houses.This was how so many of them saw a “strange glowing object” float by. Onewitness, alone on his balcony, saw the object emerge in the sky and hoverdirectly above him. “I was so upset that I wanted to scream, but could not doso,” he said. Phone calls were quickly made to the control tower at MehrabadAirport as well as the national radio network. The control tower confirmed theexistence of the object but gave no further details. A Lufthansa pilot alsoreported the object. ccclxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1865245] On October 8, 1978, yet another Iranian teenager took a photograph of aUFO. This was a daytime photo by Franklin Youri, from outside his home near LakeUrmia in western Iran. In the photograph, the object appears behind his house,just above the line of the roof. Although it is obviously distant, its shape isdiscernable as identical to the May 13 photograph. The case became known threeyears later due to a FOIA request. ccclxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1865547] It may never be known why Iran experienced this relative outbreak of UFOsightings in 1978. But it is true that the nation experienced a year-longpolitical crisis. In November, 1978, the Shah declared martial law in responseto massive rioting and a wholesale rejection of Western values. Schools anduniversities closed down, newspapers stopped publishing, and the oil industrywas paralyzed.Within such a context let us consider the final flurry of UFO sightings from theMiddle East, which took place in Kuwait. Some details are sketchy, although theU.S. and Kuwaiti governments confirmed the basic facts. On November 9, one ofKuwait’s northern oil fields, known as Gathering Centre No. 24, experienced afailure of its oil pumping station and an interruption in its communicationssystem. While specialists tried to determine why, technicians outside saw adomed disc-like object sitting on the ground. A senior Kuwait Oil Company (KOC)official told U.S. officials that when the object vanished, the system starteditself up again. This is strange, as the equipment was designed to be restartedby manual means only.This was the first of a series of UFO sightings in Kuwait. Eight events werereported between November 9 and December 14, many of which occurred over oilfields. These sightings received the attention of the American Embassy in KuwaitCity, as well as the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR), whichproduced a classified report on January 20, 1979. What is so interesting is thatthe Institute rejected the idea that these were “espionage devices,” butremained open to the idea that they were extraterrestrial. In fact, thecommittee stated explicitly that it could not reject the idea that the objectswere spaceships. KISR also said that Kuwait’s air defense system “did not reactin any way to the ‘events’ in the KOC north.” Parts of the study were reportedin the media, although researchers were not allowed to read the full report.In January 1979, the American Embassy in Kuwait City wrote to the StateDepartment about the sightings. The memo discussed the failure of the pumpingstation in connection to the UFO sighting of November 9, and stated further thatthe KISR study had not addressed this problem. The embassy stated that “eventhose who are not inclined to believe in visitors from outer space do tend tothink something strange has been going on in Kuwaiti airspace.” The embassyrepeated some speculation that helicopters or hovercraft were bringing refugeesor money out of Iran, but offered no explanation that was actually plausible.ccclxxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1865805] Soviet UFO ProgramsAs a result of the Petrozavodsk sighting from September 1977, the Soviet Academyof Sciences created a research program for “anomalous atmospheric phenomena,”named Setka-AN. At the same time, the Soviet Ministry of Defense embarked on asimilar program, dubbed Setka-MO. It is unclear how much these two programsinteracted with each other. According to former Soviet ufologist VladimirRubtsov, they worked from different sets of data: one from the militarybranches, the other from scientific institutes and periodicals. The Academy ofSciences program was said to be interested in the physical nature of UFOs whilethe military program more pragmatically wanted to determine “their influence ofthe operation of military technical equipment and personnel” – vague wordingpointing toward interest in national security issues. ccclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1866354] Moreinteresting still was the admission from skeptical authors Yuri Platov and BorisSokolov – both members of the Setka programs – that the Soviet Ministry ofDefense was interested in radar invisibility and “high maneuverability” of UFOs.ccclxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1866546] Thisbegs the question of just what Soviet authorities assumed was causing thegenuine UFO reports. If they believed they could learn something oftechnological value, did they really think that these UFOs originated fromsecret American technology that had simultaneously mastered stealth and achievedthe performance of flying saucers?The Setka programs lasted for at least 13 years and, according to accounts offormer participants, it appears that the military component generated some 3,000official reports of UFO sightings. Rubtsov said the number of unknowns was “some300,” while Platov and Sokolov wrote that “more than 400 events were registeredand identified as extraordinary or paranormal” (although the latter two alsostated that rocket launches and balloons alone accounted for “more than 90%” ofthe reports – a glaring inconsistency). Either way, the percentage of unknownswas in line with numbers derived from official programs of other nations,including Blue Book, GEPAN, or the Condon Committee. The Soviet unknowns wereespecially important, wrote Rubtsov, as the reports “were reliable, informative,and detailed ... filtered on the site by experienced officers.” This statementis amplified by the fact that reporting UFOs was a no-win scenario: the Sovietbureaucracy demanded reports from soldiers but continued officially not torecognize UFOs. To put the matter mildly, filing a report was not seen as a goodcareer move. Rubtsov even talked of fears by Soviet military personnel of “beingsent to a hospital for a long and unpleasant examination” if they made such areport. ccclxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1866831] Paul Stonehill, another authority on Soviet and Russian UFOs, suggestedthat Setka-AN served as a cover to distract from the workings of the moreserious Setka-MO. ccclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1867021] Not everyoneagrees with this, but the conclusion of the Setka programs as stated by Platovand Sokolov – that all Soviet UFOs were amenable to conventional explanations –is inconsistent with the official data. In any UFO research program, whatmatters is not so much what caused the 90 percent of “knowns” as the five, tenor fifteen percent of unknowns. One critic of Platov and Sokolov put it well:“it is beyond reason to consider the Soviet military as complete idiots who for13 years were persistently pursuing gas-dust trails of their own rockets.”Moreover, there is no evidence to indicate that anyone in the Soviet Setkaprograms attempted to analyze the unknowns themselves. If this was so, thencalling their endeavors “scientific” would therefore stretch the definition ofthe word beyond meaning. ccclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1867205]Russian UFO researcher Vladimir Azhazha, a physicist and Professor ofMathematics at Moscow University and a leading Soviet ufologist, said that theSetka-MO program generated “too many incidents that could not be denied.” Hisstatements lend support to the claim there was indeed a secret element toSetka-MO. Soviet submarines, he said, were encountering underwater objects thatwould follow them. These objects were initially thought to be American devices,but one incident laid that theory to rest. A Soviet icebreaker was at work inthe Arctic Ocean when, according to Azhazha, “a brilliant spherical craftsuddenly broke through the ice and flew up vertically, showering the vessel withfragments of ice.” Looking up, the sailors and officers on deck saw the object;looking down they saw the hole in the ice. “You don’t shoot a missile that way.You have to break the ice first. Furthermore, the object was a bright sphere. Weknew what nuclear missiles looked like!” As a result of encounters like these,said Azhazha, the Soviets drew up rules of engagement for UFOs: how to observethem and what to do in a confrontation. “They treated us the way we would treata fish, or a rabbit,” said Azhazha. “It is naive to assume they have anygoodwill toward us, or any need to interact. They simply seem to go about theirbusiness. They coexist with us.” ccclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1867450] Ultimately, much needs to be learned about the nature of official Sovietufology. It is also well to keep in mind that Soviet science, while capable ofproducing thinkers of genius, was also deeply integrated into the apparatus ofthe State and Party. This was, after all, a system that a mere generation beforehad sponsored and promoted the fraudulent Trofim Lysenko, whose rejection ofMendelian genetics was official policy in the USSR until 1964. Althoughbureaucratized science everywhere serves the needs of the State, this tendencywas brought to extreme levels in the Soviet Union. Official conclusions musttherefore be viewed with caution at best, if not outright skepticism.Although the Setka programs eventually improved reporting of UFOs, the Sovietcases of 1978 remain sketchy. One humorous incident reportedly occurred in May(no precise date) at Lake Pyrogovskoye in Russia. Anatoly Malishev, a Sovietofficer, was confronted by two entities wearing dark suits who communicated withhim via telepathy. He was given a salty tasting drink of some sort, andeventually suggested that his new acquaintances perform a toast with a real(e.g. alcoholic) drink. Apparently they did not imbibe, and Malishev asked themwhy an advanced civilization such as theirs did not drink alcohol. They replied,“Perhaps if we did, we would not be such an advanced civilization.” Malishevreported his encounter to the authorities, who were unconvinced and threatenedcourt-martial. He was subjected to hypnosis and passed a lie-detector test, andwas not court-martialed. So goes the story, at any rate. ccclxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1867632] More solid were the sightings by Soviet cosmonauts. On August 15,Vladimir Kovalyonok in the Salut-6 space station saw a strange object approachand distance itself repeatedly. On October 2, he saw a strange shadow hoveringabove the clouds, changing its appearance inexplicably. Other cosmonauts sawUFOs not while in space, but down on Earth. Pavel Popovich, a Hero of the SovietUnion who attained the rank of Major-General, saw two. While in an airplane overCuba, he was approached by a white triangular-shaped object. He alerted otherpassengers and crew members, who also saw it. The object soon passed by theirown aircraft and was gone. During the same year in Soviet air space while flyingin a Yak-40 aircraft, Popovich and his crew saw a bright sphere slowly approach,then fly directly at them. At the last moment it veered upward and away. ccclxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1867870] China and AustraliaChina also had many sightings of unusual aerial phenomena. From 1978 until 1981,Paul Dong, editor of the Chinese Journal of UFO Research , collected hundreds ofcases, some of which dated back to the first half of the twentieth century. Thereports from 1978 included several interesting encounters, but the mostsignificant was on October 23 at the Lintiao Air Base in China’s northwesternGansu Province. At 10:04 p.m., several hundred military personnel were watchingan outdoor movie when a large westerly-moving object passed over their heads.Witnesses agreed that the object was elongated, with two searchlights and aglowing tail; no one recognized it. Chinese Air Force pilot Zhou Qingtong saidthe object was large and close to the ground. It was visible for two to threeminutes, and was “clearly not a meteor, nor a swarm of locusts or birds, nor anairplane. As we are all fighter pilots we could say this with some certainty.”According to a report in the CIA files, the object “covered half the sky,causing extreme astonishment.” This would appear to be the effect of an enormousobject flying at very low altitude, although the CIA report oddly estimated theobject’s altitude to be 20,000 feet – much higher than what witnesses described.ccclxxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1868058] TheChinese government ended its long silence on UFOs on November 13, 1978, with anarticle in The People’s Daily entitled “UFO: An Unknown World Puzzle.” Afterthis, an avalanche of public interest began. ccclxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1868313]The rest of Asia and the Pacific reported little UFO activity during the firsthalf of 1978. Matters were different in the second half. On October 21, 1978,two days before the dramatic Chinese sighting, occurred one of the most strikingand tragic UFO-related events in history. This was the disappearance of theDelta Sierra Juliet, a Cessna 182 aircraft piloted by Frederick Valentich, ayoung man flying from Moorabin, Victoria, to King Island, Tasmania. This was ashort trip of about 130 miles, but Valentich had to fly over the Bass Strait,the channel between Australia and Tasmania. The strait has a history of missingaircraft and has sometimes been compared to the Bermuda Triangle.Valentich took off at 6:19 p.m. The weather was clear with a trace ofstratocumulus cloud at 5,000 to 7,000 feet. Winds were light and visibility wasexcellent. At 7:06 p.m., he saw an unknown object and reported to the MelbourneFlight Service Unit Coordinator. The transcript is vivid, dramatic, and tragic.Valentich: Melbourne, this is Delta Sierra Juliet. Is there any known trafficbelow five thousand?Melbourne: No known traffic.Valentich: I am seems (to) be a large aircraft below five thousand.Melbourne: What type of aircraft is it?Valentich: I cannot affirm, it is four bright, it seems to me like landinglights.... The aircraft has just passed over me at least a thousand feet above.Melbourne: Roger and it is a large aircraft confirm.Valentich: Unknown due to the speed it’s traveling. Is there any air forceaircraft in the vicinity?Melbourne: No known aircraft in the vicinity.Valentich: Melbourne, it’s approaching now from due east towards me. It seems tome that he’s playing some sort of game. He’s flying over me two to three timesat speeds I could not identify.Melbourne: Roger. What is your actual level?Valentich: My level is four and a half thousand, four five zero zero.Melbourne: Confirm that you cannot identify the aircraft.Valentich: Affirmative.Melbourne: Roger. Standby.Valentich: Melbourne, Delta Sierra Juliet. It’s not an aircraft, it is // openmicrophone for two seconds //Melbourne: Can you describe the, er, aircraft?Valentich: As it’s flying past, it’s a long shape // open microphone for threeseconds // (cannot) identify more than (that it has such speed) // openmicrophone for three seconds // before me right now, Melbourne.Melbourne: Roger, and how large would the, er, object be?Valentich: Melbourne, it seems like it’s chasing me. What I’m doing now isorbiting and the thing is just orbiting on top of me, also. It’s got a greenlight and sort of metallic (like). It’s all shiny (on) the outside // openmicrophone for five seconds // It’s just vanished. Melbourne, would you knowwhat kind of aircraft I’ve got? Is it (a type) military aircraft?Melbourne: Confirm the, er, aircraft just vanished.Valentich: Say again.Melbourne: Is the aircraft still with you?Valentich: (unclear) // open microphone for two seconds // (now) approachingfrom the southwest. The engine is rough idling. I’ve got it set at twenty threetwenty four and the thing is (coughing).Melbourne: Roger. What are your intentions?Valentich: My intentions are, ah, to go to King Island. Ah, Melbourne, thatstrange aircraft is hovering on top of me again. // two seconds open microphone// It is hovering and it’s not an aircraft. ccclxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1868545] The time was 7:12 p.m. After Valentich uttered these final words, Australiantraffic control heard a sound “like tin cans rolling around in the bottom of anempty oil drum.” These were the words of Richard Haines, who had a recording ofthe transmission, and described the sound to researcher Linda Moulton Howe.Valentich was never seen again. A search and rescue operation was undertakenimmediately, to no avail.During his six minute conversation with the Melbourne Flight Service Unit,Valentich mentioned several distinctive features about the object that washarassing him. It was elongated, shiny, metallic-looking, with bright lights anda green light. It had the ability to fly very fast, since it flew pastValentich’s airplane several times. It could also hover or pace his aircraft.Twice Valentich stated that the object was “not an aircraft.” It appeared thatthe object was deliberately engaging Valentich’s Cessna, and interfered with itsability to fly.Australian MUFON researchers Keith Basterfield and Bill Chalker investigated thecase. Valentich, they learned, “lived for flying.” It seemed unlikely that hewould have done anything to have damaged his chances to improve his flyingstatus. ccclxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1869178] Some yearslater, former NASA scientist Richard Haines reported that three witnessestestified seeing Valentich’s aircraft descend at a steep angle while a muchlarger object, illuminated with green lights, flew just above it. Haines arguedthat Valentich’s airplane probably crashed into the sea southeast of CapeMarengo between three and twelve miles offshore. “The nature of the largegreen-lighted object that accompanied the airplane during its steep descentremains to be identified.” ccclxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1869444] It was also later discovered that just twenty minutes before Valentichdisappeared, another witness, Roy Manifold, had taken odd photographs showing alarge, black anomaly low over the sea, apparently swirling up the water. EastmanKodak examined the pictures and ruled out the possibility of film or processingdefects. The Australian Royal Air Force said the pictures showed a cumuluscloud. Bill Chalker replied that for the cloud to have moved into view with thetime sequence of the photographs stated, it would have been moving at about 200mph. ccclxxxvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1869739]Timothy Good also pointed out a little known fact: there were at least 15 otherhigh quality Australian UFO sightings on the day Valentich was lost. ccclxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1869952]More than a thousand miles to the east of Australia is New Zealand, a placeabout as remote to the rest of the world as one could be, particularly duringthe pre-Internet era of 1978. And yet, New Zealand ended the year with someextraordinary UFO reports. On October 24, the U.S. military recorded the impactof a space fragment, known locally as a “space ball,” that landed on theproperty of a farmer named John Lovett on New Zealand’s South Island. It wasanalyzed by the National Radiation Laboratory in Christchurch for a radioactivecheck (negative finding), then by the New Zealand Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research (DSIR). What was truly odd, however, is that a second “spaceball” landed on the property of a farmer in the same area on November 5 (whosename was also Lovett, apparently a brother to the first). The second fragmentlanded approximately 240 meters from the first, and in an adjoining field. Thisobject was also turned over to New Zealand authorities.Four similar balls had been found in the same general region six years before,believed to be from the Soviet Cosmos 482 satellite. It is easy to assume thiswas from the same flight, simply found after the fact, except that the analysisconducted by New Zealand scientific personnel was that at least one of the ballswas too clean to have been lying about even for several months, let alone sixyears. Yet, it seems simplest to conclude that someone in the lab made amistake, and that all six balls were from the Soviet satellite. ccclxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1870298] The most interesting sightings occurred late in December. Near midnight onDecember 21-22, an Argosy freight aircraft piloted by Captain John Randle leftfrom Blenheim heading south toward Christchurch, a path that would take it outto sea off the eastern shore of South Island. The plane was still over landmoving toward the coast when the first UFO appeared. In Randle’s words, theobject gave off “an intense white light” that illuminated the ground as itpassed over. Still, he and his first officer did not bother to report theobject. Soon after, senior radar controller John Cordy at nearby WellingtonAirport was advised of the sighting of five lights near the Clarence River onSouth Island. He and a colleague picked up the objects on radar, as did radarcontrollers at Christchurch Airport. The targets traveled off the coast andmoved toward Wellington. At 3 a.m., Cordy picked up a large echo about 30 milessoutheast of the city, which appeared to hover there for some time. Then, itabruptly moved at 120 knots to a position 50 miles southeast of the city, whereit remained for at least 30 minutes.At 3:30 a.m., a second Argosy plane took off from Blenheim headed forChristchurch, flying roughly the same course as the first. Cordy radioed toCaptain Vern Powell that he was tracking a target 12-13 miles starboard ofPowell’s position. Powell said that he and his crew saw nothing. Within seconds,however, Cordy’s radar showed that the object was on the opposite side. WhenCordy asked Powell to look on the other side, Powell replied he and his crewcould see a bright white light with a reddish tint. Whether through bravery,foolhardiness, or natural curiosity, they flew toward it, but it kept itsdistance and sometimes disappeared into the clouds. One might think this was anatmospheric or astronomical phenomenon, but Cordy said the radar target was atleast as large and solid as the Argosy plane. The crew pursued the light forabout ten minutes, then returned to their flight path, after which Cordy lostthe target. However, as the Argosy reached Christchurch, its weather radardetected an object streaking across its path. Powell saw it: a bright flashingwhite light which shot past at high speed. He said it covered 24 kilometers infive seconds, making a speed of 17,000 kph or about 10,000 mph. It even made asharp right turn before disappearing.The event created a local stir. On December 30, an Australian news crew flewover the area in an Argosy freighter. The strangeness started almostimmediately. Near the town of Kaikoura, the crew saw a row of five bright,pulsating lights which seemed to change from pinpoint size to that of a largeballoon. At the same time, Wellington air traffic control told them that anunknown object was following them. The pilot made a complete turn, but no onesaw it. Then, Wellington informed the Argosy that the target had “increased insize.” At this point, the crew and passengers saw a light flashing white andgreen.The plane landed at Christchurch at about 1:00 a.m. and took off again at about2:15 a.m. Soon, two bright lights were in sight as the plane flew northeast fromChristchurch. Wellington radar tracked neither of these, although airborne radardid track the brightest light (at about 10 miles distance), and this was a largetarget. Cameraman, David Crockett, observing one of the UFOs through his camera,described it as a spinning sphere with lateral lines around it, although thecamera was out of focus and did not accurately represent the light or objectitself. The crew members were deeply impressed by what they saw; they did notbelieve they were seeing ordinary aircraft or natural phenomena.The film taken by the Australian film crew totaled six minutes and was shownworldwide. It mainly shows a single light, on which the cameraman zooms in andout. Skeptics provided many explanations. One astronomer said the UFOs werealmost certainly the planet Venus; another said meteors. An atmosphericphysicist said the radar echoes were a natural feature of the ionosphere duringthe summer, and that the lights could have been caused by refraction in thepredawn sky. Still others said the objects were either balloons or unscheduledaircraft.When Bruce Maccabee saw the film a week later, he said it took him “almost fourmicroseconds” to realize it was not Venus, “or mating mutton birds, or lightreflected from a cabbage patch.” Maccabee showed the film to skeptic RobertSheaffer, who agreed that whatever it was, it was not astronomical. Maccabeeanalyzed the film and interviewed the witnesses. He found it authentic andrejected the debunking hypotheses. “As yet,” he stated, “no explanation in termsof known phenomena has been proposed that satisfactorily explains the film.” Hedid determine that the appearance of rings in the film were a result ofaberrations in the airplane window glass combined with the out-of-focuscondition of the telephoto lens (which had not been mounted properly just beforethat portion of the sighting). 3[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1764672] The Royal New Zealand Air Force (RZNAF) put its planes on full alert andconducted a joint investigation with the police and the Carter Observatory inWellington. Their report concluded that the Kaikoura UFOs were caused either bythe planet Venus, reflections of light from a squid boat offshore, or by a trainor passing car. Regarding the radar targets, these were caused by faultyequipment and novel propagation affects. The report was then stamped Top Secretand archived in the Wellington National Archives.Many years later, a researcher named Peter Hassall convinced the New ZealandMinistry of Defence to lift the Top Secret rating and allow him to reprint theoriginal reports. That was when he realized how terrible the investigation hadbeen. Venus had not even risen over the horizon when most of the sightings weremade. He called the investigation “a lesson in debunking.” Perhaps there was anatural explanation for the sightings, he wrote, but we will never know becauseof the incompetency of the official investigation, which “made a completeshambles of the whole affair.” ccclxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1871082] SummaryThus ended 1978, a year of important developments in all facets of UFO history.The nature of the sightings themselves, in particular the many militaryencounters with extraordinary (and at times enormous) craft, force us to dismissthe hypothesis that the wave was caused by Steven Spielberg. What does appear tobe the case, however, is that serious conflict was occurring, very secretly,between the world’s military forces and something far more advanced.If there was one cause for optimism, it was that private researchers wereofficially in the hunt for the truth. 1977 and 1978 had been great years in thefight against UFO secrecy. Despite government foot-dragging and obstruction,many fascinating documents were coming to light, with realistic hopes that therewas yet much more to come. There seemed a chance that FOIA could be the toolthat would end UFO secrecy. Aside from the search for government records was thegrowing number of insider leaks that were coming to researchers concerned withsome of the deeper aspects of the secrecy. If just one of these cases could beproven to have merit, it would mean that the UFO cover-up had been deeper andmore substantial than anyone had ever considered.But if this were so, it would mean that certain private researchers threatenedto expose a longstanding cold war between various human and non-human groups.One might well expect resistance from those quarters in which secrecy was stillconsidered paramount.Chapter 4 The Empire Strikes Back1979-1980 What I do know is that it was nothing mundane. There are no words that canadequately describe the wonder of what we saw.― U.S. Airman First Class John Burroughs, describing his experience in theRendlesham Forest in 1980. It sort of danced about in the sky and it sent down beams of light. . . . Thepeople in the weapons storage area and several other places on the base alsoreported the lights. . . .[The beam was] adversely affecting the ordinance.― Statements by USAF Lt. Col. Charles Halt regarding events in the RendleshamForest in 1980. The events to which you refer were of no defence significance.― British Secretary of State for Defence Michael Heseltine regarding theevents in the Rendlesham Forest. My source [a former CIA employee] can’t talk about UFOs. He refused to answerany of my questions on the photos or the live retrievals. . . . He’s had hisknuckles spanked.― Anonymous source, speaking to Leonard Stringfield, 1980 The 1979 Drop OffFew years in recent history can match 1979 as a year of political upheaval. TheIranian revolution in January forced out the Shah and brought in the AyatollahKhomeini, who quickly became ‘leader for life.’ The Islamic revolutiontransformed global politics: the U.S. lost a crucial ally, the Soviets lookedwith alarm at Islamic fundamentalism, and oil prices spiked. Meanwhile, Vietnamhad invaded Cambodia in late 1978; China responded by invading Vietnam. Bymid-year in 1979, the leftist Sandinistas took control of Nicaragua. InNovember, the U.S. embassy in Iran was overrun by Iranian students who took 66Americans as hostages while Khomeini demanded extradition of the ailing Shah. InDecember, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. President Carter, besieged by astring of foreign policy failures, abandoned SALT II nuclear weapons talks andannounced major defense spending hikes.Considering how widespread and vivid UFO sightings had been during the finalmonths of 1978, the drop-off in 1979 was very abrupt. The tumultuous state ofworld affairs that began in late 1978 and continued through 1979 leads to thequestion as to whether there was some sort of a relationship to the UFOphenomenon. Without speaking to the UFO occupants themselves, we can have nocertainty. But the flurry of sightings from 1978, particularly in the MiddleEast, might lead us to consider that a monitoring process was under way, onewhich would imply that those intelligences managing the UFOs had some level ofprescience or predictive ability regarding human politics.Despite the drop-off in sightings, one thing was becoming very clear: somebodywas flying triangular craft in the United States. A case from January 5 speaksto this very clearly. In Auburn, Massachusetts, a woman driving her car in theearly evening noticed three red, glowing, triangular objects flying over nearbywoods. As she rounded the corner, she saw them hovering over the road directlyin front of her. Her radio went dead, the car slowed to a stop (although herengine continued to run), and she was completely paralyzed. The closest objectwas only 30 feet away from her. She felt heat on her face, and noticed anunpleasant odor. When another car approached from behind, the three objects shotstraight up, one at a time, and everything returned to normal. When she arrivedhome, she noticed her face was flushed as though it were sunburned. Shedeveloped a rash and some peeling skin the following day. Her car was fine. Onemight speculate that some triangular craft sightings from the 1970s and 1980swere tests of a stealth aircraft, but presumably three glowing, red triangles donot fit the bill. At that time, testing of stealth aircraft was being carriedout at Nellis Test Site, on the other side of the country. Some of these weredone at low altitudes, although hovering was out of the question. cccxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1872145] China also continued to generate some interesting reports, although mostof these were not known in the west for some years. In late January, accordingto Chinese press accounts collected by the CIA, several witnesses saw a lowflying UFO in the Fujian Province, which hovered over a road just before dawn,shining a powerful beam of light to the ground. It frightened several women ontheir way to the marketplace. CIA files also record a February instance in whicha bright object darted across an airfield in Shanxi ‘lighting up half the sky’.Similar reports came from elsewhere in the country. cccxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1872401] A few cases early in the year from Down Under bear mentioning. OnFebruary 5, in Lawitta, Tasmania, a vehicle encounter with a brilliant UFO tookplace, involving illumination of the car, electromagnetic effects on thevehicle, and physical-psychological effects on the driver. The case is similarto many others, but is noteworthy because of its nearness to the Valentich case,which had occurred a few months before. cccxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1872566] On the nightof February 8, at Liverpool Creek in Queensland, a farmer driving on the BruceHighway saw a dimly lit UFO sitting on the edge of the road. As he approached,it rose vertically a few feet off the ground. When he came to within 35 feet ofthe object, it gave off a blinding flash of light at the same time his carengine died. A little later, the engine was fine, but the man felt as though hehad just awoken from a nightmare. cccxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1872779] Growing ParanoiaOn the heels of obtaining the release of thousands of pages of UFO documents,researchers in 1979 began to take a hard look at themselves, in particular therelationship of at least some of them with the U.S. intelligence community. Mostimportant was an article by Todd Zechel, entitled “NI-CIA-AP or NICAP?” Zechelhad researched a number of the people involved in NICAP which, it turned out,was replete with CIA and former CIA officials. Most significant was ColonelJoseph Bryan, the man who had ousted longtime director Donald E. Keyhoe in 1969.Researcher Brad Sparks discovered that Bryan had founded the CIA’s psychologicalwarfare staff in the 1950s, a fact which Bryan confirmed to Zechel. Other NICAPmembers who were either CIA employees or closely associated with the agencyincluded Karl Pflock, Stuart Nixon, and Jack Acuff. Acuff’s case was especiallygalling, as he had personally bled the organization dry: his salary accountedfor more than 80% of its total expenditures in 1979. The CIA leadership of NICAPhad wrecked the group’s ability to function. It certainly looked as thoughNICAP, the organization that had done more in the 1950s and 1960s than any otherto fight against UFO secrecy, had been targeted by the CIA for destruction.cccxciv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1872945] Jacques Vallee added to the growing sense of suspicion with his book,Messengers of Deception , released in March 1979. For some years, Vallee hadargued that UFOs were probably not the result of extraterrestrial activity. Butnow he went further, describing them as “machines of mass manipulation” seekingto alter the minds of those who experienced them, “to change our belief systems”and transform – or destroy – our present civilization. As far as who was behindthe UFOs – whether ETs, time travelers, interdimensional beings, human covertgroups – Vallee did not say. On one hand, he argued that the UFO phenomenon wasancient and that the message had changed with the times – thus, today they comein the form of highly detailed spaceships. On the other, he hinted that deeplycovert human groups were somehow responsible for much of the phenomenon. Hetheorized that the concept of flying discs originated in Germany in the 1930s,and that an unknown private group (not necessarily the U.S. government) gainedcontrol over them after World War Two. Human intelligence operatives, he said,pervaded the field. Contactees – people who claimed to have received messagesfrom extraterrestrials – were being unwittingly manipulated by humanprogrammers. Moreover, intelligence groups had penetrated much of the UFOresearch community, including CUFOS, a statement that surely displeased hislongtime friend Hynek. Vallee’s book polarized UFO researchers. Some applaudedhis courage and originality; others felt he had taken his anti-ET approach to anextreme point; yet others said he engaged in unprovable conspiracy-mongering.cccxcv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1873131] Such revelations – or allegations – were amplified in statements byformer CIA agent, Victor Marchetti. UFOs, said Marchetti, were seldom discussedwithin the CIA, not because the topic was silly, but because it fell within thearea of “very sensitive activities.” He discussed rumors he had heard within“high levels” regarding the crash and recovery of UFOs and the bodies of littlepeople. While he had not seen conclusive proof of UFO reality at the Agency, hesaid that CIA attempts to dismiss the topic had all the classic hallmarks of acover-up. He suspected that the conspiracy was international in scope, thepurpose of which was to “maintain a workable stability among the nations of theworld and for them, in turn, to retain institutional control over theirrespective populations.” For governments to admit the reality of UFOs, heconcluded, could erode human society’s power structure, as the average personwould become aware of mentalities and capabilities that would be superior toours. It could even lead to a collapse into anarchy. cccxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1873462] Perhaps the power structure was defending itself when Grenada PrimeMinister Eric Gairy was deposed in a Marxist, military coup led by MauriceBishop in March 1979. Gairy had not left the UFO issue alone. At the time of thecoup, he was once again in New York City, at the United Nations to discuss aforthcoming plan of action on the UFO issue. Had Gairy been able to have theU.N. pass his UFO draft, it would have institutionalized the study of UFOswithin the U.N., a situation that U.S. intelligence wished to avoid. One mightwell wonder if Gairy’s efforts on UFOs had anything to do with the coup.Although the U.S. obviously would not have desired a Marxist government inGrenada, it is also true that Grenada was a tiny, powerless nation. More to thepoint, the U.S. military had no problem removing Bishop just a few years later.cccxcvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1873660] The House of Lords Debates UFOsThe 1978 wave of UFO sightings continued to reverberate, especially in Britain,where the BBC had reported the recent New Zealand sightings. Within this contextoccurred a historic debate on UFOs in the House of Lords, which took place onJanuary 18, 1979. It was the first time the UFO topic had ever been broachedthere. The person who enabled it was Brinsley Le Poer Trench, co-founder ofFlying Saucer Review . In 1976, he became the 8th Earl of Clancarty, and soonbegan to press the UFO issue in the House of Lords. For some months prior,Patrick Stevens, who ran the MoD’s UFO office known as S4, advised his Defencecolleagues to prepare a rebuttal. Otherwise, he warned, there was “a risk thatthe Government will be persuaded to conduct a study of UFOs, or at least toexamine the mass of evidence that Lord Clancarty and his fellow UFOlogists haveassembled in the last 30 years.” Privately, Stevens told Defence Minister FredMulley “there is nothing to indicate that UFOlogy is anything but claptrap.”The debate was one of the best attended ever held in the Lords, with sixty peersand hundreds of onlookers. Clancarty called attention “to the increasing numberof sightings and landings on a worldwide scale of UFOs, and to the need for agovernment study of UFOs. He asked the Government to reveal publicly what itknew. Others shared his opinion. Lord Rankeillour stated, “many men have seenthem and have not been mistaken. Who are we to doubt their word? … Why shouldthese men of law enforcement and defense lie?” The Government’s position wastaken by Lord Strabolgi, who had met with Stevens in preparation. He concededthat “there really are strange phenomena in the sky ... but there is a widerange of natural explanations to account for such phenomena.” There was nogovernment conspiracy on UFOs, he said, and certainly “no need to introduce thehighly questionable hypothesis of alien space craft,” especially whenconsidering the vast distances in space that would make visits fromextraterrestrials so unlikely.Clancarty’s motion for a government investigation of UFOs was defeated. Still, aUFO All-Party Study Group was soon founded within the House of Lords. Among its30 members were Lord Hill-Norton (Admiral of the Fleet and Chief of the BritishDefence Staff from 1971-1973) and Ralph Noyes (former secretary to Sir RalphCochrane, Vice-Chief of the Air Staff from 1950-1952). The group lasted into themid-1980s. The debate itself generated a tremendous amount of public interest.It filled 70 pages of Hansard , the House of Lords proceedings, copies of whichwere sold out in record time. cccxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1873861]It so happened that the British Ministry of Defence received 550 UFO sightingsfor 1979. cccxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1874362] Some appear tohave been misidentifications of space junk falling out of orbit. Other caseswere not amenable to that explanation, such as the sighting by two teenagedBritish girls on February 22, 1979 in the town of Meanwood, a suburb of Leeds.They saw a grey, egg-shaped object, the size of a small car, with fins on thesides. This object descended near them while making a whining noise. It restedon the ground for three minutes, then began to hum and ascend. It came as closeas 80 feet from them and landed again; then it began to wobble and take off.British researchers visited the site three days later, finding strangeindentations in the snow in two places. The story made the press, and the girlswere visited by an “official from the government.” During separate interviews,they drew identical sketches of the object they saw. The official advised thegirls not to discuss the matter further, but told one of the fathers, “I assureyou they have seen something. That is definite, because the questions I askedthem they would not be able to answer unless it happened.” cd[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1874519] Mutilation ControversyIn the United States, the controversy on animal mutilations was becoming intenseand political. The FBI was not investigating the matter, but in February 1979,New Mexico state police officer Gabriel Valdez told the Bureau that animals werebeing shot with a paralyzing agent, injected with an anti-coagulant, and drainedof blood. Sometimes the cattle’s legs were broken and unmarked helicopters wereseen near mutilation sites. According to an FBI document at the time, Valdezbelieved the mutilations were a clandestine operation by the CIA or theDepartment of Energy connected with biological warfare research. cdi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1874673] However, laterthat year when Linda Moulton Howe interviewed Valdez, he told her off the recordthat he thought the animal mutilation perpetrators were from outer space. Thiswas in line with what other law enforcement officials told her, whether on oroff the record. cdii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1874870] Throughout the year there were several American UFO reports in whichobjects maneuvered very low over the ground, skimmed treetops, hovered overhighways, and swept areas with intensely bright light. cdiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1875048] Some of thesein the west seem to have been connected to cattle mutilations. Dulce, NewMexico, which at the time was a hotbed of bizarre activity, had such a case onApril 9. Police officers saw a round, silent craft hovering 50 feet above theground, with a searchlight aimed downward. This was an area close to wheremutilated animals were found soon afterwards. What were these craft, and werethey “ours” or “theirs”?Further complicating matters were the events occurring at the ranch of ManuelGomez, where a great deal of the Dulce activity was centered. From 1975 untilthe early 1980s, the Gomez family lost more than 50 cattle to mutilations, thehighest total any family ever recorded. State police officer Gabe Valdez andGomez discovered that animals were being marked prior to their mutilation. Usinga black light, they found a glittery substance on the right side of the neck,right ear and right leg of a particular breed of cattle – the breed whichhappened to be the main target of the mutilations. They sent samples of theaffected hides, along with control samples, to Dr. Robert Schonfeld inAlbuquerque. Schonfeld said the affected hides showed significant and “highlysuspicious” deposits of potassium and magnesium. He did not believe it occurredon the animals naturally. Apparently, something was quietly flying at nightusing an ultraviolet beam to locate marked animals. cdiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1875213] Mutilations had become enough of an issue that on April 20, 1979, NewMexico Senator (former astronaut and twelfth man to walk on the Moon) HarrisonSchmitt and U.S. Attorney for New Mexico R. E. Thompson convened a publichearing on the subject in Albuquerque. Although the hearing was informal, withno power to enact decisions, the goal was to show that the mutilations were acriminal activity involving many states, and which therefore warranted federalaction. Indeed, some had occurred on Indian reservations, hence federal land.About 200 people attended and offered a full range of opinions. Jim Marrs, thena journalist covering the hearing for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram , attended.He observed that authorities seemed to be pitted against ranchers, citizens, andresearchers, especially when Thompson urged law enforcement officials inattendance “not to bring out any evidential material which might be used at alater trial.” This effectively muzzled people like Gabriel Valdez.Still, someone was listening, because on April 25 the State of New Mexico hiredsoon-to-be retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel to investigate the matter. Rommeljokingly told the media that if aliens were at fault, he would bring them in bytheir little green ears. Such statements caused some to wonder if hisinvestigation would be a dog-and-pony show designed to silence the matter withan official seal of approval, much as the Condon Committee had done a decadeearlier regarding UFOs. cdv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1875515] Later in thefall, Rommel met with journalist Linda Moulton Howe, who was also investigatingthe matter and was producing a documentary about it. During their interview,Rommel told Howe he was “going to prove” that animal mutilations were the resultof predators. Howe, for her part, was already in possession of photographic andlab evidence to the contrary, but Rommel had made up his mind – a year beforehis official report was printed. It was evident that the “official”investigation of mutilations was following patterns recently described byMarchetti. cdvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1875822] 1979: Mid-Year UFOsOn May 1, a UFO was seen at the government-owned oil fields of Vizcacheras,Argentina. This was a remote area, open only to employees. At 4 a.m., animalnoises woke several engineers. Outside, they saw a UFO hovering silently about200 feet from their site and 65 feet above the ground. For some reason, the mendecided to wave their lantern at it. The object seemed to respond by blinking alight, and then landed nearby. More light signals were exchanged, and the UFOtook off and disappeared toward the Andes Mountains at 4:35 a.m. The meninspected the landing site, and found a large circle with petrified or hardenedsand. The animals refused to approach the area. cdvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1875999] A remarkable case took place in northwestern Minnesota on August 27 – inthe opinion of Jerome Clark, one of the most evidential UFO cases ever recorded.The Red River Valley is about 45 miles south of the Canadian border and close toNorth Dakota. It was here, at 1:40 a.m., that a deputy sheriff saw a very brightUFO while driving. He lost consciousness and woke up with his head on thesteering wheel. The car had skidded on the highway and was now facing theopposite direction. He radioed headquarters at 2:19 a.m., reporting thatsomething had hit his car. One headlight had been blown out but he did not knowwhy. The clock in his car and his wristwatch were now 14 minutes behind. Undermedical examination, he showed an extreme sensitivity to light. The case wasinvestigated by CUFOS. Although Phillip Klass tried to debunk the case, thecause of the sighting remains unknown. cdviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1876288] There were a few interesting Chinese reports during the second half of1979, particularly of low flying objects behaving in extraordinary or odd ways.September was the most active month. On the 12th, a UFO sighting coincided witha complete power failure in the cities of Xuginglong and Huaihua in the HunanProvince. At 9 p.m., fifteen minutes after the power failure began, severalpeople saw a silent, bright object fly overhead, emitting a vertical stream ofwhite rays. This object then flew up and vanished, leaving behind two luminousclouds. The report led to rumors of other power blackouts associated with UFOs,although the Chinese government remained silent on the matter. cdix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1876444] Nine dayslater, the Beijing newspaper, Guang Ming Daily , published an article “Do flyingsaucers exist?” Around the same time a physics student of Wuhan University inHubei Province wrote to Aerospace Knowledge magazine, requesting his countrymento launch a study of UFOs. Many readers responded, and soon a “China UFOResearch Organization” was formed as a private initiative with apparently somemodest independence from the central government. cdx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1876638] Fighting America’s Goliath: the NSAThroughout the year, Peter Gersten, Todd Zechel, and Brad Sparks of CAUScontinued to press government agencies for UFO-related documents. Despite NSAstonewalling, the large release of documents from the prior December allowed forsome optimism. Important documents continued to be released in 1979, the mostsignificant of which was probably the 1961 Moon Dust document, obtained byRobert Todd. It described Moon Dust as operating on a “quick reaction basis torecover or perform field exploitation of unidentified flying objects, orSoviet/Bloc aerospace vehicles, weapons systems, and/or residual components ofsuch equipment.” Thus, UFOs were explicitly distinguished from Soviet craft.According to the document, recovered technology was to be sent to the ForeignTechnology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB. Certainly this supported thegrowing number of allegations that recovered UFOs (and alien bodies) were beingstored at Wright-Pat. cdxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1876813] With such forward momentum, one might think the future looked rosy forCAUS. In fact, the organization was ‘deactivated’ in September 1979. Accordingto Larry Bryant, the problem was lack of money and public support, not pressureby government or other agencies. Search fees had become prohibitive. This maynot have constituted “pressure,” but high fees were becoming a key method usedto discourage FOIA requests on UFOs. In response to a CAUS request for data onUFO radar trackings, for instance, the North American Aerospace Defense Command(NORAD) informed the organization that “it would require 18,383 hours and wouldcost $294,157.” cdxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1876997] Despite the end of CAUS, the court cases against the CIA and NSA did notgo away. On September 19, Peter Gersten on behalf of the UFO organization GroundSaucer Watch (GSW) met with CIA attorneys and Judge John H. Pratt at the U.S.District Court. The CIA had recently moved for a summary judgment to the case,asserting that the GSW requests constituted an “undue burden” and that thepapers released so far were of little importance. Gersten replied that thereleased documents did indicate strong interest in UFOs by the CIA, and weremost likely the tip of the iceberg. Judge Pratt gave GSW 60 days to provide awritten response to the CIA motion for summary judgment. cdxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1877180]At this point the CIA and NSA were known to be withholding 57 and 18 UFOdocuments respectively. The CIA also refused to acknowledge another 200 UFOdocuments in its possession, while NSA refused to acknowledge any at all. TheAir Force was also withholding all information relating to “unknown tracks,” itslatest synonym for UFOs. Frustrated with the stonewalling, Gersten held a pressconference in late October, hoping that media pressure might be useful. It hadno effect. cdxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1877365] On October 29,1979, a federal appeals court ruled that the records of the NSA were sosensitive to national security that they were afforded “special dispensation”from the scrutiny of any adversary action pursued under the terms of FOIA. Notonly did this ruling effectively exempt the NSA from FOIA, it also opened aloophole for other federal agencies. What would stop CIA officials, for example,from transferring their most sensitive UFO documents to NSA? cdxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1877568] Of course, abetter solution, one that had probably already been implemented, would be tohand off sensitive documents and materials to trusted private contractors,making them “proprietary” and hence impervious to any form of public inquiry.NSA’s ability to exempt itself from FOIA emphasized how powerful it was. Inaddition to its hundreds of listening posts around the world, the NSA had itsown army, navy, and air force, and massive bugs deep in space. But more thansimply collecting data, it may have surpassed the CIA at this point inintelligence analysis, an area that was supposed to be the CIA’s forte. CIADirector Stansfield Turner complained that some of the intelligence NSA releasedto other American intelligence agencies was so sanitized that it was almostuseless. He believed that the NSA was deliberately withholding raw informationfrom “the true analytic agencies” and was almost beyond control. cdxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1877751] Closing with a Bang and InvasionAs the year came to a close, other bizarre encounters occurred, a few of whichwere, thankfully, reasonably well documented. The most dramatic was a near aircollision between a UFO and a Spanish Super Caravelle airliner flying fromAustria to Tenerife on the night of November 10. At 11 p.m., two bright redlights approached the plane at “staggering” speed. The pilot, Captain FranciscoLerdo de Tejada, believed it was a single object about the size of a jumbo jet.After it took up a position half a mile away, it maneuvered around his plane, hesaid, in movements that were “quite impossible for any conventional machine toexecute.” He ordered his passengers to fasten their seat belts; one elderly mancollapsed when he saw the object approach at a zigzag. Lerdo decided to make anemergency landing at Valencia. Doubtless feeling some panic, he descended asrapidly as possible. Still, the object followed him, and was visible to theairport director, air traffic controller, and ground personnel. Meanwhile, theSpanish Air Force Defense Command Center in Madrid obtained radar echoes thatseemed to correspond with the UFO, and two Mirage jets attempted to intercept.They established visual contact, and one of the fighters was subjected toseveral sudden close approaches. Although Spain’s Transport Minister ordered aninvestigation and stated, “it is clear that UFOs exist,” no official report wasreleased about the event. The case was reported by United Press Internationaland included an interview with the pilot. cdxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1877909] Another interesting case occurred on November 27 in France. Known as the“Christelle” case, it involved a sighting of a landed UFO in connection withdistinctive landing traces left after the object departed. Grass was flattenedfor several days after the observation, and samples were taken to the Universityof Toulouse for analysis. According to the report later issued by GEPAN, theanalysis “did not give unequivocal evidence of chemical or biologicaldisturbance of the samples ... relative to the controls.” This was believed tobe because the UFO was on the ground for only a short while. In following years,GEPAN would investigate stronger cases in which it appeared that landed UFOswere having definite effects on nearby plant life. cdxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1878420] The two final UFO related events of significance concerned the two majorCommunist nations in the world: the Soviet Union and China. Neither can bedefinitively nailed down, although both were reported by reputable researchers.One concerns an event said to have occurred in November over the Kaspustin Yartesting range, during secret tests of Soviet rockets. A Colonel-General Sapkovand other officers were astonished to see a bright green elliptical object,occasionally changing hues, hovering over the range for thirty minutes. As anaside, Sapkov saw the same thing there seven years later, and was assured byofficers that this was a common occurrence. cdxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1878726] For several years, China had been generating interesting UFO reports,but few or none about alleged alien beings. That changed on December 13, 1979,according to a report received by Paul Dong. That evening, two truck driversdrove as a team in separate vehicles on the Xin’anjing Highway in the Zhejangprovince. This is very close to the eastern coast, somewhat north of Taiwan.Both men saw a bright beam of light ahead of their position. When the leaddriver saw two “unusual human beings” standing on the highway, he stopped hisvehicle. The beings were short, perhaps 4 ½ feet tall, and wore what looked like“space apparel.” The driver behind also stopped his vehicle, but did not see thebeings. The apparition vanished, and the two drivers discussed the event. Theydecided to switch vehicles. A few miles down the road, the new lead driver sawapparently the same beings, and the men again stopped their trucks. The driversturned their lights off and on – the beings remained there. Only when one of thedrivers came out with a crowbar did the beings disappear. cdxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1878953] On December 25, 1979, Soviet paratroopers landed in Afghanistan.Americans generally perceived the Soviet invasion as another move in their chessgame for world domination, particularly as a ploy for control over Mideast oil.Actually, the Kremlin was divided over the invasion. For some years, Afghanistanhad been a cold war battleground. In April 1978, Soviet-trained Afghan officersled a pro-Soviet coup. From Iran, Khomeini responded by supporting theMujahedeen against the Afghan government, while the CIA supported Pakistan intraining Islamic rebels (later to include Osama bin Laden). Thus, the U.S. andIran were unspoken allies in Afghanistan, fighting against the same government.In March 1979, the Afghan government appealed to the Soviets for help. This wasinitially declined. Finally, in December 1979, the Soviets did enter in force,becoming sucked into a ruinous war that hastened the downfall of their ownregime.Incidentally, according to UFO researcher Paul Stonehill, 1979 was the year thatthe Soviet Union may have acquired two disc-shaped UFOs. One of these was saidto be in the area of Zhigansk, in central Siberia, the other in the northernUrals. The Zhigansk disc was reportedly transported to the secret Soviet nuclearfacility, Tomsk-7, although the Soviet authorities denied everything. cdxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1879131] 1980: A Year of Intrigue1979 was a quiet year for ufology; 1980 was not. Not so much because of thecaliber of UFO sightings themselves as for the developments within the fielditself. The available evidence points to the likelihood that the recent releaseof information, whether through official government documents or insiderallegations, prompted a counter attack by the U.S. intelligence community.Leonard Stringfield continued being the most important conduit of leaks. InJanuary he published The UFO Crash Retrieval Syndrome , his first monograph todescribe what he had learned, although he had presented some of this material atthe 1978 MUFON symposium. His varied sources pointed to the possibility thatthere was not merely a single case of a crashed UFO, but many. One of hisnoteworthy discoveries were four separate military sources claiming to have seena movie film depicting a crashed saucer and small alien bodies – fifteen yearsbefore the infamous Santilli film. Many researchers were impressed. The evercautious Richard Hall stated that he was “shaken” by it. cdxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1879309] Meanwhile, the Roswell story began to reach the general public, courtesyof the National Enquirer . A February 26, 1980 edition of the tabloid describedthe story a full six months before the release of The Roswell Incident byWilliam Moore and Charles Berlitz. Considering how difficult it is to obtainmajor media attention – even from a supermarket tabloid – one might wonder howMoore and Berlitz did it. One answer could be that the Enquirer had covered UFOsfor years and simply recognized a good story. It is also true, however, that itspublisher, Gene Pope, had long-time connections to the CIA. Co-author CharlesBerlitz himself had a long history in military intelligence, and Moore wouldsoon be eyeball deep in that world. Indeed, Moore was fluent in Russian –perhaps his choice of that language was purely an intellectual avocation, butperhaps not. What these (possible) connections to the intelligence communitymight mean is not always easy to answer. Could Moore and Berlitz have beensupported somehow by the CIA, or another agency, that wanted the Roswell storyout? And if so, could this have been to promote the story because it was knownto be true (i.e. a friendly inside leak), or because it was known to be false(spreading disinformation to muddy the ufological waters)? cdxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1879482] There were few significant UFO sightings early in the year. One occurredat Burlington International Airport, in Vermont, on March 22, 1980, when airportradar tracked three small objects as they joined with a larger object and thenseparated. Speeds of up to 1,500 mph were recorded, and the objects quicklydisappeared to the east. Observers saw them as very bright lights – “unlikeanything I had ever seen before,” in the words of the air traffic controller.cdxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880002] This case was recorded by MUFON, which was one of just two American UFOgroups doing any significant work – the other being APRO. NICAP finallydisbanded in 1980, its files eventually acquired by CUFOS through the efforts ofSherman Larsen. cdxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880175] CUFOS itselfwas in troubled times. Its publication, the International UFO Reporter , was onhiatus for 1980 and 1981. The plan was to publish the journal through a newscience magazine, Probe . After this magazine failed, CUFOS attempted workingwith another independent publisher, Second Look . CUFOS during this period hadlittle more than the name of its founder, J. Allen Hynek, and the efforts of itssingle full-time investigator, Allen Hendry.As the weather heated up in the northern hemisphere, so did UFO activity andintrigue. Stringfield continued to make public appearances and cultivate newcontacts. On March 22, he met with two new sources in Erie, Pennsylvania, one ofwhom was directly connected in some way with the covert world. There Stringfieldwas shown three 8\" x 10\" black-and-white photos depicting a frozen, mangledalien body encased in glass. He was told the location was Wright-Patterson AFB.The print quality was poor (the photos appeared to have been reproduced severaltimes), and Stringfield thought the most striking print appeared to beretouched. He was suspicious, and decided to show the prints to a few of hissources. One of these was a scientist “working in a high level and secretcapacity in New Mexico.” This scientist in turn showed the images to anotherperson who was in a “position to know.” He then reported back to Stringfield,stating that the body in the glass case was genuine.The plot thickened on May 6, when Stringfield was presented with a copy of a newpulp magazine called UFO Sightings . This featured an article by David McCarthyentitled “Quest for Teleportation,” and featured a full-page picture of an alienbody lying face up in a glass case. Its caption read: “A prototype cryogenicfreeze chamber. The person inside is actually a mannequin encased in a specialprotective mylar foil.” While not identical, the photo was strikingly similar toone of the photos Stringfield had been shown. Disturbed, he called hisintermediary, who said the photos were reliable, that there were others whichalso showed mangled and burned humanoid forms. He suggested that the concept ofthe mannequin was phony, but admitted to being confused by this development. “Mysource is good and reliable,” he said. “The photos were from intelligencefiles.” He promised more. Sure enough, on June 2, Stringfield received eight 4\"x 5\" prints, seven showing different views of an alien body encased under glass,as well as various pieces of scientific equipment. One photo showed a hand withfour fingers and clawlike nails. Stringfield’s contact said the photo wasobtained somehow from a secret study that had been conducted at the Universityof Pennsylvania. The photo was striking, and Stringfield could not help butwonder that this one might have been “the key photo, the real one,” and that theother photos might be “diffuser” types – to be used to discredit the real one,if necessary. cdxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880326] At the MUFONsymposium of June 7 and 8, 1980, he showed the photos to a few researchers. Mostwere impressed by the key photo, but reserved judgment and agreed that he shouldlook for more substantiation. cdxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880542] Spring SightingsAlthough a number of UFO researchers maintained that the animal mutilationmystery was not related to UFOs, cases continued to come along suggesting alink. Tom Adams investigated such a case from April 1980. A farmer in centralTexas was walking through his pasture to check on a cow that was about to givebirth; instead, he saw two nonhuman creatures carrying a calf between them, eachholding one of its limbs. The farmer described them as about four feet high andof a light yellow-green color. He ran in fear, and did not return for two days,when he saw the carcass of the calf. It looked as though it had been turnedinside out, and only the head, feet, and hide remained. This farmer, in theopinion of Adams, was extremely reluctant to discuss the incident any further.cdxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880759] Throughout the southeastern U.S., unusual objects were being reported.On April 10, in the western part of North Carolina near the town of Lincolnton,witnesses saw a red, disc-shaped object shining a light towards the ground. Ittook off with an intense humming sound, leaving an exhaust trail. On May 7,about 25 miles to the northwest, a motorist in the town of Valdese experiencedinterference on his car radio and saw a domed disc directly ahead. cdxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1880951] Another caseof electromagnetic effects occurred on May 14, in central Mississippi. A husbandand wife driving on US Route 49 at about 3:30 a.m. saw a glowing disc high inthe sky. A beam of light came from it, which they drove through. As they did so,the car lights flickered about seven or eight times. They drove on withoutfurther incident. cdxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1881117] MUFON investigated several multiple witness reports from the SanFrancisco Bay area. In San Mateo on April 20 at 5:30 a.m., a man and his son sawfive Saturn-shaped objects flying above a reservoir. They were in formation atlow altitude and moving very fast. cdxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1881330] Duringmid-morning on May 2, two county employees in the Diablo Range saw a bright,shiny, spherical object moving south. Through binoculars, they saw a blue-greenband in the center and orange at the bottom. It stopped and spun over anobservatory for ten seconds, then went south. The MUFON investigator checked forballoon and aircraft traffic; none matched the sighting. cdxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1881500] A dramatic U.S. military encounter with a UFO seems to have occurred in May,1980. The account was obtained by a personal interview conducted by the author.The primary witness, a person of significant public stature, requestedanonymity. In the town of Manlius, New York (a suburb of Syracuse), whiledriving with a friend down a quiet stretch of road during the late afternoon,the witness caught a glimpse of something in the sky to the right. “Do you seethat thing?” he asked his passenger. “I’m glad you mentioned this,” she said,“because I didn’t know what I was going to say about that.” Outside, hoveringover a patch of trees, was an object described as “right out of a StevenSpielberg movie.” The witness stopped the car and stepped outside; the passengermay have remained inside. The object was disc shaped and “as large as a footballfield.” The only movement he detected was yellow, red, and green lights rotatingrapidly around the perimeter. Incredulous and astonished, he simply stared atthe object. He reasoned that if he and his friend were watching this object,other people also had to be seeing it. Sure enough, he said, a light commercialaircraft was visible, and he surmised its pilot had to see this object. He alsosaw an ‘eye in the sky’ news traffic helicopter. Certain that the sighting of anenormous flying saucer outside a major city would be newsworthy, he assumed thatthe helicopter crew was capturing the event on video. After a minute or two ofobservation, the witnesses became nervous. The object was still not moving, andhad not made a sound. Then, two jet fighters – scrambled presumably fromGriffiss Air Force Base – flew directly toward the object. At that point, theUFO took off “like a bullet” and rapidly disappeared. It was a good thing, hesaid, “as I was about to dive into my car.” That evening, he stayed up late towatch the local news, expecting the UFO sighting to receive major coverage. Notonly was the event not mentioned, he said, but the news announcer actuallystated it had been “another boring day in Syracuse.”Sometime later, the author spoke to another person who may have seen the sameevent. The witness was in his mid-teens, living in Syracuse, when in the springof 1980, his sister called the family outside to observe a UFO. The object wasin the direction of Manlius, and was an unusual hovering object, although hecould not make out significant detail. After a short while, the object departedrapidly, but he could not recall whether jets approached it. The Myrna Hansen AbductionAmid these cases occurred one with important consequences for ufology. This wasthe Myrna Hansen abduction, which took place in northeastern New Mexico on theevening of May 5. Hansen was driving with her eight-year-old son when they sawtwo huge, silent objects hovering over a mountain meadow. One was as large astwo Goodyear blimps, the other was slightly smaller and triangular. The nextthing either could remember was arriving home four hours late with noexplanation. The next day, Hansen phoned the New Mexico State Police office inCimarron. She talked about incredibly bright lights, herds of cattle, andstrange people. She was frightened and asked for help. The officer referred herto Gabriel Valdez in Dulce, who was well known by then for investigating strangeevents. Valdez in turn phoned Paul Bennewitz, whom he knew from the town meetingon cattle mutilations sponsored by Senator Harrison Schmitt the previous year.Bennewitz was a private scientist and proprietor of Thunder ScientificCorporation, and did contract work for the U.S. Department of Defense. He wasalso a member of APRO with an active interest in UFOs. He told Valdez that hecould get someone qualified for Hansen to talk to. On May 7, just two days afterher sighting, Hansen and her son were sitting in Bennewitz’s Albuquerque home.Bennewitz had spoken to APRO’s head, Jim Lorenzen, who recommended Dr. LeoSprinkle to conduct regressive hypnosis.Sprinkle arrived on May 11, finding Hansen and Bennewitz agitated and insistingthat the regression be done inside Bennewitz’s car with the windows sealed withaluminum foil. Author Gregory Bishop, who researched this matter, concluded thatBennewitz had probably been planting ideas in Hansen’s mind. Under hypnosis,Hansen recalled an intensely bright light approaching her. She stopped her carand saw a second bright object. Her son wanted to leave but she was curious. Anobject landed, cattle were bellowing loudly, and she remembered an orange light.She also remembered being taken somehow into the craft – just before sheentered, she saw a struggling cow being lifted by a kind of tractor beam intothe object. She then recalled being undressed and undergoing a physicalexamination. In further sessions with Sprinkle, she described being taken to anunderground base, seeing human body parts floating in vats, receiving anexplanation from her captors as to what they were doing with her and why theywere on Earth, and felt some sort of device being implanted in her body so thatthe aliens could monitor and control her thoughts. Sprinkle also questioned herson, who recalled the actual sighting and the panic of the cows, but littleelse. Sprinkle wanted to continue further with the hypnotic regression, butBennewitz was convinced Sprinkle was a CIA agent and ordered him to leave.How much, if any of this, was due to Bennewitz’s prior influence can only beconjecture, but many years later another witness corroborated the UFOs,bellowing cattle, and something horrible happening to one of the animals. Thiswas the wife of a Cimarron police officer who wanted to avoid publicity becauseof her husband’s job. Only seven years later did the officer confide the eventto Valdez. So Hansen’s memories could not have been completely from Bennewitz.cdxxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1881667] Especially interesting was Hansen’s reference to being taken to anunderground base. Underground bases were not a topic of discussion anywhereamong the general public in 1980. It so happens that Kirtland Air Force Base hasextensive underground facilities, most notably at its Manzano Weapons StorageArea. cdxxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1881898]It is also believed to have been the largest nuclear weapons storage site in theworld. Sometime later, Air Force Special Agent Richard Doty said that, while shewas under hypnosis with an Air Force psychologist, Hansen described and drew oneof the facilities at Manzano in great detail. “She even knew what the elevatorlooked like.” cdxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1882209] Ultimately,the case deepened the already prominent interest Paul Bennewitz had in UFOs overthe Manzano facility (which was visible from his home), and his growingconviction that there was an underground alien base in Dulce, New Mexico. Moreon that later. Close Aviation EncountersElsewhere in the world, UFO activity was picking up, including several dramaticair encounters. On May 7, 1980, a Dutch KLM airliner was flying just over 30,000feet above the Dachstein Mountains in Austria. At 3:50 p.m., the pilot saw agrey spherical object flying overhead. He reported this to the air controlcenter in Vienna, which in turn contacted military headquarters of the AustrianAir Force. The Officer in Command, Major Carl Schwarz, ordered three Saab-Draken105s to intercept. When the fighters made visual contact, two attempted tointercept, while a third took as much film footage as possible. Despite the factthat the Saab Draken 105 can achieve a top flight speed of Mach 2, the fighterswere unable to maintain chase – not only was the UFO going too fast, but it madevery challenging maneuvers. Soon, it was out of sight. At about 5:30 p.m., thepilot of a German Lufthansa aircraft saw a similar object. Again, Schwarzordered jets to intercept. One of the pilots said “we were operating at a heightof 12,000 meters. The ‘thing’ was flying very fast and then very slow. It seemedto be playing with us. The UFO was flying 3,000 meters over us, and although wetried all possible maneuvers, we couldn’t catch it.” When asked about the filmrecord of the first intercept attempt, a Major Wolfgang Brauner said “the filmsare useless.” He said he believed the object was a balloon. Few additionaldetails about this case are known. cdxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1882367] Right after this were two even more spectacular cases. These involvedthe Peruvian Air Force on May 9 and 10, 1980. On the morning of May 9, a groupof officers at the Mariano Melgar Air Base in southern Peru were standing information when they saw a round object hovering near the airfield. According todocuments of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the base commanderauthorized an SU-22 to intercept and identify the object. The SU-22 is a topfighter-bomber that can also reach Mach 2, but apparently was no match for thisobject. The pilot fired upon it at close range without causing any apparentdamage. When he tried to make a second pass on the vehicle, the UFO acceleratedout of sight. On the following evening, a UFO returned to the same area. Again,an SU-22 was scrambled, and once again the object outdistanced the aircraft. Aninteresting sidelight to the story was learned by researcher Antonio Huneeus,who later spoke with the base commander. Huneeus was told that the second SU-22was ordered not to fire on the object because the attempt from the day beforehad failed, and each missile was rather expensive. The object and its originsremained unknown in the DIA report. The departure speed was not indicated in thedocument, but the astounding thing from a technological point of view is thefact that the object had been first seen hovering. To accelerate from hoveringto a speed that easily surpasses an SU-22 is something that, nearly threedecades later, is not believed to be possible. Therein lies one of the keymysteries of this particular encounter. cdxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1882631] Another close aircraft encounter with a UFO occurred near Venice, Italyon June 11. Not much is known about it, except that it appeared in the recordsof Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which were obtained by NickRedfern. The report simply noted that a “UFO passed close to subject aircraft.Object appeared to be like a fighter aircraft drop tank.” In other words,cylinder or cigar-shaped. cdxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1882963] On June 14, 1980 many Moscow residents reported seeing a hugereddish-orange horseshoe shaped object accompanied by swirling luminous gases.During the same evening, 250 miles to the west, a Soviet colonel named V.Karyakin heard a low frequency booming noise in his ears, and then saw a brightobject in the sky less than 500 feet away from him. He ran toward it, felt someresistance but continued to push on and stopped at a distance of 150 feet. Itgave off a high pitched sound and briefly emitted three white rays, thenascended rapidly, hovered for two seconds, then moved northwesterly, thenvanished. Karyakin could not tell if it had moved at amazing speed, or ifsomeone had “turned it off.” Soon afterwards, over some treetops, he saw anotherobject. This was a large, elongated, and reddish UFO. Moving to a fifth floorwindow, he saw another bright object accompanying the red UFO, flyinghorizontally and leaving a fiery trail. As many as 30 eyewitnesses saw theevent, which was investigated by Soviet military and scientific personnel. Theyconcluded that what had been seen by these witnesses were the launches of twoSoviet communications satellites, a Gorizont and Kosmos 1188. Researcher PaulStonehill remarked, “some of what was observed can definitely be explained bythe launches, but what about the rest?” cdxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1883125] On June 20, a UFO was seen in Kuwait. At 9 p.m., a senior Kuwait Airwayspilot was descending at 15,000 feet when he and his crew saw a “huge ball ofbright light shaped like a hemisphere (half a Moon shape).” He estimated itsdiameter to be an astonishing ten miles, “with the flat base of the sphereapproximately the same level as the aircraft.” The object, or whatever it was,was northwest of Kuwait City, moving east at a slightly slower speed than hisown speed of 320 knots. The object was visible until he descended below the hazeand approached the runway. The crew of another flight 90 miles away reported thesame thing, which was not picked up on any radar. The event was investigated bythe Kuwait Ministry of the Interior and noted in a U.S. Embassy report to theState Department, Secretary of Defense, and various embassies. cdxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1883305] An interesting, though undated, 1980 photograph was taken of an apparent UFO inFrance. The witness was taking landscape photographs when a luminous objectsuddenly appeared. A wide beam emanated from the hovering object. The photographis from the UFO files of the Gendarmerie Nationale, which offered no additionalinformation about the picture. A Strange HarvestAt the behest of the State of New Mexico, former FBI agent Kenneth Rommel hadinvestigated cattle mutilation phenomenon for about a year – from 1979 tomid-1980. Just as his investigation ended (and he was preparing his conclusionthat the animal deaths were caused by predators), Linda Moulton Howe aired herdocumentary on the mutilation phenomenon for KMGH-TV (CBS) in Denver, Coloradoon May 28, 1980, as a 2-hour special. A Strange Harvest provided strikingvisuals of the phenomenon.One segment featured a visit by Howe to laser surgeon Arlen Meyers, M.D., atRose Medical Center in Denver. She wanted to see how long it took to excisetissue with a laser, and how laser excisions compared with mutilation cases.Meyers demonstrated on poultry the difference between trying to cut a circlewith a traditional scalpel, an electrical cauterizer, and a laser. After severalminutes of applying a laser, he was able to burn a circle of flesh that was onlythree inches in diameter, which moreover was charred with carbon. This wasnothing like the excisions from mutilation cases, some of which were twenty-fourinches long and perfectly carbon-free. Further, Meyers pointed out the dauntingtask of transporting a 400 pound device, along with its power supply, from onemutilation site to another without attracting attention, a task made moredifficult when one could not leave tracks behind, as was typically the case.Howe also interviewed Lou Girodo, Chief Investigator for the District Attorney’sOffice in Trinidad, Colorado. Girodo had been assigned to investigatemysterious, bloodless, trackless animal deaths in southern Colorado and told heron camera that he and other investigators had concluded the perpetrators were“creatures not from this planet.” Howe then traveled to Fort Carson, south ofDenver near Colorado Springs, home of the quiet Cobra helicopter in order todetermine how much noise it made at a distance of one mile. She found it to befairly noisy; their landings and takeoffs were like “local hurricanes,” shesaid. The documentary also featured a hypnotic regression session conducted byLeo Sprinkle with Janet Doraty, who said she witnessed a mutilation outsideHouston, Texas, during the spring of 1973. Under hypnosis, Doraty describedseeing a calf drawn up in a pale yellow beam of light into a UFO. She saw greybeings inside a round room with the calf, and in close detail she described howthe tongue glistened as a surgical instrument cut it. She also recalled seeingthe non-human entities scraping tissue from her teenage daughter’s mouth.While there had been some published research on matter of mutilations, Howe’stelevision documentary easily reached the largest number of people, and wasawarded a Regional Emmy. A Strange Harvest quickly became instrumental infocusing the debate among researchers as to whether or not there was aconnection between UFOs and mutilations. Three years later, Home Box Office(HBO) would contract with her to produce an hour-long documentary for itsnetwork, a story that developed its own interesting saga. cdxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1883545] Mutilation cases were frequent during the summer of 1980, mostespecially in Dulce, where dead and mutilated animals were being found almostweekly by Gabriel Valdez. Residents were becoming accustomed to seeing strangelights in the area, specifically near Mount Archuleta, a fact that took onadditional meaning when some recalled having heard what sounded likeconstruction activity near the mountain during the early 1970s. cdxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1884040] Paul Bennewitzincreasingly became convinced that an alien base was beneath the area, one whichwas slowly replacing Washington, D.C. as the main location of governmental andmilitary control of the planet. cdxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1884220] Stringfield and The PhotosMeanwhile, Leonard Stringfield continued to collect accounts of alleged crashretrievals. During the summer of 1980, he obtained some corroboration of thephoto of the alien under glass. This came from one of his key sources, aphysician who had performed an autopsy on an alien in the 1950s, who told himthe photo showed similar features to the alien he had autopsied in the 1950s.Some of Stringfield’s other sources were also telling him about live aliens inmilitary custody.In August, another set of photos alleging to show part of an alien bodyrecovered from the wreckage of a UFO was released through the auspices of a UFOresearcher named Willard McIntyre. To the best of anyone’s knowledge, McIntyrereceived these through an anonymous Navy source. William Spalding of GroundSaucer Watch analyzed them and suggested that the creature was a monkey used inearly military rocket tests. Stringfield wondered if the photos were being usedto discredit him. They were released by Charles Wilhelm and Dennis Pilichis,members of an organization called the Coalition of Concerned Ufologists, whospent much of their time attacking Stringfield’s research and credibility.Wilhelm lived in Ohio, very close to Stringfield. Was it mere coincidence thatWilhelm also obtained alleged photos of an alien cadaver – photos which wereshown to be hoaxes? cdxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1884377] ManzanoElsewhere, the plot was thickening. In late July 1980, APRO received a letterwith no return address from an anonymous writer claiming to be an airmanassigned to Kirtland AFB. The writer described the alleged experience of an18-year-old member of the Civil Air Patrol named Craig Weitzel. The incidenttook place 20 miles east of the Santa Fe National Forest, near the town ofPecos, on July 16, 1980. During a morning training mission, Weitzel and tenother people saw a UFO land in a nearby clearing. An individual dressed in ametallic suit came out of the craft and walked a short distance, and withinminutes returned to the craft. The writer said Weitzel took pictures and thegroup was debriefed at Kirtland. The following day, Weitzel was visited by a manin a dark suit and sunglasses, claiming to be from Sandia Labs. The man demandedthe pictures and warned Weitzel not to talk about the incident. Weitzel repliedthat he had already given them to Kirtland AFB. According to the letter, Weitzelreported the man to a “Mr. Dody,” a Kirtland AFB security officer.The writer of the letter mentioned “serious rumors” concerning crashed UFOsbeing kept at Kirtland’s Manzano storage area. Scientists from Sandia NationalLaboratory had examined several UFOs during the past 20 years, including “partsof one that crashed near Roswell, NM.... That is still being stored in Manzano.”Finally, claimed the writer, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations(AFOSI) had taken over UFO investigations when Project Blue Book was closed, anda secret detachment also investigated the cattle mutilation mystery.Jim Lorenzen of APRO thought the letter was probably nonsense, but it did havedates and places that could be checked. He eventually sent the letter to WilliamMoore, who found Weitzel and spoke to him. Weitzel confirmed he had seen astrange, silvery object in the skies, but denied taking pictures or receiving avisit from a man in black. Moreover, he claimed, the incident occurred not inNew Mexico, but the southeastern U.S. The conclusion by researcher GregoryBishop seems reasonable: the letter was “a load of manure with a rhinestonethrown in,” and was concocted as a “feeler” by AFOSI to see who could be used asan insider asset. That asset was beginning to look like William Moore. Indeed,much later on, Richard Doty told Moore that he had composed the letter as“bait.” cdxlv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1884688] But how much of the letter was manure? The Manzano Weapons Storage Area was thescene of genuine UFO activity. Shortly before midnight on the night of August8-9, 1980, three security policemen on the eastern side of Manzano saw a “verybright light in the sky” about three miles north-northeast of their position.Initially, they thought it might have been a helicopter, but they assumedotherwise when it traveled south extremely fast and then stopped suddenly overCoyote Canyon. The light then descended and appeared to land in the CoyoteCanyon area, somewhat east of the Manzano complex. The guards contacted CentralSecurity Control (CSC) inside Manzano, which in turn contacted Sandia Security.At about 12:20 a.m., a Sandia guard on routine patrol noticed an intense brightlight hovering motionless near the ground. It was behind a building of thefacility. Thinking this might be a helicopter with bright lights, he approached,shotgun in hand. When he tried to use his radio, he found it had stoppedworking. He then realized the light was actually a disc shaped object. It shotstraight up and was gone. The other security policemen, who had originally seenthe bright object, were several miles away. They also saw it shoot up at highspeed and disappear.There were other UFO landings at or near Kirtland that month. During the priorweek, in fact, another Sandia guard had seen an unknown object land near analarmed structure, but he did not report it for a month “for fear ofharassment.” On the night of August 10, a New Mexico State Patrolman reported alanding of an unknown craft between Belen and Albuquerque. On August 22, threesecurity policemen (different from the ones from August 8-9) observed an objectland once again in Coyote Canyon.A report of these incidents was prepared by AFOSI Special Agent Richard Doty atKirtland. The document was leaked to William Moore in January 1982 and wasobtained in a subsequent FOIA request by Barry Greenwood. Moore and BruceMaccabee separately investigated this case, obtaining essentially the sameinformation. Both interviewed Doty, who stated he personally investigated theincident and that there were “most likely” other documents pertaining to it.Moore in particular interviewed other personnel who corroborated that somethinghad happened that night at Manzano.In 1984, Doty even told Maccabee that he had written a longer follow-up report,and advised Maccabee to write to AFOSI Headquarters to obtain all releasableinformation. However, when Maccabee did so, the officer there, Noah Lawrence,told him there were no other documents on file. Lawrence even phoned Doty, whonow appeared to reverse direction, claiming that there was no suchdocumentation. Lawrence told Maccabee there was a “discrepancy” in what Dotytold the two of them. According to what Maccabee learned, Doty’s commandingofficer interviewed Doty and evidently reported back to Lawrence that Dotydenied the existence of any other document. As far as Lawrence was concerned,that ended the matter.Maccabee investigated further. He sought the permission of Russ Curtis, one ofthe names mentioned in Doty’s document, to obtain an escort inside therestricted area of Manzano. He met Curtis and showed him Doty’s report. Curtis’sreply surprised him: the event never happened, the whole thing was untrue.Maccabee did not know at the time that this contradicted Curtis’s statement toMoore in 1982. Maccabee left, feeling Curtis was hiding something important. Hecontinued to attempt to obtain follow-up documents on the incident, in vain, butcame away convinced the event was real. The Air Force has never disputed theauthenticity of Doty’s report, it has simply never admitted the existence of anyfollowup documents. cdxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1884898]Could Manzano actually have been a location for the storage of a crashed UFO, asDoty’s letter to APRO claimed? If so, could UFO testing have been going onthere? Were the UFOs at Manzano extraterrestrial or ‘made in the U.S.A.’? Philip Klass: A Covert AttackSince the 1960s, Philip Klass had been the world’s most prominent UFO debunker,and certainly the most effective at influencing public discourse. As is oftenthe case for people who live public lives, Klass’s success was all in theattitude. He had outstanding connections in the academic, aviation, defense, andjournalistic communities. Exuding confidence at all times, he understood thatactually explaining UFO sightings was less important than making them – andtheir proponents – appear to be ridiculous. Among his arsenal of weapons werecharacter assassination and overt intimidation, which he used effectively in the1960s against the physicist Dr. James McDonald, who at the time was the mostimportant UFO researcher in the world.In 1980, Klass turned his sights on Stanton Friedman. Friedman had just marrieda Canadian citizen and was in the process of moving to New Brunswick.Recognizing an opportunity, Klass sent a letter on August 15, 1980 to Dr. A. G.McNamara of the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Ottawa. cdxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1885145] This instituteworked for the Canadian National Research Council (NRC) as a repository forCanadian UFO reports. Essentially, the NRC served as Canada’s “Project BlueBook,” accepting reports from citizens regarding alleged UFOs. Like America’sBlue Book of the 1950s and 1960s, the NRC did little more than file thethousands of earnest and detailed letters from mystified citizens without everreading them. Canadian UFO reports were something of a bastard child. No onewanted them, but the astronomers at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics werestuck with the job of receiving them.Klass’s letter to the NRC was a straightforward smear of Friedman. According toKlass, Friedman was a “full-time UFO lecturer (of the ‘snake-oil salesman’variety),” and was moving to Canada “to become its chief UFO Guru.” He was“quite a showman,” wrote Klass, whose lectures were “so filled with half-truthsand falsehoods that it would take me several hours to offer a rebuttal. And likewrestling with an octopus, when you manage to pin down one leg, the other sevenare still thrashing about.” Klass disparaged Friedman’s professional credentialsas a nuclear physicist, twice referred to his “mountainous ego,” and called him“something of an outcast” within the UFO “movement.” Klass also enclosed a“White Paper” he prepared on Friedman “that illustrates the man’s modus-operandiand his distortion of facts.” 4[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1764997] Klass’s stated motive in sending the letter was to warn the scientists at NRCthat Friedman would now be focusing on them. “I can assure you,” he wrote, “thatyou and your associates will be publicly accused of a UFO Cover-up (or ‘CosmicCover-up,’ as he is prone to say)....” Klass painted Friedman as a dangerous manwho must be dealt with “cautiously,” as he was “inclined to distort the factsand exploit any ambiguity” in their statements. Klass made sure to request thatthe recipients “treat this letter in confidence, sharing it with appropriateassociates as you see fit.” In other words, to tell as many people as theycould, but behind Friedman’s back.It was ironic that Klass twice mentioned Friedman’s “mountainous ego.” Klassevidently felt he had no such ego problems, despite the presumption of suchunsolicited character assassination. While he and Friedman had frequentlydebated publicly, their relations for years were professional and cordial.Obviously, the letter was not a well-meaning warning as Klass portrayed it.Rather, it was an attempt to intimidate scientists who were alreadyuncomfortable with receiving UFO reports. Judging by the internal memos hisletter generated, Klass achieved his intended effect. Ten days later, a notefrom one of the scientists at NRC mentioned the letter and worried that “we canill afford the publicity [Friedman] will generate for us.” The next statementspeaks volumes about how these men thought of UFOs: “Since there is no sciencein the subject of UFO’s perhaps we should think again about the possibility ofturning the so-called ‘UFO file’ over to some body with no responsibility forthe conduct of scientific research.” One cannot help but think of the thousandsof Canadian citizens whose hard work authoring detailed reports of UFO sightingsand encounters, was wasted when men such as these at the NRC simply cast theminto the proverbial circular file unread and most likely unopened.Although the NRC was unable fully to unload its UFO responsibilities, it didremove most of its UFO files. Apparently as a result of Klass’s letter, thedecision was made that as of January 1, 1981, any UFO file more than a year oldwould be turned over to the Public Archives of Canada. 5[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1765209] What Klass did was impressive. He created a bogeyman for a group ofeasily frightened scientists and enabled them to divest themselves of a largeportion of their “UFO connection.” Seen in the broader context of his career,this was his typical modus operandi. cdxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1885487] Another such “Klassic” incident occurred regarding a UFO conference that tookplace at the University of Nebraska on November 11 and 12, 1983. This wasorganized by the MUFON State Director for Nebraska, Ray Boeche. Klass learnedabout the event three months in advance, and immediately placed telephone callsto the Conference Coordinator, Russ Free and the Director of Conferences at theUniversity, Robert Mortensen. Klass wanted to know why a prestigious universitywould sponsor such a conference. Apparently, he was so unpleasant that theUniversity’s Assistant to the Chancellor, Dr. John K. Yost, initiated aninvestigation. One reason was that Klass claimed there was a political agenda tothe conference. In the words of Mortensen,Mr. Klass has a personal feeling that the nature of this conference seriouslyquestions the integrity of the United States government. He feels that there isno scientific evidence to support the claims of the and indicated that theseorganizations, by publicly questioning the government, lend support to theCommunist movement.Thus Klass revealed one of his key motivations at UFO debunking to be anexplicit support of the U.S. government and national security community. At anyevent, the conference took place as scheduled. cdxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1885698] Klass’s actual analyses of the UFO phenomenon were consistently shallow andpolitically motivated. His true legacy lies in his efforts – sometimes quiet,sometimes public – to persuade and frighten appropriate targets away from thestudy of UFOs. Whether or not he did this on behalf of the U.S. intelligencecommunity has (as of this writing) not been proven publicly. However, the duckscertainly appear to be lining up. More TrianglesIn terms of UFO activity, one of the most important developments in the U.S. wasthe continuing appearances of triangular aircraft. Several reports during thefall of 1980 indicate that this unusual shape was being seen in a variety ofplaces. On September 13, people camping in Hamilton, Texas, woke up when theirtent was lit up with a yellow glow. Outside was a loud humming sound; above themat no more than 125 feet was a triangular object. The underside was a greenishor greyish, and two lights appeared at each tip in a combination ofyellow-white, red-green, and blue-white. The object was moving north very slowlybut stopped for about ten seconds and began to pulsate, almost sounding asthough it would stall. It started up again, headed north and was soon gone.Thirty minutes later, the group heard a loud explosion, and some members sawsparks from above the top of the hill. The case was investigated by MUFON, whichcould find no conventional explanation. cdl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1885861] An undated case of a black triangle, also investigated by MUFON, comesfrom the fall of 1980 and was witnessed by two women near Middletown, New York.They described it as about 60 feet long, with a bluish white light and a whitespotlight. Like the Texas triangle, this object made a humming noise. cdli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1886056] Yet anothertriangular or boomerang-shaped object was reported on October 23, 1980, seenover a copper smelting site in the town of Morenci, Arizona. This object shone abright light downward, accelerated rapidly, and made non-inertial,non-aerodynamic maneuvers. cdlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1886231] The Roswell Incident and the SpooksIn the fall of 1980, The Roswell Incident , by William Moore and CharlesBerlitz, was published. Stanton Friedman, who had done substantial research forthe book, was supposed to get equal billing as an author, but Berlitz – apublished author with substantial connections in the book industry – at the lastmoment changed the plan. Other than the brief passages in Stringfield’sSituation Red , this was the first book since Frank Scully’s Behind the FlyingSaucers (1950) to argue that a UFO had crashed and been retrieved by U.S.military personnel. This time, however, the argument gained traction. Friedmanand Moore, even at this early stage, had interviewed dozens of people connectedto the case, and put together a reasonably strong argument that something trulyexotic – not just a weather balloon – had crashed near Roswell in July 1947. Tobe sure, not all UFO researchers believed this. But many did, or at least feltthe case warranted further investigation. Just a few years earlier, talk ofcrash retrievals among UFO researchers was simply not done . Stringfield’sresearch had gone a long way toward changing that, but The Roswell Incidentsolidified ufology’s transformation. Roswell was an idea whose time had come.That September, William Moore did a promotional tour for the book. While at aradio station in Omaha, Nebraska, he received a phone call from someone whoidentified himself as a colonel from nearby Offutt AFB. The man said “we thinkyou’re the only one we’ve heard that seems to know what he’s talking about.”Moore was unable to meet him, but took his phone number. After an interview inAlbuquerque, another caller told Moore exactly the same thing. Moore met withthis caller, who had an Eastern European accent and said he represented a groupof U.S. intelligence agents who wanted to end UFO secrecy. Their goal was torelease more accurate information to the public, and they wanted to do thisthrough a reputable researcher. But Moore would have to provide them withinformation, as well. The man, whose code name was “Falcon,” gave no details onthis yet, but Moore agreed nevertheless. There has been some discussion over theidentity of the person, much of which has centered on Richard Doty. But Moorealways maintained it was somebody else. According to Gregory Bishop, “Moorebelieved he could get his hands dirty just enough to lead those directing theprocess into believing that he was doing exactly what they wanted him to do. Allthe while he would continue to burrow his way into the defense and intelligencematrix to learn who was directing it and why.” cdliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1886441] “A Mysterious Silence”In late September, Stringfield was contacted by “Jeffrey Morse,” the militarypoliceman at McGuire AFB connected with the shooting of an alien entity in 1978,an event certainly as dramatic as the Roswell incident. In October, anotherfirst-hand informant told Stringfield of a retrieval operation in Yucca Valley,California, from 1947. By now, Stringfield had 20 first-hand reports, ten moresince the publication of his monograph in January, 1980. But it was also at thistime, during the fall of 1980, that he began to encounter a “mysterious silence”from all of his sources. On October 21, one of them told him, “my source [aformer CIA employee] can’t talk about UFOs. He refused to answer any of myquestions on the photos or the live retrievals.... He’s had his knucklesspanked.” Stringfield’s key medical source also became silent. While this personhad previously been open and helpful, he now told Stringfield, “I can’t commenton anything.” Other sources also dried up, all at once. In late November, one ofhis contacts, who had been in hiding, wrote that “it seems you have struck anerve in the spinal cord of the jokers who know what is happening.” This personhad been under heavy surveillance, he said, since Stringfield had spoken in Juneat the MUFON symposium. cdliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1886706] The Strange Signals of Paul BennewitzThroughout the summer and fall of 1980, Paul Bennewitz kept a close eye on theManzano Weapons Storage Area. Bennewitz was a trained scientist who had donecontract work for the Defense Department. He had an array of equipment that waspicking up low-frequency electromagnetic pulses and recording aerial displays.During the fall of 1980, he called Kirtland AFB about this. He believed that thedisplays were genuine UFOs and the pulses were alien signals of various sorts.Some were alien messages directed to the implants of abductees (although why hebelieved this is not clear). 6[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1765471] Other signalsseemed to be about an alien base. Many of Bennewitz’s notes are gone orunavailable, but some exist – and make for strange reading. The following are‘messages’ he received with what he described as “analog recording equipment” inOctober 1980.Den under Archuleta Peak. West of peak, snow gone. Go west 1 km. Enter ram badjudgement. Attach cable. Drag ramp away. Drown good until Ant Widow beg forlife. Death eats hate. Fox kill dead. Go down a railed entry. Strike fast. Enemyvery tough at death. When at each turn test air. Key to effective fight, fear –ejection. Arbitrated peace no heed and deny or death take you. Do cut jugular.Go no further to arrange deal. State day they leave Earth. Near Lyra orbit. Agentle act does cause material good. Take fact first. Take until a black autohit has seen chase. No let catch or upset you. Have Den racked. Aim well. Abrave death has man.He wrote a series of separate interpretations of these statements, and believedthey were instructions on how to attack and destroy the alien base under Dulce’sArchuleta Peak. cdlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1886921]"},{"pageContent":"Bennewitz was worried. All this seemed very wrong. His communications withKirtland AFB resulted in a personal meeting with AFOSI Special Agent RichardDoty. Doty’s office had jurisdiction over all criminal and securityinvestigations at Kirtland and Manzano. Accompanied by Air Force physicist LewMiles, Doty went to Bennewitz’s home on October 26. They saw Bennewitz’simpressive array of equipment, various photographs, and heard recordings of manyof his signals – including, we might assume, the cryptic message regardingArchuleta Peak. At the request of the NSA, which had a major presence atKirtland, Doty secretly photographed everything he saw. cdlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887095]Bennewitz was invited to Kirtland AFB on November 10 to present his findings toa small group of officers and scientists. In attendance was commander BrigadierGeneral William Brooksher, four colonels, two AFOSI men, and several scientistsfrom Phillips Laboratories. Doty does not appear to have attended. Bennewitzdescribed the Manzano UFOs, his work with Myrna Hansen, and his thoughts on ET.When he asked for financial support to continue his investigation, he wasadvised to apply for an Air Force grant. It is possible that Bennewitz receiveda grant from the NSA, which appeared to be most interested in his work,particularly the discovery of the signals emanating from Kirkland. cdlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887259] A week later, on November 17, Doty told Bennewitz that AFOSI had decidedagainst further consideration of the matter. This was not true. In reality,Bennewitz’s story had created great concern within sectors of themilitary-intelligence community. Somewhere within AFOSI, DIA, or the NSA, thedecision was made that Bennewitz would be allowed to continue his work, so thatit could be learned how he obtained his information. cdlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887415] To do this,Doty befriended Bennewitz and expressed enthusiasm about his research. Yearslater, when Doty discussed this on the radio show Coast to Coast with Art Bell,he argued that AFOSI’s interest in Bennewitz had nothing to do with UFOs oraliens. 7 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1765731]Rather, it was to protect the technologies and activities at Kirtland. Whatfollowed was a program on Bennewitz that involved monitoring and misinformation,most of it passive. When, for example, Bennewitz asked Doty to let him know ifhe “tapped into something” that was going on at Kirtland, Doty merely nodded andsaid Bennewitz had found “something unknown.” Doty did not so much tell storiesof aliens as allow Bennewitz’s belief system to take over. cdlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887628]Here we reach the core issue. What exactly did Paul Bennewitz uncover? Were thethings he observed and recorded secret military projects that required countermeasures for reasons of national security? Or were they more exotic still, inother words related to UFOs?Let us look at Dulce first. In the margins of his transcription of the messageabout the “Den under Archuleta Peak,” Bennewitz wrote “from this, we found thefirst base by helicopter.” Evidently, the notes referred to something real.Bennewitz was a private pilot and flew his airplane over Dulce throughout the1980s, finding and photographing what he believed was evidence of an alienpresence on the mountain. On several occasions he flew with other people fromKirtland, including Doty and Colonel Ernest Edwards, chief of security at theManzano facility. While many thought Bennewitz’s photos were unremarkable, thereis reason to believe that there were artifacts on the mountain. According toDoty, Archuleta Peak was used as a special operations training area during the1970s until 1983. Military hardware was on the ground, as was a helicopterlanding zone with landing lights. Without saying anything explicitly, he and histeam nudged Bennewitz along in his belief that these were signs of an alienpresence. In Doty’s view, this was not part of an active counterintelligenceoperation against Bennewitz. “Paul made up his own mind as to what he saw.” cdlx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887818] It is also true, however, that other people have trekked to the areawhere Paul Bennewitz is said to have gone, and found absolutely nothing. Onesuch researcher was Richard Sauder. Armed with notes of Bennewitz’s that gavedetailed locations to the various artifacts to be found as well as openings tounderground facilities, Sauder searched diligently, but did not find a thing.Admittedly, his search took place in the early 1990s, a full decade afterBennewitz’s direct involvement with Dulce, but nevertheless not a trace wasfound. It was Sauder’s opinion that this was because there was in fact nothingto find. However, his own extensive research into underground bases and tunnelsdid lead him to speculate that a “Dulce” base might have been real, but in alocation other than Dulce, New Mexico, possibly closer to Los Alamos. cdlxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1887991] So perhaps military hardware was the answer to Dulce, or perhaps theanswer is that there was nothing there all along. But some of Bennewitz’sencounters while flying around Dulce were truly bizarre. One story comes fromRon Regehr, a MUFON research specialist who was employed by the company Aerojetto build the Defense Support Program (DSP) spy satellite. During the 1980s,Regehr and Bennewitz became friends, frequently discussing Bennewitz’s research.Around 1985, Bennewitz told Regehr that he flew several times around Dulce in ahelicopter with Colonel Edwards. On one occasion over Dulce, said Bennewitz, asilver spherical object approached them at a tremendous speed and came to withinjust a few feet away. Airborne radar had even tracked it as it approached.Regehr thereupon surprised the Colonel with a visit at his office, mentioningthat Bennewitz had told him some “interesting stories” about their helicopterflight over Dulce. According to Regehr, Edwards immediately repeated the exactstory that Bennewitz had told him. Years later, Regehr laughed when he recalledasking the Colonel whether he thought the object was “intelligently controlled.”The Colonel merely looked at him as though he lacked all common sense. InColonel Edwards’s opinion, it was clear that the object was “not one of ours.”cdlxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1888214] Then there is the matter of the strange signals and ‘messages’ Bennewitzreceived that suggested an alien base was under Archuleta Peak. These werecoming in as early as 1980, before Bennewitz was in the crosshairs of thenational security establishment. How did he get these recordings, how was hegetting them in English, and where were they coming from? The author discussedthis matter with Regehr, who had received many of Bennewitz’s notes,photographs, and drawings. Even after reviewing all the available data, Regehrwas unsure how Bennewitz got the messages. It makes no sense that Bennewitzcould translate an alien code into English. Regehr speculated that Bennewitzmight have received a compressed English-language audio signal, then used hisequipment to uncompress it. cdlxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1888382] That Bennewitzwas using an analog computer could have been helpful, said Regehr, allowing himto process the data with more precision, albeit more slowly. If these wereEnglish-language messages, this would not necessarily rule out an alien origin(feasibly aliens could transmit English if they wanted), but of course it couldwell mean that Bennewitz had intercepted a deep black message that was not meantfor his ears.So much for the Dulce connection. What of the lights and ‘things’ seen overKirtland and Manzano? To be sure, there was a great deal of classified activitythere. Beneath Manzano was one of the world’s largest repositories of nuclearweapons, stored within a labyrinthian system of tunnels and undergroundfacilities. There was also an interesting piece of technology known as theStarfire Optical Range. This was an extremely advanced system used to resolveoverhead satellites, presumably Soviet. It had the incredible ability to readserial numbers on satellites at a distance of 100 miles traveling at 20,000 mph,and possibly to disable them. cdlxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1888551] Anotherinteresting piece of technology at Kirtland was a large electromagnetic platformused to test aircraft vulnerability to electromagnetic pulses, similar to whatwould be encountered in a nuclear blast. It is feasible that some of the thingsBennewitz saw had to do with these technologies. Yet, other people were seeingaerial displays that appeared to go far beyond these. Perhaps Bennewitz, too,was seeing and detecting something more exotic, be it homegrown flying saucersdeveloped in the deep black, or technology belonging to other beings altogetherwho came by now and then to observe all the commotion.Adding to the intrigue are rumors that a “Project Sigma,” allegedly an NSAprogram to communicate with non-humans, was based at least in part out ofKirtland AFB since the 1960s, or even earlier. In a communication with theauthor, Linda Moulton Howe stated that she personally had been shown from adistance an NSA structure at Kirtland that was said to house Project Sigma.According to her source, Sigma operated by sending out various Hertz signalsidentified as operational with Grey, Nordic, or other craft. If Sigma was infact real, this could easily explain Bennewitz’s sightings, which would be aliencraft attracted by the signals being generated. And if Bennewitz did stumbleonto Project Sigma, surely this would have been more than sufficient cause forMJ-12 to order an immediate end to the threat this posed. cdlxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1888955]Bennewitz was convinced he had stumbled onto a grave matter. Toward the end ofthe decade, he become so tightly wound that he suffered an emotional and mentalcollapse. In 1980, however, there is no evidence that he was unhinged, nor thathe could concoct such a detailed fantasy, regardless of his personal beliefs.His notes of this period are sophisticated, clear, and precise. His scientificskills were well appreciated by those who knew him, including the many militarypersonnel and officers he dealt with. It is entirely possible that PaulBennewitz obtained genuine English language transmissions and saw genuine UFOsover Kirtland and Manzano. Unfortunately, the full truth of the matter may neverbe known outside the classified world, if it is known anywhere. Moore Slides DeeperDuring the late fall of 1980, while Bennewitz was getting the attention of theNSA and AFOSI, William Moore met again with his mysterious connection, “Falcon,”in an Albuquerque restaurant. This time he was introduced to none other thanRichard Doty. Moore was annoyed because he had been given bogus leads by hiscontact when they had met the previous month. He wanted to know what was goingon. Falcon told him he had “passed the test.” Moore now learned his job would beto track selected UFO researchers and report their opinions. Falcon repeatedthat he represented an elite group that was unhappy with UFO secrecy. He toldMoore that Doty would be his main contact.On November 17, the same day that Doty met with Bennewitz, Moore also met withDoty at Kirtland AFB. Doty brought Moore to a video screen which displayedclassified communications before they were printed on a teletype. According towhat Moore later remembered, the documents originated from AFOSI headquarters atBolling AFB in Washington, D.C. The text described a detailed analysis ofBennewitz’s photos and film. It also stated that the NSA was monitoringBennewitz, and that a “Project Aquarius” was classified Top Secret with accesslimited to a group called MJ-12. Just what was Project Aquarius? Or, for thatmatter, MJ-12? cdlxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1889133] There are two basic positions one can take as to what was going on here. One isthat, as Falcon told Moore, there was a faction within the intelligencecommunity that wanted to end UFO secrecy, but had to do it safely. Selected bitsand pieces of information would be released to Moore. Accordingly, the releaseof the occasional misinformation – perhaps better described simply as variationsof specific documents – would be to track the actual progress and destinationsof the leaked information.The other position is that Moore was being used to confuse the UFO researchfield, and was simply being fed lies. Indeed, Moore would soon be giving atampered version of the Aquarius document to Bennewitz. If we consider thissecond scenario, we must ask what was being protected? Was it the thoroughlyterrestrial programs that were being compromised by Bennewitz? Or did it includethe objects that were being seen over Kirtland and Manzano, as well as thetransmissions Bennewitz was recording? People were, after all, seeing strange,inexplicable objects over the area.It is well to remember that interference with Bennewitz seemed to fit with apattern emerging elsewhere against other UFO researchers, like LeonardStringfield. It could be that the recent revelations obtained through FOIA, theleaks that passed through Stringfield, Howe’s documentary linking animalmutilations to extraterrestrials, the interest in the crash at Roswell, and nowBennewitz’s obsession with alien implants and messages, were becoming realthreats to UFO secrecy, threats that needed to be disabled.Toward this end, the infiltration of APRO by the intelligence community is worthnoting. In 1980, Moore was APRO’s most prominent member. The Lorenzens wereaware that he had connections to the world of intelligence, and had known for along time that their group was being watched. Without getting into specifics,Moore had told them several times about his connections. They urged him tocontinue “but keep APRO out of it.” Doty claimed that APRO was “full of people”on the Air Force payroll, and Moore also said that “two or three” other APROresearchers had arrangements with the Air Force similar to his own. None ofthese other individuals ever came forward, even if some – such as researcherKevin Randle – were known to be members of APRO at the same time as beingmembers of the U.S. Air Force. cdlxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1889338] Cases at the End of 1980The relative lull of UFOs that started in 1979 continued through most of 1980.However, a flurry of encounters began in October. Paul Dong recorded 33 UFOreports from China during the last three months of the year. In northern China,people in Tianjin saw several objects over a major power plant and oil field. At3 a.m. on October 5, five off-duty metalworkers at the Dagang oilfield saw acone-shaped, red, glowing object. It lit the area below, and workers felt ascorching heat as it flew by and disappeared over the Bohai Sea. cdlxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1889495] On October 16,during the approach of an aircraft at the Tianjin airport, radar picked up asecond target. It gave a strong, distinct echo, seemed to cause strong radiointerference as the airplane touched down, but was not seen visually. cdlxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1889679] By November,the official China news agency announced that a government association was beingset up to study UFOs throughout the country. cdlxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1889839] For China, aland so isolated for centuries, there was no longer any turning back.Also interesting was a flap of sightings occurring in Britain, several of whichinvolved the Royal Air Force. One undated event from November concerned RAFNeatishead, Norfolk, when ground-based radar tracked an object executing aerialmaneuvers that “defied all convention.” The object was seen by an RAF Phantompilot, who described it as very bright and directly in front of him. Senior RAFpersonnel questioned witnesses and confiscated the radar tapes. Another eventoccurred on November 25, when a glowing orange ball maneuvered around an oilplatform in the North Sea at 6:40 a.m. The RAF dispatched a Nimrod aircraft tothe area, but no conclusions were ever officially reached. cdlxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1890038] One of the oddest UFO events of the period was a series of aerialencounters over Spain that took place exactly one year to the day after aprevious aerial encounter in that country. In this case, not one but sevencommercial aircraft encountered an inexplicable green sphere that movedintelligently and with incredible capabilities. This took place in thenortheastern portion of the Iberian Peninsula on November 11, 1980. The aircraftinvolved were an Iberia 727 flying from the province of Asturias to Barcelona;another Iberia 727 en route from Barcelona to Athens; two Iberia 727s flyingshuttle services between Madrid and Barcelona; a British airliner en route fromEngland to Alicante; an air-taxi from Palma de Mallorca bound for Marseilles;and a Transeuropa aircraft en route from the Balearic Islands to Bordeaux.Spanish journalist Juan J. Benitez investigated the cases, determining thateither seven identical UFOs were involved, or a single object was responsible,one that was capable of traveling hundreds of miles within minutes. CaptainRamos of the Asturias-Barcelona flight told Benitez that at 6:40 p.m., a greenlight appeared from his 10 o’clock position, moving at a near collision coursetoward the airliner. Ramos, along with his co-pilot and two flight mechanics,watched in apprehension as the bright green light approached, appearing like asphere or “soap bubble.” He dove his aircraft 300 or 400 feet, as the spherecrossed in front of him and moved south. Other lights became visible, inparticular a second, smaller, “ball.” Barcelona flight control informed Ramosthat the only other traffic in the area was an English aircraft bound forAlicante. Shortly after this encounter, the captain of the Transeuropa reported“green traffic” on his route.According to Benitez, the curious thing was that this same fast-flying brightgreen sphere was seen at the same time from five other aircraft, each atdifferent points in the northeastern part of Spain. In one case, while oneaircraft was approaching the Barcelona Airport, the sphere came right down andbuzzed the runway. It then shot straight up into the sky. The event left Benitezto conclude that the objects were “machines crewed by beings that have nothingwhatsoever to do with our world.” Perhaps – but perhaps also by beings that hada great deal to do with this world, but who were not openly recognized by thehuman power structure of 1980. cdlxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1890197] Encounters in Rendlesham ForestThe Rendlesham Forest incident remains, decades after it occurred, among themost important and controversial UFO cases ever. Important because it involved alanding of an unknown craft near two Air Bases in Britain, 8[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1765970] was witnessedby many U.S. military personnel, and is supported by military documentation. Inaddition, the area held a large stock of nuclear weapons, a fact that was deniedby authorities for years, then admitted to be true. Yet the case remainscontroversial because proponents have not agreed on certain key details, andother critics have claimed it has wholly prosaic explanations. Not only this,but additional confusion has plagued the case in matters so simple as the exactdates when it occurred. A large part of this stems from the primary militarydocument associated with the case, prepared by Deputy Base Commander Lt. ColonelCharles Halt. This was written from memory several weeks later, left a greatdeal out, and ascribed the wrong dates to the major events. In addition, thewitnesses that did come forward did not all do so at the same time (sometimesdoing so under pseudonyms), and only slowly offered key details of theirexperience. Nevertheless, the incredible detail provided by so many witnesses,much of which is well corroborated, makes it clear that something extraordinaryhappened. cdlxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1890405] Rendlesham – The First EncounterOn the night of December 25/26, 1980, 9[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1766189] while aChristmas party was in progress at one of the air bases, Airman First Class JohnBurroughs and Staff Sergeant Budd Steffens (although one account substitutesSteffens with Dule) were stationed at RAF Woodbridge’s back gate, known as theEast Gate. Burroughs noticed strange lights above the Rendlesham Forest, nearthe base, so they drove out for a better look. The lights were closer than theyinitially realized, and flickered in red, yellow, and green. As they continuedto drive, a large white light appeared to come from the main object and movealong the forest boundary parallel to them. It seemed very close. Feelingnervous, they returned to the East Gate and called for backup. cdlxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1891936]Staff Sergeant James Penniston and Airman First Class Edward Cabansag soonarrived at the East Gate. Burroughs and Steffens explained the situation, andPenniston assumed that a plane had crashed. “It didn’t crash,” replied Steffens,“it landed.” Steffens stayed behind while Penniston, Burroughs, and Cabansagdrove off. At a certain point while going into the forest, the road became toorough, so Burroughs and Penniston got out and walked. Cabansag stayed behind toact as a relay for radio communication.As the two men approached the lights, animals seemed unusually active, thingsseemed odd. They received a radio transmission stating that an unknown objecthad been tracked over their base and disappeared on radar a short while earlier.Deep in the forest and approaching the strange lights, Penniston realized thathe smelled no burning fuel, nor found any sign of a plane crash. A field ofstatic electricity seemed to envelop them, making their hair stand on end. Thenthey lost radio contact. By now they noticed a small, shiny object with a bankof blue lights, motionless in a clearing. “It was unbelievable,” said Burroughs.Although he never got close enough to see it as a solid object, Burroughs saidthat the light configuration gave the image of a craft. He thought it may havebeen a machine under intelligent control or a bizarre natural phenomenon. “WhatI do know,” he said, “is that it was nothing mundane. There are no words thatcan adequately describe the wonder of what we saw.” cdlxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1892330] Burroughs and Penniston moved closer (although only Penniston consciouslyremembered details, while Burroughs later concluded that his memory wasblocked.) Penniston remembered coming to within ten feet of it and paused. Itwas definitely a craft of some sort, about ten feet (three meters) long andseven feet high. In dead silence, he observed the object, then walked around it.It looked like “smooth, opaque, black glass.” Bluish lights were visible, as wasstrange writing or symbols. He had brought a notebook, so he decided to write:Triangular in shape. The top portion is producing mainly white light, whichencompasses most of the upper section of the craft. A small amount of whitelight peers out the bottom. At the left side center is a bluish light, and onthe other side, red. The lights seem to be molded as part of the exterior of thestructure, smooth, slowly fading into the rest of the outside of the structure,gradually molding into the fabric of the craft. cdlxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1892634]According to one of Penniston’s statements, he took out his camera and began“snapping photo after photo.” Before long, all 36 exposures had been taken. 10[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1766352] He becamebolder and touched the object. The symbols felt inscribed or engraved, “like adiamond cut on glass.” When he did this, the white light on the object grewintensely bright. Penniston jumped back, as did Burroughs who was still nearby.They threw themselves to the ground. The craft lifted silently and then slowlyworked its way around the trees. Then it rose above the trees and was gone inthe “blink of an eye.” Everything became normal again. The static electricity was gone, radiosfunctioned normally, and the lighthouse beacon was clearly visible in thedistance. Both Penniston and Burroughs thought they saw more lights, and walkedfor another 300 yards towards them before deciding they had been out too long.On the way back, Burroughs noticed three indentations in the forest floor, rightwhere the object was first seen. Then they found Cabansag, who from a muchgreater distance had apparently seen what they saw, although with much lessdetail.At the base, their shift commander advised them to keep quiet about theirexperience. Still, since radar had confirmed something to be out there, hesuggested they look for proof of what happened. The next morning, Burroughs andPenniston inspected the site (Burroughs hoped to find nothing in order todismiss the whole affair). Several trees had broken tops and three holes werefound in the frozen soil in a triangular formation, an inch and a half deep andseven inches in diameter, matching the location of the legs seen beneath theUFO. Penniston even made plaster casts of the indentations. Ground traces withradioactive readings were also found. Skeptics later challenged the significanceof the radiation. Nick Pope, however, who ran the “UFO Desk” in the BritishMinistry of Defence during the 1990s, said the radiation levels were ten timeshigher than expected. In addition to these ground readings, an A-10 aircraftflew over the site the following morning and detected infra-red radiation.At 10:30 a.m., RAF Bentwaters called the Suffolk Constabulary, who met withPenniston and Burroughs. According to Penniston, the police officer refused towrite any information relating to a UFO incident, only that there were “strangelights” that could have been from the nearby lighthouse and that the landingmarks looked like “rabbit scratchings.” Penniston tried to explain that he hadseen an actual craft, and that the three indentations were identical andequidistant. The officer would not listen.Incidentally, John Burroughs has never been able fully to recover his memoryabout what happened to him as he approached the strange object that night. In2008, he communicated with Linda Moulton Howe, who arranged for him to work witha professional hypnotherapist. Through a hypnotic regression session, Burroughsrecovered more details about his experience. This time he remembered that he,like Penniston, had approached the craft very closely, and even thought thelights of the craft might be “alive.” Rendlesham – The Second EncounterThen, on the night of December 27-28, security personnel saw strange lightsfloating in the sky above the forest. Lt. Col. Charles Halt, Deputy BaseCommander at USAF Woodbridge, led a team to the area. He had heard the rumorsabout Penniston’s and Burroughs’s encounter, and “was determined to put an endto this nonsense.” He brought a Geiger counter, gas powered arc lights, and amicrocassette recorder. In the woods, the Orford Ness Lighthouse and theShipwash lightship were both easily visible. Something seemed to be interferingwith their equipment. The light-alls failed even after different ones werebrought back from the base. The radios were problematic, as well, according toHalt: all the frequencies were intermittent, and none worked properly. cdlxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1892867] At 1:48 a.m., a group of men, including John Burroughs and SergeantAdrian Bustinza, saw a glowing light resting on a pillar of yellowish mist.Before long, Halt saw it. It has been claimed that the Orford Ness Lighthouse,which is six miles away from Rendlesham Forest, was the source of the pulsinglight. Halt disagreed, stating that they could see the lighthouse distinctly,off to the side of the main light by about 30 degrees. “This object was nolighthouse,” he said. “It was dancing about in the forest, woods and all.”cdlxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1893124] Halt’s cassette recording (which ran for 20 minutes and covered a span of overthree hours) conveyed the excitement as well as the data. “Okay,” Halt spokeinto the tape,... we’re looking at the thing, we’re probably about two or three hundred yards.It looks like an eye winking at you. It’s still moving from side to side andwhen you put the star scope [a night vision device] on it, it’s like this thinghas a hollow center, a dark center. cdlxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1893327]The object flashed so brightly through the star scope, Halt said, that it almostburned his eyes. There was a noticeable field of static electricity as well. Theobject then maneuvered out of the forest to the middle of a farmer’s field, andHalt’s group pursued it. It was yellow and red, and seemed to be throwing offsparks -- Halt later likened it to “molten metal.” According to Sergeant MonroeNevilles, “it looked like a large brick” through night vision goggles. “The heatwas coming off it. Every once in a while it would flash, throwing off sparks.”cdlxxx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1893582] What happened next is disputed. According to Adrian Bustinza, who had left forWoodbridge and then returned, Halt was with 20 to 30 other men near this object.They had managed to get very close to it and had apparently surrounded it –something plausible if the object had been in the field long enough. Halt deniedthis, simply claiming that the group watched the pulsating object move throughthe trees to the farmer’s field, then silently explode with a bright flash. Atthat point, it separated into three to five white lights, all but one of whichquickly disappeared. One hovered motionless and began to shine laser-like beamsof light down all over the forest and RAF Woodbridge. According to Halt:It sort of danced about in the sky and it sent down beams of light.... fallingdifferent places on the base.... The people in the Weapons storage area andseveral other places on the base also reported the lights.... [The beam] stayedon for about 5-10 seconds and just as abruptly as it came, it disappeared...Other objects became visible, making high-speed angular movements. WitnessSergeant Bobby Ball later recalled that the objects appeared to be searching forsomething, as if they were performing a grid search. cdlxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1893782] Halt called onhis radio to learn if radar had picked up anything. He heard voices on the otherend saying that beams were coming down on the base. Halt had no idea what thesebeams were, and he was concerned. For years, there were claims that the beamspenetrated the Weapons Storage Area at Woodbridge, and even that the beamsdisabled some or all of the nuclear weapons stored there. Given the history ofUFOs and their proximity to nuclear weapons, it is certainly plausible. Indeed,according to the statement of Rendlesham researcher Peter Robbins, this isexactly what happened. In February 1993, Robbins and Larry Warren interviewedCharles Halt. According to Robbins, Halt admitted to them that the beams oflight from the UFO somehow penetrated the alternating layers of steel, earth,and concrete of the hardened bunkers. Ultimately they reached the secured areaswhere the weapons were stored, “adversely affecting the ordinance,” in the wordsof Halt. Although Halt has never confirmed this statement, Robbins stands by it“absolutely.” cdlxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1893983] The men stayed out until after 4 a.m. Incidentally, photos taken that night ofthe landing site came out fogged, according to the base’s photography lab,although Halt suspected that the photos were simply switched out.Halt wrote a memo of the incident dated January 13, 1981. The document is ofgreat significance in that it clearly describes how on two separate occasions aUFO was seen by base military personnel. However, Halt suggested that there wasmuch he left out of that report, and the biggest part appears to have been thestory of Larry Warren. Rendlesham – The Third EncounterLarry Warren was a member of the USAF Security Police who had been posted to RAFBentwaters in early December 1980. Indeed, it was his account in 1983 that firstmade the story public. Obtaining certainty about which night Warren had hisencounter, however, is difficult. For some time he believed it took place on thenight of December 29/30, although he later corrected it to 28/29. There is eventhe possibility that his encounter took place the same night as Halt’s, whichwould mean that there were two nights of UFO activity over the base, not three.cdlxxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1894237] Warren was on security duty (“guard mount”) at a Bentwaters Perimeter Post 18,apparently on the night of December 28/29. Having just returned from leave, hewas unaware of the recent strangeness near the base. Shortly before midnight, heheard radio transmissions about “some funny looking lights bobbing up and down”over the forest near RAF Woodbridge. He saw nothing unusual, but soon heard thehooves of panic-stricken deer running past him. Five minutes later, a securityvehicle arrived at his post. Sergeant Adrian Bustinza was driving with a SecondLieutenant Englund and two other security officers. Warren was relieved of hispost, got into the truck, and drove to the Bentwaters motor pool with the group.On the way, he heard radio communications from Woodbridge requesting that theWing Commander, Colonel Gordon Williams, be contacted. More vehicles were atBentwaters’ main gate, and Warren’s group joined them in a convoy towardWoodbridge.RAF Woodbridge teemed with activity. Warren’s convoy turned left at the EastGate and continued down the dirt road track which eventually led to a largeclearing named Capel Green. Other vehicles and personnel were already there, andone group was walking down a narrow trail into the woods. Other officers came tothe group, and the men were given weapons and ordered to maintain silence. Theywere then directed into the woods “to investigate a disturbance.” Warren checkedhis watch; it was 12:30 a.m.They walked deep into a densely wooded area, experiencing an increasing staticelectricity charge in the air as they advanced. They soon came to a large fieldwhere about forty or so military personnel had gathered. The men were ordered tosurround what appeared to be a bright fog or mist. When his group entered thefield, Warren saw it was a glowing, yellow-green circular object, not more thana foot in height. At times it almost seemed transparent. Two officers walkedaround it with Geiger counters, someone took photographs, others operated moviecameras. Radios were active, and he heard what sounded like a pilot stating,“Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.” In the distance, over the NorthSea, Warren saw a small red light. This light approached his group far too fastand silently to be any aircraft he knew. Warren checked his watch again; it was1:30 a.m.The red light cleared the trees bordering the field and made a downward arcuntil it was directly over the illuminated object. It hovered at twenty feetabove the ground, roughly the size of a basketball, and of an unusual shade ofred. It then exploded in a blinding flash which gave off no heat. Now,instantly, less than 25 feet away from Warren, was a large, pyramid-shapedobject, topped by a glowing red light. He described the main body as ‘pearlwhite, with a rainbow-color effect.’ Somehow, its appearance was distorted, andit was easiest to see by peripheral vision. At the base was a bank of intenselybright blue lights. Warren thought he saw landing gear. Covering the entiresurface were what looked like boxes and pipes, but no identifying markings,windows, or doors. It looked solid and heavy.Cameras continued to film, and the men were ordered to maintain a tight cordonaround the area. An officer ordered Bustinza and Warren, who was now feelingnauseous, to follow him as he approached the object. Carrying their Geigercounters, they came to within ten or fifteen feet of the object, and Warren’seyes watered profusely. Before long they were ordered back to their positions.Warren saw military personnel confiscate the camera of a British police officerwho had taken pictures, and heard the argument that ensued.Suddenly a staff car arrived, carrying Colonel Gordon Williams and his staff.Most were in civilian clothing, including Williams. Now, from behind the object,came a bright bluish ball of light. It moved slowly and deliberately just offthe ground, then stopped. That was when, according to Warren, he and Bustinzanoticed something inside the glowing ball – what looked initially like children.However, Warren could tell by their large heads and “catlike” dark eyes thatthese were not human beings. He could not make out any other facial features,but noticed their bright silvery clothing.Warren observed Colonel Williams slowly approach these beings. Just five feetapart, they stared at each other. No conversation could be heard, but Warrenbelieved they were communicating, though not in any conventional sense. Anotherofficer handed Williams something. Soon after, men began to leave the field, andWarren’s group was told to return to the trucks. As Warren walked back into thewoods, he turned around one last time to see the object and entities. Warrenarrived back at Central Security Control at 4:30 a.m. His eyes hurt, he had abad taste in his mouth, and heard a ringing sound in his ears. Looking in amirror, he noticed a shock of gray hair. He was relieved from duty, went to hisroom, and collapsed.Warren also stated that the next morning he and other witnesses were soonordered to appear at the Bentwaters law-enforcement desk at 11:00 a.m. Oncethere, Major Malcolm Zickler told the men they were going to be debriefedconcerning what they had experienced the night before. A long counter heldnumerous documents arranged in stacks. Warren and the others were told to signthem, though not given time to read them fully. It was clear they were agreeingthat what they had seen were unusual lights in the forest and nothing else. Oneairman protested, but was told to sign them and go into the office. Two rows offolding chairs had been set up and a movie screen stood at the front of theroom. A projector sat on a desk toward the rear of the room already loaded witha reel of film.Three men stood in a corner of the room. A uniformed Commander from the Officeof Naval Intelligence (ONI) introduced himself, then introduced two men in suitsfrom the Air Force Security Service (USAFSS). The Navy commander told Warren andother men that, among other things, what they had seen in the forest“represented technology far advanced to our own.” Numerous civilizations, hesaid, visit this planet, and some have a “permanent presence here.” Thedebriefing concluded with the screening of films composed of wing camera footagefrom World War II and Korea, on the ground in Vietnam, and allegedly on theMoon, all of which included UFOs. Prior to the film it had been made clear tothe men that keeping the secret would help their careers, but it would be noproblem if anyone talked, since “bullets are cheap.” Everyone laughed, but thethreat was real.There was a final part to Warren’s involvement with this affair. He received aphone call in his barracks dormitory instructing him to be outside in twentyminutes to get into a car. Warren did as ordered, and also saw Adrian Bustinzathere. Two men wearing civilian clothing got out of the car, and Warren andBustinza entered. The interior was unusually bright, with a greenish glow. AsWarren got into the car, “everything went black.” He was in a semi-consciousstate, feeling as though he had been anesthetized. The next thing he rememberedwas the engine of an A-10 taking off, and that he was on the Bentwatersflightline. He was then led out of the car and walked somewhere, then descendedsomewhere as if in an elevator. He felt a pressure change to his ears and lostconsciousness again. When he awoke, he was in a small cafeteria-style diningarea; other airmen were there, too, looking lost. Warren still felt heavilysedated. He walked along a hallway, clearly remembering rooms with high-techmachines and computers with technicians dressed in orange and blue uniforms. Twomen in black SWAT-type uniforms led the small group of airmen through a largedoor which quietly opened. They entered a large, dimly lit room. The wall toWarren’s left had a large glass or plexiglass window with glass sides forperipheral vision. The opening was about four feet wide, allowing only a fewpeople at a time to enter. Warren stepped into the confined area and looked intoa gigantic, dark, cavernous space – it strangely reminded him of the interior ofthe Houston Astrodome. Far below, he saw movement on a “liquid black floor,”possibly people, and something very similar to the object he saw in the forest,resting in a far corner of the facility. He also saw other strange objectsflying across his line of sight. To his right were curved tiled walls thatlooked wet, and three bands of light. One of his escorts said it was a tunnelthat led to the North Sea.Warren and presumably his companions were directed down a hallway to a smallroom with rows of cushioned chairs. He sat in the first row, next to Bustinza.Before them was a large translucent screen, and the men were somehow frozen intoplace. Behind the screen, Warren discerned the silhouette of a small, motionlessfigure. However, he felt a communication from it – it addressed him by his firstname and demonstrated an intimate knowledge of his personal life. In his mind,Warren asked the being who it was, and it said it was from a place he wouldnever understand, from a different reality. It said that he was in a facilityfar below the air bases, and there were apparently many such places with beingsof its kind, accompanied by human support personnel. This particular facilityhad been there since the 1940s, and expanded during the 1960s. Their craftsentered and exited through an extensive tunnel system. Many civilizations fromoff-world were living here, and they had been intimate with the governments ofthe U.S., U.S.S.R, U.K., and Japan since World War Two. Its race had blendedinto human society at many levels. The being added that religion was created forthe human race (a statement that disturbed Warren and which he refused tobelieve), that wars were fought for “human entertainment” (presumably as a wayto keep human energies occupied), cdlxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1894571] that the ColdWar was phoney, and that future battles would be fought in the Third World. 11[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1766523] The facilitywhere Warren happened to be was one of many processing zones throughout theworld. He and the other witnesses were “selected” because the beings “knew”them. The being mentioned something about politics and corporations and thatWarren would not remember most of his experience, mainly for his own protection.It then said, “Larry, in your life, strive to remember.”Warren fell into blackness. When he regained consciousness, he was walkingthrough a door and facing bright sunlight. He was disoriented, taken to a busand brought to the dorm area. He strove to remember everything while at the sametime trying to kill the memory. It was New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1980.Warren’s claims of many military personnel at the scene, the extremely closeencounter with the craft, the threats to keep silent, and his undergroundencounter were not mentioned in Halt’s memo, and not surprisingly have beenchallenged by skeptics. Of course, it would not be surprising that Halt’s memoleft out some of the more striking details – something that, years later, Haltacknowledged. Finally, there is the possibility that Warren and others who weredebriefed were subjected to some form of mind altering processes.That Warren’s account differs from the other witnesses may not be a majorproblem. Nick Pope pointed out that police agencies have long understood thatwitnesses do not always see events in the same way. 12[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1766867] After Warren’sbook, Left at East Gate, was published, Pope spent a great deal of time with himand co-author Peter Robbins, and the three frequently discussed the case. Popewas “personally convinced” that Warren was there, and “witness to some quiteextraordinary activity.” It was equally clear to Pope that what Warren witnessedwas not referred to in Halt’s memo. cdlxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1894863] Rendlesham – “No Defence Significance”Warren’s account made the press in October 1983. In 1984, a poor copy of Halt’stape came into the hands of researchers. The audio quality was poor, but abetter copy eventually became available and was transcribed for Georgina Bruni’sYou Can’t Tell the People , published in 2000. Over the years, the case gained agreat deal of attention. Lord Hill-Norton, former Chief of the Defense Staff andAdmiral-of-the-Fleet, inquired with Secretary of State for Defence MichaelHeseltine about it. Heseltine released the statement to Hill-Norton that “theevents to which you refer were of no defence significance.” Hill-Norton repliedthat “there would seem to be some defence significance either in an unknownobject’s entering and possibly landing on British territory or, alternatively, adeputy base commander of an RAF/USAF base filing a ludicrous and make-believereport.” In November 1983, Heseltine wrote to British M.P. Merlyn Rees: “...that there is not a grain of truth in the allegation that there has been a‘cover up’ about alleged UFO sightings... nor was any unidentified object seenon radar.” Researching this contention, Nick Redfern received proof thatHeseltine’s statement was completely wrong. Squadron Leader (for OfficerCommanding) E. E. Webster confirmed to Redfern in an official RAF correspondencedated October 25, 1988, that their log book showed that a UFO was reported byRAF Bentwaters at 0325 GMT on 28 December 1980. cdlxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1895081] Detractors of the case, most notably science writer Ian Ridpath, arguedthat the nearby Orford Ness Lighthouse can create the impression of a lighthovering just above the ground, especially so during the misty weather of thenights in question. If a UFO had been present, he suggested, the men should havereported two sources of light, e.g. the lighthouse and the actual UFO. Hefurther argued that on the Halt tape, one can hear an airman call out “there itis again...there it is,” with the same frequency at which the lighthouseflashes. The radiation readings, argued Ridpath were also questionable, as theequipment used by Halt’s team was not intended to measure background radiation;therefore the readings at the low end of the measurement scale were meaningless.cdlxxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1895312]Further claims were made that the so-called landing marks were simply rabbitdiggings. Moreover, Dr. John Mason, who collected reports of meteor sightingsfor the British Astronomical Association, said that a meteor “almost as brightas the full Moon” flew over southern England at exactly the time of the initialreports of a bright object landing in the forest. UFO researcher SteuartCampbell suggested that the meteorite, which was actually hundreds of miles awayover the North Sea, was mistakenly interpreted by guards to be an aircraftcrashing in the forest. Campbell also suggested that the object later seen byHalt and his men was the Shipwash lightship, and the unusual lights in the skywere bright planets. Other explanations for the incident have included a downedSoviet spy satellite or a nuclear incident.Hoax theories have always been prominent in relation to the case. In 2005, theBBC reported that a former U.S. security policeman, Kevin Conde, claimedresponsibility for creating strange lights in the forest by driving around in apolice vehicle whose lights he had modified. Later, however, Conde said hebelieved his prank took place at another time, and was “not the source of thisspecific incident.” cdlxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1895521] While acknowledging multiple possible explanations for a UFO event can be avirtue, the skeptical case hinges entirely on assuming the incompetence of largenumbers of military personnel, including a Deputy Base Commander, duringmultiple sightings. The amount of detail offered by the witnesses, including thetranscript of Halt’s recorded narrative, force the skeptical arguments to relyon numerous unrelated events that, frankly, do not match the explanatory powerof multiple detailed and consistent first-hand accounts from the people who werethere. As the years go by, the incident at Rendlesham Forest has continued togrow, not diminish, in its power as a bona fide UFO encounter. The Cash-Landrum IncidentFrom opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, two important UFO events closed 1980,nearly simultaneously. The December 29 incident near Huffman, Texas, a few milesnortheast of Houston, was important not merely for the sighting of the craftitself, but because of the military helicopters that followed it, the physicaleffects on the witnesses, and the obstinate stonewalling about it by the U.S.government.While, across the ocean, the Rendlesham Forest was the scene of dramatic UFOactivity, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie’s grandson Colby Landrum weredriving in the State of Texas, on the Cleveland-Huffman Road on the way to thetown of Dayton. At about 9 p.m., a bright, diamond-shaped object descended overthe road ahead of them, a mere 25 feet from the ground. It made a beeping noiseof some sort, and the three immediately felt tremendous heat coming from it. Itwas so bright that it lit up the night landscape and hurt their eyes. A row ofblue lights ran across its center, and flames occasionally shot out from beneathit.Betty stopped the car, and all three got out to look at the amazing object.Several helicopters were visible in the distance. Colby, who was just sevenyears old, was quickly frightened and returned to the car with his grandmother.Betty stayed outside and approached it in fascination. It gave off such intenseheat that she returned to the car after only a few seconds. Despite it beingmid-winter, she burned her hand on the door handle when she returned to the car.Inside the car, it was so hot that they turned on the air conditioning. Theobject continued to hover, bobbing slightly. When it rose and moved off to thesouthwest, Betty began to drive again. They saw it again soon enough, this timeaccompanied by more than 20 military helicopters, making a tremendous noise.Most of these were double-rotor helicopters, believed to be CH-47 Chinooks. Afew smaller, single rotor helicopters were also there. Betty kept driving, andthe three were able to watch the object and choppers for at least another tenminutes. She dropped Vickie and Colby off at their home, and arrived at her ownhome at 9:50 p.m.Other people saw this spectacle. An oil worker in Dayton saw the object,describing it as diamond-shaped and “shooting brilliant blue flames out theback.” An off-duty Dayton police officer and his wife saw the helicoptersshortly after Betty, Vickie, and Colby had their experience.The three main witnesses immediately exhibited symptoms consistent withradiation poisoning. Betty, who had the most exposure to the object, had theworst reactions. She suffered from severe headaches, nausea, diarrhea, swellingof the neck, and red blotches on her face and head. Some days later, her eyesswelled shut and the blotches became blisters. She was hospitalized for twoweeks as a burn victim, losing patches of skin from her face and much of herhair. Vickie and Colby had similar symptoms that did not requirehospitalization.In February 1981, Betty asked NASA if the agency had flown an unusual craft thatnight. Not surprisingly, the answer was no, but a NASA representative referredher to John Schuessler as a private party who might be able to help her. Inaddition to being MUFON’s Deputy Director, Schuessler was a Project Manager forSpace Shuttle Flight Operations with McDonnell Douglas Corporation. He took avery active role in investigating the case, receiving some help from aerospacescientist Alan Holt. It was obvious that an extremely unusual high performancevehicle had been in the area, an object that moved like a helicopter but did sowithout propellers, or indeed any known means of propulsion. This object washighly radioactive, and presumably was nuclear powered.Betty later developed breast cancer which required a mastectomy. Eventually,she, Vickie, and Colby hired Peter Gersten to sue the U.S. government fordamages. The problem was that no government agency took responsibility for thehelicopters, to say nothing of the UFO itself. The Air Force stated in 1983 that“our investigation has revealed no evidence of involvement by any militarypersonnel, equipment, or aircraft in this alleged incident.” Schuesslerdescribed stonewalling by the military that was simply outrageous, especially tosuch trusting, patriotic citizens as Betty Cash and Vickie Landrum. The casenever went to trial because the judge simply refused to hear it. cdlxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1895813] A case can be made that this was an experimental military vehicle goneawry. While it is not unusual for witnesses to experience real physical effectsfrom UFOs, this was obvious radiation poisoning. Several sources claimed thatthe craft was one of “ours.” Richard Doty and William Moore claimed the machinewas a nuclear powered antigravity craft on a test mission that developed engineproblems. cdxc [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1896336]Researcher Tom Adams met a military source who claimed to have been one of thehelicopter pilots during the event. He had been stationed at Fort Hood, and toldAdams about a special alert that occurred in late December 1980. He and otherpilots were vectored to a location where they would see an “unusual aircraftflying below radar,” where they would have to “go visual.” As he understood themission, it was to “force the object to land or keep it at a low altitude.”Within the large group were four contact teams responsible for securing the areaif the craft came down. At the targeted area, he said he saw “the biggest damndiamond I have ever seen in my life! I have no idea what the object was.” Thehelicopters followed it for seven to ten miles at a very low altitude. Then theobject stopped producing sparks, became stationary in the air, and began toglow. The pilots received orders to abort the mission and return to theirvarious bases. After returning to Fort Hood, he was told the craft was anexperimental aircraft which had experienced problems and gone astray. cdxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1896543]Schuessler’s opinion evolved from an initial hunch that it was a secret militaryproject to the belief that it was extraterrestrial. “I imagine some UFOs arepart of classified military operations,” he stated later. But he saw no evidencethat the U.S. military was developing diamond-shaped objects remotely like theHuffman, Texas object. “The best way to evaluate this situation is to considerthat we are not flying disc shaped aircraft. The only ones ever built didn’texceed 200 mph. We do not fly cigar-shaped vehicles, other than rockets andmissiles. We do not fly half mile wide triangular craft that can hover and thenshoot away at lightspeed. We do not fly spherical aircraft, other than balloonsthat can move only with the wind, not against it.”Whatever the provenance of the object, the Cash-Landrum case is significant. Theobject which injured Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Colby Landrum was able tofly using principles and technology beyond what officially existed in 1980. Thatby itself warrants attention. In addition, the stonewalling and obstruction bythe U.S. government gives reason to believe that somebody, somewhere in aposition of power knew more than they were telling. SummarySince its inception during the early cold war years, UFO research had undergoneconstant change. Still, the late 1970s had been transformative. The release ofthousands of pages of government UFO documents, particularly in the aftermath ofWatergate, made it clear that the only way to get truth from the government wasby dedicated arm twisting. The results were energizing: the longstanding claimsof a “cover-up” were shown to have merit. Some of the released documentsindicated grave concern by responsible authorities about intrusions of sensitiveairspace by UFOs. These documents described the objects just as thousands ofcivilian reports had done: as mechanical, technological objects far beyond whatthe science of the day seemed capable of producing. The “nuts and bolts” schoolof ufology was back in force.Just as important were the leaks. While information from anonymous militaryinsiders lacked the virtue of official confirmation, their collective value wasobvious – as was their danger to the status quo. The various accounts coming toresearchers like Leonard Stringfield, William Moore, Stanton Friedman, andothers had a compelling consistency, and it seemed inevitable that one of theseleaks could eventually enable a breakthrough of sorts, something that would leadto confirmation. By the end of 1980, some people believed that the Roswell casejust might be The One. Then there was the investigation conducted by PaulBennewitz, which was turning out to be a very high stakes affair.But something else happened. Stringfield’s sources suddenly began to dry up.Someone or some group was pressuring them into silence. At the same time, theintelligence community began cultivating Moore, offering the promise of insideinformation in return for reports on other UFO researchers. Moore hoped that hecould navigate his way through the murky world of spooks and gather a fewmorsels of truth along the way. Perhaps the people he worked with were genuinelyinterested in helping him end UFO secrecy. Perhaps, too, they would provide himwith disinformation that would muddy the ufological waters for years to come.Air Force intelligence and the NSA also began to take notice of Paul Bennewitz,and indeed William Moore soon became one of the means by which they would spy onhim. Bennewitz’s case is perplexing. He was clearly photographing, seeing, andrecording strange phenomena over a sensitive U.S. military installation.Somehow, he was ‘translating’ audio signals that suggested the existence of analien base beneath Dulce’s Archuleta Peak. Whether or not Bennewitz wasaccurately doing this, there is no evidence that these early signals were partof an intelligence disinformation campaign. That may well have come later, butit was these 1980 signals that placed Bennewitz in the crosshairs of the spooks.Thus, the ufological victories of the late 1970s appear to have led to a programof surveillance and infiltration of UFO research by the intelligence community –a ‘counter attack’ of sorts.Behind all of this were worldwide sightings of objects behaving in extraordinaryand impossible ways. The global nature of these encounters was not yet fullyappreciated by most western researchers: the Chinese and Soviet information inparticular was still locked behind barriers of language and politics. Peaks ofastonishing activity occurred in the spring of 1976 and again during the latterhalf of 1978. Explaining these as experimental or secret U.S. technology makesno sense, at least not in any conventional way of looking at the matter.Is it possible that breakthroughs, in anti-gravity for instance, had been madewithin secret American installations? The leaked information available toresearchers in 1980 did not provide much testimony to conclude in theaffirmative. As the following chapters will demonstrate, however, testimonylater arose that pointed to such programs, nearly all of which connected them toalien reverse-engineering efforts. But even if a breakthrough was made, say, inthe early 1970s (as would be later claimed), could this account for the Spanishcases of 1976? Or the Valentich case? Or the encounters by so many national airforces, such as Chile, Peru, France, Britain, Italy, Austria, China, Iran,Kuwait, the Soviet Union, and the United States?Perhaps the most suggestive new development in UFO sightings were the triangles.Although there was not, within the context of known 1970s technology, thecapability to fly these objects in the manner witnesses reported, it isreasonable to conjecture that such devices were possible, given a secretdevelopment project. It is also suggestive that nearly all the reported trianglesightings during the 1970s occurred within the United States.Still, it must be acknowledged that any of the difficult UFO sightings,including most of the triangles, involved capabilities that, quite simply, werenot supposed to exist. Whether these events were human, alien, or both, theimplications are clear: something very, very big was happening, and the officialinstitutions of power and learning around the world were simply not talkingabout it.Ronald Reagan was elected America’s 40th President in November 1980, signifyinga national political sea change. Even well before the end of the Carteradministration, the great hope of Freedom of Information had been showing signsof sputtering out. Now, the advent of an administration far more friendly to themilitary establishment, while making a number of Americans happy for a varietyof reasons, promised to put UFO research on the defensive. And yet, the 1980swere no dark age of UFOs. In a world in which the only constant was changeitself, new opportunities would arise to take on the secret keepers.Chapter 5 Cloak and Dagger1981-1983 Something impossible according to the laws of physics.― Cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalyonok, on seeing a UFO while in Earth orbit in 1981 I have long ago given up acquiring access to the so-called blue room atWright-Patterson . . . . this thing has gotten so highly classified . . . it isjust impossible to get anything on it.― Senator Barry Goldwater (R-AZ), 1981 Certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes wereextremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories analyzed them verycarefully.― Retired defense scientist Dr. Robert Sarbacher, 1983. Trans en ProvenceWhile Rendlesham is widely understood to be Britain’s most important UFO case,another major case took place in France less than two weeks later. It involved aclose encounter by a reliable witness, physical trace evidence, and extensiveinvestigation by qualified scientists. Although less dramatic than Rendlesham,the physical evidence it left behind makes it the most important case in Frenchufology.At his home near Nice during the afternoon of January 8, 1981, 55 year-oldRenato Niccolai heard a whistling sound outside and went to investigate. On theedge of his property, just above the trees about 250 feet away, he saw an objectthat looked like two saucers, one upside down against the other. It was dullgrey and about four or five feet high. The object landed in his field of wildalfalfa, but stayed on the ground only briefly. He soon heard the whistlingsound again, louder this time. The object rose to treetop height and shot off tothe northeast. Before it left, he noticed additional details, including landingfeet and trap doors.Niccolai told his wife and the police, who arrived within 24 hours. They in turnnotified France’s official UFO investigative body, GEPAN, part of the CentreNational d”Etudes Spatiales (CNES). They found a circle on the ground aboutseven feet in diameter; nearby plants looked diseased or damaged. Severallaboratories studied plant and soil samples, showing consistent and bizarreresults. The leaves in the affected area had lost 30% to 50% of theirchlorophyll pigment. Scientists could not duplicate this effect, even withradiation. Speculation centered on “some type of electric energy field” causingthe damage. Niccolai was interviewed many times, with no indications of mentalissues, dishonesty, or even exaggeration. Forty days after the event, traces ofthe craft’s impact were still perceptible.GEPAN produced a 66-page report, concluding that “a significant physicalphenomenon had indeed interacted with the environment at the site, producingabrasions, thermal impact and unexplained effects on plants.” A few years later,Jacques Vallee conducted a follow-up investigation. He interviewed the witnessand his wife, studied the landing site, and brought original soil samples fromthe earlier investigation to an American laboratory. These results wereconsistent with the original analysis, and added that there was no residue thatcould have come from tractors or other farming equipment, such as cement powder,oil, or chemical contaminants. The event remained unexplained. cdxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1896912] Thus, it appears that a small disc-shaped craft had landed in southeasternFrance, and its pilot did not want to interact with, or be seen by, the locals.It traveled by an unknown, but extremely efficient, means of propulsion. It wasalso apparently dangerous, judging by the dramatic effect it had on plant lifeafter only a brief landing. Perhaps this helps to explain the pilot’sskittishness. The Reagan AdministrationRonald Reagan was elected president in November 1980, and took office on January20, 1981. In many respects, Reagan’s views were a throwback to the 1950s.Courting Christian evangelicals, he argued that the liberalism of the 1960s and1970s was a mistake, and that the nation needed to return to ‘family values.’Reagan the candidate was also the quintessential anti-elitist – as much as aformer Governor of California could be. He had attacked Jimmy Carter’s manyconnections to the Trilateral Commission and Council on Foreign Relations, thetwo most obvious “insider” organizations. In similar manner, he attackedcompetitor George Bush (who had belonged to both the Trilateral Commission andCFR until 1979). Reagan even promised that Bush would never receive a positionin his government. cdxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1897390] Rhetoric was one thing; reality another. Reagan may have believed someof that rhetoric, but even during his California governor days in the 1960s, hehad surrounded himself with Rockefeller men. cdxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1897586] Early on inhis journey to the White House, Reagan replaced his campaign manager withlongtime CFR member William Casey. During the summer of 1980, he shocked hissupporters by choosing Bush as his running-mate. In September 1980, Reagan gavea “Prelude to Victory” party at which the ultimate power player, DavidRockefeller, sat to Reagan’s immediate right. cdxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1897742] Following hiselection, his 59-member transition team consisted of 28 CFR members, at least 10Trilateralists, and 10 Bilderbergers. His most important cabinet appointees wereall CFR members: Alexander Haig (State), Casper Weinberger (Defense), DonaldRegan (Treasury), and William Casey (CIA). Reagan selected James A. Baker III tobe his chief of staff; Baker had not only been the campaign manager for GeorgeBush, but was from afamily long associated with Rockefeller oil interests. cdxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1897877] Reagan mayhave campaigned against the elite, but checkmating him proved easy enough.On March 30, 1981, just two months after taking office, Ronald Reagan was struckand almost killed by an assassin’s bullet, an event that would have put GeorgeBush into the Oval Office. The would-be assassin, John W. Hinckley, Jr., wasportrayed as a lunatic who was obsessed with the actress Jodie Foster.Hinckley’s ties to the Bush family were hardly mentioned in news reports. Hisfather was a Texas oilman and longtime friend of George Bush. His brother Scottwas scheduled to have dinner with Bush’s son Neil on the evening of March 30.When a journalist asked Vice President Bush of the connections between the twofamilies, and whether Bush might have known the younger Hinckley, Bush blandlyreplied, “it’s certainly conceivable that I met him or might have beenintroduced to him.” cdxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1898028] Even more strange is that the elder Hinckley ran a “World Vision”mission in Denver, Colorado. This was a CIA-connected evangelical church groupthat seems to have been involved in mind control – some of the people connectedto it were cult leader Jim Jones and Mark David Chapman, the murderer of JohnLennon. The late conspiracy investigator Jim Keith believed Hinckley Jr. was aprime candidate for mind control assassination programming. He had beenreceiving mood altering drugs from his psychiatrist, and was on Valium when heshot Reagan. Keith also argued that Hinckley had a “double,” a man namedRichardson, who followed Hinckley in Colorado and wrote the love letters to JodyFoster that Hinckley allegedly wrote. Richardson was a follower of CarlMcIntyre, leader of the International Council of Christian Churches – which inturn was part of World Vision. When one considers the many connections betweenGeorge Bush and the CIA, to say nothing of the other elite fraternities, 13[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1767158] the overt lackof follow-up by the major media was as suspicious as Bush himself. cdxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1898470] Reagan may have survived the attempt, but George Bush gained greaterascendancy, anyway. At 70 years of age, Reagan was the oldest man everinaugurated as President. His mind was already deteriorating, and theassassination attempt accelerated this process. Over the next few years, Bushchaired a “Special Situation Group.” Contained within this bland title was apowerful network of organizations: the Standing Crisis Pre-Planning Group, theCrisis Management Center, the Terrorist Incident Working Group, the Taskforce onCombating Terrorism, and the Operations Sub-Group. Bush brought on his formerCIA associate, Donald Gregg, as his main advisor on national security. Gregg inturn brought with him a CIA assassination manager, Felix Rodriquez, whom Bushhad known during the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. During the 1960s, Gregg andRodriquez had organized assassinations and drug-running in Southeast Asia withCIA officer Theodore Shackley. Now working for Bush, these men – and others suchas Lt. Colonel Oliver North – would soon orchestrate the illegal drugs andweapons operation known as Iran-Contra. cdxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1898709]Reagan’s survival was an unexpected boon for the elite. Out of his depth indealing with the true power players, told only what Baker and his other handlersdecided he needed to know, effectively barred from speaking spontaneously to themedia, and requiring daily afternoon naps, Reagan provided cover for Bush,Casey, and the rest of the ‘team’ to run their sundry national security andfinancial operations. With conviction in his heart, Reagan could describe theSoviet Union as an Evil Empire plotting world domination, call for a “crusade offreedom,” and even promote Henry Kissinger’s idea of a winnable nuclear war.‘The Great Communicator’ – who was after all a former Hollywood actor – becamethe ultimate pitch-man for the global power elite.An interesting sidelight to this is that the 1981 Bilderberg meeting, which tookplace in Burgenstock, Switzerland, discussed among other things “changes in theSoviet Union,” Soviet intentions, and what Western policy toward the Sovietsshould be. Clearly, whatever the conclusions of these discussions were, theBilderberg Group saw major changes ahead. Within a few years, major change wouldindeed come. d [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1898939]Reagan’s Soviet policy meant heady times for the U.S. military and intelligencecommunity. During his first four years in office, military spending grew bynearly 50 percent, surpassing $300 billion annually. In addition, $75 billionwent toward strategic modernization, and $75 billion more for research anddevelopment. di[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1899178] Special forcesand covert operations were big winners. One of Reagan’s earliest executiveorders (#12333) allowed the CIA to conduct ‘special activities’ within the U.S.,as long as these did not influence the domestic politics, media, or publicopinion – as if the CIA had ever refrained. dii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1899365] More important was the deregulation of many American industries, ofwhich the savings and loan industry was one example. As a matter of principle,deregulation can have great merit. In practice one has to watch out for thewolves. By the end of the 1980s, the once-tightly regulated industry was a mess:over 1,000 S&Ls had failed, costing the nation an estimated $150 billion andcontributing to the 1990-1991 economic recession. Later investigation showedthat many of the failed S&Ls had been owned by people with ties to the CIA, andmany of these had made large unsecured loans to others linked to the CIA andorganized crime. The debacle, called “the largest and costliest venture inpublic misfeasance, malfeasance and larceny of all time,” was in part the workof the intelligence community and organized crime, which had systematicallylooted America’s S&L institutions. diii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1899676] In a study of UFOs and associated cover-up, such information is useful toremember when considering how it might be possible to fund the (presumably)deeply covert programs connected with the topic, especially when no such fundingofficially exists in any part of the U.S. government’s enormous annual budget.In all likelihood, we will never know what happened to all the stolen S&L money,but the point is that when secrecy of a program is absolutely paramount, thensecrecy of funding is equally important. In such a context, there is nothingmore attractive than an enormous supply of unvouchered and untraceable money,for which one need not answer to public institutions or oversight.Finally, in attempting to discern UFO-relevant policy during these years, it iscrucial to recognize where the true power lay: not with Ronald Reagan himself,despite his known obsession with UFOs. div[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1900028] Regarding suchmatters as UFO secrecy, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or other covertactions taken regarding the UFO matter, we must assume that the initiative camefrom elsewhere – perhaps Bush, but certainly some reliable representative of theelite interests that dominated Reagan’s Presidency. This includes severaldevelopments during the 1980s that hinted at attempts at some form of UFOdisclosure. The State of Ufology, 1981Unlike during the election of Jimmy Carter four years previously, UFOresearchers expected little support from the Reagan White House. They seemed tounderstand they were on their own. Considering the state of organized ufology atthe time, the circumstance was not auspicious.NICAP, for instance, had ceased to operate. Its director during the 1970s hadbeen John Acuff, former head of the CIA-connected Society of PhotographicScientists and Engineers (SPSE). Acuff had personally orchestrated NICAP’semasculation until he was fired by its Board of Governors in 1978. Claiming thatNICAP owed him $20,000 for “contractor” services, he held the organization’sthousands of case files in his personal possession, essentially as ransom.According to Todd Zechel, Acuff was still working covertly for the FBI. dv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1900806]CUFOS was going through a major downsizing. The organization had alwaysstruggled financially – for the past year it had not even published its ownjournal. By March 1981, its Evanston, Illinois office was closed and the filestransferred to the home of Allen Hynek. Even worse, it not only eliminated itsoffice secretary from the payroll, but also chief investigator Alan Hendry.Although CUFOS eventually rebounded, matters were bleak enough in 1981 that theend looked near. dvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1900987] APRO was in trouble. The basic problem was that James and Coral Lorenzenwere getting older, and were not delegating responsibilities or training newleaders. There was still an active member base, but the publication of the APROBulletin was becoming sporadic. Cooperation with MUFON and CUFOS was essentiallyzero. Moreover, APRO, which had been watched by the intelligence community sincethe 1950s, was now part of an Air Force intelligence disinformation campaignthrough the graces of William Moore, Richard Doty, and the good people at AFOSI.That left MUFON as the sole active American UFO organization. Its members didwhat they could to get the word out. In February 1981, MUFON members RichardHall, Bruce Maccabee, and Don Berliner appeared for three hours on the LarryKing radio show, reaching millions of listeners. dvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1901163] Later thatmonth, Trinity University in San Antonio held a debate on UFOs between MUFON’sStanton Friedman and Philip Klass of CSICOP. No winner was decided, but threetimes as many people assembled around Friedman afterwards as around Klass,according to Walter Andrus. dviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1901344] The generalpublic maintained a taste for ufology. The problem was reaching that public.MUFON’s membership and resources, while greater than the other three groups,remained insignificant in the real world. Occasional forays into the publicrealm were helpful, but not really enough to make a lasting impact.Meanwhile, there seems to have been a concerted effort against the credibilityof Leonard Stringfield. A group calling itself the Coalition of ConcernedUfologists issued statements questioning his information and sources. LikeStringfield, its members – primarily Willard McIntyre and Dennis Pilichis – werebased in Ohio. Early in 1981, the coalition sent out a booklet with its own‘alien’ photographs. Researchers were baffled by this development, whichcertainly made it harder to analyze all this new (and now conflicting) crashretrieval information. Several researchers wondered whether the ‘Coalition’ wasan intelligence operation. dix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1901522] Indeed,Willard McIntyre had a longstanding connection to the Society of PhotographicScientists and Engineers (SPSE), an organization closely connected to the CIA.Could this have been part of an orchestrated plan against ufology, one prong ina general attack which also included the compromising of William Moore?The deepening of the Paul Bennewitz saga during the spring of 1981 might supportthis theory. AFOSI and NSA were both paying close attention to Bennewitz by now,and he was receiving all sorts of visits, with and without his knowledge.Richard Doty and Dr. Robert Fugate stopped by during the spring. Fugate ran theAir Force’s Star Fire Optical Range at Manzano, which contained some of thetechnologies Bennewitz may have been seeing. To their surprise, they learnedthat Bennewitz had invented a machine to detect magnetic fields surrounding theUFOs he was watching. Fugate studied the device closely; after returning, histechnicians built an improved version. Gregory Bishop, commenting on this, said“how the Air Force eventually employed this device remains a mystery.”One obvious answer would be: to detect UFOs. In any event, strange things werehappening at Bennewitz’s home. William Moore was another frequent visitor duringthe early 1980s. On one occasion, Moore noticed a bright orange-yellow ball oflight, hovering in a corner, with a pale blue halo. He asked Bennewitz about it,who was also mystified but said “they keep showing up.” The orb then winked outsuddenly. Doty and two NSA operatives also saw this phenomenon when they brokeinto Bennewitz’s home on one occasion. All three men were perplexed. Somethingwas happening at the home of Paul Bennewitz, and it is not clear who or what wasbehind it.It has been claimed that Air Force intelligence and NSA were attempting to steerBennewitz away from the real technologies at the Kirtland-Manzano complex infavor of a phony alien base beneath Dulce. Richard Doty, for instance, claimedthat AFOSI created the illusion of an underground base beneath Dulce for thesole purpose of fooling Bennewitz. This claim went very far, indeed: that AFOSIimproved old, out-of-the-way dirt roads, airlifted mothballed equipment to thearea, and placed fake air vents on Mount Archuleta – all for Bennewitz. Callingthis “over the top” would be a mild statement. State police officer GabrielValdez also saw the vents, and vehemently disagreed that they were fake. Like somuch else in the cloak-and-dagger world of UFOs, this matter remains unresolved.dx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1901698]One thing is known: as a result of everything he had been seeing and recording,Bennewitz began writing to New Mexico Senators Pete Domenici and HarrisonSchmitt, describing his observations and giving his opinion that aliens weretaking over the base beneath Dulce. dxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1901852] World Sightings through MayAfter Trans-en-Provence, UFO sightings slowed down. A British CAA reportdescribed an interesting radar target near Lyons, France, on February 13.Although it was not seen visually, it was “a sizeable oval shaped target” thatmoved toward an aircraft “at very high speed.” dxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1902003] After this,the next important sighting did not occur until May, and that happened to be inEarth’s orbit.This was aboard the Soviet Salyut-6 space station on May 5, 1981. Oddly (ornot), the United States had recently launched its first reusable manned spacevehicle, the Space Shuttle Columbia . Its first mission, known as STS-1, lastedfrom April 12 to 14, 1981. Three weeks later, the Salyut-6 was in orbit overSouthern Africa, and cosmonaut Vladimir Kovalyonok had just finished exercisingwhen he looked through a porthole. Astonished, he saw a rotating, ellipticalobject, flying along with the space station. Lacking all reference points inspace, he could not determine either its distance or its size. He called hispartner Viktor Savinykh to observe, who was about to photograph it when theobject exploded in “golden light.” This was followed immediately by a secondexplosion, leaving behind two “golden and very beautiful” spheres and a residueof white smoke. The space station soon entered the Earth’s shadow, and thespheres vanished into blackness. As cautiously as possible, the men reportedtheir sighting to mission control.Later, Kovalyonok learned that Soviet scientists had registered an unusualradiation emission the day of their sighting. The Soviet press covered theevent, generally excluding extraterrestrial answers. In 1993, by then a majorgeneral, Kovalyonok publicly described the event, calling it “somethingimpossible according to the laws of physics.” He said “it was probably a UFO,but it was definitely not mysticism; two people watched it at the same time....I do not believe it when astronauts say they have never seen anythingextraordinary in space.” dxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1902160]More strange still is a sighting by Kovalyonok and Savinykh that reportedlyoccurred between May 14 and 18, following the docking of the Soyuz T-4 with theSalyut-6. The event was first described during the days of glasnost and later byPaul Stonehill. According to the account, the two cosmonauts saw anunidentified, spherical ship, about 30 feet in diameter. This object approachedtheir position, occasionally moving erratically, even vanishing, thenreappearing. It looked metallic, had many windows and was well lit inside. Whenit approached to the incredibly close distance of 100 feet, the cosmonautslooked inside with binoculars. They saw three brown-colored beings with slantedbright blue eyes, straight noses, and bushy eyebrows. The beings expressed noemotion and appeared to resemble robots. Soviet mission control would not permitdirect contact, so the two crews tried to communicate through other means:display of various mathematical equations, maps, and Morse code (apparently theequations and maps elicited some sort of response from the aliens, and the Morsecode did not). At one point, the aliens left their spaceship without apparentprotective suits.It was claimed that the cosmonauts filmed the incident and that after theyreturned to Earth, Lt. General Georgy Beregovoy, who led training programs forSoviet cosmonauts, led a meeting of 200 party leaders and scientists in Moscowto show the film. According to Stonehill, those who tried to see the film werewarned off. dxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1902578]Incredibly enough, there was another incident from this month, also unconfirmed,that rivals the Soviet sighting for sheer drama. According to Merle Shane McDow,who was attached to the U.S. Navy Atlantic Command, a UFO was tracked on atleast five radar scopes moving at high speed up and down the Atlantic coast. “Weknew that it wasn’t the Soviets,” said McDow, who related this event years laterto Steven Greer and the “Disclosure Project.” The Command Center was put onZebra Alert, the Navy’s highest level of alert, and Admiral Harry Trane gave theorder to force the object down and recover it. For more than an hour, U.S. jetfighters chased the mysterious object, sometimes seeing it visually. The UFOeasily evaded them. McDow discussed the threats, intimidation, and confiscationof log books that occurred after the event. dxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1902828] Setbacks in the Fight Against SecrecyThroughout the late 1970s, the Freedom of Information Act had been the brighthope of UFO researchers, the wedge that might pry open the door of UFO secrecy.But that wedge was wearing away. The lawsuit against the NSA received a setbackon November 18, 1980. Following an in camera affidavit by the NSA, Judge GerhardGesell dismissed the suit, stressing “the sensitive nature of the materials andthe obvious effects on national security their release may well entail.” Notonly the NSA documents, but the affidavit itself was itself classified TopSecret. NSA’s argument was that the documents would reveal how NSA acquired itsinformation – its methods and sources. dxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1902985] The CIAlawsuit was still in appeals, and the newly formed Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR)awarded a $2,500 grant to underwrite litigation to obtain copies of 200 knownCIA documents relating to UFOs. dxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1903206] By the summer of 1981, citizen-based lawsuits against the CIA, NSA, DIA,and FAA had all been decided in favor of the defendants. The organizationCitizens Against UFO Secrecy, riding on financial fumes, could only afford toappeal two of the rulings, and so the CIA and NSA were selected. No one expectedeither to succeed. To make matters worse, the NSA was pressing for dispensationfrom FOIA – that is, to be exempt altogether – on the grounds that its missionand modus operandi were too sensitive for public viewing. “The foot in thedoor,” wrote Larry Bryant, “is getting numb from the tight fit.” dxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1903384] Meanwhile, Leonard Stringfield continued to encounter obstacles in hisresearch into the subterranean matters of UFO conspiracy. On the one hand, hissources were drying up – several explicitly said they could no longer speak tohim. On the other, he was experiencing a personal assault from a so-called “Hoaxand Fraud Committee.” On July 1, 1981, its chairman, Charles Wilhelm, gave apublic ultimatum. Stringfield had 60 days to answer questions regarding hisphotographs and sources, or else be ‘exposed’ as a fraud. A definite piling oneffect was taking place: FATE Magazine writers Jerome Clark and George Earlyalso questioned Stringfield’s credibility. Stringfield, meanwhile, insisted hewas doing the best he could do, under the circumstances. He remindedresearchers, as he had done many times before, that his informants neededconfidentiality. He also began to wonder aloud whether he was the victim of anorchestrated attack.Stringfield retained many supporters, however. Richard Hall, for instance,pointed out that crash retrieval stories had circulated for a long time. Duringthe 1950s and 1960s, he said, NICAP received perhaps a dozen crashed UFO leads,but performed minimal follow up because the stories seemed too outrageous.“Since then,” wrote Hall, “some of the stories have been traced to the source.”dxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1903545] The attacks on Stringfield seemed suspicious, but Paul Bennewitz was a moreobvious victim of underhanded actions. For some time now, Bennewitz had beenphotographing apparent UFOs and picking up strange signals from near the ManzanoWeapons Storage Area. As a result, he had been the target of militarysurveillance since the end of 1980. Now, during the summer of 1981, more activedisinformation began when William Moore gave Bennewitz an altered version of theProject Aquarius document. Moore had seen the original in November 1980, and hadhis own copy since February 1981. He gave Bennewitz this document on behalf ofAir Force Intelligence, knowing it had been altered. He felt guilty about it,but did it in order to retain his access to inside information.The memo marked the first time that the alleged UFO control group known as MJ-12made its appearance in a public document. It stated that “the results of ProjectAquarius are still classified Top Secret with no dissemination outside officialintelligence channels and with restricted access to ‘MJ Twelve.’” According toMoore, the original memo stated that the NSA had analyzed Bennewitz’sphotographs, and incidentally found them to be authentic. In the altered memo,NSA became NASA.Regarding the existence of Project Aquarius, it turns out that there have beenseveral classified projects by that name. In 1985, researcher Chris Lambrightrequested a response via FOIA from the NSA regarding three project names. Twowere dismissed in the reply, but NSA said the third one – Aquarius – wouldrequire a $15,000 search fee with no promise of results. After further inquiry,the agency wrote “even the release of the project name could reasonably beexpected to cause grave damage to the national security.” Further researchuncovered a Project Aquarius operated by the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency (DARPA) around 1970 to “demonstrate the feasibility of detecting bothsubmarine launched ballistic missiles and low-flying aircraft ....” Thus, ratherthan being a complete hoax, the Project Aquarius document is probably a tangleof fact and lie. How else could a deeply classified NSA project by that veryname have crept into it? dxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1903683]There may be several reasons Bennewitz was given an altered Aquarius document.First, to be able to track the distribution of the document (easily done by the“NASA” marker it contained). Assuming Bennewitz’s research threatened securityinterests at Kirtland and Manzano, it would be helpful to learn the extent ofhis personal network. It cannot be known if another motive was to confuse UFOresearch by introducing this tainted document. However, this was by far the mostlasting effect. If Bennewitz was in fact obtaining UFO data and photos, thengiving him a tampered Aquarius document could have been an attempt to discredithim.One of the pleasant respites from the depressing fight against the spooks andThe Establishment was the conference circuit. The MUFON Symposium that summeroffered a breadth of topics: Peter Gersten on FOIA struggles and successes,Allen Hynek on scientific ufology, Budd Hopkins on abductions (“an invisibleepidemic”), and Stanton Friedman and William Moore on the newly emerging Roswellcase, which they described as a kind of “cosmic watergate.” Moore’s dealingswith the intelligence community would not be known for many years; meanwhile hewas riding high as ufology’s newest star. dxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1903945]CUFOS, operating in downsized mode, nevertheless continued to publish a smallbulletin, and even organized its own conference that fall – its first since1976. The conference was limited in attendance, serious in tone. Hynek, Hopkins,Bruce Maccabee, and Mark Rodeghier presented, among others. Claims of recoveredalien debris and bodies were studiously avoided, although Stringfield, whoattended, spoke privately about it. dxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1904131] The discussions at such conferences were essentially internal dialogues; therest of the world hardly noticed. Yet, the value of these gatherings wasbecoming evident: researchers were talking to each other, strengtheningrelationships, and getting fresh ideas. Five major conferences took place in1981, a large number at the time, although small by later standards. Abduction DebateBy the early 1980s, it was not merely the debate about Roswell or other possibleUFO crash retrievals that was transforming ufology. The matter of alienabductions had arrived.Starting in the 1950s, ufology had developed a substantial literature on thetheme of human-ET contact. Some writers, notably the ‘contactees’ of the 1950s,described voluntary and positive encounters with human-looking aliens who warnedof the threats posed by reckless misuse of human technology. In time, a darkertrend emerged: people who claimed to have been forcibly taken and examined bybeings, some of whom looked decidedly non-human and appeared to lack humanemotions.The Travis Walton case of 1975 had triggered a stronger interest by researchersin abductions. In 1977, Coral and James Lorenzen had written a book onabductions, compiling two decades worth of cases. Most of the aliens theydescribed were small, with large heads and eyes, no hair, and communicated bytelepathy. The Lorenzens suggested that abductions were the latest logical stepin a kind of alien information-gathering process. Each abductee, they believed,had specific information of value to the aliens. dxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1904327] In 1979, Raymond Fowler had published the Andreasson Affair , detailingthe experience of Betty Andreasson. Her hypnotic sessions produced a detailedstory of interaction with creatures with grey skin, large heads, cat-like eyes,tiny mouths, three-fingered hands, and dark blue uniforms. They moved by glidingand communicated telepathically. One night in January 1967, several of thesebeings entered her Massachusetts home through a solid door. They “switched off”all of the family members except for Betty and her daughter Becky. They thentook Betty alone into their ship, leaving Becky behind but “frozen.”Betty was physically examined. A needle was inserted up her nose and into herhead, but without any sensation of physical pain. Somehow, she was transportedto an alien realm, whether physically or by means of mind-control. She wentthrough tunnels, saw a red and then green atmosphere, strange creatures andplants, and pyramid-like structures. With a message focusing on love and nature,the aliens explained that humans were destroying the Earth. Because of greatlove, said Betty, “they cannot let man go in the footsteps he is going...” Abetter understanding of nature and humanity’s place within it were essential.The culminating event was when she witnessed a giant phoenix-like bird burn upand then reappear from the ashes as a giant worm. A presence she understood tobe God told her that she had been chosen. The event symbolized the rebirth ofmankind after going through a terrible tribulation. The aliens indicated thatthey shared Betty’s belief in the sacredness of Jesus Christ and affirmed thathe was “coming soon.”Betty’s Christianity was a distinct feature of this case, and some researcherswondered if this biased her recollection in some way. Yet, Fowler conducted hisinvestigation thoroughly and sincerely, and his book made a strong impact. Overthe decades, he continued to follow Betty’s case, reporting his findings insubsequent books. dxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1904548]Abduction literature was becoming more detailed and bold. The publication in1981 of Budd Hopkins’s Missing Time brought abductions to center stage in UFOresearch. Hopkins was a successful artist, with works in the permanentcollections of many major museums. Through the 1970s his interest in UFOs andabductions became increasingly active, and in Missing Time he documented severalstudies of apparent alien abductions, looking for consistencies and patterns.dxxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1904934] Missing Time was a pioneering work that introduced two new ideas. First,that a period of unexplained missing time was a typical aspect of the abductionexperience. Second, that abductions seemed to be far more common than previouslythought, and their significance far greater. “We have no idea how many suchkidnappings may already have taken place,” Hopkins wrote, “but I believe thereare vastly more than the mere 200 or so incidents which have been investigated.”There seemed to be an ulterior purpose, “as if these quite similar abductionsconstitute some kind of systematic research program, with the human species asthe subject.” This program involved abducting people, performing procedures,then erasing their memories through some sort of post-hypnotic suggestion.Hopkins conceded the possibility that there was a psychic element to abductions,but emphasized that these were real and physical events. Witnesses describedtheir ordeals, and even the equipment used by the aliens, with astonishingconsistency. Many of them had scars, ‘scoop’ marks, and incisions thatinexplicably appeared on their bodies. As to the ‘why,’ Hopkins briefly touchedon the idea of alien-human hybridization, a theme he expanded on in later books.The information in Missing Time came primarily through hypnotic regression,although Hopkins did not conduct any of the sessions. Instead he secured the aidof licensed psychologist Aphrodite Clamar, Ph.D. Clamar also conductedpsychological tests on the abductees (finding them to be normal, albeit stressedand perplexed by their experience). The hypnosis was necessary, said Hopkins, tobreak the barrier of silence often built around the minds of abductees.Not surprisingly, not everyone saw things this way. Two early critics were D.Scott Rogo and Hilary Evans. Both argued that abductions appeared to be afeature of the human mind. UFO abductors, said Rogo, communicate throughabsurdities, space-time incongruities, and symbols. It could not be merecoincidence that this was the language of dreams. Somehow, he maintained, theseso-called aliens were linked to our minds. dxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1905202] Similarly,Evans argued that abduction reports suggested ancient archetypal encounters withfairies, angels, and demons. He believed there was something to the phenomenon,but that it was probably based in a reality vastly different from the ordinaryhuman experience. dxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1905350] Such criticisms were mild compared with allegations that Hopkins wasacting irresponsibly, that hypnosis was just as likely to produce fantasy asaccurate recollection. The 1980 study, Memory , by psychologist ElizabethLoftus, provided an intellectual foundation for this position. She argued thathuman memory is a frail thing “continually being altered, transformed, anddistorted.” Hypnosis does not reliably retrieve buried memories, she concluded,and can even make things worse when people confidently ‘recall’ events thatnever happened. dxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1905622] Hopkins andhis supporters countered that his subjects were never asked leading questions,and were often asked questions specifically designed to screen out hoaxing orconfabulation.Given the nature of the abduction phenomenon, it is inevitable that the argumentwould come down to human memory. Even physical elements such as scars and scoopmarks could be explained away by skeptics as ordinary events of which the personwas simply unaware. Yet, as the testimony and literature on alien abductioncontinued to grow, so did the number of converts to the idea that somethingserious was going on.In a few brief years, the UFOs phenomenon had gone from being a mystery aboutlights in the sky to one of retrieved alien technology, and now to intimateinteractions between the aliens and humans, a phenomenon believed to be sowidespread that it could affect one’s very family. Sightings: June through December 1981In Britain, another new phenomenon had arrived. For the past few years,mysterious circular depressions and combinations of circles had been discoveredon the farmland and fields of southwestern England. During the summer of 1981,British researcher Pat Delgado publicized the “crop circles.” A bevy ofexplanations soon arose, ranging from weather to magnetic fields to hoaxers toextraterrestrials. Inevitably, the phenomenon began to be felt among UFOresearchers, especially when the circles became more complex at the end of thedecade. For now, however, they remained a curiosity.After the spectacular Trans-en-Provence case in January, 1981, the rest of theyear produced relatively few UFO reports. Even so, a few cases were noteworthy.The strength of a case always comes down to two factors: the level ofstrangeness and nature of the evidence. Judging them cannot be done withmathematical precision, but must be handled within the messy domain of humanjudgment.One example is the sighting of a luminous object by students in China’s X’ianUniversity in the Shanxi Province on June 5, 1981. At 10 p.m., witnesses saw anobject which split into two parts, then three, then four. The various partsseparated and converged, and another object appeared and merged with it. Thisobject then split again, diminished in size, and vanished at 10:20 p.m. Anyobject that can separate into multiple pieces and converge before astonishedwitnesses would appear to be indicative of extraordinary technology, begging thequestion of ‘whose.’ The strength of this case comes down to the reliability ofthe witnesses; enough for some investigators and not enough for others. dxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1905787] Several interesting vehicle encounter cases occurred that summer andfall, including a few involving apparent alien beings and even abductions. Suchmay have been the case in Shewsbury, Britain, when three women driving in theearly hours of a July morning saw an object with red and white lights in afield. They remembered their car losing, then regaining, power. Discovering theywere missing twenty minutes of time, they went to the police. The three laterunderwent hypnosis and described various entities. Although diverging in somedetails, their accounts were basically congruent. dxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1905942]Close encounters were reported in places as divergent as Temuka, New Zealand(July 12), Lieksa, Finland (July 31), eastern Zimbabwe (August 15), and severalin California during August and September. All involved explicit sightings of anunusual object with high performance characteristics. The New Zealand caseinvolved a brightly lit dome-shaped object with ‘windows’ approaching a car thenshooting away. dxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906103] In Finland, ablack sphere with lights approached a motorboat, surrounded it with a fog, andinduced witness paralysis, missing time, and other physiological effects. dxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906266] In CaliforniaUFOs, some of which were triangular, were reported buzzing vehicles, often nearfreeways. dxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906469] The Zimbabwecase occurred at a large private estate known as La Rochelle, in the ImbezaValley near the Mozambique border. In the early evening, a man named CliffordMuchena saw a ball of light maneuver around various buildings, and soonafterward saw three beings wearing silver coveralls. An intense light blindedhim and he fell to his knees. Later he said “there was a power coming fromthem.” Other witnesses also reported seeing the ball of light and the entities.How the beings or light departed was not indicated. dxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906643] A noteworthy case took place in Britain on September 11, 1981. A womannamed Denise Bishop saw a large, dark grey object hovering over her house,shining several beams of light from beneath. Frightened, she tried to enter herhouse, but a beam of green light hit her hand for about thirty seconds,paralyzing her. For several days, her hand was burned, and a mark was stillvisible ten months later when Timothy Good visited her. He described Bishop assensible and sincere, with no prior interest in UFOs. The Ministry of Defenseapparently did not investigate. dxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906803] In most of these cases, UFOs and their occupants interacted closely withhuman witnesses. A few airliner and military encounters took place that summer.One was a jumbo jet encounter on July 4 with a silvery disc-shaped object overLake Michigan. dxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1906961] More dramaticwas an unofficial account given by an informant to Nick Redfern. This was saidto have occurred at the island of Cyprus on August 16, 1981. Presumably itinvolved one of Britain’s two Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) on the island,Akrotiri and Dhekelia. An object described as “vast” approached the island,tracked at 30,000 feet and 900 mph. Initially, it was believed to be aconventional aircraft, until it came to a sudden stop and hovered over the basefor forty five minutes. Many photos were taken, and witnesses described theobject as a bright white triangle over 700 feet long. Oddly, according to theinformant, prior to the sighting the Ministry of Defence in London had sent anencrypted message to the base. This ordered “a complete stand-down of aircraftin the event that any strange ‘aerial phenomena’ was sighted in the vicinity ofthe base airfield.” The following day, a man and woman arrived at the base,stayed for six hours, then left with all evidence. Redfern’s informant statedthat shortly afterwards, American AFOSI and British personnel met at RAFLakenheath to discuss the case. They were “really bothered about it.”Did prior knowledge by British military authorities imply this UFO was actuallyan experimental aircraft? Redfern’s informant did not believe so. “Whatever wesaw, it was not man-made.... this thing was really alien.” Perhaps the MoD hadalready detected the UFO and then simply warned other bases to leave it alone.The case is almost typical in that it is both spectacular and unconfirmed – oneof many. dxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1907122] Equally intriguing as the Cyprus case, but quite definite, is a UFO photographtaken on Vancouver Island in British Columbia on October 8, 1981. HannahMcRoberts was on vacation with her family. At 11 a.m., they were at a rest-areaon the east coast of the island, thirty miles north of Kelsey Bay, when Hannahphotographed one of the mountain peaks. No one saw the object that appeared soclearly after the picture was developed. The photograph shows an object to theright of and above the peak, a perfectly clear and classic daylight disc.For nearly a year, they showed the image only to friends and relatives. Then, inthe summer of 1982, they visited the Vancouver Planetarium and were persuaded tolend their negative for analysis. Eventually, Richard F. Haines of the Journalof Scientific Exploration obtained it and conducted detailed analyses usingmicro-densitometry and various computer enhancements. He found no evidence of ahoax, atmospheric disturbance, or photographic defects. He also conducted a sitesurvey and interviewed the McRoberts family – “middle-class, hard-workingpeople,” he said, who were genuinely puzzled by the photograph. Haines concludedthat the disc was an unidentified “three dimensional object.” dxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1907286]Assuming Haines’ analysis was correct, the photograph provides clear evidencethat some agency was flying perfect disc-shaped objects. Another interestingaspect of this case is that the disc was apparently able to camouflage itselffrom unaided human eyes, although not from a camera. To some researchers, 1981may not seem particularly early in the game. After all, good UFO sightings andphotographs had been reported for a long time by then. But 1981 is also notyesterday. Whether this was secret human-derived technology, or something whollyalien, that is a long time to keep something secret.There were several interesting aerial events in the fall of 1981, one an allegedSoviet Air Force encounter in October, taken from the files of the Russian UFOCenter. A MiG pilot encountered a glowing sphere which accompanied his plane fora short while, jamming his radio and shutting his engine down. When the spheremoved toward the tail, it apparently caused an explosion that damaged the fin.After it vanished, the engine restarted and the pilot landed. Sovietinvestigators concluded that a glowing plasma ball was the culprit. dxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1907574]The most important UFO-related development in late 1981 was the onset of the“Hessdalen Phenomenon.” Starting in November 1981, the thinly populated valleyof Hessdalen in central Norway began to experience sightings of anomalous lightswhich lasted through the 1980s and even beyond. They usually came in betweenmountains, stopped and hovered for as long as an hour or more, then quicklyascended or accelerated horizontally. Hundreds of such sightings were made overthe next few years, usually luminous objects seen at night, but sometimes alsometallic cigar-shaped objects seen during the day. Objects were observed singlyor in groups, moving sometimes slowly, sometimes at great speed, sometimes in asimple path, other times in highly complex maneuvers. Even after several goodphotographs were taken, they continued to resist conventional pigeonholing.Radar equipment was brought in and tracked the objects at a speed of more thanfive miles per second, or more than 18,000 mph. Throughout the duration of thephenomenon, no sounds were ever heard, a noteworthy fact considering that thiswas an area so isolated that residents could hear cars and tractors severalmiles away. Essentially, the phenomenon resisted any interpretation, being fartoo complex for any naturalistic explanation such as “earth lights” or theresult of the Earth’s magnetism. In 1981, this phenomenon was just beginning.dxl [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1907756] Correspondence on UFO SecrecyBy late 1981, the new American President was receiving letters from citizensabout UFOs and extraterrestrials. One of these was dated September 28 from Major(Ret.) Colman VonKeviczky, formerly of the Royal Hungarian Army and now Directorof the “Intercontinental UFO Galactic Spacecraft Research and Analytic Network”(ICUFON). VonKeviczky claimed UFOs were an intergalactic task force that woulddestroy earth unless world leaders collaborated. Perhaps surprisingly, hereceived a reply on November 21 from the Chief Military Advisor of the WhiteHouse, Major General Robert Schweitzer, who wrote, “The President is well awareof the threat you document so clearly and is doing all in his power to restorethe national defense margin of safety as quickly and prudently as possible.”VonKeviczky went public, believing he had a direct acknowledgment of UFOs by theReagan administration. An embarrassed Schweitzer had to tell the AssociatedPress that he thought VonKeviczky was talking about the Soviets, that his replywas a mistake. Considering that VonKeviczky’s five page letter mentioned UFOs 49times (not even counting the 17 pages of attached documents), the denial lackeda certain credibility. Grant Cameron put it clearly: “it is absolutelyimpossible that the VonKeviczky letter could be mistaken for a Soviet threat.”Schweitzer’s salvation was that his reply did not mention UFOs. Still, it didnot prevent him from being fired immediately afterward by National Securityadvisor Richard Allen. dxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1908146] The VonKeviczky correspondence is suggestive of UFO secrecy. But the letterfrom Senator Barry Goldwater from October 19, 1981 makes the matter as clear asday. Goldwater was a five-term Senator, a former Republican Party nominee forU.S. President, and an Air Force reservist with the rank of Major General. Hehad been close friends with legendary Air Force General and former Chief ofStaff Curtis LeMay. In 1982, Goldwater was inducted into the National AviationHall of Fame. If any American politician could lay claim to being amilitary-friendly insider, it was Barry Goldwater. Thus, a letter from him to aconstituent on the matter of UFOs must be taken seriously. Responding to aconstituent query regarding the rumors of bodies and technology held atWright-Patterson AFB, Goldwater wrote:I have long ago given up acquiring access to the so-called blue room atWright-Patterson .... this thing has gotten so highly classified, even though Iwill admit there is a lot of it that has been released, it is just impossible toget anything on it. dxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1908299]Goldwater had written letters in a similar vein in 1975 and 1979. In theseletters, it has become clear that a person of Goldwater’s stature was stillunable to penetrate the secrecy and classification system of UFOs.By the end of 1981, researchers were noticing that the new administration wasnot especially friendly regarding FOIA requests. In October, researcher RobertTodd learned that North American Air Defense (NORAD) would no longer waivesearch and duplication fees, even when no responsive records were located.dxliii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1908474] Then,in early November, a federal court reinforced its earlier decision to withholdNSA documents pertaining to UFOs. dxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1908655] 1982: Pennsylvania UFOsLike the previous year, 1982 was another quiet year in terms of UFO activity.For the first half of 1982, the most interesting UFO reports came from the stateof Pennsylvania. An important reason for this was the diligence of UFOresearcher Stan Gordon, MUFON’s State Director of Pennsylvania, who ran a UFOreporting desk and actively investigated leads. The Pennsylvania flap was areflection of genuine UFO activity which was recorded by a motivated andcompetent researcher.Gordon received information on the sighting of a triangle near the town ofScottdale, in the western part of the state, at around 9 p.m. on March 22, 1982.The object was described as very large and silent as it hovered near a man’s carand followed him for a short while. Another UFO was reported in westernPennsylvania on March 23, this time by an off-duty police officer on Route 65who saw a bright, round object in the late afternoon above the roof of hishouse. He notified another officer, who also saw the object when he arrived. Itthen followed the patrol car down Route 65, at times from behind and at timesdirectly above. Another officer was called to the scene, this one with a camera,but the object was too far off and almost out of sight by the time he arrived.On the 29th, yet another UFO was seen in the western Pennsylvania borough ofOakmont. At 3:30 a.m. on that day, a witness reported a bright, silver, metallicdisc-shaped object hovering over the area. Gordon investigated and thought theobject was not likely to be a balloon, but was otherwise unknown.Amid this sharp upsurge in sightings, another triangle was reported on April 1in the town of Petrolia, not far from Pittsburgh. At 7:15 p.m., three men wererepairing a jeep when one of them noticed an unusually bright object just abovethe trees with a flashing red light. A few minutes later they noticed the objecthad doubled its altitude. As it was getting dark, the men turned on theheadlights of their vehicle to continue working on it. Almost immediately, thebright object moved toward them. Wondering what would happen, they turned thejeep lights off, and the object backed away. They turned the lights on again,and it approached, this time passing almost directly over their heads at no morethan 250 feet altitude. As the object passed over them, the bright light wentout and its triangular shape became clear. This object was very large, a dullgun-metal color, and was surrounded by a luminescent mist. At each point was alight: a red light in front, with a white and amber light at the other corners.While watching this display, the awestruck men saw two bright lights shoot awayfrom the triangle, one going north and one south. No sound was heard throughoutany of this. A jet plane approached from the east, and the object seemed to stopcompletely and become very bright. Then it rose straight up until it was out ofsight.Gordon investigated this case, as well. Two of the witnesses told him that whileobserving the object, they had the feeling that “their skin was crawling offtheir body.” For several days, they had severe headaches, and one had diarrhea.Other residents from the local area reported similar observations.Sightings continued in western Pennsylvania. On April 14, 1982, in West Sunbury,sky observers watching the planets through their telescope saw a largedisc-shaped object move across the sky. The witnesses said they had observedmany types of aircraft previously, but that the shape and movement in thisinstance were unlike conventional aircraft. On April 21, in the town of Derry,residents reported two bright orange balls hovering over trees. After severalminutes, one of the lights disappeared toward the south, while the other lightascended straight up and was gone. At 8 p.m. on May 5, at Youngstown Ridge inLatrobe, a witness saw a top-shaped object with a small dome on top. Within thedome was a red pulsating light. It appeared to be the size of a small aircraftand moved slowly at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. This object was first seento move east, then to hover, and finally to move west and disappear.Later that night, another triangular UFO was seen near Pittsburgh. At 11:17p.m., police radio networks were filled with reports of a bright nocturnallight. One witness, a pilot who heard the reports over his scanner, ran outsideto see if there really was anything unusual. He saw no light source, butsomething even stranger. Moving in a southeastern direction was a triangularobject about the size of a Lear jet and approximately 1,000 feet altitude. Thestrange thing about the object was that only the front section appeared to havea solid outline. The rest seemed transparent, as the brighter stars could beseen through the middle structure. For about twenty seconds, he watched theobject glide quickly and silently across the sky.Gordon recorded another UFO case from the town of Jeannette (not far fromPittsburgh) on May 19, 1982. Shortly after 9 p.m., as a thunderstorm was movinginto the area, a man noticed what he thought was a helicopter about to crash onthe far side of a hill. A search by state police, fire departments, and civilair patrol units failed to locate anything. Neither Westmoreland control toweror the FAA flight service office indicated any unknown aircraft in the area atthe time. Gordon interviewed the witness, who said the object was dark,solid-looking, and had three distinct brightly lit windows. Gordon found otherwitnesses who reported a similar object in the South Hills area of Pittsburghtwo hours later. dxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1908833] Elsewhere within the U.S., probably the most interesting UFO report wasa police officer’s encounter with a diamond-shaped object in East Texas, not farfrom where the infamous Cash-Landrum case occurred in 1980. John McDonald was adeputy sheriff for Liberty County, on patrol during the night of May 22, 1982.Just before 11 p.m., he noticed two bright lights above tall pine trees.Thinking he was seeing a low flying airplane, he pointed his spotlight towardthem as the lights sank out of sight. But then the lights reappeared and passedover his head at a low altitude, perhaps 1,000 feet. McDonald shone hisspotlight again, and “could plainly see ... it was in a diamond shape,” albeitwith four rounded corners. The object was greyish in color and large – heestimated ten cars could fit inside it. Despite the quiet night, he heard nosound at all from it as it moved away to the southwest. Seconds later he heard ahigh-pitched whine as the object quickly departed. Unlike the witnesses of theCash-Landrum incident, McDonald suffered no physical side effects. He preparedan official “offense report,” a copy of which John Schuessler obtained. dxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1909085] World Sightings, early 1982Unusual atomospheric activity occurred near the Finnish-Soviet border, trackedby the U.S. military. A U.S. Defense Informational Report discussed “lightedobjects in the sky to the east of Finland” seen on February 16 and 19. Althoughmuch was redacted, the memo indicated that the light on February 16 was visiblefor five minutes and made two large counter clockwise circles while movingtoward the northeast. It was accompanied by “a bright star like object thatappeared to be exuding gas” moving to the north. On the 19th, a bright ball wasseen traveling northeast “on a slow, flat trajectory,” and then disappeared. Twolights were then seen following each other, but most of the memo is blacked outafter this. dxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1909288] Meanwhile, Norway was the scene of unexplained lights. Researchers fromthe group UFO-Norge arrived in the Hessdalen area in late March, and a townmeeting was held nearby on March 26, attended by 130 local residents. Since theprevious December, when the “Hessdalen phenomenon” started, about thirtysightings had been reported. Most had been of a round, yellowish light; otherswere cigar shaped; others had red or yellow lights attached to them. A few caseseven included physical effects, animal reactions, or radio or TV interference.Two officers from Trondheim’s Vaernes Air Force Base also arrived on the scene.They saw no UFOs, they told the media, but did see lots of shooting stars,satellites, and aircraft. “Not the least,” they told reporters, “we saw a lot ofUFO hunters in the area.” dxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1909498] Sporadic and unofficial reports were the rule for most of the year. Thisis not to say that they were of no interest. A June 1 incident at the Sovietcosmodrome was reported in Flying Saucer Review . According to the account, twoUFOs hovered over for 14 seconds and allegedly “sucked out” the bolts and rivetsof the support towers at the launch pad and caused damage to nearby houses. Thecosmodrome was reportedly shut down for repairs for two weeks. dxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1909688] A British CAA report described a “Large translucent object 500 feet longat 41000 feet” over Dinkelsbuhl, Germany, on June 12, 1982. According to thereport, the object, seen “by all on board,” was described as having the form “ofa double rectangle surmounted by a globe (egg shaped) crowned by a silver one.”dl [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1909843] A great deal of activity was being recorded in northern China duringJune 1982, reaching a peak on the 18th between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. One of thesewas reported by five Chinese Air Force pilots flying on patrol over the northernmilitary frontier, an event called by Paul Dong “one of the most intriguingmilitary cases.” At 10:06 p.m., a large object appeared in the clear sky overnorthern China. It was yellowish-green and initially the apparent size of a fullMoon. However, it soon grew, and black spots became visible near its center. Inan all-too-common pattern, five fighter aircraft lost their communication andnavigational systems and were forced to return to their base. Their feeling wasthat the object released strong electric currents of some kind. One pilot toldthe Chinese Journal of UFO Research:... when I first saw the object, it flew toward me at a high rate of speed,whirling fast. While it was whirling, it created rings of lights. In the centerof the light ring was fire. After 10 seconds, the center of the ring explodedlike a hand grenade. Then the body of the object enlarged rapidly.The other four pilots also gave statements to the journal, which published anaccount of the incident in its first issue in 1983. dli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910021] Three days later, at the heel of Italy by the Adriatic Sea, a BritishCAA report recorded another aerial encounter. According to the report, thepilots saw an object pass down along their left side, roughly two miles away. Itwas described as a “black shiny doughnut shape about the size of a car. Objectwas tumbling and judged to be stationary.” If this were falling space debris,why would it look stationary? dlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910193] The Lid Stays OnRegarding UFO research, 1982 started out with a new International UFO Reporterby CUFOS. From this point onward, CUFOS published the IUR on a regular schedule,mainly on the efforts of Jerome Clark, Nancy Clark, and Mark Rodeghier.In January, Australian researcher Bill Chalker made the first visit to the RoyalAustralian Air Force (RAAF) archives in search of UFO documentation. He found “aresidue of provocative reports that survives the gauntlet of both official andcivilian investigation.” Rather than conspiracy, he leaned toward institutionalconfusion as the key response to UFOs by the Australian military. To him, theRAAF was probably “as confused and uncertain as many civilian research groups onwhat to do about provocative UFO sightings.” dliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910373] The “cloak and dagger” activity of recent years continued in 1982. Inearly February, William Moore received a plain envelope from one of theintermediaries of ‘Falcon.’ Inside were Air Force documents signed by RichardDoty regarding unexplained lights over Kirtland AFB and Manzano during Augustand September 1980. Moore, and later Bruce Maccabee, examined the documents andconducted a detailed on-site investigation. They found extensive corroborationand no contradictions. dliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910599] In March and April 1982, the National Enquirer published a series ofprovably false articles on UFOs. To many, this would not seem like an importantor unusual development, and indeed the Enquirer had done this kind of thingbefore. What complicated matters is that in recent years it had also beenpublishing UFO-related articles that were well-researched and accurate, mostnotably those by Bob Pratt. The articles from the spring of 1982, however, wereanalyzed by Swedish UFO researcher Anders Liljegren. They included “Soviet ShipsBuzzed by UFOs from Under the Sea” (3/30/82), “Space Alien Blasts Forest RangersWith a Bizarre Ray” (4/6/82), and “Space Aliens Blast Holes in Windows”(4/13/82). He fact-checked all three, finding errors indicative of intentionaldisinformation. The first article referred to 190 sightings of UFOs diving intothe sea by Soviet ships. One included a “9,000 ton freighter, VladimirVorobyev,” the crew of which supposedly had an encounter in the Sea of Japan inAugust 1980. Liljegren determined that there was such a ship with that name, butwas a small research/fishing vessel, built in West Germany. Considering theEnquirer’s CIA connections via its publisher, Gene Pope, such disinformationseemed designed to sow confusion, impede genuine research, and cast doubt overthe legitimate reports. dlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910751] Through the spring and summer the lawsuit against the NSA by CAUS continued tomuddle on. Early in 1982, Peter Gersten filed a petition for the Supreme Courtto hear the case of CAUS v. the NSA. He argued that the NSA did not clearlyjustify its reasons for withholding the requested UFO documents. He questionedthe actions of the court in not reviewing the documents first-hand, and itsdecision to rely upon a Top Secret summary prepared by the defendant of what thefiles contained. His petition was denied by the Supreme Court on March 8, whichruled that releasing the NSA’s files “could seriously jeopardize the work of theagency and the security of the United States.” Thus, the NSA’s 135 UFO documentsremained classified, unseen by even a single judge. Still, the battle continued.On April 27, Gersten on behalf of CAUS filed a request with the NSA for alllegal documents, memos, records, affidavits, and notes used to prepare and arguethe Civil Action case as well as the appeal. He also requested all or any partof the 21-page top secret affidavit.Oddly, the NSA partially declassified the 21-page NSA affidavit on May 18.Although nearly all reports of UFOs were censored out, it became known that atotal of 239 UFO documents had been discovered by the NSA in its files, with 79originating from other government agencies. That means 160, not 135, documentsoriginated from within NSA. One reference in the material even described theNSA’s ability to deal with “unusual phenomena.” Lawrence Fawcett and BarryGreenwood puzzled that the affidavit was released so quickly (albeit censored)following a simple letter from private citizens, after it had been completelywithheld throughout three legal actions. dlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1910962] Any victory attained by the limited release of the NSA documents wassnuffed out by an executive order signed by President Reagan on April 2, 1982.This was Executive Order #12356, which eliminated response time limits to FOIArequests. Almost immediately, searches for UFO documents were significantlydelayed. Henceforth, it would not be uncommon for a search to last two years ormore. Search fees rose accordingly, sometimes substantially – as high in oneinstance as $250,000. This was clearly unattainable for private citizens andnearly all organizations. dlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1911148] The ExecutiveOrder served notice that the glory era of the Freedom of Information Act hadended. The Act continued to be useful to researchers of all types, but the UFOdata slowed to a trickle compared with earlier years.Although Reagan’s order hindered the public’s ability to investigate the UFOcover-up, he himself retained a strong interest in the topic. His several publicstatements about the topic are well known. On June 27, 1982, Reagan hostedSteven Spielberg at the White House for a private screening of the latter’ssoon-to-be-released movie ET: The Extraterrestrial . The movie concerned astranded extraterrestrial who was trying to return to his world, while U.S.government agents tried to capture him. Along with the Reagans and Spielberg,thirty five others attended the special screening, including Supreme CourtJustice Sandra Day O’Connor. The movie deeply affected the Reagans, and thePresident said quietly to Spielberg, “you know, there aren’t six people in thisroom who know how true this really is.” Apparently, the surrounding crowd madefurther conversation impractical. The story came from Hollywood televisionproducer Jamie Shandera, who said that Spielberg had told him this personallyshortly after the incident occurred, while Shandera was involved in making adocumentary on Spielberg. (Shandera would also soon play a major role in theMJ-12 document controversy). Several attempts to follow up on this story failed.During the mid-1980s, Linda Moulton Howe, who was working on a script for a newdocumentary, spoke with Spielberg’s appointment secretary about arranging aphone interview with him to discuss the Reagan statement. She was told that nointerview was possible, as Spielberg was then on the other side of the worlddirecting a feature film. In 1988 Grant Cameron inquired with Spielberg aboutit, receiving the reply from Spielberg’s publicity coordinator that Spielbergwas away and “unable to personally answer your question.” Billy Cox, reporterfor Florida Today , also tried reaching Spielberg. Cox was told by Spielberg’spublicist, Marvin Levy, that “Mr. Spielberg does not wish to discuss any privateconversation held with the President.” dlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1911473]What makes this story more interesting is that the following morning, Reagan wasbriefed on the U.S. Space Program. Initially meeting in the highly secure WhiteHouse Situation Room with Chief of Staff James Baker, Attorney General EdwinMeese, and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver, the four then met with sixmembers of the National Security Council (NSC) – but no one from NASA. GrantCameron noted NASA’s absence from this kind of meeting as “unheard of.” It wouldseem that NASA had become irrelevant to the true U.S. space program. dlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1911860]On a related matter, the author can disclose a discussion he had with one“insider” who was well-placed in the intelligence community during the Reaganyears. When asked the question “how much do the Presidents know” about UFOs,this person stated that “some knew more than others.” While hinting that he didnot believe Presidents Clinton or George W. Bush had been briefed significantlyon the topic, it was his knowledge that President Reagan had been briefed (andhis near certainty that Presidents Carter and George Bush Sr. also had).Intrigue thickened in early July during a MUFON Symposium in Toronto. Accordingto William Moore, at some point during the proceedings he went out privatelywith Allen Hynek for a drink. On the way, he stopped at a store to drop off somefilm to be developed. The two then went to a bar, and Moore began to discuss theBennewitz case. After a few beers, Hynek made a shocking statement. Each year,he said, the Air Force gave him a certain amount of money to do consulting work,just as he had received during the days of Project Blue Book. During theprevious summer – that is, 1981 – Hynek was tasked with delivering a newcomputer and program to Bennewitz. However, he did not tell Bennewitz that thiswas done at the request of the U.S. Air Force. In other words, Hynek was workingfor the U.S. military-intelligence community, presumably in an attempt to spy onand influence Paul Bennewitz. Moore did not know what to make of this claim byHynek, but received supporting information from Bennewitz himself, who latertold him that his program to monitor alien communications had “been modified bythe aliens themselves,” in order to facilitate better communication with him.Moore’s story continued. The following day, his hotel telephone rang. It wasFalcon. “How did the pictures turn out?” he asked. Apparently Moore was not asalone with Hynek as he had thought. Falcon told Moore he was being watched. Ofcourse, it was possible that Hynek was informing Falcon of Moore’s activities.Nothing could be sure. Gregory Bishop even speculated that perhaps Hynek hadbeen told to tell the computer story to Moore in order to gauge his reaction.None of Hynek’s former associates has supported this story, although Bishop, whoreceived it directly from Moore, trusts and believes his source. dlx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912015] The Smith-Sarbacher Connection: UncoveredThe Hynek story may have some truth to it, but corroboration is unlikely and soit remains only an allegation. Meanwhile, traditional research methods weremaking significant strides toward getting under the real cover-up. Canadianresearcher Arthur Bray uncovered a very important lead in 1982. While goingthrough the papers of the late Wilbert Smith, Bray discovered handwritten notesrelating to a conversation Smith had about UFOs in September 1950 with a keyAmerican scientist. It had previously been learned that Smith wrote a secretmemo that year to his government on this topic, indicating that UFOs were “themost highly classified subject in the United States Government.” But the memohad given no names. In his handwritten notes, however, Smith revealed that hismain source was Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a brilliant scientist who was veryprominent within the Pentagon, and whose laboratory had been near the CanadianEmbassy in Washington. Most interesting was that, in 1982, Robert Sarbacher wasstill alive.Several researchers quickly followed up, most notably Stanton Friedman andWilliam Steinman. To the amazement not only of UFO researchers but elite memberswithin the aerospace community, Sarbacher confirmed Smith’s account and more. Hesaid, for instance, that prior to his conversation with Smith, he was invited toWright-Patterson AFB for a briefing on the recovery of a flying saucer in thewestern United States. In late 1983, he wrote a two-page typed letter toSteinman saying that while he was not directly involved in retrievals of downedflying saucers, “John von Neumann was definitely involved. Dr. Vannevar Bush wasdefinitely involved, and I think Dr. Robert Oppenheimer also.” He added... certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes wereextremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories analyzed them verycarefully.... I remember in talking with some of the people at the office that Igot the impression these ‘aliens’ were constructed like certain insects ....dlxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912226] Later, Sarbacher told Steinman that a certain Dr. Eric Walker wasinvolved. Walker was another prominent scientist and former President of PennState University. Sarbacher told Steinman that Walker (“for sure”) attended UFOmeetings at Wright-Patterson AFB in the early 1950s. Walker, too, was stillalive. Steinman found Walker and spoke to him, receiving the startlingly candidreply, “yes, I attended meetings concerning that subject matter...” Walker saidhe had known of MJ-12 since 1947, but told Steinman he was “delving into an areathat you can do absolutely nothing about,” and advised him to “leave it alone.”dlxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912405]Bray’s discovery of the Wilbert Smith notes was the most important researchdiscovery of 1982, but Leonard Stringfield continued to develop interestingsources and leads. One was a Lieutenant Colonel who claimed that a secretunderground military base existed in Texas, beneath the Fort Hood Army MilitaryReservation. He claimed to have intimate knowledge of the installation and toldStringfield about squadrons of unmarked helicopters with sophisticatedinstrumentation to monitor UFOs, or airlift them out of the area in the event ofa crash. dlxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912592] Incidentally, Charles Wilhelm, of the “Coalition of ConcernedUfologists,” who had been attacking Stringfield so stridently for some time,published a booklet on the alleged alien body photos, concluding that WillardMcIntyre contrived the whole affair and that he had been taken in as a pawn.This leaves the question of, who was Willard McIntyre, and why did he create acampaign to smear Leonard Stringfield? dlxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912801] The answer isnot difficult to envision, since McIntyre was previously associated with theCIA-connected Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (SPSE), and inany case the U.S. intelligence community appears to have been busy monitoringall areas of the UFO front.On June 2, 1982, a new organization, the Society for Scientific Exploration(SSE), met for the first time at the University of Maryland. Led by PeterSturrock of Stanford University, it included over 100 professors from NorthAmerican universities from a range of disciplines. The society’s goal was toprovide a forum discussion and analysis of anomalous phenomena, including butnot limited to UFOs. Its tone was decidedly scientific and non-conspiratorial.dlxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1912979] Twomonths later, the group held its first meeting in Europe (Munich), and was thesubject of a classified DIA report. Obviously, somebody was interested. dlxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1913117] Slowly but surely, researchers were making some strides in studying theUFO phenomenon and even uncovering elements of the cover-up. Still, skepticsscored a public relations victory on October 12, 1982, when PBS television aireda strongly debunking piece on UFOs that was produced by BBC/NOVA. Entitled TheCase of the UFOs , it was advertised as a “rigorous, scientific investigation ofthe fact, fiction and hoax of unidentified flying objects.” It gave extensivecoverage to Philip Klass, James Oberg, and Michael Persinger, the last of whomargued that UFO sightings and experiences were triggered by electrical phenomenaproduced by stress along geological fault lines. Persinger suggested the TravisWalton case was caused by an “electrically induced confabulation.” Briefappearances were made by Bruce Maccabee and Alan Hendry, both of which wereedited to look as though they agreed with the debunkers. Allen Hynek wasinterviewed at length but did not appear. Liberal use of terms like “buff” and“believer” were scattered throughout. The tenor of the show was not surprising,considering that Kendrick Fraser, editor of CSICOP’s Skeptical Inquirer ,provided the list of participants to the producers. Kenneth Arnold, America’s‘original’ flying saucer witness, now getting on in years, wrote to BBC producerJohn Groom, calling the program a “stupid, ignorant distortion of facts that Iknow were available to you.” dlxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1913273] As Noam Chomsky frequently pointed out, the relative openness of Westernsocieties required a more sophisticated form of propaganda to manage publicopinion than was needed in more authoritarian societies. dlxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1913556] Notsurprisingly, control over public opinion on UFOs was more heavy handed in theSoviet Union. There, according to Russian ufologist Valerie Sanarov, many UFOpublications were simply confiscated by postal authorities “as prohibiteditems.” dlxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1913920] America: First Among EqualsOne of the difficulties in understanding the nature of the UFO cover-up comesfrom its obvious international nature. UFOs are seen everywhere, not just in theUnited States. Why, then, would not some other nation go its own way andacknowledge the reality? Could the U.S. really control all other nations on thismatter – or within the context of the Cold War, at least all allied nations?One way to look at this question is to observe the relationships between theU.S. intelligence community with sister intelligence communities. For instance,in April 1982, war in the Falklands Islands broke out between Argentina andGreat Britain. During the fighting, the British government came to realize thatit was entirely dependent on America’s NSA for signals intelligence – as much as98 percent of Britain’s intelligence on Argentina’s naval and military movementscame from the NSA. While cooperation was generally good, one British officialsaid “there may be targets they [the Americans] don’t want to cover.” Britainsimply could not afford the kind of satellite coverage that the Americans wereable to produce. dlxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1914075] In other words, American dominance in matters of national security –even other nations’ national security – was frequently a given. It is not hardto see how America could exercise its military, intelligence, and economic mightto influence other nations regarding UFO policy. It is also helpful to rememberthat the dominance of national structures by private individuals and groups wasan old story by 1982, and firmly entrenched in the U.S. and elsewhere.Nationalism may have been going strong within the many world cultures, but wasfast becoming irrelevant in the realm of power politics and control of globalresources. dlxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1914233] As with Europe, so with Latin America, where the United States continuedits long history of propping up and destabilizing regimes as it saw fit. Indeed,shortly after the end of the Falklands war, the CIA recruited a motleyassortment of drug dealers and gun runners to train the so-called NicaraguanContras, 14 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1767619]and then deftly rigged elections in El Salvador. dlxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1915279] Meanwhile, adrug dealer named Barry Seal, allegedly connected with the CIA, began smugglingdrugs through an airstrip at Mena, Arkansas. Seal was convicted of drugtrafficking in 1984. In exchange for leniency, he agreed to work undercover forOliver North’s contra network. The smuggling operation continued. dlxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1915701] Big Brother Grows UpMeanwhile, an especially unsavory chapter in the secret history of the U.S. wasunfolding. In 1982, the U.S. Justice Department granted the contracting firmInslaw $10 million to adapt a certain computer program to the needs of U.S.attorneys in tracking criminal cases from office to office. The program, calledProsecutors Management Information System (PROMIS), had the vital capability ofinterfacing with other databases. PROMIS soon became an astonishingly powerfulprogram which certain insiders at the Department of Justice (and beyond)realized could provide applications for a wide range of other uses, a number ofwhich were clearly illegal, but immensely profitable. dlxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1915868] Shortly thereafter, PROMIS developer William Hamilton learned to his surprisethat he had lost his contract with the Justice Department. A sympathetic insidereventually told him why: his software had been pirated and was being resold withastonishing modifications. Thus began an extended legal battle of the Hamiltonsagainst the Department of Justice, which ultimately involved the NSA, organizedcrime, and much more. It eventually resulted in the murder of journalist DannyCasolaro – but not in justice for the Hamiltons.According to Ari Ben-Menasche, a former Israeli Mossad agent, PROMIS was used totap into the computers of telephone companies, water utilities, credit cardcompanies, and other public organizations to search for specific information. Itallegedly had a “backdoor” which allowed entry into the files of any foreignintelligence service using the system. Some considered this backdoor capabilityto be pure fantasy, although the secret may not have been with the software butrather the hardware. Such was the information that came to PROMIS developer,Bill Hamilton, who was told that “extra chips” were able to broadcast the datainside PROMIS to satellites owned by the NSA. This scenario neatly bypassedobjections that physical access was required for a backdoor to work. dlxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1915994]One of the modifications to PROMIS apparently included artificial intelligence,a feature developed by computer engineer Barry Kusnick. This ostensibly allowedPROMIS to deduce from personality characteristics the potential action of aperson being traced. Kusnick had previously done communications and intelligencework for Northrop and the U.S. military. He went missing during the early 1990s,presumably killed. dlxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916121] It also appears that PROMIS was useful to the military regime inGuatemala, where it tracked leftist insurgents. According to Ben-Menasch, evenif a dissident traveled under a false name, characteristics such as height, haircolor, age, were searched through the database, while a local army commandercould learn that a dissident matching that description had been in his areaseveral days before, took a train, then a bus, stayed at a friend’s house, andwas now on the road under a different name. “That’s how frightening the systemwas.” dlxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916246] Most important of all, PROMIS was used for money laundering. Accordingto information leaked to the Hamiltons, the software was installed throughoutthe BCCI banking empire to track wire transfers of money, all being monitored bythe NSA. dlxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916372] Journalist Gordon Thomas later published an authorized history of theIsraeli Mossad intelligence agency which included admissions about the theft andre-sale of PROMIS. His research showed that Israeli intelligence collaboratedwith the U.S. Justice Department to steal the software in the first place. TheFBI and CIA were then among the U.S. agencies that adapted PROMIS to track theintelligence information they produce. Elements in U.S. intelligence alsoadapted it to track financial transactions in the banking sector. Furthermore,U.S. and Israeli intelligence created a Trojan horse version of PROMIS whichthey then sold to foreign intelligence agencies (for approximately $500million), and promptly used it to spy on them. dlxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916500] Although the PROMIS saga displayed government corruption at its most banal, itsknown relationship to the UFO phenomenon and cover-up was at best indirect. Yetit is important here as a key moment in the expansion of the national securitystate. The matter of obtaining government ‘disclosure’ on UFOs takes on adifferent meaning when the very nature of one’s government is being transformed. Sightings in Late 1982With a few notable exceptions, the latter half of 1982 was a quiet period of UFOactivity. On September 17, 1982, the crew and captain of the Romanian cargo ship“Bosca” saw a UFO off the coast of Brazil, near the equator. The event wasspectacular, though sketchy on the details. The ship was 200 miles off thecoast, just outside of Brazilian territorial waters. Shortly after 9 p.m.,captain Stefan Freitag and his crew saw an object that looked like a full Moon,accompanied by a smaller, star-like object. This smaller object grew and becamebrighter, eventually equaling its companion. Both objects then disappeared,leaving behind a shiny cloud. But the scene had not ended. Another moon-likeobject appeared, during which a silent explosion occurred, and an orange lightradiated from the object. By now, Freitag and fourteen of his men were watchingand photographing this display. A fourth “Moon” then appeared; either this orthe other object rapidly approached the ship, causing the crew to panic and theship’s dog to howl. Then a fifth phenomenon appeared. Although it is not clearhow this series of events ended, it appears to have faded out, leaving a glowthat lasted for 30 minutes. Freitag communicated with the Brazilian coast guard,but received no answer. No heat was felt by any of the crew, although radiationlevels were higher than normal.James Oberg expressed regret that the case was even recorded and suggested thatresearchers should have investigated “some of the more obvious” terrestrialstimuli before rushing into print with such a report. Although he offered notheories, it is conceivable that some sort of aerial test was underway. dlxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916714] Even more dramatic was an incident from October 4, 1982, in which a UFOsighting allegedly almost caused a nuclear war. This case comes from the famed“KGB files” on UFOs, and was examined by ABC news correspondent David Ensor in1995. At a Soviet military base in Byelokoroviche, Ukraine, an object ofastonishing size – reportedly 2,900 feet in diameter – hovered over a nuclearmissile site. Many witnesses confirmed the sighting to Ensor, including missileengineer, Lt. Colonel Vladimir Plantonev, who described the UFO as silent,disc-shaped, with no portholes and a completely even surface. The missile siloat the base contained a fully functional warhead pointed at the United States.Plantonev was in a bunker while the object hovered overhead; on the controlpanels, signal lights suddenly turned on briefly, indicating that the missileswere preparing for launch. However, no orders had come from Moscow, nor hadanyone at the base pushed any buttons. For fifteen seconds, the base had lostcontrol of its nuclear weapons. Was this a malicious joke played by an alienprankster? dlxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1916919] Less dramatic but more interesting from a scientific point of view wasthe “Amarante” case that occurred at Nancy, France, on October 21, 1982. Thewitness, a biologist, reported that an oval-shaped object descended into hisgarden, hovering just one meter above the ground. He watched the object fortwenty minutes, when it then lifted straight into the sky. There was no soundduring the encounter, the witness felt no heat, nor were there any traces on theground afterward. One oddity, however, was that just before the object left, thegrass blades stood straight up. Later investigation by GEPAN/SEPRA succeeded induplicating this phenomenon in the laboratory by using intense electric fields.The investigators also noticed that the plants near the object had becomedesiccated while similar plants further away were in normal health. The fruit ofplants near the landing site looked as though they had been cooked. dlxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1917098] An interesting military encounter occurred on November 2, in theEstremadura province of Portugal. A Portuguese lieutenant was flying a DHC-1trainer from the OTA Air Base at 10:50 a.m. during clear skies. Below the planenear the ground, the pilot saw a small shiny object and reported the sighting tohis base. Ten minutes later, the pilot and passenger of another trainer sawprobably the same object as it gave off flashes of red and green light. Theobject circled for about ten minutes, at one point flying between the twoaircraft, enabling a reasonable estimate of its size – roughly six or seven feetin diameter. Finally it made a pass at the first plane and sped off out ofsight. dlxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1917650] By the end of the year, a far more interesting and lasting developmentwas occurring in the northeastern U.S. These were the triangle and “boomerang”sightings, investigated by a number of investigators, most notably a localscience teacher named Philip Imbrogno, who described the phenomenon in the bookNight Siege . Most of these sightings were in lower New York State orConnecticut, an area known as the Hudson Valley. They typically involved lowflying, silent, objects hovering over highways, shining bright lights to theground, and gliding away, sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly. By the mid-1980s,witnesses numbered in the thousands and covered the full sociological spectrum.One of the early compelling sightings occurred on New Year’s Eve, December 31,1982. A retired New York City police officer, outside his home in the town ofKent, just a few miles from the Connecticut border, was cleaning some debrisfrom a New Year’s champagne christening of his new home. The time was nearmidnight. Overhead, red, green, and white lights moved slowly across the sky.They appeared to be connected in a boomerang or V-shape. A faint, deep hum camefrom it, which the witness said sounded “like a factory with a lot of machinesrunning in the distance.” He called his wife, who came out with a video camera.They videotaped the object while it passed directly over their house just 500feet above. As it passed over, the retired officer felt a deep vibration in hischest.The strangeness did not end there. The multi-colored lights then vanished andthree bright white lights appeared in a triangular shape. The white lights thenwent out, and about fifteen multi-colored lights came on. It passed slowly outof sight towards Interstate 84, at the state border. “This was not any type ofaircraft that I know of,” the witness said. Unfortunately, the video came outpoorly; the bright white lights were discernable, as were some other coloredlights, but no structure could be seen.Philip Imbrogno found other witnesses to this sighting. One was a man drivinghome on Interstate 84 who saw many cars pulled off the road and a bright lightin the sky, making slow, tight circles in the air and scanning the ground with asearchlight. Initially, he assumed it was a helicopter, but could not see thestructure. Then the object descended toward his car, turned off its searchlight,and hovered about 300 feet off the road. The witness told Imbrogno it was“shaped like a boomerang with lights running up and down its wings.... so hugeit filled up the entire sky.” From fear and nervous reflex, he blew his horn.When the object shot another beam of white light onto the highway, he shieldedhis eyes. As the beam became closer, his nervousness became panic, and hepleaded from within his car for the object to leave. He felt a kind ofcommunication with whatever intelligence was connected to the object, and saidhe heard a “voice” that told him not to be afraid. Suddenly the object turnedaway and the beam of light vanished. He hurried home and told no one of hisexperience for quite some time. dlxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1917830] Sightings like this were only the beginning. The Hudson Valley was about toexperience the most startling wave of UFO activity in modern history.Explanations essentially came down to a few candidates: genuine UFOs (that is,alien vehicles), experimental or classified aircraft, or ultralight aircraftflying illegally in close-knit formations at night. Close examination of most ofthe cases over the next few years ruled out the ultralight explanation, as thoseaircraft lacked hovering ability, were considerably louder than what witnessesdescribed, could not legally fly at night, were not safe in close formations,and could not carry powerful search lights. In addition, it was illegal andextremely dangerous for any aircraft flying at night to shut off its lights forany extended period, as these objects repeatedly did.The experimental aircraft solution is a better candidate, but also problematic.For instance, the first deployment of the F-117 “Nighthawk” stealth fighter tookplace in 1982, and its existence remained classified for another six years. Itis conceivable that another classified project began to deploy at this time,although problems of explanation remain: what principles of flight could accountfor its extraordinary characteristics? What would be the mission of suchboomerangs? Why fly them so close to densely populated areas?Indeed, such questions apply regardless of whomever, or whatever, lay behindthese mysterious craft. Star Wars, the Soviets, and ET?By 1983, the Cold War had taken a decided turn in favor of the United States.Longtime Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had died in 1982, the CIA-supported warin Afghanistan continued to bleed the resources of the USSR, and the militaryspending of the Reagan administration surely worried Brezhnev’s successor, YuriAndropov. In January 1983, Andropov proposed a new East-West summit to create“nuclear free zones” in parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, ban the sale ofweapons to the developing world, and reduce the number of Soviet SS-20 missilesin Eastern Europe. He also proposed a non-aggression undertaking in which NATOand Warsaw Pact members would agree not to use force against each other, noragainst members of their own bloc (a move that obviously mattered more to theWarsaw Pact members than to NATO). It was a clear break with the past.Reagan was of no mind to compromise. In March 1983, he issued severalconfrontational public statements and private directives. On March 8, hereferred to the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,” and Soviet leaders as “thefocus of evil in the modern world.” dlxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1917985] On March 23,the same day that flight testing resumed on the B-1 bomber at Edwards AFB, thePresident gave his famous “Star Wars” speech. dlxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1918255] Like Andropov,Reagan too broke with the past, but in the opposite direction of his Sovietcounterpart. Rejecting the age-old idea of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) –that a preponderance of missiles by both sides would deter either frominitiating a nuclear war – Reagan promoted a “Strategic Defense Initiative”(SDI). This was an ambitious project to construct an anti-missile system inspace. Using ground-based and space-based weapon systems, SDI was to act as adefensive shield to intercept and destroy incoming hostile projectiles. Thus,not weapons reduction, but escalation, was Reagan’s answer to Andropov.Much of SDI’s science was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ina program headed by physicist Lowell Wood, a protégé of Edward Teller – the“father of the hydrogen bomb.” Indeed, Teller himself told Reagan of theprogram’s capabilities in early 1983. SDI used such technologies as lasers,x-ray weapons, and even an exotic “Kinetic Energy Weapon” which could fire aseven-gram projectile from a light gas gun at a velocity of more than 23,000feet per second (over 15,000 mph).Yet, it seemed too exotic to work for the 1980s, and quickly drew criticisms.Nobel physicist Hans Bethe, a man who had worked with Teller on the atomic andhydrogen bombs, argued that a laser defense shield was too costly, too hard tobuild, too easy to destroy, and liable to be overwhelmed by decoys. Diplomacywas the only way to end the threat of nuclear war, he maintained. SDI could evenworsen matters, causing the Soviets to view it as a positive threat. Europeanswere also alarmed that the “shield” apparently covered only America – leavingthem as the main target. 15[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1767786] Nor had Reaganprovided any analysis of the technological problems or likely cost of thisfuturistic program. Andropov, for his part, rejected SDI as futile. dlxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1918419] Anunsympathetic media dubbed the program “Star Wars,” initially as a pejorative toindicate that the whole idea was no better than fantasy, although Reagan soonembraced the term.Seen conventionally, SDI was a dubious bulwark of national security. From thebeginning, however, conjecture arose that the program was connected to the UFOsituation, a speculation amplified by Reagan’s several “alien invasion” remarksfrom later years. 16[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1768022] Yet,interpreting SDI in connection to UFOs is tricky. If such an array ofspace-based weapons could not be expected to stop Soviet missiles, how could itdeal with an alien menace? One obvious possibility is that SDI was not meant asa final answer, but as a starting point. Presumably, the anti-missile,anti-Soviet, component of SDI could serve as cover for the more exotic aspectsand covert missions.There are reasons to suppose there was more to Star Wars than met the eye. Inthe first place, several insiders and alleged insiders have spoken about asecret space program and of covert interactions with ET. This author spoke atlength to a former USAF Telecommunications Specialist named Simone Mendez (andreviewed her military records). During the early 1980s, Mendez had a Top SecretClearance while working at Nellis AFB with the 2069th Communication Squadron. InOctober 1981, a friend gave her a Top Secret message stating that NORAD haddetected deep space objects entering Earth’s atmosphere. Mendez subsequentlyunderwent intensive interrogation by the Air Force which sparked depression andpsychological problems for years.Another individual known to the author, Ronald S. Regehr, has providedsubstantiation of claims that “fastwalkers” (e.g. UFOs in space) are constantlybeing tracked. Regehr is a leading expert on the Defense Satellite Program(DSP), for which his employer Aero-Jet was a contractor. During the 1990s,Regehr accidentally, but legally, came into possession of many pages of theDSP’s “Individual Target Event Data Base” (nicknamed “Ittybitty”). This databasewas a list of fastwalkers tracked by the DSP satellites, which Regehr argues areideally designed for detecting UFOs. The database certainly supports thisbelief: during the period under review for this book (the years 1973 to 1991),the database recorded 283 space-based UFOs, an average of more than one permonth. In 1982, DSP sensors had tracked 15 UFOs; in 1983 the total was 17. Thesewere not primarily “deep space” UFOs, but it is indicative that the U.S. spaceprogram encountered UFOs with regularity. dlxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1918596]One of the most amazing fastwalker encounters by the DSP system occurred on May5, 1984, when a UFO entered Earth’s atmosphere from deep space, slowed, turned,and returned to deep space. The observation lasted for 9 minutes, and the objectcame to within a mere 3 kilometers of the satellite. A detailed investigationfailed to explain what caused the sensor reading, other than a real object ofsome type. As if this were not enough, another deep space platform, with whomRegehr’s group cross-tracked the sightings data, also detected this objectoptically. dlxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1918788] Other researchers have obtained similar information regarding thefrequency of fastwalker encounters. New York Times journalist Howard Blum, inhis 1990 book, Out There , said that NORAD deep-space radars regularly trackedmany UFOs. Also, according to UFO researcher and activist, Dr. Steven Greer,NORAD sources told him that the Air Force tracked about 500 fastwalkers enteringEarth’s atmosphere each year – more than one per day. Other sources told Greerthat rogue units within unacknowledged Special Access Programs – theprototypical black budget operations within the Department of Defense – secretlydeveloped SDI weapons to shoot down UFOs. dxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1918979] Attorney Stephen Lovekin, who had worked for the Army Signal Corpsduring the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, also stated his opinion that SDI was tobe used against extraterrestrials. In 2005, Lovekin spoke with filmmaker PeterJanney about the extraterrestrial presence on Earth and its associated cover-up.In 1995, he said, he attended a conference on SDI in Monterrey, Mexico, thatincluded high level American and Russian participants. “Star Wars,” Lovekin saidto Janney, “was not meant to keep us from a Russian attack, but it was there toput a curtain, if you will, over Russian territory as well as our territory. Wewere there to try to protect the Russians. The Russians knew it.” Lovekin added,somewhat unclearly, that he had seen Russian films of “UFOs trying to get away.... It was brought down ... exactly what Star Wars was supposed to do.” dxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1919136] Certainly, a large number of anomalous events are recorded by NASA, aswell as by the European Space Agency, the Russians, and the Chinese. dxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1919358] Theirabundance suggests at the very least a motivation to develop secret componentsto a space program – after all, if there are strange things going on in space,one would presumably want to investigate them. In a few instances, it looks asthough actual space-based weapons were used against alien objects.A strange object was recorded visually in space just a year and a half afterReagan’s Star Wars speech. This was during NASA’s STS-51 mission by the SpaceShuttle Discovery . In November 1984, as the shuttle approached the Westar VIsatellite (built by the Hughes’ Space and Communications Group), its videocamera recorded a sphere that seemed to materialize from a distance near the topcenter of the frame and then move with slight undulations across the right sideof the frame in a curved path. The Earth is visible in the background. Despitethe video’s extraordinary implications, it has received no significant publicanalysis.In correspondence with the author, Navy optical physicist Bruce Maccabeeconfirmed that the STS-51 video was real and not a hoax. He added his personalopinion that NASA was probably hiding secrets on UFOs in space. Maccabee wasunsure, however, whether the STS-51 video showed an alien craft. The object, hesaid, might have been “a reflection of something in a window or a small nearbyparticle.” He simply did not know what it was. dxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1919807]The object was captured on video for two seconds. It was clearly threedimensional, and did not look like recognizable debris – such as ice crystals –that might have been ejected by the shuttle. More to the point, the object’sapparent diameter can be seen to grow during the first second it appears, whenit is still above the horizon of the Earth. The effect is noticeable, and givesthe distinct impression that the object was moving toward the camera. Shuttledebris must be ruled out, as debris would move away from the shuttle, not towardit. Perhaps, as Maccabee speculated, the image was a reflection of something,although the video shows no evidence of reflection at any point. Considering allthe factors involved, the possibility of a genuine space anomaly must beconsidered. Indeed, it appears to be the strongest hypothesis until a detailedscientific analysis is undertaken.Undoubtedly the most famous space video of a UFO was taken during the SpaceShuttle Columbia’s STS-48 mission in September 1991. This showed what appearedto be the firing of a weapon at an object entering Earth’s orbit. While thereare no easy answers for this video, it must be said that the officialexplanation (booster rocket firing which thereby moved ice particles and debrisin various directions) has been energetically argued to be impossible. More onthis case later. dxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1919986] It also appears that the Soviets had a specific concern about Star Wars,and not the one conventionally described in history textbooks – that Star Warsthreatened to make their missile system obsolete. In the words of a June 1989issue of Soviet Military Review :"},{"pageContent":"This ballistic missile defense is designed to control outer space and destroynear-earth, air and space targets. Any system can be effective only if it ismanaged by super-quick computer systems. It is most important here to correctlyidentify targets. So, corresponding computer cells must ‘know’ what signalcharacteristics of the object it is tracking [that] can make it a potentialtarget. We believe that the lack of information on the characteristics andinfluence of UFOs increase the threat of incorrect information. Then, masstransition of UFOs along trajectories close to those of combat missiles could beregarded by computers as an attack. dxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1920614]In other words, the USSR was concerned that UFOs could be misidentified by SDIas attacking Soviet missiles. This exactly mirrored the fears expressed by theAmerican UFO research organization NICAP during the 1950s and 1960s. It wasimperative, argued NICAP Director Donald Keyhoe and former CIA Director RoscoeHillenkoetter (who was on the NICAP Board) that UFOs be taken seriously by themilitary so as not to confuse UFOs with Soviet missiles. Of course, the realityback then was that, contrary to public statements by the military, UFOs werebeing taken very seriously. For that matter, it is just as likely that theproblem was understood equally well during the 1980s. Runaway GovernmentDuring early 1983, the Reagan Presidency undertook measures to tighten controlover government secrets. On March 11th, President Reagan authorized NationalSecurity Decision Directive (NSDD) 84, which substantially increased governmentcontrol over federal employees, particularly their relationships with the media.Various government agencies, such as the CIA, had long been using secrecycontracts and lifetime censorship to prevent employees from revealing sensitiveor embarrassing information. Congress with some success had blocked the spreadof this trend, enabling federal employees to become “whistle blowers” on waste,fraud, and abuse within the federal government. Reagan’s directive effectivelyoverturned such Congressional attempts, and applied to all executive branchagencies – including more than 100,000 government employees. The directivemandated that all employees who had access to sensitive information were nowsubject to lifetime censorship of their writings and speeches on those topics. Researcher Terry Hansen pointed out that this directive would enable thepresident to lie about foreign policy matters, “and senators and representativeswho knew he was lying could not contradict him using information that wasclassified.” Despite arguments that the directive undermined the underlyingpurpose of the First Amendment – which was to preclude such restraints onspeech, especially on behalf of the public good – the directive has gone throughits inevitable expansion. As legal theorist and writer Frederick W. Whatley putit: “Governments invariably favor prior restraint. A free society should not.”The slippery slope toward an American police state had just become steeper.dxcvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1920785] The directive came at an inconvenient time – or convenient, depending onhow one looks at it. For instance, it might have been inconvenient had VicePresident George Bush’s relationship with Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriegabeen fully known at that time. Bush had personally intervened to keep Noriegafunded by the CIA, despite his known role as a smuggler of cocaine into theUnited States. Indeed, the two conspired to create a CIA-backed army of “contra”mercenaries that directed terrorist attacks against the Nicaraguan governmentand people. dxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1921118] Yet, Noriegawas becoming a problem for U.S. policy makers. He was playing both sides of thegame, including sending guns to leftists in Latin America and high-technology tothe Soviet Union. dxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1921351]The Contras were an interesting problem, as they seemed to be more interested inmaking money in narco-trafficking than in toppling Nicaragua’s Sandinistagovernment. This was during President Reagan’s “War Against Drugs,” punctuatedby the slogan “Just Say No.” The obvious question arises, how much did U.S.intelligence know about the drug trafficking, and how guilty were they inallowing it to happen? The question was made public in 1996, when journalistGary Webb published a three-part exposé entitled “Dark Alliance,” squarelylaying much complicity on the CIA. Immediately, the hounds were unleashed uponGary Webb – in the form of the New York Times , Washington Post , and LosAngeles Times . He lost his job within a year, and ten years later died of two“self-inflicted” gunshot wounds to the head. In short, it appears that Gary Webbwas “suicided.” dxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1921555] 1983 was noteworthy for many such subterranean developments. During theyear, the stolen “Big Brother” software known as PROMIS was probably installedin the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). At least, this is whattwo computer experts from the World Bank later told the owners of the software,Bill and Nancy Hamilton. The experts added that while the “hardest evidence”pointed to those two institutions, the program was almost certainly being “muchmore widely used.” dc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1921778] The issue of secrecy becomes more complicated when one considers howgovernment functions increasingly became privatized. This trend was moving at abrisk pace during the 1980s. 1983, for instance, saw the founding of theNational Endowment for Democracy (NED), an “establishment-oriented” organizationmanaged by individuals such as Henry Kissinger, Sally Shelton-Colby (WilliamColby’s wife), Barbara Haig (Alexander Haig’s daughter), and similar luminariesof the elite. Although it was furnished with $80 million in financing fromCongress, its private status kept it safe from FOIA requests and governmentaudits. It soon became a kind of private CIA. Among its hundreds of programswere: destabilizing Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and Manuel Noriega inPanama, supporting the Nazi PAN party in Mexico, channeling money to theContras, and supporting operatives of the Medellin drug cartel. In other words,this “foundation” was – and remains – a private intelligence network with adefinite agenda; some observers have claimed its operations are more extensiveand more effective than those of the CIA. dci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1921941] One dimension of secrecy concerns the ability to develop secret bases.To what extent are significant underground bases feasible? To what extent dothey exist? The expansion of secrecy within the United States government makes adefinitive answer to the second of these questions difficult, although the firstcan be answered more confidently. In June 1983, the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory (LANL) proposed the creation of an underground science facility to beconstructed deep beneath the nuclear test site in southern Nevada. The proposedfacility was planned to be an astonishing 3,500 feet underground, although thestudy left open the possibility of extending it down to 6,000 feet – more than amile underground. It is unknown whether such a facility was actually built.Still, one can assume that those who made the proposal recognized the technicalfeasibility of a mile-deep underground installation. dcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1922190] The Hudson Valley ObjectsMeanwhile, the UFO phenomenon escalated in the northeastern United States,particularly New York State’s Hudson Valley. Quite a few of the 1983 sightingswere dramatic, often involving low flying objects and astonished motorists.One such case took place on February 26 near the town of Kent, New York. Closeto 8 p.m., a mother and her teenaged daughter were driving home when the carradio began to hiss. Outside their window, they saw as many as 50 intenselybright lights moving slowly across a clear night sky. They pulled the car offthe road, and realized the lights were part of one object which had stopped overa pond. Despite her daughter’s screams of terror, the mother went out to get abetter look. She saw that the pond ice reflected the object’s red and bluelights, which flashed “like crazy,” and she also noticed a large central amberlight. The entire object appeared to be quite large, perhaps 200 to 300 feetlong.What followed next was an apparent mental communication between the woman andthe UFO. For three or four minutes, the object simply hovered over the frozenpond; then it began to move away. She then issued a thought to the object:“please don’t go. I want to look at you some more.” At that moment, the objectstopped, made a complete turn, and moved slowly toward her. This frightened her,and she quickly moved toward her car. In apparent response, the object stoppedand moved away. After returning to the car, she regained some courage anddecided to follow. She blew her horn to get the attention of others, andeventually some other cars stopped. Soon a small group of people were observingthe object glide across the sky, convinced that no one else would believe whatthey were seeing.Moments later a few miles away, a teacher and two friends (both air trafficcontrollers) were exiting Interstate 84 at Danbury, Connecticut, when theynoticed odd colored lights in the pattern of a boomerang. They stopped their carand got out. Once again, the object approached them – this time hoveringdirectly above them. It was low enough – about 1,000 feet in the air – that theycould see the lights were part of a solid object, and they discerned a blackunderside. Even so, they heard no sound from it. The object drifted off to thenortheast and disappeared, leaving the witnesses utterly baffled. They agreednot to talk about what they saw, but changed their minds when others reportedthe same thing. When local investigator Philip Imbrogno contacted the Danburypolice about this incident, he was simply told that “stable people do not reportUFOs.” dciii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1922358] February 26, 1983 had been a busy night, but the sightings were only beginningin the Hudson Valley.The sightings of March 17 were more dramatic still. For an incredible 30-minuteperiod, many people within a ten-mile radius in the Hudson Valley reportedseeing a large boomerang-shaped object. At 8:40 p.m., a Brewster woman namedLinda Nicoletti looked out of her house window to see a large V-shaped objecthovering over Interstate 84. It had rows of multi-colored lights along the sidesand a bright light in the center. She watched in amazement as it made a rightangle turn, and she also noticed her neighbor, Dennis Sant, watching the objectfrom outside his house. The object moved over his house and bathed the area inbright light. The object then stopped and hovered directly over him. Concernedfor her neighbor and herself, Nicoletti phoned the sheriff’s office in Brewster.The dispatcher told her that there had been quite a few UFO calls that night,and that several police officers had reported a UFO. What she was seeing, thedispatcher told her, was a type of experimental vehicle from Stewart Air ForceBase (a statement the sheriff’s office later denied making). As she hung up thephone, the lights moved slowly away to the north. Others also saw this object,one of them a pilot who was “sure” that it was not any type of aircraft he wasfamiliar with.Sant, who was a deputy clerk for Putnam County, confirmed the event to UFOinvestigators. “It seemed about the width of a football field and was a dark,very grey metal,” he said. “It was so close you could hit it with a baseball.”He said the object had been quiet, but not silent. He heard “a low engine sound,very finely tuned.” dciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1922512] The sightings continued. Exactly one week later, on March 24, 1983, peoplereported the same craft behaving just as it had done before. Throughout theHudson Valley, between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. that night, switchboards werejammed with reports of a large UFO. Judging from the reports, it appears thattwo objects of slightly differing sizes were patrolling the area, as witnessesfifteen miles apart simultaneously saw a low-flying object with red, blue, andgreen lights arranged in a boomerang pattern. At least one of these objects wassilently moving back and forth across the Taconic Parkway; motorists left theirvehicles to observe. Several witnesses reported a bright beam of white lightcoming from the bottom of the object, shining down on the cars.There are many detailed accounts from this night. A doctor and his family saw awhite beam of light descend from the object; a small red object then traveledhalfway down the beam and shot off across the horizon. A couple driving in a cardescribed an object at least six stories high, which shot across the horizon andcame back to a hovering position near them again, all within a split second. Awoman driving alone saw a distant object which then moved rapidly and directlyover her car. An executive saw a light “jump” from one part of the object toanother. A police officer saw an object that turned 180 degrees around, as if ona wheel, then slowly drift away. An aircraft designer described a UFO “as atleast twice the size of a large jet with brilliant white lights in the shape ofa V.” He tried to convince himself it was a plane. “But it didn’t act like one.”Another witness was a chief meteorologist for the National Weather Corporation.He, too, was unable to identify the object, even though it was a mere 1,000 feetabove him. It was “as large as an aircraft carrier” and totally silent. All atonce its string of lights came on and it hovered for a few seconds. Stillanother witness described the object that night as “a flying city.” dcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1922666] Perhaps the most amazing account from that evening came from Gene Mallon, a NewYork State corrections officer, described as a “level-headed family man” byinvestigators Chris Clark and Philip Imbrogno. The experience upset Mallondeeply. He had been driving two teenagers, a brother and sister, to their homein his Jeep, when he noticed very low lights in the sky. Much brighter than carheadlights, they quickly changed to multiple colors. He stopped his Jeep, gotout, and watched the lights approach him. Soon they were hovering directly abovehim.From a distance, the lights had appeared in a V-shaped formation, but it was nowevident to Mallon that they were part of an object, and that the object wascircular in shape – a very large circle, perhaps 200 feet in diameter. It waseither silent or else humming slightly. Soon, the teenaged boy got out of thecar while his sister remained inside, hysterical. Mallon simply continued towatch the object. He counted as many as 30 lights outlining the object, makingthe edges look bright and the center dark. He stayed beneath this object for avery long period of time – he claimed a total of ten minutes, although quitepossibly not that long.He eventually responded to the crying of the girl in his car and drove to anearby restaurant. From there he called his father-in-law, who was nearby. Thefather-in-law immediately saw the object, which to him looked like an enormoussilent boomerang. Soon, it began to move away. Mallon tried to follow it, but itdisappeared sometime after 9:15 p.m., going west over Interstate 84.It had been an amazing evening. Indeed, the local UFO hotline eventuallyreceived about 300 calls regarding that night. dcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1922872] So it was in the Hudson Valley for the rest of the spring, the rest ofthe year, and the next several years. The UFO sightings received a good deal oflocal publicity. On March 26, the Westchester-Rockland Daily Item ran theheadline, “Hundreds see UFOs!” It was at this point that the ‘pranksters-flying-ultralight-aircraft-in-formation’ theory was used to explain the sightings. Thetheory was ludicrous from the outset, but necessary to help minimize panic. Anultralight – essentially a hang glider equipped with a seat and a small engine –could in no conceivable way have been responsible for the sightings in question.One witness to the March 24 sightings, a police officer, made this very clear.“I saw the thing,” he told investigators, “it hovered directly over my head forfive minutes, and airplanes don’t hover.”The military aircraft theory was another early offering. Police in the towns ofBrewster and Carmel reported that they were told that the UFO was actually aformation of military planes being transferred from nearby Stewart AFB to a newlocation in New Jersey (Linda Nicoletti had been told a variation of this, whenshe called the police on March 17). The base had been inactive from 1970 until1983, when the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard took upquarters. These pilots were said to be unfamiliar with night flying, so theyfollowed the Taconic parkway. This might sound reasonable, except that theTaconic Parkway was a completely unlighted road, the “pilots” wandered in alldirections (including north), and they never even reached their destination,since the UFO reports ended at the southern part of Westchester County.Several UFO researchers investigated the sightings: Philip Imbrogno, Bob Pratt,Fred Dennis, Sheila Sabo, Chris Clark, and George Lesnick. Even J. Allen Hynekflew in from Evanston, Illinois. Working with limited time and resources, theycontacted area police stations and airports, interviewed witnesses, anddiligently investigated leads.They saw that something important was going on that defied an easy explanation.The ultralight theory was an obvious red herring, but the possibility ofmilitary flights was more serious. A spokesperson at Stewart AFB told them thatthe police claim (that the base had said their aircraft were responsible) wasfalse: there had been no flights to or from the base during the busy night ofMarch 24. On the other hand, he said, the base did receive phone calls fromcitizens that night regarding low-flying formations of aircraft and helicopters– not UFOs – buzzing their homes. These aircraft were circling at low altitude,as if they were looking for something. Perhaps, the investigators wondered, somegovernment agency was monitoring the UFOs.Inquiries with the Westchester and Dutchess County airports had similar results.The Westchester County Airport received calls about UFOs on the night of the24th, but nothing showed up on its radar (which could not track below 1,000feet). After receiving so many phone calls about an object, air trafficcontrollers tried to make radio contact with it, but with no success. At theDutchess County Airport, controllers saw a formation of multicolored lights at9:10 p.m., but could not track them on radar. They assumed they were seeingsmall aircraft flying in illegal formation, but still could not understand howthe planes could keep such a tight formation, or hover, or remain virtuallysilent. dcvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1923059] It became evident that aircraft explanations of any sort were problematic. Noagency came forward to claim any of the Hudson Valley objects. While it wasalways conceded that classified or experimental aircraft were possible culprits,there remain no obvious candidates even decades later. The F-117A stealthfighter, sometimes argued to be the cause of occasional UFO sightings, wasangular enough that it bore a superficial resemblance to a boomerang. Yet, itwas based on the other side of the country, in Nevada’s Tonopah Test Range, anddid not become operational until October 1983. Nor were the stealth fighter’scapabilities even remotely comparable to the object described by thesewitnesses. If the UFO was man-made, it would have to have been from a projectmore deeply classified than this, one that has remained classified for severaladditional decades. It is worth asking, too, how such a large craft could moveso silently and slowly – and why it was tested over such a densely populatedarea?As the sightings of boomerangs continued, so too did sightings of mysterioussquadrons of helicopters and what became known as “mystery planes.” These wereunmistakably conventional aircraft, yet unidentified. Eventually, realultralights flown by hoaxers further muddied the waters. dcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1923213] The appearanceof such obviously conventional aircraft enabled police agencies to explain allsightings in this manner. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), forced intomaking public statements, said that as long as the lights avoided restrictedairspace and commercial flight paths, they would probably do nothing. On theface of it, this was an odd position to take, since if conventional aircraftwere responsible, many of the flights would have been illegal.The FAA had an institutional aversion to truth on this matter. Any publicinvestigation held out a likelihood that a culprit would not be found. Worse, itwould open public discussion on the matter, and the true strangeness of theobject would be plainly evident. Denial would no longer be tenable, publicpositions would become unstable, and public panic would be a real possibility.Bureaucracies, by their very nature, are designed to stifle initiative orindividual responsibility; no bureaucratic institution would want to admit thatthere was an unknown, incredibly advanced, piece of technology traversing theskies of lower New York State.Behind everything, of course, was the obvious question, the inescapable issuehaunting the valley. Were the boomerangs genuine UFOs – that is, alien? If so,they were unlike all previous UFOs. In the first place, the boomerang shape wassomething quite new. Moreover, they flew again and again over a denselypopulated region during ideal evening viewing hours, where they were seen bythousands of witnesses. This too was something new.Many witnesses were not prepared to accept that these were actual UFOs. This wasthe case during an all-too-typical, all-too-extraordinary family highwayencounter on the night of March 26, 1983. The family saw a V-formation of lightslow in the sky which approached their car to within 300 feet. The father, a highschool physics teacher, said it was “much more silent than any engine I everheard.” The family clearly saw that a single object was connected to the lights,more than 75 feet long from tip to tip. Everyone in the car screamed wildly,including the father, although he later told investigators he believed it was ahoax. “I mean, it has to be a hoax,” he said. “These things [UFOs] don’t exist,that’s what I feel.” He believed the police ultralight theory, and that thecraft “must have had extensions on its wings to make it look bigger, and thelighting was lightweight.” Investigators pointed out that adding any extensionto an ultralight would increase its uplift ratio and make it nearly impossibleto control. “You’re right,” he said. “But that’s the only explanation I can comeup with to explain the object.” dcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1923369] Other witnesses were similarly disinclined to accept their encounter,including those that suggested an abduction experience. From the beginning,there were several Hudson Valley cases that had a possible abduction connection.In one instance, three witnesses who had been together during their sightingafterward all had vivid UFO-related dreams. One of them underwent hypnosis andrecalled an alien abduction (“don’t worry, we won’t hurt you”), although hehimself remained skeptical of the event, insisting it was just a dream. dcx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1923523]Generally, the investigators who took the time to review the reports believedthat something alien was staging a dramatic display in the sky. Linda Moulton Howe meets Richard DotyWhile the Hudson Valley experienced a wave of UFO sightings and President Reaganwas busy promoting SDI, America’s intelligence community was making furtherinroads into the UFO research field.On January 10, 1983, Richard Doty of AFOSI met with three individuals in anAlbuquerque restaurant to discuss extraterrestrials and UFOs: UFO researchersPeter Gersten and William Moore, and a San Francisco television producer namedRon Lakis. Among their topics of discussion was the August 9, 1980 incident atManzano. Athough Doty was short on details, he gave the impression that he knewa great deal about UFO investigations. The following day, Doty and Gersten metalone. Doty said that his involvement with UFOs began at Ellsworth AFB in 1977,when a craft landed. A document associated with this incident (alleged to be ahoax) stated that a beam of light had been fired at a security guard,disintegrating his gun and burning his hand. The two also discussed a groupcalled MJ-12, which Doty said stood for “Majority 12.” The government knows thatUFOs are extraterrestrial, said Doty, and that they come from fifty light-yearsaway. At least three UFO crashes have occurred, and bodies have been recovered.There had been an arranged meeting between aliens and U.S. military on April 30,1964. The NSA was communicating electronically with ETs through projectAquarius. Spooks were collecting information and spreading disinformation withinthe UFO community. The most sensitive cover-up documents were going to beimpossible to retrieve. The U.S. government had made an agreement withextraterrestrials in which the ETs could conduct animal mutilations and land atcertain bases. In exchange, the U.S. government obtained advanced alientechnology. Indeed, said Doty, the Cash-Landrum UFO of 1980 had been an attemptby the military to exploit such technology. Finally, the media establishment waspreparing the public to accept the reality of visitation by beings from otherworlds.Judging the veracity of these statements, especially when coming from a U.S.intelligence officer, is not particularly easy. Doty even asked Gersten, “how doyou know that I’m not here to either give you misinformation, or to give youinformation which is part of the programming, knowing you're going to go out andspread it around?” dcxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1923678] Gersten didspread it around. He phoned Barry Greenwood about it, and in early April, 1983,he met with Linda Moulton Howe in New York City. Gersten said that Doty might beable to give her information concerning the Ellsworth incident. As Howe was thenworking on a documentary for HBO dealing with extraterrestrials entitled E.T.s:The UFO Factor , the information seemed propitious. dcxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1924249] Howe was soonin Albuquerque developing her script. Indeed, it was to include a study of theclaims of Paul Bennewitz and report on the strange activities at Kirtland AFBand the Manzano Weapons Storage Area.She met Doty on April 9, although he was not at the airport to meet her as theyhad agreed. Howe had to phone Gerald Miller, Director of Weapons TestingEvaluation at Kirtland AFB – the same Miller mentioned in the NSA ProjectAquarius document, and with whom she had already known through priorcommunications. Miller drove her to his home, and from there was able to reachDoty, who came to pick up Howe. Doty never offered a logical reason for why hehad not been at the airport. He drove directly to Kirtland AFB’s Office ofSpecial Investigations (AFOSI). On the way, Howe mentioned the alleged HollomanUFO landing by saying, “Bob Emenegger told me the date was May 1972.” To Howe’ssurprise, Doty acknowledged that it happened, and said with irritation, “That’sbullshit! The date was April 25, 1964.” Doty seemed unusually certain aboutthis, Howe thought. The Socorro, New Mexico, sighting by policeman LonnieZamora, which had occurred the late afternoon before, had been a “mistake,” Dotytold her. Zamora had seen an alien craft at 6 p.m., Doty explained, but thearrangement had been for 6 a.m. the next day. “We, or they . . . someone blewthe time and coordinates,” said Doty. “What Zamora saw was an advance militaryscout ship. We got it corrected and the Ebens came back to where they weresupposed to be, at the Trinity site in White Sands the next morning at 6 a.m.,April 25, 1964.”The two drove toward the Kirtland AFB entrance gate. On the right Howe could seeBennewitz’s Thunder Scientific Corporation. Through the gate, they drove to asmall building that had an AFOSI identification sign. Doty said that he hadpermission to use his boss’s office. As they walked into a large office, Dotysaid to Linda Moulton Howe, “You broadsided the U. S. government with thatdocumentary.” This of course was a reference to her television film, A StrangeHarvest . “It came too close to something we don't want the public to knowabout.” Why were extraterrestrials mutilating animals? Howe asked. Doty repliedthat the subject was classified beyond his need to know.Then, Doty sat down behind a large desk that had someone else’s name plate. Theytalked about Ellsworth AFB, and Doty showed Howe a document that described theencounter. There had been a UFO intrusion, Doty said, but what amazed AFOSI inthis case was that the “inner zone alert” went off, indicating that somethinghad entered the underground chamber. Yet, the entrance hatches were untouched.Doty then took out a Manila envelope. “My superiors have asked me to show thisto you,” he said. “You can read these and you can ask me questions, but youcan’t take any notes. And I want you to move from the desk to that chair.” Hepointed at a large, green, leather chair in the middle of the office. Howe wasconfused by what was happening, but was so stunned to read the top page of whatDoty handed her that she followed his instructions. A few years later, she wastold by a source that she was audiotaped and videotaped during that meeting tolearn her reaction to what she read. The top page of the documents was in allcapital letters and entitled, BRIEFING PAPER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICA ABOUT THE SUBJECT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL CRAFT (UACs). Theopening pages contained summaries of government efforts such as Project Sign andthe Robertson Panel concerning extraterrestrials, the 1948 crash of USAF pilotThomas Mantell after a disc encounter, and a list of several UFO crashes andretrievals. Howe recalled that the earliest on the list was 1946, but otherdates included 1947, 1949 and the early 1950s. These occurred in Roswell (1947and 1949); Aztec, New Mexico; Kingman, Arizona; and northern Mexico south ofLaredo, Texas.According to the document, radar interfered with the aliens’ guidance system.Bodies and craft had been taken to secure government facilities such as LosAlamos National Laboratories (LANL) and Wright Field, Ohio. The word“extraterrestrials” was used in the document Howe read. These creatures weredescribed as grey in color, three to four and a half feet tall, with long arms,four fingers on each hand, and no thumbs. They had webbing between their fingersand claw-like nails. Small holes existed where one would expect noses and ears.Howe noted this description differed from the large beaklike nose described byRobert Emmeneger of the beings at Holloman AFB.The briefing paper also described a live extraterrestrial recovered from a 1949crash near Roswell that was transported to LANL. This creature died of “unknowncauses on June 18, 1952.” During those three years, “EBE” – an acronym for“extraterrestrial biological entity” – communicated telepathically and verballyabout his civilization. Ebe’s civilization came from the binary star system,Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2, about 38 light-years from Earth. His species had beencoming to Earth for at least 25,000 years. The government has been trying tolearn about the ETs, stated the document, and there were four projects mentionedon the last page. Project Garnet dealt with questions and mysteries about humanevolution. According to the document, “All questions and mysteries about theevolution of Homo sapiens on this planet have been answered and this project isclosed.” Project Sigma was designed to communicate with extraterrestrials byusing various electronic frequencies, one-way or two-way, and had been runningsince 1964. Project Snowbird provided research and development of alientechnology, including efforts to fly one or more of the ET craft. ProjectAquarius was a general project to gather all information about the aliens. Howeread that some of the data collected in this program had been used to advancethe U.S. space program. The “presidential briefing paper” also related how, atvarious intervals in Earth’s history, the extraterrestrials had come “tomanipulate DNA in already-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens.” Sherecalled that 25,000, 15,000, 5,000 and 2,500 years ago were given as timeintervals when E.T. manipulation of primate DNA occurred. Another bombshellstatement in the briefing paper was that “two thousand years agoextraterrestrials created a being” to teach mankind about love and nonviolence.When Howe read this she looked at Doty and said, “we’re talking about JesusChrist, here?” Doty nodded silently.Howe saw a reference to another alien type, referred to as “the Talls.” Shementioned that there were two types of ETs often described in mutilation cases:the smaller greys, and taller beings sometimes called Nordics, “and maybe youcall the Talls. Who are they?” Howe wrote that Doty’s face turned red. She laterrealized that he must have been tape recording the conversation and she musthave interfered with this when she approached him with her question. Heexplained that there was friction between the greys and the tall ones, but that“they tolerate each other.” In fact, Howe recalled cases in her research wherethere seemed to be collaboration between greys and Nordics.“Why are you showing this to me?,” she asked him. “Why not the New York Times orthe Washington Post or 60 Minutes?” Those institutions were problematic, hereplied. Independent people are easier to manipulate, control, or discredit ifthe need arose. But there was more, Doty said. He was showing all this to Howebecause his superiors intended to release several thousand feet of filmincluding images of crashed discs, alien bodies, the live ET known as “Ebe,” thetruth about Lonnie Zamora’s UFO encounter, and the Holloman landing. Howe wasgoing to be permitted to use this for her HBO documentary, and she was going toreceive support by official government confirmation. Doty would call her and usethe code name Falcon.Howe felt “as if fragile pieces of ancient scrolls” were being put in her hand.Yet why was Doty telling her so much? And wasn’t it dangerous for Doty to tellher of all this? His answer startled her: “I have been told to tell you. We wantyou to do the film.”Doty had to leave, but the two met later for dinner in a noisy restaurant whereoverhearing quiet conversation would be difficult. He told her the planet of the“Ebens” is a hot desert, and they live in houses carved out of rock and soil,something like Pueblo Indians. This was known, he said, because some humanresearch scientists had been studying their planet, just as the Ebens arestudying Earth. Doty added that the aliens can control gravity, and manipulateDNA “like a child can build with blocks.” There were spiritual truths, as well.Ebe had said souls recycle, and that reincarnation is real. “It’s the machineryof the universe.”Alone in her hotel room, Howe was struck by the enormity of what Doty had toldher. Feverishly writing down everything she remembered, she did not think itwould have been possible for Doty to have made this all up to manipulate her forsome secret agenda. She phoned her producer at HBO. She told her about themeeting and the potential historic film release. The two agreed to say nothinguntil Howe actually got something. They also agreed that HBO should getsomething in writing from the government “affirming its intention to releasefilm” for inclusion in the HBO documentary. dcxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1924414] Through April and May 1983, Howe and Doty spoke by phone several timesabout getting an official letter of cooperation to HBO that would confirm thegovernment’s intention to release sensitive film. Howe needed that letterdelivered before her next meeting with HBO in New York City, scheduled for May18, 1983. But no government communication had reached HBO by the time shearrived. Bridgett Potter, second in charge to HBO head, Michael Fuchs, made thesurprising statement that she would not authorize production funds without thegovernment’s UFO films delivered to HBO – along with the firm backing of “thePresident, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State and theJoint Chiefs of Staff.” From New York, Howe called Doty at Kirtland AFB abouther frustration. He replied that his superiors did not work for HBO; they hadtheir own timetable. Also, the release of the film to her had been delayed for“political reasons.” However, he had good news for her: she would be allowed tointerview the colonel who had spent a great deal of time with Ebe during theearly 1950s. Appointments were repeatedly set and then cancelled. dcxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1924580] In June 1983, Doty told Howe there were more delays and that he wasleaving the project. Others would contact her. He gave her the name of someonein Washington, D.C., who called her home office three times when she was out(that name was written on phone message pads on three different dates variouslyby her husband and their housekeeper). By October 1983, HBO had withdrawn itsfunding and dropped her documentary. Then, in the spring of 1984, Howe receivedanother call to tell her there was still government interest in having herproduce a film – not for HBO but perhaps the Corporation for Public Broadcasting– although nothing could be done until after the November 1984 election. Infact, nothing was ever released to her. dcxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1924745] For more than three years, Howe told no one of her experience with Doty,other than a few close associates. Then, in June 1987, MJ-12 documents werefirst made public, showing an obvious relationship to the documents she had seenduring her 1983 meeting. In October 1987, at the request of Just Cause publisherLarry Fawcett, Howe described her saga with Doty and the subsequentdevelopments. She concluded that in all probability “MJ-12 did not want the samefilmmaker who did A Strange Harvest to focus on the UFO phenomena for a nationalTV audience.” dcxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1925020]Doty quickly denied most of Howe’s main points. In a letter to Larry Bryant, hestated that the meeting was “a simple matter” between himself and Howe. Heconceded that they did meet at Kirtland (covertly monitored by two supervisors),but all this was from her initiative. She wanted to know about the 1980 Kirtlandincident and implied she had information about it, he said. They discussed thatand the Ellsworth AFB incident, and then Howe mentioned her HBO film project.Regarding the last, Doty said, he had no information for her, certainly nohistoric film footage. He claimed she insisted on discussing MJ-12,extraterrestrial beings, and Project Aquarius, but maintained he had “noknowledge of any of those subjects.” He also denied showing Howe a “PresidentialBriefing Paper” or a “so-called Project Aquarius” document. Indeed, he claimedto Bryant, government investigation indicated that there was no project known asAquarius. dcxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1925190] The contradiction in accounts could not be more stark, but no one seems to havebelieved Doty. The amount of detail offered by Howe, and subsequentcorrespondence she published, was simply overwhelming. Doty clearly was lying.As the years went by, Doty told another version of this story. In a 2008correspondence with the author, he hinted that Howe was targeted because it wasbelieved she had cultivated inside government sources during the making of AStrange Harvest. This concerned the intelligence community, which wanted tolearn who these sources were. Ultimately, Doty said, none were found, at leastnone who had contributed to her documentary. While “the Linda Howe operation”was a failure, he added that many others relating to UFOs, still withheld fromthe public, were successful. Indeed, Doty claimed that there were otherintelligence operations on Howe going on at the time. HBO’s cancellation of herdocumentary was not a result of AFOSI’s actions, but of “other entities” withinthe U.S. government. dcxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1925430]Howe’s encounter with Doty was the first significant entry of MJ-12 into UFOresearch. True, Moore had already introduced it in 1981 by passing off analtered version of the Aquarius Document. This was far more substantial,however. Twenty months later, in December 1984, the situation became morecomplex still when the well-known MJ-12 documents were mailed to researchersJaime Shandera and (through him) Bill Moore. These were sent from Albuquerque,almost certainly from Doty or others he worked with. The two sets of documentshad certain similarities, as well as key differences. Most notably, the MJ-12documents made no mention of a UFO crash at Aztec, nor of live aliens. Indeed,they explicitly stated that the aliens recovered by U.S. personnel were alldead. Why was Linda Moulton Howe told of a UFO crash at Aztec and of live alienshaving been recovered, when the same source (Doty and AFOSI) propagateddifferent information via Moore?In his correspondence with the author, Doty said the papers he showed Howe(presumably the Presidential Briefing Papers) were a “scripted document.” Thismeant they were “part truth and part disinformation” with the intention ofconvincing her it was all legitimate. This is a classic disinformation ploy,particularly in conjunction with the “look but don’t touch” technique. It wasused by the British Army’s psy-ops unit in Belfast during the 1970s. Journalistswere taken into back rooms and showed “secret documents” – some were forgeries,but others were genuine – which they could read but not copy, then hopefullywrite about in their newspapers. The reason is that falsehoods, properlypackaged, can tarnish any truth. dcxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1925611] It seems reasonable to consider the documents shown to Linda Moulton Howe, aswell as the MJ-12 documents, to be some form of disinformation. But this is verydifferent from labeling them as hoaxes, which is a much more simplistic argumentand implies that they were complete fiction. After all, the “Aquarius” documentMoore gave to Bennewitz was also disinformation, but as far as anyone knows,only a small part of that document was altered. If the MJ-12 documents werecompletely fake, it would have meant that a section within Air ForceIntelligence (or the CIA) created a detailed ufological history from wholecloth. This seems unlikely. The true pattern of disinformation is to takesomething that is true and alter it, thereby more easily discrediting it.It is more logical that Howe (and Bennewitz) were targeted because they weredelving into exactly what they thought they were delving into: topics relatingto extraterrestrials that were of extreme importance to national security. Howeput it clearly enough: intelligence insiders were concerned that a credibletelevision producer was filming law enforcement officers and ranchers who spokeopenly about “silent, shape-shifting helicopters over pastures where mutilatedanimals were found.” dcxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1925874] That Doty’srole was to create confusion cannot be doubted. That it was solely to hidepurely terrestrial Air Force programs, as argued by some, is doubtful. dcxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1926054] As breathtaking as Doty’s information for Howe was, she did not discuss themeeting for several years. But she did suspect that something very important wasbehind Doty’s meetings with her, and that there was probably some truth in whathe told her. The problem was, as it remains to this day, in sorting out justwhat that truth is. Taking ET Into Custody?In the early 1980s, the Roswell event was still new to researchers, and therewere only the barest hints – to a few researchers like Stringfield – thatanything more spectacular had occurred. Yet vague rumors had existed for sometime of a landing at Holloman AFB by an extraterrestrial craft, and anotherrumor about a program to accommodate alien “guests” of the U.S. government. In2005, retired Air Force Captain Robert Collins wrote Exempt from Disclosure , aninsider’s account of the UFO cover-up, with extensive consultation from RichardDoty. The book was controversial for several reasons, not the least of which wasDoty’s obvious authorship of several substantial sections, although he quicklydisavowed the book. Of particular note are appendices containing photocopies ofthree alleged CIA and Majestic 12 documents. These concern aspects of Majestic’sattempts to manage the existence of an alien “guest,” known as EBE-2.This author spoke to a source with senior-level CIA experience, who offered hisjudgment that although he had no opinion about some of the other documentslisted in the book’s appendix, he believed these three were genuine. Obviously,leaked documents like these can almost never be definitely proven to beauthentic. Until the CIA comes forth to claim them, they will remain orphanswithout a home.The earliest of these documents was dated May 14, 1980. Its text reads:The Texas incident will present a problem for us. Must determine more info inorder to develop dis-info plan. Why do these things always happen when MJ12 isgone. Luck is never on our side. Let R-3 know something is up and that we willneed their support to get through this one. Don’t make anymore phone calls on KY[unclear: 3 or 8] until the new code is changed. Too many of the wrong peoplemight be listening. I don’t trust R-2A. Could be leak there. One more thing,EBE-2 has expressed a desire to visit ocean. I don’t know what the hell to do onthat one. If we don’t let him, he’ll just disappear. Can’t allow that to happenagain. MJ6 is working on that. TREAD open/or will be. MJ9. dcxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1926211] The second of the “EBE-2\" memos was dated June 24, 1982. Of the three, this onereceived the strongest endorsement from the author’s intelligence source asbeing “almost certainly authentic.” Its text reads:Yesterday R2 requested briefing on Project “A”. In particular, he wanted updatedinfo from EBE-2. MJ3 advised that that info was not available to R2. Apparently,White House requested info because of large volume of FOIA requests. Can’t seemto make those fools realize EBE-2 info is not available for any dissemination,per EO 01156, regardless of who requests info. Contact T-2R and see if he canassume custody of the matter. Don’t allow AF to evaluate IDENT info. They mayopen up a little too much. KEND-3 can assist to some extent. MJ5. dcxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1926482]Like the others, the document was stamped “Top Secret” and “Handle on StrictNeed-To-Know Basis.”The third alleged leaked memo is dated December 28, 1982. It reads:TR-3 related both phases of OP-KIWI compromised by leak. Terminate phase I andre-direct energy to dis-info. EBE-2 can’t be located at this time. R4 has placedhim in safehouse somewhere near Edwards. I don’t even know the exact location.No transfer will be approved until Phase I in DD23. CAP-3 not ready to receiveEBE-2. Don’t even know if they have facilities available for holding. CLASSYY-II only available at Kirtland or Los Alamos. Must make decision before Jan15. No other options open. NORAD not cooperating with MJ4 on D-SITE studies. Wemay have to contact KERW-302 personnel and have them conduct study. NORAD stilloperating on old system. The big problem is only a few of NORAD’s personnel areclear for SONG-DANCE info. PETE-23 open class II. REPEAT BLOCK NOT USED. DON’TNEGLECT MAKING CHANGES TO BOTH BLOCKS. CODES EXPIRE ON 31 DEC. MJ5. dcxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1926771]These documents have exactly the right tone, language, acronyms, abbreviations,and other details for what they purport to be. If they are forgeries, we canassume they came from someone (or some group) with a sophisticated background inU.S. intelligence. They have persuaded several people of distinguishedbackgrounds that they are legitimate. If true, they support the contention thatthere was indeed at least one alien “guest” of the U.S. government. Thedocuments seem to indicate that the UFO control group (MJ) possessed authorityabove and beyond that of NORAD and the President of the U.S. in matters relatedto the topic of extraterrestrials.Exempt from Disclosure also contained statements by Richard Doty concerning hisalleged viewing of alien bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1982. dcxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1927036] Morespectacularly, he claimed that on March 5, 1983, he was permitted to witness aninterview with EBE-2 in a highly secure facility at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory. After a table and recording equipment were set up, a short“non-human looking creature” entered the room, wearing a tight fittingcream-colored suit. The being sat in a chair across the table from two civiliansand an Air Force Colonel. According to Doty, EBE-2 said in perfect (albeitmachine-generated) English that its world orbited the star Zeta 1, was warm,dry, and had long periods of sunshine. The being gave great detail on weatherpatterns and climate. Its society was highly regulated, and each member had aspecific job. Doty said he did not actually hear any questions asked by thethree humans. Either the questions had already been given, or the humans werethinking the questions and EBE-2 was responding to them. The interview endedafter an hour, upon which EBE-2 left the room. dcxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1927223] Whether the above documents and stories are authentic, disinformation, oroutright lies will undoubtedly be a matter of debate until and unless relevantauthorities open the books and stand by them in a credible manner, or provideincontrovertible evidence to the contrary. The wait might be a long one. Ufology in RetreatAmid the developments at ufology’s leading edge, a more conservative elementremained influential, arguing that the claims of crash retrieval and abduction,while interesting and possibly fruitful, still lacked sufficient scientificevidence to be taken seriously. Hynek and Richard Hall were most prominent inthis regard. In Hall’s opinion, these were ufology’s “extremes,” not its norm.Yes, he acknowledged, they should be investigated, but the “core of the mystery”lay in the CE-II cases, that is, close encounters of UFOs by reliable witnesses.Like Hynek, he championed “scientific ufology.” dcxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1927537] Hynek, meanwhile, was going down a curious path. By the early 1980s, he was,like Vallee, becoming more skeptical of actual, physical extraterrestrials.Vallee had presented five arguments against the ETH; Hynek now offered seven.(1) Sophisticated surveillance systems failed to detect incoming or outgoingUFOs. (2) So-called extraterrestrials had no difficulty dealing with Earth’satmosphere or gravity. (3) Sheer statistics indicated a truly intense amount oftraffic, rather like launching an Apollo space probe every half hour. (4) UFOsand their alleged occupants behaved in an elusive and absurd manner. (5) Peopleoften reported an “Oz-like” experience near UFOs, in apparent space-timeisolation. (6) Most UFOs appeared to be “space unworthy,” with crampedconditions and no room for supplies and equipment that would presumably beneeded to last for years – although on this point he acknowledged thepossibility of mother ships. (7) Finally, the great astronomical distancesbetween the stars. “There is nothing in our present or foreseeable technology,”he stated, “that gives us any clue as to how these distances can be traversed inany reasonable time.”Hynek conceded that the UFO phenomenon was real. He just did not believe theywere the product of beings from outer space. Unfortunately, his points amountedto little more than objections against how UFOs defied common sense. Theypossessed no scientific rigor, some were frankly absurd. This was a sad state ofaffairs for a man considered the Dean of Ufology. Point #1, for instance, wasdownright silly, blithely ignoring the possibility of anything like a cover-up.One wonders what the actual objection to Point #2 even was, other than that thealiens would possess better technology than humans. And so on. None of Hynek’sobjections negated the possibility that UFOs were alien; in fact, most of themwould have been better used to argue why UFOs were in fact extraterrestrial. Allof them could have been explained by reference to advanced technology, thepsychological differences of a variety of intelligent species, or a combinationthereof. That UFOs defied common sense was nothing new. dcxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1927716]The most scientific work in ufology was regarding the Hessdalen phenomenon. Bymid-1983, members of UFO groups in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the “Society ofPsycho Bio Physics” formed Project Hessdalen under the direction of Leif Havik,Odd- Gunnar Roed, and Jan Fjellander. Through several universities, the groupwas able to obtain radar equipment, a seismograph, a fluxgate magnetometer, aspectrum analyzer, Geiger counters, infrared viewers, and various cameras. Thusarmed, they began sentry duty in the bleak Norwegian landscape. Whether from thelaughter of the gods or the whim of the UFO operators, the Hessdalen phenomenonnearly ceased for much of the year. Yet, the planning and persistence of theinvestigators would pay off by early winter. dcxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1927936]Still, Richard Hall felt that ufology was in a period of “retreat.” Fewwell-attested sightings, effective debunking, excessive pop-culture emphasis,and insufficient inroads into the wider public were the main factors he cited.That summer, Hall resigned as editor of the MUFON UFO Journal , and was replacedby Bob Pratt. Pratt had been the main UFO writer for the National Enquirer forsome time. As recently as June, the Enquirer had published an article on UFOsightings in 1980 in Peru and Kuwait, as well as the 1980 Kirtland-Manzanoreport. There is no question that Pratt had done legitimate journalism, alsonone that the Enquirer had key connections to the CIA. One of Hall’s complaintsabout ufology was the lack of attention it received in serious journals.Emphasis in tabloids like the Enquirer , no matter how accurate some of itspieces may have been, hurt the reputation of ufology. dcxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1928189] A glimmer of optimism remained. By the summer of 1983, there were rumorsabout a major new book soon to come out that would incorporate many of therecent FOIA reports, and was poised to serve as a kind of sledgehammer at thewall of secrecy. This was Clear Intent , co-authored by Barry Greenwood andLawrence Fawcett, and scheduled for release by Prentice-Hall for the spring of1984. Hynek had written the Foreword, and Walter Andrus predicted it would be“the vehicle that will force the Pentagon and our government intelligenceagencies to reveal why they have conducted a ‘cosmic watergate’ or cover-up withrespect to their involvement with UFOs.” dcxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1928400] At the same time, frustrations at the never-ending ufologicalwheel-spinning resulted in another attempt at creating organizational unity. Inthe summer of 1983, Richard Haines founded the North American UFO Federation,enlisting support from the major people in most of the UFO organizations – thenotable exception being APRO, which remained aloof. Haines hoped for acollaborative effort to resolve the UFO phenomenon, but lack of sufficientfunding doomed the effort to failure. dcxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1928584] Matters were difficult for American UFO researchers, but such was thecase everywhere. In France, GEPAN seemed to be little more than a publicrelations endeavor at this point, with no political incentive to promote actualinvestigations. Its chief noted that “we are collecting UFO reports, but wedon’t know what to do with them. Once a case has been investigated, we publish anote on it, and that is that. We have no scientific structure behind GEPAN.”Elsewhere, political repression was more straightforward: in the Soviet Union,for instance, postal interception of UFO-related publications was a regularoccurrence. dcxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1928792] Philip Klass: One Man Disinfo BandDuring the summer of 1983, skeptic and CSICOP member Philip Klass publishedUFOs: The Public Deceived. Not only did the book deny the reality of UFOs asextraterrestrial, but it ruled out UFOs as advanced military technology. Klassargued that there was no government cover-up on the matter. If UFOs wereextraterrestrial, he reasoned, there would be more CIA documents to examine. Allthe significant data was available, he said, and all actions taken by the CIAwere in good faith.Much was ignored in this study. The possibility that the topic might be handledin deeper secrecy if UFOs were extraterrestrial was one example. So was thedetermination of the CIA to conceal its control of the 1953 Robertson Panel – afact that was only learned through the determined effort of outside researchers.Classic UFO cases and events were typically misrepresented and distorted such asthe 1950 Montana movie film, the 1952 Tremonton film, and the 1973 Ohiohelicopter case. The last of these, for instance, was alleged by Klass to havebeen caused by a fireball, despite the detailed descriptions by multiplewitnesses, despite no fireballs having been reported that night, and despite thefact that the UFO had been visible for several minutes, ruling out a fireball.Klass’s argument was simply contrary to all reason. Regarding another dramaticcase, the Cash-Landrum incident of 1980, Klass implied that it was probably ahoax. Many UFO researchers were attacked by name: Allen Hynek, Bruce Maccabee,Richard Hall, and others.Serious UFO researchers saw the book as little more than a public relations ployor government propaganda. Klass, after all, was not just a “professional”skeptic, but a senior editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology , apublication with close ties to the U.S. intelligence community. However, thebook was well-written and – to those not well-versed in UFO research – had theability to persuade.Klass was busy all year debunking UFOs. As mentioned in the previous chapter, heworked hard, albeit in vain, to derail a UFO conference which was held at theUniversity of Nebraska on November 11 and 12, 1983. Klass was at it again onDecember 8, during a television appearance with Larry Bryant on Philadelphia’sKYW-TV. Constantly interrupting, correcting, and criticizing Bryant, he tried toturn the tables on UFO researchers, including himself as a UFO researcher,claiming that “we” were the ones involved in a cover-up – not the government.This ignored the 4,000 government documents that had so far been released underFOIA. dcxxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1928959] Encounters 1983While 1983 was most significant for UFOs in the Hudson Valley and intrigue fromthe world of intelligence, there were other events of interest in the U.S. andaround the world. A UFO encounter by the RAF and USAF appears to have takenplace on March 15 in Oxfordshire, Britain. An American air traffic controllertracked the object between 5 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Civilian witnesses saw it as aslow, brilliant white light. Inquiries with British authorities were met withsilence and obstruction. dcxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929144] Another air traffic incident occurred later that month in Gorky, USSR.On March 27, controllers that evening saw a grey cigar-shaped object flyingtoward them, and they tracked it on radar for 40 minutes. Attempts to establishradio contact failed. The object was the size of a conventional aircraft, buthad no wings, tail or fin. It moved at a normal speed and altitude but behavederratically, making many turns. It vanished about 25 miles north of the city,and was said to receive serious attention by the Soviet authorities. dcxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929304] There were other events and alleged events, most notably the landing orcrash of the so-called Ordzenikidze Object in the Soviet Union in early May,generally believed to be fake, but the origins of which remain unknown. Theobject was photographed as somewhat similar in structure to the lunar modules ofthe Apollo program; except that this was 250 feet high, more than half theheight of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Speculation centered on the object being aprop from an abortive Hollywood movie shot between 1985-1987 (apparently thephotos did not turn up until later). dcxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929461] The Hudson Valley provided the best confirmed UFO cases of the year,indeed of the early 1980s. Sightings continued frequently through the spring andsummer of 1983, the most intriguing of which took place near the town ofDanbury, Connecticut on the evening of July 12. At 9:30 p.m., a police officeranswered a call at a location southeast of Danbury, where he saw several peoplestanding outside looking at a circular pattern of lights in the sky. The lights,which flashed red, blue, and green, appeared to be attached to a silent object,as no stars could be seen inside the ring of lights. The most startling part ofit was that the object appeared to be less than 500 feet in altitude and theenormous size of 300 feet in diameter. The officer decided to shine a powerfulspotlight on the object. When he did so, the object projected a brilliant flashof white light downward, covering everyone there. It then moved quickly towardthe north and was lost behind trees. dcxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929645] The same type of object and behavior was seen just a few hours later, at10:55 p.m., by four people in a small fishing boat. Police Chief Nelson Macedo,his brother in law Charles Yacuzzi, Yacuzzi’s 15-year-old son Michael, andretired police officer Jim Lucksky were in the boat. As they talked, theynoticed a grey, circular object, fairly high in the sky. It was motionless,silent, and very large. They discerned twenty to thirty bright lights on it –blue, red, orange, and green – moving in a circular pattern. The men turned offtheir boat lights, and the object shut off its own lights. For several minutesall was quiet. Charles Yacuzzi then turned the boat lights on and off, whereuponthe object switched on very bright lights and moved behind the mountains.Michael, the teenager, was so frightened that he nearly jumped overboard.dcxxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929800] Thus, not all the Hudson Valley objects were of a definite boomerangpattern. As the flap continued, however, towns such as Brewster, Ossining,Croton Falls, Yorktown, Mahopac, Poughkeepsie, Hyde Park, Fishkill, Rhinebeck,and others reported triangular or boomerang formations of lights, typicallybrilliant white but also red and green. Bright spotlights emanating from a largeobject over the Hudson River were also reported that summer. dcxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1929951] Three hundred miles to the southwest, in western Pennsylvania,researcher Stan Gordon collected similar reports of low-hovering objects. One ofthese was a July 25 sighting from the town of Latrobe. A man named Tom Jacksonwas getting ready for work at 5:15 a.m. when he saw a bright light outside hisbathroom window. Upon opening the window, he saw a huge object hovering over agroup of pine trees about 250 yards away. The object was a metallic grey color,elongated in shape but with the front and back ends dropping down. The objectwas flat on top and bottom, with two rows of evenly spaced windows. Jacksondescribed the object as possibly 300 feet in length. The bright light wasattached to the front of the object, and could swivel. Jackson ran outside andobserved the object. It was completely motionless and silent. After five moreminutes, it began to move toward the town’s sewage plant. Gordon also receivedreports of other residents in the area reporting a brilliant orange light overthe sewage plant. Still other residents, unaware of these sightings, wereawakened by a loud, high-pitched sound so intense that it caused severalheadaches and disturbed neighborhood dogs. This was typical of the reportsGordon received throughout the year: large, extremely quiet objects thatmaneuvered at very low altitudes, often hanging motionless above the road. dcxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1930125] The Cold War EscalatesThe Cold War, already moving along with renewed impetus, received a high-octanejolt on August 31, 1983 from the infamous KAL 007 incident. A Korean airlinercarrying 269 persons, flying from New York to Seoul via Anchorage, was shot downby a Russian Su-15 fighter. It had strayed 365 miles off course and was insideSoviet airspace, well into a particularly sensitive security zone. The Sovietfighter pilot followed all the international protocols for warning a civilianairliner that it was off course. As a final warning, he fired multiple burstsfrom his cannon. The pilot had no tracers, so these shots could not have beenseen by the KAL 007 crew. Soviet military authorities were nonethelessastonished that none of their pilot’s actions elicited a response from theairliner. They concluded that it was a U.S. military reconnaissance plane on aspying mission, undoubtedly equipped with electronic espionage equipment. Theyordered the shoot-down as the airliner was leaving Soviet airspace. U.S.intelligence officers quickly produced edited tape extracts as evidence ofSoviet treachery. Reagan referred to the incident as the “Korean airlinemassacre,” a “crime against humanity [that] must never be forgotten” and an “actof barbarism … [and] inhuman brutality.” In fact, it is not farfetched toconsider the possibility that the U.S. did indeed equip the Korean airliner withinstrumentation to spy on the Soviet base, and had thus essentially used thecommercial aircraft as cover for a covert operation – and the civilianpassengers as hostages. dcxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1930427] The U.S. went on the offensive immediately, announcing the deployment ofthe formidable Pershing II missiles in Europe (which began in January 1984).Then, on October 25, 1983, America unleashed Operation Urgent Fury, better knownas the invasion of Grenada. It took a few hours for a 7,000 strong U.S. invasionforce to overcome a 600 man Grenadan army. Several factors were cited by theAmericans for the action: the illegal execution of Grenadan Prime MinisterMaurice Bishop and resultant political instability, the presence of Cubanadvisors on the island which (in Reagan’s words) had turned the BritishCommonwealth member into a “Soviet-Cuban colony,” the construction of a newairport that was going to be used for long-range Soviet supply aircraft, and thepresence of American medical students at St. George’s University on Grenada.There was in fact a small number of Cuban advisors on the island nation,although Cuba condemned the execution as much as anybody, and insisted that itwould not defend the nation from an American attack. The airport was being builtby a British company for tourism. Indeed, Grenada was a member of the BritishCommonwealth, and British Prime Minister Thatcher told Reagan she was “deeplydisturbed” by the U.S. invasion. But it was popular in America, and mostAmericans accepted Reagan’s line that Grenada was “being readied as a majormilitary bastion to export terror and undermine democracy.” More realistically,the invasion was a tune-up for the U.S. military, being its first major militaryaction in nearly a decade. According to an official history of the U.S. AirForce, “the greatest outcome of the operation ... was the realization that tenyears after Vietnam, command and control functions still had kinks that neededto be worked out.” dcxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1930687] A ten-day series of NATO exercises immediately followed on the invasion,designed to practice high-level command coordination during a nuclear attack.The Soviet leadership was concerned that this could in fact be a ruse for anactual nuclear strike by the U.S., and moved to high alert. Although the eventis generally forgotten, it was possibly the most dangerous nuclear threat sincethe 1962 Cuban missile crisis. When Reagan learned that the Soviets actuallythought he might initiate a nuclear strike, he was “seriously disturbed.” Thus,according to some historians, began a feeling in Reagan that a face to facemeeting with the Soviet leaders was necessary. dcxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1930974] Stealthy UFOsThrough the fall and winter, UFO activity was comparatively slow. Within theU.S., the best reports were confined to the northeast, primarily New York,Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Typically, they involved night-time,low-flying objects which came alarmingly close to motorists.Such was the case with an October 15 report from Altoona, Pennsylvania, when amotorist named Catherine Burk saw a large, bright, silvery disc pass over hercar shortly after 8:30 p.m. The force of the object somehow lifted the rightside of her car briefly off the road, caused her car lights to blink out, andthe engine to stall. She suffered hearing loss in her right ear, had severeheadaches, and also developed problems with her shoulder, chest, and spine. Theevent was investigated by the local police, which noted that she was “visiblyshaking.” Her case was reported in the MUFON UFO Journal and the local Altoonanewspaper. Burk, a sincere and religious person who did not believe in aliens,believed it was something the government built. “I always said the governmentwas trying out stuff. But I never want to see nothing like that again.”Unfortunately, there were no other witnesses to the event. dcxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1931148] Another close-range motor vehicle case was reported on October 26 inWest-Central North Carolina. At 9 p.m., David Keener reported to the CatawbaCounty Sheriff’s Department that he saw a diamond shaped UFO above his car onHighway 321, northeast of the town of Hickory. The object was bright green inthe back and red in the front; it hovered and then moved to a higher elevation.He watched the object for about five minutes. It was silent throughout hisencounter. dcxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1931321]Another interesting Hudson Valley case occurred in New York’s Putnam County onOctober 28, involving a biomedical engineer named Jim Cooke. At 2:15 a.m., whiledriving by the Croton Falls Reservoir on his way home to Mahopac, Cooke saw whatlooked like aircraft lights approaching and dropping very fast. Then, oddly,they seemed to hover for a while – then go out. Cooke got out of his car, walkedtoward the shore line, and saw an object hovering less than 15 feet above thewater. It was extremely non-reflective, but he could make out a triangularshape. Cooke had done airplane repair work while in the military, but he hadnever seen anything like this. It was only 200 feet away from him, yet he heardno sound. After a few minutes, nine red lights came on from its sides. Then, ared beam of light from the underside appeared to probe the water. The objectmoved to four locations over the reservoir, each time shining the red light onthe water, all the while remaining steady at 15 feet above. Each time a cardrove by, its lights went out. Cooke estimated the object was at least 100 feetlong at the base and 30 feet at the apex. After it finished whatever it wasdoing, it “just lifted and silently drifted upward the way it came. It went upat about a 30 degree angle until it was lost in the sky.” Cooke’s totalobservation time was 10 to 15 minutes. Thus it would appear that whatever wasoperating the Hudson Valley UFOs was interested in quietly searching bodies ofwater, of which that area has an abundance. dcxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1931500]One of the last interesting American UFO sightings of 1983 took place inWinston-Salem, North Carolina, on November 28. It was another night-timesighting. At 8:40 p.m., a woman noticed a ball of light approaching. It wasunusual enough that she entered her house to get her boyfriend and two children.The four people watched the light approach to within 400 feet, where it hoveredat treetop level. It appeared to be about half the size of a house. Threesmaller objects came from behind the object and traveled southeast; they seemedto land in a swampy area near a manufacturing facility. While the woman and herchildren ran through a field toward the large object, her boyfriend jumped intohis car to pursue it. At one point he saw the object hovering near a small lakeless than 200 feet away from him. Within seconds, however, the object vanished,like turning off a light. In the aftermath of the event, all four witnessesexperienced eye irritation, and the man said his face and hands turned red andfelt sore. dcxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1931654] From elsewhere in the world came scattered reports. One from the SovietUnion emerged from Colonel Boris Sokolov, in a statement he made to American UFOresearchers ten years later. The event, he said, took place on October 5, 1983at an ICBM base in Ukraine. Sokolov said he received an order to leaveimmediately for the base since, as reported by the base commander to the Chiefof the General Staff, a UFO had been observed near the base from 4 p.m. until 8p.m. During that time, the launch codes for the ICBMs had mysteriously beenenabled. “They received an order to prepare the launch of the ICBMs,” saidSokolov. dcxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1931835] In late October, a craft of some sort reportedly hovered for twentyminutes over the town of Hollesley, not far from the Rendlesham Forest in GreatBritain. The size of craft was not indicated, but it projected three powerfulwhite lights down to the ground. Witness Ron Macro said the lights formed atriangular shape and remained perfectly still. The object then flew over Macroand other witnesses. There was at least one report of car trouble related to thesighting, and local residents demanded a meeting with RAF Woodbridge. CaptainKathleen McCollom, the base public information officer, would only comment“nothing was seen on radar. I cannot say more than that.” dcl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932015] Finally, the Chinese Air Force had an interesting UFO encounter onNovember 2. A bomber aircraft reportedly encountered an unknown object at about40,000 feet. The aircraft immediately lost its guidance systems and the planebegan to shake violently from side to side and lose speed. With greatdifficulty, the crew members landed the plane. Upon landing, they learned that aportion of the tail was missing. This encounter was reported on the radio inBeijing and Shanghai and relayed by Paul Dong. dcli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932213]Whereas the Soviet and Chinese stories cannot be easily confirmed, and theBritish case was reported in Britain’s oldest tabloid, they were allinvestigated by responsible researchers and appear to have occurred. TheAmerican cases seem to be quite reliable, competently scrutinized, several ofwhich involved multiple witnesses. Two Important Stories BreakUFO activity in 1983, even the dramatic Hudson Valley cases, received littlemore than local publicity. None of the cases reached the general public. Towardthe end of the year, however, two important UFO stories broke. The first was onthe December 1980 Rendlesham Forest case by News of the World on October 2,1983. Other publications, even more sensationalist, picked it up, getting manyof the basic facts wrong. Some researchers wondered whether this was anintelligence operation, a kind of damage or spin control, since the story was inthe process of breaking throughout 1983. dclii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932386] The London Times quickly debunked it, but neglected to interview any ofthe witnesses or investigators that originally broke the case. Instead, TheTimes interviewed a young government worker in the forestry office who suggestedthat the marks on the ground were scratchings made by rabbits. This was obviousnonsense but, supported by The Times, the notion became widespread. Wheninvestigator Jenny Randles spoke to this “expert,” he told her that his theory“just seemed like a good idea at the time.” dcliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932614] At the BBC, there were those who were genuinely interested in the case.Randles knew one producer who wanted to make a serious documentary, somethingeven-handed and not stridently debunking. He tried repeatedly to persuade hissupervisors to let him do so, but was refused each time. Instead, skeptic IanRidpath was asked to produce an exposé. According to Randles, Ridpath did notconsult with anyone who had previously investigated the case. Instead, he took acrew to the forest and filmed the lighthouse, which he made look strange byusing a zoom lens and some creative editing. Ridpath stated that there had beena meteor on December 26, 1980 which probably sparked the UFO sighting itself.The conclusion, as aired on BBC: “another UFO case bites the dust.” Other majormedia outlets also debunked the case, even though the British MoD stillconsidered it unexplained. Randles herself was refused several times bymainstream publications to present a counter-argument. dcliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932802] The other important breakthrough was not reported in the news, but soon madethe rounds of UFO researchers and interested parties. This was a two-paged,single spaced, typed letter from retired scientist Dr. Robert Sarbacher toresearcher William Steinman concerning UFO crash retrievals. Sarbacher had beenan important physicist, missile expert, and consultant to the DefenseDepartment’s Research and Development Board, and Steinman was following a lead.As mentioned previously, it had previously been known that the late Canadiangovernment official, Wilbert Smith, had met with unnamed American officials in1950 to discuss the matter of flying saucers. From that meeting, he wrote a memoto the Canadian government stating that, based on the information he obtained inthat meeting, that flying saucers did exist, and were “the most highlyclassified subject in the U.S. government, ranking even higher than the H-bomb.”But it was not known with whom Smith had met until Canadian researcher ArthurBray discovered in Smith’s papers that Sarbacher was at least one of Smith’scontacts. What made all this especially interesting was that Sarbacher was stillalive. Although Bray did not try to contact him, Stanton Friedman was able tophone him and then visit him. Sarbacher immediately admitted the truth of theSmith connection to Friedman, who then passed the information on to WilliamMoore. Moore, in turn, told William Steinman, who then wrote to Sarbacher.Sarbacher replied on November 23, 1983. He confirmed he was “invited toparticipate in several discussions associated with the reported recoveries” ofUFOs, although he was unable to attend the meetings. Some famous individualswere “definitely involved” in the program, such as Vannevar Bush, John vonNeuman, and probably Robert Oppenheimer. American laboratories analyzed thematerial that came from UFO crashes, and the hardware was “extremely light andvery tough.” Sarbacher described the beings that controlled the UFOs: “Iremember in talking with some of the people at the office that I got theimpression these ‘aliens’ were constructed like certain insects we have onEarth.” dclv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1932989] Friedman asked Sarbacher whether he could recall anyone who attended themeetings at Wright-Patterson AFB. Sarbacher could not, but gave enough cluesthat when Steinman reviewed the conversation in 1987, he believed all cluespointed to Dr. Eric A. Walker, who had been the Executive Secretary of theResearch and Development Board. As we shall see, Sarbacher’s and Walker’stestimonies would strongly confirm each other, and the existence of MJ-12. dclvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1933177] Thesestatements would also be confirmed independently by Canadian researchers GrantCameron and T. Scott Crain. dclvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1933324] SummaryThe UFO phenomenon went through changes during the early 1980s. The quantity ofsightings appeared to dip, although strangeness remained high enough. A trulyspectacular photograph was taken in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1981.Triangular and boomerang craft were being seen more frequently, particularly inthe lower Hudson Valley. Commercial and military aircraft continued to haveclose calls in the air with UFOs, a concern that unsurprisingly received nopublic attention. And very soon, the strange phenomenon in Hessdalen wouldbecome utterly mystifying.Ufology moved ahead slowly but surely. With the publication of Missing Time byBudd Hopkins, abductions became a key topic of discussion, and was nowfrequently paired with Linda Moulton Howe’s research on animal mutilations atconferences, adding a darker and more ominous tone to the UFO phenomenon thanhad existed previously. In addition, analysis of the conspiratorial aspects ofthe phenomenon received a boost with the 1983 letter by Robert Sarbacher. Yetthere were definite setbacks. The court battles to release contested UFOdocuments from government agencies did not go well. To some seasoned observers,ufology appeared to be in a state of retreat, with a drop in sightings, no signof imminent government ‘disclosure,’ little to no interest from science andacademia, and a public connection with such tabloids as the National Enquirer .There seemed to be a definite interest shown in the field of UFO research by theintelligence community. Bill Moore was getting his hands dirty through anassociation with Air Force Intelligence. Paul Bennewitz – convinced that he wasseeing UFOs over an Air Force base and obtaining alien signals – was certainlygetting attention from the same groups.The encounter by Linda Moulton Howe with AFOSI Special Agent Richard Dotyunderscored interest from the spook world. By Doty’s own admission in lateryears, several agencies monitored Howe, attempted to learn her sources, andsucceeded in preventing her from producing a UFO documentary for Home BoxOffice. The documents Doty showed Howe (but did not permit her to copy) wereclearly related to the infamous MJ-12 documents released 20 months later. Yetthey were different enough to make one wonder what was going on. Whether she wasshown some version of something genuine, or an earlier version of what becamethe MJ-12 documents, they seem to have been used for purposes of disinformationthat specifically targeted the UFO field. Considering the areas that Howe,Bennewitz, and others were looking into at the time, it makes the most sensethat this disinformation targeted the UFO field, and was not simply designed toprotect conventional technologies from the Soviets.A number of the difficulties encountered by UFO researchers can be traced topolicies of the Reagan administration. The Executive Order of April 1982relating to FOIA requests stands out as an obvious example, and theintransigence of the federal agencies during the legal battles is closelyrelated to this. More generally, what was happening was a substantial assertionof federal power, much of which was of dubious constitutionality or even clearlyillegal (as in the shenanigans relating to the theft of PROMIS software). TheBig Brother State expanded during these years, as America began to reassert hermilitary establishment through massive spending increases, military tuneups suchas the invasion of Grenada, and the introduction of a space-based weaponsplatform.Indeed, conventional historians have failed to grasp the full significance ofSDI. Fixated on the Cold War, they have ignored the evidence relating to U.S.military interest in UFOs that might have affected the decision to implement theprogram. One need not refer to the strong personal interest that PresidentReagan had in UFOs, nor even the fact that he was a witness to one. Rather, theinexplicable encounters with UFOs in Earth orbit by U.S. and Soviet astronauts,as well as the confirmed tracking of UFOs by Defense Support Program (DSP)satellites, supply reason enough that “Star Wars” could well have had anET-component. Something was going on in space, and only the grossest negligencewould permit America’s national security apparatus to ignore it. At the sametime, only the most reckless indiscretion would allow anyone to talk about it. Chapter 6 Calm Before the Storm1984-1986 We had it on camera for 15 minutes.... Whatever it was, it was larger than aC-5A, which is the largest aircraft in the world.... This was much larger. Itseemed very brazen. It acted like it didn’t care who saw it.― Security Officer at Indian Point Nuclear Facility, New York, 1984. We have things out there that are literally out of this world. . . . Better thanStar Trek.― Groom Lake non-commissioned officer, 1985. This was no ordinary UFO. Scores of people saw it. It was no illusion, nodeception, no imagination.― Air Marshall of Zimbabwe, Azim Daudpota, 1985 At least 20 unidentified objects were observed by several aircrews and on radar.― U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency memo, on UFO sightings in Brazil, 1986 State of Ufology: 1984UFO sightings continued in the Hudson Valley during 1984, and indeed activityseems to have picked up elsewhere. Still, many researchers thought they were insomething of a lull. dclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1933612] Partly, thiswas because many of sightings were beyond the reach of American researchers, inplaces such as the Soviet Union. Even the Hudson Valley sightings needed timebefore their full impact was recognized.Ufologists at this time were doing some good work, but there was also concernover the state of their research. John Schuessler mentioned several obviousproblems: the lack of solid data available to researchers or the public, trashynews coverage, and personal attacks by zealous skeptics that could intimidatewitnesses and researchers alike. Each of the major organizations had decliningmemberships. CUFOS was elitist, out of touch, and needed a management overhaul.At APRO, the Lorenzens were in poor health, notoriously uncooperative with otherorganizations, and not cultivating new leadership. MUFON, too, while fairlygrassroots and diverse, nevertheless suffered from an authoritarian structure,although Schuessler did not get into specifics. dclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1933778] Allen Hynek, meanwhile, was frustrated by timid mainstream scientistswho felt UFOs were too strange to study, leaving the field to amateurs. dclx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1934002] This was abigger problem than the alleged cover-up, which he called overblown. In Hynek’sopinion, the military attitude toward UFOs was best characterized by apathy,although he acknowledged a kind of “cover-up of ignorance.” In other words, themilitary was embarrassed to admit that it could not control certain objectswithin U.S. airspace. Of course, this important point supported the contentionthat there was a cover-up. Hynek amplified this by conceding that he had seendeliberate attempts by the military to withhold good UFO reports from the mediaand invent false explanations for difficult cases. dclxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1934215] Hynek’s attitude, while frustrating to experienced researchers, meantthat he could more easily speak to the mainstream and his fellow scientists.During the spring of 1984, he presented 400 UFO cases at the annual meeting ofthe American Association for the Advancement of Science. He told theoverwhelmingly skeptical audience that responsible witnesses around the worldhad seen UFOs, “some of whom were independent of each other but observed thesame event (and sometimes in daylight) which defied both common sense and commonphysical sense.” Because such sightings appeared to be outside the currentscientific paradigm, most scientists simply dismissed the phenomenon. Hynekcautioned that “in the light of the history of science, this may not be anentirely wise step.” Perhaps these remarks resonated privately with somescientists; publically, nothing changed. dclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1934415] Simply put, scientists were not researching UFO-related topics. Asalways, the best work was being done by private individuals. Such was the caseregarding abduction research, in which the Fund for UFO Research providedfinancial support to Ted Bloecher, Budd Hopkins, and Dr. Aphrodite Clamar. Thethree conducted an experiment to have an accredited psychologist administerstandard tests (Rorschach, TAT, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, MinnesotaMultiphasic Tests) to people with alleged alien abduction experiences. The twistwas that the psychologist had no knowledge of this fact, and was told only thatthe persons were being tested for emotional and psychic stability. The importantconclusion of the study was that all persons tested out as normal, meaning thatpeople who claimed to have had alien abduction experiences were notpsychologically aberrant. dclxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1934755]The most important contribution to ufology in 1984 was the publication of ClearIntent by Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett. This was the first collection ofFOIA-released government documents relating to UFOs. Most of these documents hadbeen known to researchers, but none had been published in a book. The mostdramatic documents dealt with the airspace violations of 1975 over Loring,Wurtsmith, and Malstrom air force bases. The reproduction of so many confirmeddocuments seemed to make it undeniable, even to the staunchest skeptic, thatsomething serious and unexplained was going on. dclxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1934962] Skeptics did criticize the book, however. One argued that the authorswere guilty of “the craft fallacy” – automatically assuming that lights in thesky were solid objects, and ignoring recent studies suggesting such lights oftenformed along areas of geologic stress. This was not a reasonable criticism. Inthe first place, the documents themselves frequently described the phenomenon as“objects” or “craft,” often unambiguously so. Moreover, none of the 1975 casesoccurred over geological fault lines. dclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1935341] More on targetwere criticisms about the book’s haphazard organization and occasional lack ofin-depth commentary. dclxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1935525] Such quibblesaside, Clear Intent was something of a culmination of the recent FOIA bounty.Moreover, while few researchers were foolhardy enough to expect governmentdisclosure about UFOs, the book did revive hopes that, perhaps with enough soliddocumentation soberly presented to an impartial public, the tide might turnagainst the secret keepers.Interest in Clear Intent was strong, and publisher Prentice-Hall received anunprecedented number of inquiries for it. Even so, the publishers cut back onthe book’s original publicity schedule and severely underprinted it. The bookimmediately sold out and was unavailable all summer. A second printing in lateAugust also sold out immediately. Presumably, the stop-and-start printingschedule did not help sales, but a harder blow was the establishment newsmedia’s refusal to review it. dclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1935728] MUFON and the National EnquirerClear Intent prompted fresh thinking at MUFON. In the first place, Andrus andother MUFON leaders decided to “de-Klassify” the MUFON UFO Journal – that is,remove the skeptics. dclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1936033] They alsoreconsidered MUFON’s relationship to the National Enquirer . For years, it hadbeen obvious that the Enquirer was a poor choice for getting the word out.Indeed, it seems astonishing that an organization seeking to promote “scientificufology” had wished to cultivate such a relationship. But MUFON’s leadership –most prominently Andrus himself – had been seduced by the tabloid’s circulationin the hopes that memberships, and thereby revenues, would increase. It is alsotrue that amid the tabloid’s weekly serving of trash were some legitimate UFOpieces, mostly written by Bob Pratt. Indeed, Pratt within his own person linkedthe tabloid and researchers: in 1984, he was editor of the MUFON UFO Journal.All of this might seem innocuous, until one considers the history of theEnquirer ’s publisher, Generoso (Gene) Pope. Pope came from a Mafia backgroundand had been a CIA intelligence officer during the 1950s; the Enquirer itselfappears to have started with CIA slush money. Ever after, Pope remained tied tothe national security world. A friend once asked him how he knew so manytop-level American political figures. Pope answered enigmatically, “one handwashes the other.” Former Nixon Defense Secretary Melvin Laird even gave theeulogy at Pope’s funeral in 1988. dclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1936437] Seen in this light, the Enquirer looks like a publication designed,among other things, to manage the UFO phenomenon within popular culture alongthe lines recommended in the 1953 Robertson Panel. Since it was impossible toblock completely the flow of UFO reports, the Enquirer would disable those thatslipped through. Consider: (1) the U.S. military and intelligence establishmentwere publicly hostile to the idea of UFOs; (2) Pope was their loyal friend; (3)his laughingstock tabloid regularly reported on UFOs, sometimes accurately,sometimes deceptively. (If all UFO stories in the Enquirer were true, somebodymight catch on; hence the sporadic false stories). Good UFO reports making itinto the Enquirer – such as the 1975 airspace violations – died a quick death.Mainstream journalists, academicians, and scientists never followed up.So what was going on with MUFON and the Enquirer ? Were the players wittingagents of the intelligence community, or just being manipulated? By allappearances, Bob Pratt was serious and legitimate. Unfortunately, MUFON’sconnection to the world of intelligence has never been fully explored. Thisauthor has spoken to several prominent MUFON members and officers who expressedsuspicions that intelligence operatives existed high within the structure of theorganization. No one was willing to go on record, however.It has to be considered, at the least, that MUFON’s relationship to theintelligence community was similar to that described by Francis Stonor Saundersin her work The Cultural Cold War . Saunders studied CIA penetration ofostensibly independent cultural organizations during the 1960s, most notably theCongress for Cultural Freedom. Such organizations ran the gamut from liberal toconservative, and their loyal members had no idea that CIA operatives wereworking behind-the-scenes. Short of a high-level confession or smoking gunevidence in the form of government documentation, there is no firm proof thatMUFON, CUFOS, or other UFO organizations were infiltrated. Nevertheless, thecollected pieces of evidence add up to a reasonable case that the intelligencecommunity penetrated and manipulated America’s major UFO organizations at thistime.Governmental PoliciesSeveral governments took actions regarding UFO reports in 1984. Each year theBritish Ministry of Defence received hundreds of UFO reports from the public,police, airport authorities, and military. On March 4, 1984, for the first timeever, the MoD released some of these cases to the public. Sixteen reports,albeit mostly blacked out and missing key data, were sent to the British UFOResearch Association (BUFORA). The MoD’s public position was that UFOs as suchwere of no concern to them, except for those with possible defense implications.When asked about possible landing cases, such as the 1980 Rendlesham incident,Defense Under Secretary for Procurement John Lee replied that these were notseparately identified from other reports. In any event, he said, “none of thesereports was of any defense significance,” and therefore no records were kept.Thus began the British MoD tradition, to which it has steadfastly adhered overthe years, of pretending to provide good-faith disclosures of its UFO data.dclxx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1936647] Two months later, the Australian Ministry of Defense echoed the Britishposition. Stating that since nearly all of the UFO reports filed by the publicwere of no defense significance, and only three or four percent wereunexplained, they would henceforth only investigate “unusual aerial sightingswhich suggest a defense or national security implication.” Of course, presentingmisleading information about UFOs is an old game, and Australian researcher BillChalker used the RAAF’s own statistics proving that the true figure ofunexplained sightings was closer to eight percent. Writing for CUFOS’s IUR , hesuggested it was “unwise – or at least premature” for Australia’s military todismiss UFO sightings as having no national security significance nor anyscientific relevance.” This criticism certainly was valid, but also naive – muchlike CUFOS in general – in assuming that the Australian military was notactively dealing with UFOs on a more covert level. dclxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1936979] The United States also took UFO-related measures in 1984 when it beganprocedures to seize 89,000 acres of public land surrounding the Groom LakeFacility (Area 51), in Nevada. The land was finally taken in 1988, although theAir Force overlooked 3,900 acres which continued to afford a good view ofactivities going on there. Glen Campbell, a private citizen who investigatedhappenings at the Groom Lake Facility during the 1980s and 1990s, would soon dubthis area “Freedom Ridge.” dclxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1937218] In the Soviet Union, the government took a different approach tomanaging its UFO problem. For years the Soviet Academy of Sciences haddiscouraged reports from the general population. Now, the government encouragedthem by creating “anomalous phenomena commissions.” These were said to beindependent groups that would take UFO reports from the citizens withoutridicule, but were in fact a cover to assist the Soviet government to collectUFO data. dclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1937374] A possiblereason for this new policy, as we shall see, was the occurrence of severaldisturbing Soviet military UFO encounters that year.Late in the year, the British Ministry of Defense was reorganized, making thegroup Sec (AS) 2a as its main focal point for receiving public UFO reports. Itsmission was “to determine whether or not UFOs present a threat to the securityand defence of the United Kingdom.” This appeared to be very much along thelines of the U.S. Air Force’s old Project Blue Book, right down to the fact thatthe group’s actual investigatory role was minor. It had no specific UFO budgetother than minor staff costs, and (according to Nick Pope), its records were“unclassified in nature.” On the other hand, Timothy Good uncovered evidence toshow that Britain’s Provost and Security Services (P&SS) at RAF Rudloe Manorwere conducting more serious and secret investigations of UFO activity. Finally,in 1995, an MoD letter to a UFO researcher confirmed that “in the past, RudloeManor was indeed the RAF co-ordination point for reports of “unexplained” aerialsightings,” a fact that had been denied by the MoD for years. dclxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1937554] HessdalenIn the realm of conventional history, 1984 is a year memorable for many reasons:the landslide re-election of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, the boycott by theSoviet Union of the 1984 Olympics, the year of the first Apple Macintosh, thegreat famine of Ethiopia, the entry of crack cocaine into the U.S., and, perhapsmost of all, for its service as the title of George Orwell’s classic dystopiannovel. And yet, there is something else that occurred during that year,something of equal significance: the occurrence of UFO sighting waves over twodistinct regions in the world. First, the area in Norway around the remotevillage of Hessdalen, where a most unusual phenomena was being recorded bydedicated observers. Second – for a much longer and more intense period – thearea north of New York City known as the Hudson Valley, where, week after week,distinctive and unusual craft were being seen by hundreds of amazed residents.Rounding out this were sightings and encounters elsewhere in the world that madethe year surprisingly significant in terms of UFO activity.From January 21 through February 26, 1984, the area around the small town ofHessdalen in central Norway was a perfect scene of UFO activity. Night afternight, bizarre light phenomena were observed and recorded by a team armed withcameras, radar, Geiger counter, seismograph, and infra-red viewers. During thatmonth, members recorded 188 specific observations. Of these, 53 were ofsufficient quality (level of detail, witness caliber, and strangeness) to beconsidered valid “Hessdalen Phenomena.” dclxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1937724] But whilesomething was obviously going on in the remote valley, whatever it was remainedelusive.Typical reports were of strangely maneuvering lights that had no reasonableexplanation. On January 27, 1984, for instance, an elongated light was observedat 5:32 p.m. It was red and white in color, and blinked unevenly while travelingnorth, eventually disappearing over the horizon. The team tracked it on radarbut failed to photograph it. The following afternoon, the team picked up afast-moving, strong radar signal to the west. It divided into two parts and wentin different directions. The team shot fourteen frames of film in the directionof the echo, but nothing showed up.The phenomenon was fascinating, tantalizing, frustrating. On January 29th, theteam again tracked something on radar, close to their position and moving north.They saw nothing. The same thing happened on the 31st, and again on February 1.The latter date marked the second time within a few days that an event wasrecorded at 3:49 p.m. There were also several sightings at 2:05 p.m. Leif Havik,one of the project leaders, speculated that such exact replication “would seemto be beyond a natural phenomenon, or would it be?” dclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1937980] On the night of February 2 the team had a “first class” observation.Unfortunately, it was the only evening during the month that they were notmonitoring the radar. One of the members was on the phone when a neighbor bargedin at 8 p.m. and announced “it’s coming.” Havik ran outside with a camera and400mm telephoto lens. He saw a bright, oblong yellow light with red in thefront, traveling north in a wavelike motion. Nine people from three locationssaw it. The photographs came out poorly, indicating just how hard it can be tophotograph UFO phenomenon, even in an active hotspot with dedicated people.Eventually, the perseverance paid off. On February 18, team member Roar Wistersaw a light in the east-northeast direction, moving eastward for two minutes,constantly changing intensity from weak to strong. He took several photographs,five of which captured the light very well. He did even better three days later,at 7:23 p.m., capturing an oscillating light moving across the sky. dclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1938159] This would not be the last time the phenomenon would be photographed.Indeed, researchers have continued studying it to the present day, amassing animpressive collection of video and photographic evidence, as well as dataderived from instrumentation. Over time, they have categorized the phenomenoninto three general types: (1) a white (or blue-white) flashing light, normallyhigh in the air and lasting a short while; (2) a yellow light, with a red lighton the top, sometimes flashing; (3) most commonly, a slow-moving, roundishyellow or white light able to maneuver, stop for an hour or more, and continuemaneuvering. dclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1938346] After manydecades, there is still no single theory that has covered the full spectrum ofthe observed phenomenon. The provisional conclusion from the 1984 study stillholds today: “We have not found out what this phenomenon is. That could hardlybe expected either. But we know that the phenomenon, whatever it is, can bemeasured.” Interestingly, the team was able to obtain measurements with radar,lasers, and cameras, but not with seismographs, Geiger counters, or infra-redviewers. This would suggest that an actual object has been observed, but thatgeological activity or radioactivity were not involved. The objects haveappeared at times not merely to be intelligent, but mischievous. “Many timesduring the project period,” noted the project’s final report for 1984, “thecameras failed. This happened mostly when we needed them most.”The Hessdalen phenomenon is particularly odd considering the remoteness of thelocation, the difficulty of the terrain, the lack of anything of obvioussignificance there. One would think this is some sort of natural phenomenon,except for times when the lights seemed intelligently controlled – orintelligent. Could it be a natural phenomenon? Is there a connection to amilitary program? An alien intelligence? Now observed for decades, the Hessdalenphenomenon continues to elude identification. Moreover, as baffling as thelights are, and despite the attention they have deserved from the media andscholarly community, the phenomenon has received next to none. Triangles and Balls of LightAlthough, as we shall see, triangular and boomerang-shaped objects continued todominate New York’s lower Hudson Valley in 1984, similar objects were beingreported elsewhere in the U.S. The area northwest of Detroit, Michigan, was sucha scene of activity on February 22 and 23. For two nights near the town ofFlushing, objects with triangular lighting patterns shone beams of light to theground. The lights approached the car of one witness who said they were part ofa cigar-shaped craft 100 feet off the ground. A jogger reported a light fromabove so intense that it hurt his eyes. Another person said a craft withtriangular shaped lighting hovered less than 200 feet above the ground,illuminating the area behind her house and panicking her outdoor cats. Two morecraft passed over her house. She called the police, although the officer couldhardly explain the event. MUFON investigator Shirley Coyne learned of twelvepeople who saw the lights during these two nights, but only three would give hera report. Most avoided getting involved, and only spoke to her because she knewthem. dclxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1938540] Western Pennsylvania had similar sightings, mostly recorded andinvestigated by Stan Gordon. One took place near Mechanicsburg on February 29. Awoman observed a dark, diamond-shaped object approaching at no more than 50 feetoff the ground. White lights were at the front and back, blinking red lightswere at the sides, and smaller lights were between each of the four points. Shedescribed it as being “as long as a tractor trailer and wide as two tractortrailers.” Wobbling slightly, it passed over trees and disappeared to thesoutheast. dclxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1938732]More boomerangs were reported in the southeastern Georgia town of Claxton onMarch 21 by a mother and daughter who were driving south along Perry Road. Themother held an executive position with a prominent firm, and approached themedia only on condition of anonymity. At around 8 p.m., they noticed an unusuallight through the trees off the road. As they topped a hill, they slowed the carto a near stop when they noticed three boomerang-shaped objects hovering above afield: a large one and two smaller ones. Each object had two large lights in thecenter as well as a row of small, multi-colored lights that blinked in rapidsequence. Initially curious at seeing such a spectacle, the two soon becameterrified once one of the objects began to move. The mother, physically shaking,drove while her daughter cautioned her not to crash. The large object flew overtheir car in perfect silence. As it did so, the two witnesses looked directly atits underside – it was of dark metal and the mother estimated its wing span tobe at least 40 feet. “It just floated over the car,” she said. “There was nosound at all. I didn’t notice any heat.” The witnesses never saw the other twoobjects approach them, and the mother kept driving. While she believed that sheand her daughter saw something “from another world,” she added, “if the UnitedStates has something like that, and that’s what we saw, then I’m proud for ourcountry because we’re so far ahead of everyone else, we don’t have anything toworry about.” dclxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1938927]In California, too, triangles were reported. Near Napa on April 25, three peopledriving at night on the American Canyon Road saw a huge triangular object “atleast the size of a football field,” hovering a mere 100 feet off the road. Theypassed beneath it, and the object soon moved out of sight. dclxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1939150] As Hessdalen showed clearly enough, not all UFOs are objects. A certainnumber of them are strange, seemingly intelligent, light phenomena. Two suchcases were reported near the Pacific coast early in 1984. In late February at3:30 a.m., a driver in Everett, Washington, saw a silvery green, egg-shapedobject moving toward his car from a wooded area. It was between a softball andsoccer ball in size, and within a few seconds it bounced from one side of theroad to the other, passing over his car’s front fender. A nearly identical eventwas reported the following month from Santa Monica, California. On March 25 at8:55 p.m., a driver reported that a bright red ball of light, about 10 inches indiameter, maneuvered around her car with a bouncing motion. It approached towithin a foot of her car, lighting up the hood and windows. Her sighting lastedfor nearly a minute. dclxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1939335] The Barbados IncidentThere is at least one UFO sighting from the spring of 1984 of undeniable defensesignificance, as it was described as “a serious defense and security alert” inan Incident Report from the U.S. Embassy in Barbados. dclxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1939519] At 2:10 a.m.on April 12, air traffic control radar at Grantley Adams International Airporttracked a large number of UFOs. These were 30 miles southeast of the island infour “loose but distinct formations,” approaching at around 100 mph. Localauthorities immediately notified Prime Minister Tom Adams, as well as theBarbados Defense Force (BDF) and the police commissioner. Within minutes, theentire BDF, in full battle uniform and with loaded weapons, was placed on RedAlert. Adams, a political friend of Ronald Reagan and key ally during theGrenada invasion, roused the U.S. Embassy to get answers. By 2:20 a.m., theformation was 14 miles off the coast. Two of the targets then veered off to theisland’s west side, two others moved toward the east, while the remaindercontinued moving north. By 3 a.m., the U.S. Defense Attaché arrived at the BDFsituation room, where he was briefed and remained for three hours. Police weredeployed to the beaches to guard against a seaborne landing. The Barbadosgovernment asked Martinique if they had an exercise in progress; the answer was“no.” At 3:30 a.m. the BDF launched a patrol boat and scrambled a Cessna –neither party found anything. Airport radar was still tracking nine objects at 4a.m., which by then were over the northern part of the island. Since Barbados isscarcely more than 20 miles long, they must have slowed down considerably orelse loitered about. By 4:10 a.m., the objects disappeared to the west towardMartinique.Atmospheric conditions and technical malfunction were both considered. Accordingto the U.S. State Department document, there appeared to be a “weatherinversion” over Barbados early that morning. Adams, however, did not accept thisas the cause of the incident, nor did the BDF Chief of Staff. The Soviets, onnaval exercises in the Caribbean, were of special concern to the Barbadians. Theonly problem was that they were more than 1,500 miles away, near the YucatanPeninsula. Nor does the U.S. military appear to have been responsible, as theU.S. Embassy informed Adams after checking with Washington.This is all that is known of the incident. Weather remains a possible cause. Andwhile the Soviet explanation seems unlikely, that cannot be ruled out either, asthe region had a history of silent Cold War confrontation (including an incidentnear Barbados from 1977, mentioned in the document). What cannot be denied isthat the invasion of national airspace is always a serious matter for defenseforces. The Barbados incident is known to us because a single document wasobtained through FOIA; the event described within it, as well as its serioustone, is consistent with many other such documents. These reports are notobtained in any kind of comprehensive, systematic manner, but only through theperseverance and luck of dedicated citizens. The number of similar incidentsthat have escaped the scrutiny of researchers will always remain an interestingmatter for speculation. Giant UFOs Over the Hudson ValleyLike the valley near Norway’s Hessadalen, New York’s Hudson Valley was the sceneof unexplained lights and objects traversing the skies, low to the ground,silent, unlike anything people had seen before. Yet this was a place asdifferent from Hessdalen as can be imagined: a densely populated region justnorth of New York City.1983 had been the Hudson Valley’s “breakout year,” but 1984 had more ofeverything. After a winter lull, sightings picked up in the spring. A March 11incident in Wolcott, Connecticut, just after midnight, involved a mother and herdaughter seeing a large cylindrical object through the window of their home,just a few feet away. For seven long minutes, it hovered low over the ground.Then it moved away, never once making a sound. dclxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1939926] On March 21 at8 p.m., a trucker driving south on NYS Route 87 saw a massive boomerang-shapedobject with red, white, and green lights along the side. The object wasincredibly low in the air: the driver estimated it to be about 100 feet off theground. As a result, he could see the enormous, dark structure that unified thelights. He said it was “at least the size of a 747” and made no sound, evenafter he rolled down his truck window. He assumed it was an experimentalvehicle. Then it vanished. dclxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940108] New York State’s Taconic Parkway meanders along on a picturesque north-southcourse, roughly 15 miles from the Connecticut border. On the night of March 25,1984, near the town of Peekskill, hundreds of people saw low-flying lights overthis road. Drivers stopped their cars, stepped outside, and watched inamazement. Descriptions were consistent: a slow-moving, boomerang-shaped objectwith six intensely bright lights and a green light in the center. The lightsmoved like one object, even when making a sharp turn. Many people had to shieldtheir eyes, but at least one witness, a professional photographer, discerned adark structure connecting the lights. He estimated it to be at least 300 feetlong and flying at 30 mph. It moved over the water when, “all of a sudden, thelights were out and the thing was gone.” He videotaped the event, but his tapecame back blank.Local police were overwhelmed with phone calls that night, although researchers,receiving only stonewalling, were for a long time unaware of this fact.Eventually, they learned that the official policy in most towns was todiscourage police from talking about the sightings. Some were dismissive or eveninsulting to witnesses that night. In Danbury, Connecticut, one officer told aresident that “it can’t be UFOs because they don’t exist.” Another advised acaller to “sleep it off and the pink UFO will go away.” Presumably statementslike these were in the days before the adoption of “community policing”principles. dclxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940266] The incident of March 25 repeated itself six days later, on the 31st.Once again, motorists on the Taconic Parkway saw V-shaped lights moving slowlyoverhead, sometimes stopping and hovering. Hundreds of people got out of theircars. Most astonished witnesses could hear no sound except for a very quiet hum.dclxxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940425] April was quiet – until the night of the 25th, when the Taconic Parkwaywas again visited by a huge, hovering object. It had brilliant white lights in ahalf circle, along with smaller red lights, and some witnesses discerned afootball-field-sized dark structure, silent and motionless. Drivers swerved intheir vehicles as they saw this object. One witness phoned the New York StatePolice, which informed her she “probably saw those hang gliders from StormvilleAirport.” dclxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940585] Events likethis continued all through the spring and summer, overshadowing all other UFOactivity anywhere else in the world. Local researchers such as Philip Imbrognoand Peter Gersten interviewed witness after witness, collecting more than 90reports of a large V-shaped formation in just one month, from late May throughJune 1984. dcxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940745]Considering all that was happening, the paucity of news coverage was striking.Local newspapers continued to cover the sightings, but the wire services andmajor media stayed away. The official word was simply that there was nophenomenon happening, other than some stunt flyers playing pranks. Thediscrepancy between witnesses and authorities was vast even when the witnesseswere authorities. On June 11, a New Castle police lieutenant named Petersoncalled the Westchester Airport about an object he and others had seen. Hisconcern was simple. “If this thing can come in here and do whatever it wants,”he said, “I want to know where the hell are our government’s defenses.” Theairport representative told him what he saw was probably airplanes in formation.When Peterson adamantly disagreed, the representative replied, “just tell thepeople they saw planes.... It’s planes, at least that’s what I was told.”Researchers contacted the FAA the next day, and were told the conversation hadnever taken place. dcxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1940961] Matters became more serious when a triangular object entered thepremises of the Indian Point Nuclear Facility, in Westchester County, on June14, 1984. This turned out to be the first of two air space violations over thefacility that summer. At 10:15 p.m., several plant employees saw an immense(“football-field sized”) boomerang-shaped object enter their airspace. It hadintensely bright lights along its sides and moved very smoothly, despite thehigh winds that evening – certainly no weather for ultra-light flyers. Fortwenty minutes, the object alternately hovered and moved, finally departingslowly. It did not bank when it turned, but moved as if on a horizontal plane.Witnesses were adamant that there was a dark mass visible behind the lights.dcxcii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1941116] Eitherthis or a similar object was seen elsewhere that night, even videotaped,although the video showed only lights. One witness insisted that the center ofthe object was hollow. dcxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1941274] And so it continued. A large V-shaped object was seen flying low overHyde Park on June 21. dcxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1941431] The samenight, 50 miles to the south, unidentified lights were seen over the WanaqueReservoir in New Jersey. Four anonymous calls were made to the local policebetween 9:44 p.m. and 12:17 a.m. about “lights” over the reservoir. Police sawnothing, but local press interviewed a witness who claimed to have seen anegg-shaped object “moving too fast for a blimp.” dcxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1941607] On the 22nd, athree-minute video of a close light formation was recorded and brought to ascientifically trained, experienced pilot. His only certain conclusion was thatthese were not conventional aircraft (if indeed the lights were separateobjects) and that private pilots were not at the controls. He doubted that evenspecial military aircraft would use such a dangerous formation. Investigatorscontacted FAA to learn whether anyone had clearance for formation flying in thearea. The answer was negative. (The FAA spokesperson added “it is the policy ofthe FAA that UFOs do not exist, so we do not collect any reports of such.”)dcxcvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1941812] On June24, witnesses observed a “big, giant thing in the shape of a V,” flying over theroad. dcxcvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942019]On the 25th, near Bethel, Connecticut, a slow moving, huge object with manylights was seen for twenty minutes. While people saw normal aircraft elsewherein the sky, this object looked like an enormous Ferris Wheel on its side.dcxcviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942173] A major event took place July 12, about 20 miles east of the Taconic Parkway,just over the Connecticut border. Police in the towns of Danbury, Ridgefield,Bethel, New Fairfield, and New Milford received report after report of a lowflying, slow moving object “as large as a football field.” Its lights wereincredibly bright, and intense beams of light were directed to the ground. Italso gave off heat to those beneath it. Yet, its light pattern was not aboomerang, but circular. Many formerly skeptical members of the Danbury policesaw the object. After this, they were believers.Local publicity for this event was strong, and newspapers listed the telephonenumbers of some of the local UFO investigators. They were immediately floodedwith calls, and investigators later estimated that 5,000 witnesses saw theobject that night. A police officer from Bethel told them that not only had manyofficers seen the object that night, but they had been asked by the FAA tostonewall both press and investigators. If pressed, they were to explain thelights as caused by stunt fliers, primarily to prevent panic. dcxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942328]More sightings occurred in the coming weeks, but the major event of the summeroccurred on July 24. This time, video was recorded in Brewster that was goodenough for professional analysis. The same night, the Indian Point NuclearFacility was once again the scene of an overflight by an enormous object.The video was recorded by Bob Pozzuoli, a New York City electronics executive.At 10 p.m., he videotaped a large object with a string of six bright lightsaround it. He briefly lost it to view behind a pine tree; it emerged with astring of rotating multicolored lights in the shape of a disc, and a flashingred light at the rear. It then vanished behind some houses. Pozzuoli’s videoalso captured airplanes flying overhead in formation, very useful for analysis.The impressive video was studied by many groups, including ABC television andthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. All agreed it wasauthentic, and none could explain the object. dcc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942684] Just a few miles away was the Indian Point Nuclear Facility, in Peekskill. Itwas there that the most extraordinary UFO event of the year occurred – indeed,an argument can be made that it was the most extraordinary event anywhere onEarth during 1984.On the night of July 24, 1984, at least a dozen plant workers and securityguards at the facility watched a boomerang pattern of lights approach. Seen frombelow, the object resembled an ice cream cone – triangular but with a curvedstring of lights in the back. They could plainly see that these were notdisconnected lights, but a solid body of enormous size, “about the size of threefootball fields,” as one guard later put it. Despite winds that gusted at 30mph, the huge object moved with cool purpose toward Reactor #3, the soleoperational reactor at the plant. The guards stood, awestruck, as the objecthovered directly above it. “That’s what got our supervisor worried,” one of themsaid. “This thing got to within thirty feet of the reactor.”Even more extraordinary, as the object approached the reactor, the plant’ssecurity and communications systems were rendered inactive. The computercontrolling them simply shut down.It need hardly be mentioned that this was a serious matter. No aircraft of anykind was allowed to fly over the reactors without proper clearance. Videocameras at the facility filmed the object, and the officer in charge of filminglater spoke to researchers. The object, he said, had eight bright lights in awide V-formation. “It was one solid structure and very large. We had it oncamera for 15 minutes.... Whatever it was, it was larger than a C-5A, which isthe largest aircraft in the world.... This was much larger. It seemed verybrazen. It acted like it didn’t care who saw it.”The shift commander contacted nearby Camp Smith, a New York National Guard base,requesting identification of the object. As the base had no answer to give him,he asked for an armed helicopter to shoot it down. He then ordered his men toprepare to fire on the object. “We had shotguns and were waiting for the finalword to fire on it,” said one guard – an incredible statement that was confirmedby other personnel.All seemed ready for a hopeless armed confrontation. But before the command wasgiven to launch the helicopter, the object glided away. The next day, thecommander of the security guards informed his staff that “nothing happened.”They were told to forget the event.Researchers had already known that Peekskill police had received many phonecalls that night from area residents describing the same object. The encounterat Indian Point, however, was not known by them until early September. At thattime, a plant employee contacted Philip Imbrogno and wanted to tell the story.Somehow, clearance was initially granted for a few researchers to meet witnessesand visit the reactor on September 5. Then, without any reason given, the visitwas cancelled and the employees forbidden to talk. At this point, an angryImbrogno threatened to go public. That was when management relented. The guardswere once again allowed to meet with the researchers, but not at the facility,and only with a security supervisor present. Two meetings subsequently tookplace.In the days after the July 24 incident, officials of the U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission visited the plant, and, according to Imbrogno, the entire securitysystem underwent a shakeup. One journalist received an acknowledgment from theplant that sightings had occurred, and that New York State police had arrestedfour Cessna pilots in connection with it! This was simply too absurd, and theUFO researchers checked state police records which showed that no pilots hadbeen arrested. Plant authorities had simply lied. FOIA requests were filed withNew York Power Authority, U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. NuclearRegulatory Commission. Each of these agencies replied that they knew nothingabout an incident from July 24. Authorities also denied the existence of anyvideo tape that may have recorded the incident. Researchers attempted to obtaincopies of radio communications that night, but none reportedly existed. Imbrognosummed up the matter well: such obstruction was tantamount to proof that UFOreports, when they involve national security, were exempt from FOIA. dcci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942839] Years later, Imbrogno privately added a few important – and astonishing– details regarding Indian Point. He indicated that he had sworn testimony fromseveral plant security personnel that in fact there had been a crack in the wallof Reactor #3, and that they had not only seen an enormous UFO hovering above,but some had seen non-humans walking through the containment wall of thereactor. Apparently, the beings had saved the plant from a nuclear disaster.dccii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1942995] The Hudson Valley UFO ConferenceAfter the July 24 sightings, researchers began receiving phone calls from a manwho said he was a specialist in satellite intelligence for the National SecurityAgency. Despite this weighty connection, he claimed to be contacting Imbrognofor personal, not professional, reasons. He wanted to know about Imbrogno’sresearch, was very interested in learning Allen Hynek’s opinion on the matter,and especially wanted to see a copy of the Pozzuoli video tape. As they spoke,Imbrogno noticed a clicking sound every fifteen seconds or so. The two agreed tomeet when the caller was in the area. Somehow, Imbrogno checked into this man’sbackground and learned that he actually was an agent for the NSA. dcciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1943367] All through August, this man phoned Imbrogno and other researchers. He oftengave the impression that he was monitoring their other phone calls, as he wouldsometimes refer indirectly to other conversations they had. In one instance, amere five minutes after one of them had ended a telephone call with Hynek, theNSA caller phoned. Had they learned anything new from Hynek, he asked? Anotherodd development was that the FAA began making counter-statements on newsightings before the researchers had even publicized them. This caused Imbrogno,Gersten, and their colleagues to suspect a direct link between their NSAconnection and the FAA. They borrowed equipment to detect telephone taps, andthe result was a probable yes, although proving an NSA tap was no enviable task.The investigators met their mysterious NSA man in mid-August. He read theirreports and transcripts with interest. They discussed whether or not the CIA wasflying special aircraft in the area in order to confuse the issue. Theresearchers had a good source that the CIA was using nearby Stewart Airport forsome type of operation, and another source who had seen small planes taking offin formation from the airport at night. The NSA man acknowledged thatcounterintelligence was a CIA specialty, and that such an operation was withinits capability. The most unsettling moment of the meeting was when he asked forthe Pozzuoli tape. With no guarantee of full exchange of information, with notrust, this would have amounted to a blank check. The researchers said no. Hereplied, “you know, Phil, the government has done away with people for a lotless.” dcciv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1943525] Imbrogno and Gersten had meanwhile been organizing a conference, whichthey planned for August 25. Gersten did an excellent job at promotion andorganization. When it convened at a middle school in Brewster, 1,500 peopleshowed up – triple the seating capacity. Allen Hynek was there, as were severalmajor media organizations, the mysterious contact from the NSA, various peoplefrom the FBI, and senior officers from Pease AFB. For twelve hours, attendeeslistened to presentations, discussed the lack of government action, and mainly(since most were actual UFO witnesses) shared stories. An incredible 900 peoplefilled out UFO sighting reports. The impressive Pozzuoli tape was shown; ABCtechnicians who analyzed it could only say that the lights were not airplanes.dccv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1943682] The media coverage was mostly skeptical. First local newspapers, thenthe New York Times , for instance, emphasized a police sergeant’s claims thatthe affair was caused by a group of close formation aircraft with blackundersides and bright lights that could change color. The reporter did notchallenge this bizarre claim, nor did he ask the reasonable question of why hadauthorities not identified or apprehended the perpetrators of such illegalactivities? Journalist Terry Hansen argued that the New York Times covered theevent only because it had to – the sightings were in its own backyard, as itwere, and were now receiving significant coverage elsewhere. What distinguishedthe Times coverage, wrote Hansen, was “a noteworthy lack of commitment andcuriosity.” Such an attitude was entirely consistent with that newspaper’shistory of UFO coverage. dccvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1943939]While sightings of the “Hudson Valley Object” continued through August andbeyond, people also saw more and more obvious formations of low-flying lightaircraft and helicopters. Many of these occurred in Brewster and Putnam Laketownships, over land that researchers learned was owned by the NSA. Imbrogno andother researchers concluded that the U.S. government owned and operated theplanes, either to confuse the UFO issue, or else to conduct its own surveillanceover the area. In fact, a local television news story quoted an FAA spokespersonwho said the government was carrying out surveillance, although the FAA soondenied this. dccvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1944294] Within a few months the Hudson Valley mystery had exploded onto theworld. There is ample evidence showing covert interest by the U.S. intelligencecommunity, an overwhelming desire by authorities to keep this matter fromgetting out of hand, and cooperation with authorities from the major media. Thephenomenon had also unsettled UFO researchers. What was happening there had noprecedent. For decades, UFOs had come in a few basic shapes, mostlydisc-variants, although some triangular shapes were reported in earlier years.dccviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1944452] Therehad been low-flying UFOs in the past, there had been large UFOs, and there hadbeen quite a few reports from densely populated areas. There had also been a fewextended sighting waves from specific geographic regions. But there had neverbeen anything in ufology that combined all of these features, and certainly nospecific wave that had lasted this long. Plus, the boomerang-shape appeared tobe something completely new.Something new was happening here. The newness raises a simple question: why?Was this a demonstration of a new but still secret terrestrial technology? Ifso, it might not necessarily mean a breakthrough in physics. One hypothesis isthat the Hudson Valley Object was a type of lighter-than-air technology (LTA) –in other words, some form of rigid dirigible. The LTA hypothesis has been usedto explain the sightings of large triangular craft (“Big Black Deltas”) duringthe 1990s, although it is not universally accepted. One anonymous author of a2002 paper submitted to the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS)theorized that LTA vehicles powered by “electrokinetic” drive have been operatedby the U.S. military since the early to mid-1980s. dccix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1944912] Anelectrokinetic LTA craft would not need propellers or jets, but instead woulduse aerostatic lift gas. Since its energy could be fed remotely by a groundbased power system using microwaves, it would not need a power supply. Accordingto the paper, the maximum transmission distance would be about 62 miles. Thecraft would have an outstanding thrust to mass ratio, enabling it to acceleratevery quickly, including up. One problem is that such a beamed microwave systemwould require a line of sight that is dangerous to anything that gets in itspath, such as birds. There are no known reports of dead birds accompanyingsightings of the Hudson Valley boomerang, or for that matter of later sightingsof BBDs. Another difficulty of linking the LTA hypothesis with the Hudson Valleysightings is the very shape of the object in question: whereas LTA vehiclesappear designed solely for a blimp or delta shape, none are known to be designedfor a boomerang-shape. This is not to say such a design is impossible: it may bethat a terrestrial design team succeeded beyond their wildest dreams in creatinga boomerang-shaped LTA for covert testing or missions over the Hudson Valley inthe early 1980s. If so, or if this is some other terrestrial breakthrough, it isa breakthrough that has remained secret for 25 years as of this writing.But perhaps other possibilities exist. If the Hudson Valley object was a “trueUFO,” it was still different enough from previous UFOs to give pause. It couldindicate that the “others” operating UFOs were using different technologies andtactics to interact with the people on Earth. Of course, the object could alsohave signified the presence of a different group altogether. The presence ofhelicopters in the area during the fall of 1984 might indicate that a covertgroup was looking into that possibility. Dangerous Soviet UFOsFrom what we can tell of Soviet UFO history, 1984 was an interesting year. Thereappears to have been a UFO crash in the mountains of Azerbaijan on July 20,although next to nothing is known about the details. dccx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1945204] A case withmore information, albeit no date, is said to have occurred near Astrakhan, onthe northern shore of the Caspian Sea. An anti-aircraft unit was alerted to aspherical object flying along the coast at about 6,000 feet. Requests foridentification were ignored. Two fighters were scrambled and tried to shoot itdown, but the object descended close to the ground, preventing the fighters fromfiring any further. Photographs apparently were taken. When, near Krasnovodsk, ahelicopter attempted to shoot it down, the object climbed above it and hovered.After the helicopter landed, the UFO disappeared over the sea. dccxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1945384]The most dramatic Soviet UFO encounter of 1984 took place during the earlymorning hours of September 7. A Tu-134A passenger plane was flying north to theEstonian city of Tallinn. While near Minsk at 4:10 a.m., the pilots saw whatlooked like a large, bright, elongated star, directing a thin ray of lighttoward the ground. Before long, the ray opened up to become a cone of light.Another cone quickly followed, then a third. The pilots decided that the lightsource was 80 miles away, and the co-pilot drew a sketch of what he saw. Thelight turned a blinding ray directly at them. It then appeared to explode, beingreplaced by a greenish cloud. Next, it displayed maneuverability far beyondanything in the known inventory of the world’s air forces: this “object”approached them rapidly, stopped dead, descended, ascended vertically, thenmoved left and right. Finally, it stopped in front of the Tu-134A, apparentlypacing them close to their position. The crew now saw multicolored lights withinthe green cloud which flared and died away. The cloud changed shape, developed atail which then ascended, leaving the cloud in a rectangular shape. Co-pilotLazurin shouted that the object was teasing them. It certainly seemed to bedoing just that.A second Tu-134 was 60 miles away and was ordered to approach their position.Although the giant cloud should have been easily visible from such a distance,the commander of the other plane saw nothing – until at eight miles distant hesaw the UFO in great detail. Such a development might suggest the object had anability to cloak itself for all but very close distances. It then turned aroundand directed a light at the new aircraft, then downward to trace out arectangular shape. The UFO made zigzag movements and illuminated the rectanglebelow. Then it descended and stayed below the aircraft. Ground control informedthe second Tu-134A that Soviet cosmonauts had seen the object from their orbitalstation. At 5 a.m., the crew saw running multicolored lights along the object’sside. It is not clear how the object departed, but the encounter had tragicresults. Within a year, the captain of the second Tu-134A, a V. Goridze, haddied of electromagnetic radiation; the pilot had developed heart disease andlost his job; and a stewardess developed a complex skin disease. All had beenhit by the object’s ray during the encounter. The Tallinn crew suffered onecasualty, a steward, who developed similar ailments.There were many ground witnesses to this UFO. One of these, retired Colonel A.Kovalchuk, described it as a cigar shaped object about 330 feet long surroundedby a greenish halo. He described two powerful lights on it, and a bluish lightthat came straight to the ground. He said the object at times moved as slowly as40 miles per hour. He was aware of no Soviet aircraft like it.Russian ufologists could not agree on what this object was. They establishedthat a rocket was launched from the Cosmodrome at Plesetsk, many hundreds ofmiles to the northeast, and that this is what caused the greenish cloud andother light effects. Other details of the case pose greater problems. Onespeculation is that this was a military experiment involving the creation of anartificial cloud for some purpose. Another is that this was a genuine UFOcoincident with the rocket launch. As in so many of these baffling reports, theorigin and control of the UFO is itself secondary to the reality of its veryexistence. The encounter was so dramatic, seen by so many people, that evenSoviet censorship was not able to stop it, and it appeared in Tass in January1985. dccxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1945738] One more Soviet sighting of note for 1984 was a landing case in theeastern Urals, northwest of Chelyabinsk, in late September or early October. Alocal militia captain and patrolman were driving at 9 p.m. when they noticedodd-colored lights to their right, about 25 meters away in a field. They saw alarge triangle outlined by multi-colored, sequentially flashing lights, eitherresting on the ground or perhaps just above it. The captain later sketched theobject with 11 lights on the left and right sides, and another 13 going up thecenter. The men stopped their car and stared. At some point, the object simplybecame dark and impossible to see. The next day, the captain returned to thearea and found three round depressions in the soil about 10 inches deep and 36inches in diameter. They were at the corners of an equilateral triangle withsides of about 25 feet. dccxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1945990] Meanwhile, the limited Western coverage of the Soviet scene was markedby glib explanations that Soviet UFO reports were government disinformation tocover up serious experiments and activities, even illegal strategic weapontesting. NASA employee James Oberg in particular argued that some sightings wereexperiments of the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS), which theSoviets had secretly built in violation of the 1963 Outer Space Treaty. Thistreaty forbade the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. 17[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1768711] Because thelaunches of rockets and the fiery returns to earth of dummy warheads could notbe concealed, the government decided to present them as a UFO mystery, arguedOberg. dccxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1946196]Undoubtedly there were tests of Cosmos satellites, or perhaps of laser beamweapons as some speculated, that were mistaken by Soviet citizens for UFOs. Thewestern media grabbed hold of this idea – that “flying saucers became part ofthe KGB’s arsenal of deception.” It was a thesis not only with some logic, butit was easy to grasp. In reality, the UFOs always managed to leach out beyondsuch tidy explanations. dccxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1946411] Media Damage ControlThe Hudson Valley sightings continued through the remainder of the year.Finally, on October 5, two of the investigators, Phil Imbrogno and Fred Dennis,saw the object while driving. It had a large array of six lights that seemed tobe connected by a structure. They watched it flip over on its side and rotatelike a Ferris Wheel. They tried to follow it, but lost it after they turned acorner. It had vanished. dccxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1946626] In the November issue of Discover magazine came a dismissive article byGlenn Garelik on the sightings, attributing them to private aircraft secretlyflying in formation. Repeating the August absurdities of the New York Times ,Garelik suggested these amazing aircraft could fly as close as six inches fromeach other and turn off their navigation lights while in flight. No evidence wasoffered, no identification of the offending pilots, no aircraft descriptions.Two debunking sidebars accompanied the article, one claiming that UFOs existedonly to fill a psychological need, the other informing the public that UFOs hadbeen investigated by the Condon committee and shown to be without substance.To a casual reader, the article seemed like a disinterested analysis, butseveral interesting features hinted otherwise. First, the non-existent logic, tosay nothing of science, evident in the article itself. Second, the long historyof Discover ’s parent company, Time, Inc., as a CIA-friendly publication. Third,Garelik’s own background in Soviet studies, his fluency in Russian, and hisexpertise on the Soviet space program. He completed assignments in the SovietUnion for Discover, and wrote about the post-Soviet KGB for the New York Times.This was an American journalist with obvious connections to the world of powerand the intelligence community. Was his purpose purely detached, or was heserving a deeper agenda? dccxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1946780] If this was an instance of collaboration between American media andgovernment, it would simply fit the longstanding pattern of American mediacompliance with the interests of national security. For example, in December1984, the launch of a U.S. military satellite was voluntarily censored by theAssociated Press after Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger asked them not toreport it; NBC followed suit. During this time, also, AP choked stories aboutcocaine trafficking by the infamous Nicaraguan Contras, and New York Timescorrespondent Raymond Bonner was pulled from Central America for investigatingthe El Salvadorian death squads. dccxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1947342] Towards a New EraThree events, none of which were major news at the time, ended the year. Each ofthem signified a major break with the past. Each pointed the way toward thefuture.In December 1984, Bob Gribble, who operated the National UFO Reporting Center inSeattle, discontinued sending UFO reports to MUFON. He now began sending them toa computer network called Compufon, administered by Michael Hart. The World WideWeb would not be in place for another ten years, but the beginnings of theInternet were there, mainly through the bulletin board system known as Usenet.Gribble’s UFO telephone hotline number had extensive coverage throughout theUnited States, particularly with police agencies and airports. Moving to theInternet, undeveloped though it was, was a signal of things to come. dccxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1947503] On the grand stage of geopolitics, too, the world was about to change. InDecember 1984, Mikhail Gorbachev, not yet Secretary General of the SovietCommunist Party, visited British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She was dulyimpressed. “I like Mr. Gorbachev,” she said. “We can do business together.” Thatmonth, Gorbachev took his stand firmly with the forces of reform within hiscountry, delivering a major speech introducing two new concepts to the Party:glasnost and perestroika. Openness and restructuring.Finally, a matter that would forever change ufology. On December 11, 1984, amanila envelope arrived at the home of television producer Jaime Shandera inBurbank, California. Shandera was a close research partner of William Moore. Theenvelope, which had no return address, had an Albuquerque postmark and was datedDecember 8. Two more envelopes were inside, then a roll of undeveloped 35 mmfilm.When developed and printed, there were seven pages included. The first was acover sheet stamped “Top Secret/Majic Eyes Only” entitled “Briefing Document:Operation Majestic 12 Prepared for President-Elect Dwight Eisenhower: (EyesOnly).” It was dated November 18, 1952, although the date format was shown as 18November, 1952 (a format style that would later become a major issue ofcontention among researchers).The second page gave a brief description of “Operation Majestic-12.” AdmiralRoscoe H. Hillenkoetter (designated as MJ-1), was listed as the briefingofficer. Majestic 12 was described as a “Top Secret Research andDevelopment/Intelligence operation responsible directly and only to thePresident of the United States,” and “was established by special classifiedexecutive order of President Truman on 24 September, 1947, upon recommendationby Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary James Forrestal.” The page then listed the 12original members. In the order and manner of listing, they were: Adm. Roscoe H.Hillenkoetter, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Secy. James V. Forrestal, Gen. Nathan F.Twining, Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Dr. Detlev Bronk, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker, Mr.Sidney W. Souers, Mr. Gordon Gray, Dr. Donald Menzel, Gen. Robert M. Montague,and Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner. A note at the bottom of the page stated that uponForrestal’s death in 1949, his spot remained vacant until filled by Gen. WalterB. Smith the following year.Pages three, four, and five provided a nine-paragraph summary of theextraterrestrial presence. They mentioned how the Kenneth Arnold sighting ofJune 1947 had kicked off the wave of flying saucer sightings, then how “a localrancher reported that one had crashed in a remote region of New Mexico,” 75miles northwest of Roswell Army Air Base. The document stated that secretrecovery operations were begun on July 7, 1947 and that “aerial reconnaissancediscovered that four small, human-like beings had apparently ejected from thecraft at some point before it exploded.” All were dead and badly decomposed.Strange writing was found in the wreckage, and could not be deciphered. Nor hadthe ship’s method of propulsion been identified. Bodies and wreckage were allcarefully removed and sent to various locations. Study of the bodies, led by Dr.Detlev Bronk, indicated that they were not human, although they had many humanfeatures. They were designated as “Extra-terrestrial Biological Entities,” orEBEs. While some speculated that these beings possibly came from another planetin the solar system, others such as Dr. Menzel believed they were from anothersolar system.The document also mentioned a second UFO crash which occurred on December 6,1950 in the El Indio-Guerrero area of the Texas-Mexican border. This object wasnearly completely incinerated, but was transported to the Atomic EnergyCommission’s facility in Sandia, New Mexico.The origin and intentions of these visitors remained unknown, according to thedocument, and concern was high throughout 1952 that “new developments” might beimminent. The need to avoid public panic was paramount, as was the necessity tounderstand this exotic technology. The Majestic-12 Group had decided unanimouslythat the strictest security precautions be continued into the next (Eisenhower)Presidential administration.Page six of the document listed eight additional attachments (various StatusReports and Analytical Reports) which were not included. Page seven was amemorandum dated September 24, 1947 and signed by President Harry Truman.Addressed to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, it authorized him “to proceedwith all due speed and caution upon your undertaking. Hereafter this mattershall be referred to only as Operation Majestic Twelve.”In summary, these were the MJ-12 documents. Upon initial review, they certainlylooked as though they might be legitimate. Moore and Shandera were now facedwith a daunting task: to determine whether or not they were. One thing thatstruck them both immediately had to do with the list of MJ-12 members, whichcontained one shocker: Dr. Donald Menzel. Before Philip Klass, Menzel had beenthe world’s most prominent UFO debunker. His inclusion in the list appeared tobe a joke.In general, the MJ-12 documents were similar to the documents that AFOSI AgentRichard Doty had shown Linda Moulton Howe in the spring of 1983. However, therewere also discrepancies, the most significant being that while the MJ-12documents stated that two UFOs had crashed, one near Roswell in 1947 and theother at the Mexican border in 1950, there was no mention of numerous othercrashes which were discussed in the papers Howe had seen, including one said tohave occurred at Aztec, New Mexico.Who sent the undeveloped film to Shandera? Although the envelope had no returnaddress, it had been postmarked from Albuquerque, which is of course whereRichard Doty worked. Doty was also handling Moore throughout the 1980s. It seemsobvious that Doty was the source, although decades later, he continued to denythat this was so. The only question is, how authentic were any of the documentshe was connected with? Were the documents that Doty showed Howe in 1983 alltrue, partially true, or not true at all? If partially true, which parts? Thesame questions apply to the Eisenhower Briefing Document, and would later applyas well to the many “Majestic” documents leaked during the 1990s, which did notappear to have any connection with Doty at all.In the ensuing years, every UFO researcher developed an opinion. A distinctmajority came down on the side of hoax or disinformation, a persistent minorityargued that the documents were valid. Extensive document analysis revealed onething beyond question. The documents, if hoaxes, were not cheap or simple. Thatgoes not only for the original documents leaked in 1984, but many others leakedduring the 1990s. Indeed, when stacked, the documents are more than an inchthick, of great variety and sophistication, covering a broad range of technicaldisciplines, historical data, writing styles, perspectives, and jargon. Theamount of planning and coordination going into the making of them would havebeen substantial – well beyond the capability of any one person. In other words,if hoaxes or disinformation, the documents would most likely be the result of anintelligence operation. But if this is so, would not such an operation addcredibility to the reality of UFOs? Why go through the difficulty of creating somany sophisticated fake documents if UFOs were silly nonsense? The most likelydisinformation scenario would be that there is indeed reality to UFOs, and thatthe documents were created in order to lead researchers into dead ends. As BarryGreenwood later put it, “MJ-12 did immense damage to document research. Now Ilook at anything written about UFOs and I say, is that for real?” dccxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1947685] Perhaps thiswas the intention.Such debates and uncertainties, however, lay in the future. For the next fewyears following receipt of the MJ-12 documents in December 1984, Shandera,Moore, and (very soon) Stanton Friedman kept their existence a closely guardedsecret. Meanwhile, they tried to determine how exactly one could authenticatethem. Leaks and Lore, 1985In the modern history of UFOs, certain years are sometimes listed as “down”years when subsequent research indicates otherwise. 1985, however, was a slowyear. For whatever reasons, sightings dropped around the world. Even the HudsonValley experienced a significant decline in sightings. The global geopoliticalscene was more interesting, as were some very intriguing leaks from the covertworld.By the mid-1980s, America’s national security establishment was riding high.Four years of the Reagan Presidency had brought a renewed confidence to themilitary and intelligence community – a confidence buttressed by many billionsof dollars. Government secrecy was in the ascendant. General William Odom, a manwho equated journalism with espionage, became the new director of the NSA.“Quite simply,” said Odom to a group of colleagues, “there is no comprehensive‘right to know’ included, either explicitly or implicitly, within the firstAmendment.” Such was the prevailing attitude. dccxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1947839] The stealth fighter was operational and still secret. The stealth bomberwas being test-flown in the mid-west, occasionally causing UFO reports. dccxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1947999] And the firsthint of a mysterious new aircraft appeared in a U.S. Defense budgetary requestfor Fiscal Year 1987. Within a section entitled “Strategic Reconnaissance” was areference to a project known as “Aurora.” No one knew of it, and fewer cared todiscuss it. Some $455 million were requested for the program – for production,not research. In all likelihood, the Aurora aircraft – believed to be a highaltitude, high speed reconnaissance platform that succeeded the SR-71 Blackbird– was flying at this time. dccxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1948223]Interest in space weapons and systems was strong. This was the year that the SDIprograms began making notable progress, including the Mid-Infrared AdvancedChemical Laser (MIRACL), which successfully destroyed a Titan missile boosterduring a simulation, and the High Precision Tracking Experiment (HPTE), designedfor Earth to Orbit laser tracking. General Odom pushed for a satellite programthat would be survivable in the event of a Soviet attack. According tojournalist James Bamford, most senior officials at NSA thought the idea “loony,”though one may wonder whether additional motives were at work – if rumors ofET-connections to the Strategic Defense Program are to be believed. dccxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1948405] Other programsoperated on the principal that the best space defense is a good space offense.During 1985, an anti-satellite missile (launched from an F-15) successfully hita target 290 miles above the Earth, moving at 17,500 mph. dccxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1948562]It is interesting that the annual Bilderberg meeting discussed SDI that year.The conference strongly supported further development of SDI. According toBilderberg Group watcher Daniel Estulin, members did so “on the premise that itwould grant unlimited riches to the Masters of the Universe.” Such riches, ifnothing else, would come in the form of defense contracts, but most likely theassumption was that domination of space was a prerequisite for domination of thebattlefield in future wars – something that America’s satellite program wouldprove decisively during the 1991 Gulf War. In any event, several strong SDIproponents were known Bilderberg attendees, including Richard Perle, whoattended a 1983 meeting, and Paul Nitze, who attended many meetings going backto the 1950s. Whether an extraterrestrial connection was quietly made by someBilderberg members can only be guessed at. Clearly, even in a group such as theBilderbergers, knowledge of the UFO reality and extraterrestrial presence musthave been on a “need to know.” dccxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1948730]Another secret program at the time, purely at the research stage, later becamethe High Frequency Active Aural Research Program (HAARP). In 1985, Bernard J.Eastlund, a physicist for ARCO Power Technologies, applied for the patent“Method and Apparatus for Altering a Region in the Earth’s Atmosphere,Ionosphere and/or Magnetosphere.” The idea was to use high-frequency radio wavesto beam unprecedented amounts of power into the ionosphere, more than 100 milesabove the planet’s surface. The beam would energize and heat the ionosphere,disabling incoming missiles and knocking out enemy satellite communications.Well into the 1990s, ARCO scientists expanded Eastlund’s ideas to develop newweapons capabilities. In the midst of the Alaskan wilderness, a large clearingwas made to create the HAARP Array.The anti-missile aspect of Eastlund’s work may have been discarded later, butHAARP of the 1990s and beyond contained definite military applications. It coulddisrupt satellites and communication systems. It could also useEarth-penetrating tomography to search for natural gas or petroleum deposits, oreven artificial structures like underground military bases. HAARP has beenaccused of being able to change weather patterns (perhaps in concert with thenotorious chemtrails), and even disrupt human mental processes. The OfficialHAARP Homepage denies these claims while acknowledging that the array cangenerate Extra Low Frequencies (ELF). While ELFs can affect biological systems,HAARP’s defenders argue the signals are negligible and have no effect on humansor other biological systems. dccxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1949200]That HAARP can be used to “see” below the Earth’s surface is a fact of thegreatest importance. One HAARP project manager stated that the program could, infact, be used to locate underground bases, presumably those belonging tomilitary adversaries. By the mid-1980s, the technology was in place to createhardened underground facilities under virtually all conditions. The onlyconstraint was money. Such was the conclusion of a 1985 report by the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers. Underground base researcher Richard Sauder pointed out that,given the substantial buildup in military budgets under the Reaganadministration, money may not have been a drawback at all. A 1986 report fromLos Alamos National Laboratories called for using a fission powered, nuclearsubselene to provide the heat to “melt rock and form a self-supporting, glasslined tunnel suitable for Maglev or other high speed transport modes.” Thisreport was not even directed toward Earthly purposes, but rather at NASA plansfor tunneling on the Moon. Such devices would be automatic and remotelyoperated. The following year, Lloyd A. Duscha, Deputy Director of Engineeringand Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, mentioned in a speechthat several of the Corps’ “most interesting” underground facilities wereclassified, and that there were projects – which he would not identify – with“multiple chambers up to 50 feet wide and 100 feet high.” In other words,enormous secret underground facilities were very much in existence by this time.dccxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1949370] Indeed, claims of secret underground bases were beginning to leak fromthe covert world. Several, replete with connections to UFOs and reverseengineering, pointed to Fort Hood in Texas. 18[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1768958] ResearcherRichard Sauder communicated with a former member of the Army who claimed that toreach his work station beneath Fort Hood, he had to travel through two miles oftunnel. There was evidently much more beyond that. When Sauder asked him whetherhis work underground was UFO-related, the man remained sphinx-like, butintimated yes. Another military source told Sauder of an underground base atFort Hood dating back to the 1950s, if not earlier. More recently, Sauderexpressed his firm conviction that there are multiple, massive facilitiesbeneath Fort Hood, perhaps even a labyrinth of tunnels and bases. dccxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1949757] Yet anotherperson, writing anonymously to the UFO news repository, Filer’s Files , claimedto have interviewed during the 1980s several individuals connected with FortHood. He concluded there was a secret base below, containing either captured orman-made UFOs. Some of his sources claimed to have seen UFOs taking off orlanding in a restricted part of Fort Hood. dccxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1949952] This was still several years before the claims of Robert Lazar regardingthe reverse engineering of an alien saucer at the Groom Lake facility south ofArea 51 in Nevada. But even by the mid-1980s, aviation writer James Goodall wasinterviewing people who worked there. Goodall wrote many articles on aviationand black technology for Jane’s Defense , Aviation Week and Space Technology ,and Interavia . One of his sources had worked at Groom for twelve years. Whenasked whether he believed in UFOs, the man replied: “Absolutely, positively,they do exist.” “Can you expand on that?” asked an intrigued Goodall. “No, Ican’t,” came the reply. A few years later the same man told Goodall, “we havethings in the Nevada desert that would make George Lucas envious.” Anothersource, a Chief Master Sergeant with three tours at Groom Lake, told Goodallaround 1985: “We have things out there that are literally out of this world....Better than Star Trek or anything you can see in the movies.” Goodall asked himto expand on this statement; he refused.Based on his many first-person interviews in the 1980s and early 1990s, Goodallconcluded there were at least eight black programs flying out of Groom Lake,entirely separate from the known stealth programs. At least two of these were ofvery high speed aircraft; another was of a high-altitude, slow, and quietstealth aircraft. Another was of a silent flying triangle. “Unconventional”technologies were in use, said Goodall. dccxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1950092] Even more incredible information was coming to Linda Moulton Howe, who hadcultivated military sources describing exotic programs and more. Studying alientechnology was the least of it. Howe was given a veritable mountain ofinformation (or disinformation, depending on one’s analysis) about theextraterrestrial presence on planet Earth. For one, there was an active programto communicate with extraterrestrial biological entities, called “Ebens.” Shelearned of a “Yellow Book” – a device brought by the Ebens on April 25, 1964 –which provided holographic images of many things, including Earth’s history andalleged images of Christ.There was also a “Red Book,” written by humans based on the information gatheredabout the extraterrestrials. Some of the information contained within it wasnothing short of astounding. Alien-made tunnels were common beneath the Earth.The Ebens knew the past and future, and wanted to change the catastrophesawaiting mankind. However, they preferred to convince humanity to change itsways, rather than directly interfere.One of Howe’s contacts believed there may have been a war 6,000 years agobetween two extraterrestrial races, the Ebens and Nordics, over territorialrights to a certain planet, which may not have been Earth. Theseextraterrestrials – masters at manipulating DNA – have designed and enhancedcreatures from many worlds. The extraterrestrials also have an interest in oursouls, possibly in a predatory way, possibly not. One of Howe’s sources onceasked an elderly member of MJ-12 about souls and why the Ebens “made” humanity.The reply he received was “you don’t want to know that.” dccxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1950313] By the mid-1980s, the information leaking out of the black world was far moredetailed and bizarre than anything that had previously escaped. The 1980s weretruly “The Decade of Leaks.” Conservative UfologyThere was no question that a popular demand existed for ufology, if only someoneknew how to tap it. In January 1985, Oprah Winfrey, hosting the television showAM Chicago , did an hour-long segment on UFOs. The same month, CNN produced aspecial documentary on the Rendlesham Forest Incident, obtaining cooperationfrom researcher Lawrence Fawcett. dccxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1950504] But despitethe obvious popular appeal, proponents of scientific ufology steered clear. Mostof these researchers also refused to give credence to the leaks that had beenseeping from the covert world.At CUFOS, Allen Hynek’s deteriorating health meant that the organization wasinexorably devolving into other hands. In the spring of 1985, he resigned asPresident and designated Mark Rodeghier his successor. The editorship of theInternational UFO Reporter passed to Jerome Clark. The new lights at CUFOSsought to continue Hynek’s tradition of providing a scientific voice to ufology,although for the most part the group had to be dragged forcibly into doing anytrue research. In fairness, membership was limited and funds less so. Yet, theentrenched conservatism of the organization meant that it often played catch-upto everyone else. Clark, for instance, acknowledged that there was somethingserious about UFOs. “Beyond that,” he said, “we hold forth for no particularinterpretation.” He considered all the talk of reverse engineering, undergroundbases, to say nothing of Ebens and Nordics, as a plague of “mystery mongering,”“credulity” and “loose thinking.” Ufology was sinking into a morass of popculture, said Clark, and needed a good housecleaning. dccxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1950691] Some CUFOS members, it is true, were unhappy with the organization’sstubborn intransigence regarding these new developments. Clark was evenunimpressed by the Hudson Valley sightings, calling the case a “scam” in thedebunking journal Saucer Smear . At this point, Hynek took exception to Clark’sposition. Though ailing, he had recently visited the area, and came awayimpressed by the researchers and their data. dccxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1950889]When the IUR did try to confront ufology’s leading issues, like the crashedsaucer thesis, the results were tepid, such as in a 1985 debate between DavidJacobs (“absolutely no”) and Richard Hall (a definite “maybe”). For Jacobs, theconcept was so outlandish, the alleged cover-up so immense, that nothing lessthan actual alien hardware would suffice as proof. He argued that nothing in thereleased FOIA documents indicated that the U.S. government systematicallyinvestigated UFOs, much less retrieved crashed UFOs. The only evidence presentedfor UFO crash retrievals was anecdotal, he said, mostly anonymous, and none fromactual scientists. Following up on such so-called leaks, said Jacobs, promisedto be a waste of resources; he dismissed such testimony as too fantastic to beconsidered. Case closed. Hall, for his part, conceded the “historicalridiculousness” of the idea that UFOs had crashed, but acknowledged “a small butgrowing body of credible reports” that were suggestive of exactly this. Hepointed out that Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a man who certainly qualified as aleading scientist, made several statements about UFO crash retrieval programs.Hall counseled his skeptical colleagues to use more caution before condemningthe idea that crashed UFOs may have been retrieved. dccxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1951368]Absent from the debate was a recognition of just how revolutionary the crashretrieval concept was to ufology. Accepting its reality would transform theentire concept of secrecy. It would mean that the government was not merelyhiding the existence of the reality of UFOs from the rest of the world, but alsoits possession of exotic technology, the probability of hiding a great deal ofmoney for secret research and development, and the likelihood that privategroups would have gotten in on the “gravy train” to benefit from such secrets."},{"pageContent":"Whereas American ufology could be recalcitrant enough regarding evidence of agrand conspiracy, British ufology had practically tossed out the ETH altogether.Across the Atlantic, paranormal and psychological theories were explaining UFOs;conspiracies were right out. British researcher Jenny Randles speculated thatone reason might have been the difficulty in obtaining UFO data from the Britishgovernment. In the U.K., the Official Secrets Act provided for prison sentencesrelating even to the release of minor data. Without obtaining any evidence ofactual government data on the subject, conspiracies were a tougher nut to crack.dccxxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1951641]Meanwhile, after a long and productive existence, the Aerial Phenomena ResearchOrganization (APRO) was beginning to shut down. The July 1985 APRO Bulletinannounced that health problems in the Lorenzen family would cause thepublication to be suspended indefinitely. APRO did not have to go this route.With better cultivation of new leaders, this organization had the capability ofsustaining itself and growing through the years. But it was not to be. Soon, Jimand Coral Lorenzen would be dead, and APRO gone forever. dccxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1951829] Hynek’s health, too, was in decline. In the latter half of 1985, heunderwent extensive cancer treatment and moved to Scottsdale, Arizona. He hadalready been stepping back from management of CUFOS. By the end of 1985, ShermanLarsen was the organization’s chief executive officer, Mark Rodeghier its deputyscientific director, and Jerome Clark the editor of the IUR (for which Larsenwas also the Production Manager). dccxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1951985] One of the oddfeatures of Hynek’s move to Arizona was his connection to a woman named TinaChoate. Little is known about her, except that she appears to be a member of theprestigious Choate family, one of the early families of New England. Choate, andher partner Brian Myers, lured Hynek to come to Arizona with promises ofresearch money. These were never fulfilled, and Hynek soon broke off relationswith the two in disillusionment. Choate and Myers would take on a moresignificant and darker role in ufology a few years later, after the death of theLorenzens. dccxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1952189] 1985: A Quiet YearIn terms of actual UFO activity, 1985 was as quiet as any year in modern times.There appears to have been a glimmer of activity in the Soviet Union, where –coincidentally or not – major political changes were beginning. On March 11,1985, following the death of Communist Party Secretary General KonstantinChernenko, Mikhail Gorbachev was unanimously selected to lead the country.Gorbachev electrified the Soviet Union; yet he did not seek to overthrow thesystem. He sought radical reforms, not revolution; greater freedoms, but theretention of communism. Within a few years, however, his reforms had spun out ofcontrol, leading to the unthinkable: the dissolution of the Soviet Union.One of the Soviet encounters from the year involved a radar station in theKrasnovodsk region, in Turkmenistan, near the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea.A Captain L. Valuev registered an unknown object at an altitude above 60,000feet. Its size was enormous: one kilometer long. The object was stationary, buteventually a small object with a diameter of 15-20 feet flew out of it andlanded at the Krasnovodsk port. Patrol-boats pursued it, but it took off andflew away for about a kilometer. The patrol boats continued to approach it; onceagain it flew away from them. According to the KGB’s “Blue Folder,” thissituation occurred five times. Finally the object ascended with tremendousspeed. Its radar target joined that of the mother ship, and the large objectwent up and away. dccxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1952459]There is another KGB file regarding an incident on May 23, 1985, in theKhaborovsk region, the country’s extreme east, not far from China. A bomberregiment carrying out a scheduled mission spotted an oval, orange unknown at10:35 p.m. Radar did not track it, but observers estimated it was travelingclose to 350 mph, and they saw a light halo surrounding it. The sighting lastedfor 13 minutes, during which the object occasionally descended and remainedmotionless. Two hours later, a similar object was seen for ten minutes, emittingbeams of light. According to the official report, “the object traveled at a highaltitude and with a great speed.” dccxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1952828] A July report from the northeastern part of the Soviet Union was morestrange, involving a luminescent sphere that flew in front of a train travelingfrom Petrozavodsk to Suoyrvi. The driver was unable to break at the nextstation; instead, the train gained speed as if the sphere were pulling itforward. The UFO then vanished. It later reappeared, apparently forcing thetrain to slow down considerably. dccxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1953128] A KGB file recorded an incident from November 3, 1985 in the waters nearVladivostok. At 8:30 p.m., two men of a small vessel noticed a high flyingobject in the north, looking a bit larger than a star, rapidly moving towardthem. At some point it sent a beam of light to the Earth at a sharp angle,although the beam did not reach the ground. As the UFO approached the boat, theboat’s engine stopped. The captain restarted the engine, but it died again whenthe object was overhead. As it moved off toward the city, the objectdisappeared. The boat’s engine still did not start, and the men used oars toreturn to shore. dccxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1953309] Elsewhere in the world, sightings were sporadic. The Hudson Valley wavedropped off considerably, although several of the main investigators had theirown sighting on March 21, 1985. While walking to their car after giving a localradio interview, Philip Imbrogno, Sheila Sabo, and George Lesnick saw somethingthat was so astounding they initially thought it was a hoax. In the sky wereseven intensely bright lights in an elliptical pattern. They jumped into the carand tried to follow. As they drove, they could see a dark structure connectingthe lights. The object glided “effortlessly” across the sky. The investigatorschecked with the FAA and learned that other witnesses had also reported this.They became suspicious when the FAA told them that the sighting was actually ofpilots flying their aircraft in illegal formation; incredulous when told thatstate police had arrested the culprits. After checking into this story, theylearned that this was totally untrue. No arrests had been made at all. dccxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1953492] Several near collisions were reported from around the world. One casetook place on June 11 over China, when a Boeing 747 airliner flying from Beijingto Paris encountered an object at 33,000 feet. This object crossed in front ofthe airliner’s path at a very fast speed. It appeared to be elliptical, bright,and extremely large. The pilots claimed to see three horizontal rows ofbluish-white lights, and the sighting lasted for two minutes. No passengersreported seeing the object. The incident was reported twice in The People’sDaily , which stated the estimated size of the object was an incredible sixmiles. dccxlvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1953650] Another near-collision occurred a month later in the United States. Thiswas an incident reported many years after the fact, and not investigatedindependently. Yet, claimed the pilot, as he was flying his two-seater aircraftunder blue skies toward the Columbus, Ohio airport, he was given permission toinvestigate what appeared to be a “second sun” about two-thirds the size of afootball field, a few miles northwest of the airport. As he approached the lightsource, he could see it was a huge bright sphere. Even though airport radartracked his own aircraft, the unknown object never registered. The pilot, aformer Navyman trained in radar, believed this was impossible. “Anything thathuge ... that bright ... and that close to the radar,” he wrote, “should have‘blipped’ like the Graf Zeppelin blimp with a full metal jacket.” Frightened butcurious – and prepared to eject with his parachute if the need arose – hecontinued to approach the UFO. At that point, the bright light from the objectinstantly “switched off,” revealing a huge grey sphere. The truly bizarre thingwas that this was not a single object, but “millions” of clearly visible,pentagon-shaped crystals, apparently partially translucent. The pilot estimatedthem to be six inches in diameter, all spaced identically about one foot apart.They were most definitely not moving. The pilot decided to penetrate the mass ofcrystals with his left wing, hoping he could knock some to the ground. As hiswing sliced through, he heard what sounded like a hale storm on a tin roof, andhe saw hundreds of crystals breaking at his wing’s edge. To his surprise, hisaircraft’s turbulence did not affect these small objects. They never moved.However, their impact on his left wing nearly destabilized him. Later, heexamined the ground for evidence of the impact, but found nothing; nor did hefind fragments of the crystals embedded in his wing. dccxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1953984] The aforementioned encounters are interesting, but lack documentation thatwould make them stand up to skeptical inquiry. The situation is different,however, regarding an incident that took place on July 22, 1985, when two jetsof the Zimbabwe Air Force tried to intercept a UFO. The object was first seenover the border between South Africa and Zimbabwe, then at various locations inwestern Zimbabwe, and finally at Bulawayo Airport by control tower and groundpersonnel. Two fighter jets were scrambled from Thornhill AFB at 5:45 p.m.,piloted by C. Cordy-Hedge and T. R. Van Rooyen. Both men saw the bright orangeobject, apparently hovering 15 miles southeast of the airport at 4,500 feet. Asthey approached, it shot up very quickly to an altitude to 80,000 feet.Commercial traffic at the airport was delayed for several hours while the jetsinvestigated. The object eventually accelerated at a high speed and was gone.The Air Force sighting lasted nearly an hour.Some wondered if the object was a high altitude balloon. Such an objectconceivably could appear lower from a distance, and then seem to rise as thejets approached. South African UFO researcher Cynthia Hind spoke to airportwitnesses who thought the object might have been a balloon coated with areflecting material. One of her Johannesburg contacts also told her thathigh-altitude balloons had been released from South Africa all month. Still, shecould not understand how a balloon would move against the northeastern winds,nor why it would have hovered in one place for so long.UFO skeptic James Oberg was unconvinced the sighting was anything anomalous.Zimbabwe, he said, “is sort of on the edge of the civilized world in terms oftracking things that might cause this kind of UFO report – like Russian andSouth African reconnaissance planes that, I’m sure, are flying over thatairspace.” Undoubtedly, Zimbabwean military personnel would have disagreed withthis assessment. In any case, they were impressed by the sighting. The Air Forcestated it had tracked the object on radar and was satisfied it was not aballoon. Zimbabwean Air Force Commodore David Thorne told Hind that he felt thiswas a genuine UFO. Later, in a letter to Timothy Good, he stated off the recordthat his Air Staff was “concerned” about the event, and that they believed someunexplained UFOs were “from some civilization beyond our planet.” The nation’sAir Marshall, Azim Daudpota commented that “this was no ordinary UFO. Scores ofpeople saw it. It was no illusion, no deception, no imagination.” dccxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1954127]Just what exactly were these objects doing in the sky? Whatever UFOs were,wherever they were from, defense implications were always obvious to militariesencountering them. In the case of Iran, which was then at war with the nation ofIraq, UFOs were probably enemy weapons. On Monday, August 5, 1985, Iranianantiaircraft fired on a shining object that flew over Tehran toward the east at8:15 p.m. A spokesman from the Iranian Joint Chiefs of Staff said the object hadnot been identified, but that the unit believed it to be an Iraqi warplane;other reports speculated the object was a satellite. No other information hascome to light. dccxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1954649] A baffling encounter occurred throughout central Chile on August 17,1985. For several hours in the afternoon, many people saw distinct, luminousspots in the sky – sometimes motionless, sometimes moving slowly. Televisionstations filmed the objects, astronomers in Santiago photographed them, and theComodoro Benitez International Airport in Santiago tracked them on radar. Earlyexplanations, including by the Chilean Air Force, centered on weather balloonsor research balloons. At least one of the objects remained difficult to explain,however, and a Chilean Civil Aeronautics report stated that the sightingsremained “an enigma to be added to the archive of unexplained phenomena.” dccl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1954852]Little else was reported for the rest of the year, except for a few trianglereports in Wisconsin during November, dccli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1955034] and one moreinteresting sighting in the Hudson Valley on November 21. On this occasion, inthe towns of Peekskill, Port Chester, and Greenwich, a large circular objectwith colored lights was seen by no less than 400 witnesses. Once gain, the FAAperformed damage control, telling local media that these were helicopters,although no one knew where they were based. Philip Imbrogno and otherresearchers interviewed 25 witnesses, none of whom had heard a sound from theobject. dcclii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1955197] Reagan’s (First) Alien Invasion SpeechDespite the scarce number of good UFO reports, and the near absence of mediacoverage, the issue was still seen as a serious matter by none other than RonaldReagan, who had a longstanding interest in the matter. On November 19 and 20,1985, at a summit in Geneva, he met for the first time with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev. To their mutual surprise, the two leaders connected on apersonal level. While making a toast, Reagan surprised everyone by discussingthe idea of an alien invasion. As he recounted a few weeks later, Reagan toldGorbachev and the Soviet delegation how much easier their tasks might be “ifsuddenly there was a threat to this world from another species from anotherplanet outside in the universe.” The statement received a great deal ofpublicity through several major newspapers, and researcher Grant Cameron locateda State Department “Memorandum of Conversation” that recorded Reagan’s comment.dccliii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1955375]Reagan was a former UFO witness with a possible close encounter, and so had anobvious attraction to this topic. Cameron, upon review of the files from theDecember 4 speech at Fallston High School in Maryland, found that the “alieninvasion” reference was not in the drafts or the speech copy – Reagan had simplyadded it on his own. His handlers did not like these references, and suchoccasional public statements were certainly not a policy emanating from thenational security community. dccliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1955644] Yet, it wouldseem to matter that a U.S. President would show such a persistent interest inthis subject. According to the private statement he made to a journalist yearsbefore, Reagan had read a great deal about UFOs, and there is no indication thisinterest ever wavered. If it is reasonable to assume that Ronald Reagan was aUFO believer, might we assume he believed in the possibility of alienvisitation? And if this was so, would this belief have translated into specificattitudes and policies relating to the cold war? What makes this even moreinteresting is the claim, according to one of the author’s sources, that Reaganwas formally briefed on the matter of UFOs and extraterrestrials. If that wasso, his various statements on the matter of ET would have reflected more thanjust a private obsession, but perhaps hinted at defying national securitysecrecy protocols. Pennsylvania TrianglesIn terms of UFO history, 1986 was another slow year, similar to 1985. Trianglesightings continued, especially in the Northeastern U.S., where objectscontinued to be reported in the Hudson Valley and Pennsylvania. One keydifference in 1986 from the previous year, however, was the occurrence of a fewtruly historic cases that stood out from the rest.Early in 1986, something was happening in western Pennsylvania. On January 7, anobject was seen hovering above the town of Butler, emitting six beams of lighttoward ground. Twenty minutes later in nearby Pittsburgh, a silver grey discwith body lights was seen hovering. Mist formed around it, the object tilted,and then moved out of sight. dcclv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1955920] Meanwhile,UFOs and unmarked helicopters (with searchlights) were being reported with somefrequency in nearby Westmoreland County. One particular area, a 60-acre swampyarea on private property, was scene to many of the events, which were reportedby local property owners and travelers. Researcher Stan Gordon also investigateda possible military UFO encounter from near the town of Slickville from January23. Several people saw a large, silent, triangular object with amber-coloredlights maneuvering around the countryside. After ten minutes, three militaryjets came in from the east, pursuing the object in the direction of Pittsburgh.dcclvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956084] Meanwhile, on January 9, in the Connecticut region of the Hudson Valley,a building inspector for the town of Torrington saw what he described as a“cigar with square windows” near the Bradley International Airport. She told themedia that “this thing of it being aircraft flying in formation is a lot ofcrap.” The FAA said the object was a blimp, although investigators found that noblimps flew in that area during the month. dcclvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956264] Such reports continued throughout the spring, including claims oflow-flying objects shining down bright lights. This was reported in New Castle,Pennsylvania, on February 28 dcclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956424] and then onMarch 26 in Kingston, New York – another Hudson Valley UFO. The latter caseinvolved at least 500 witnesses who described an object that looked like a“giant Ferris wheel” the size of a football field. It made a humming sound andhad intensely bright lights, mostly white but also red, yellow, green, and blue.A dark mass, visible behind the lights, blocked out the entire sky. Suddenly,the object flipped over on its side before going away. One of the witnesses, apolice officer, said, “up to this point, I heard about the sightings and wasconvinced that it was nothing more than a bunch of guys flying in planesperpetrating a hoax, but now I know this is not so.” dcclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956591] Strange objects continued to be seen in Pennsylvania and the HudsonValley through the spring and summer, including a huge triangular object seen inlate May near Harrisburg and Carlisle. According to Stan Gordon, many witnessesdescribed it as being immense, silent, with non-blinking reddish lights at thecorners, and moving steadily at 1,000 feet altitude. dcclx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956749] A large,silent, low-flying, triangle was reported a month later on June 27 in the HudsonValley, causing several minor accidents in the town of Newburgh. dcclxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1956928] The Challenger and Ellison OnizukaOn January 28, 1986, one of the great tragedies of the U.S. space programoccurred when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, at11:39 a.m. All seven astronauts aboard were killed. The event essentiallygrounded America’s space program for two years.An interesting prologue to the tragedy concerns a story told to NASA employeeClark C. McClelland, a long-time mission control specialist at the Kennedy SpaceCenter in Florida. McClelland later wrote that in the days prior to the fatallaunch of the shuttle, he ran into astronaut Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka, one ofthe members of that ill-fated mission. The two were acquainted, and Onizuka knewof McClelland’s interest in UFOs. He asked McClelland about his beliefs inextraterrestrials, and then whether his name had any connection with McClellanAFB in California (it did not). Onizuka then related a surprising experience.Many years before, during 1970 or 1971, he was on specialized military trainingduty at McClellan AFB, when he and his group were directed to report to aviewing room. Without any official introduction, which would have been standard,Onizuka and his fellow officers were shown a very realistic looking film of amedical room with small bodies lying on slabs. Several of the officers withOnizuka let out excited comments. The small creatures were humanoid but nothuman. They had large heads, large eyes, and small torsos. They did not appearto be of earthly origin. Onizuka told McClelland, “Clark, my God, these highlytrained officers and I were shocked by what we saw. We were not made privy towhat we would see until it happened. We were all caught off guard. Perhaps itwas a test of our psyche to determine our overall reaction. Well, we were allcaught by surprise.” This type of scenario had been reported several times inyears past to Stringfield; apparently it had happened many times. Indeed, AirForce Major George Filer stated that several Air Force officers told him theywere also shown such a movie. No explanation is ever known to have been offered.Onizuka’s explanation seems logical: a test of the psyche. But why aliens? Whysomething so realistic? In all instances this story has been related, the filmappeared to be real. Therefore, if it was a hoax created by the U.S. military,it was exceptionally well done. This begs the dual questions: why and how?Why show something as outlandish as an autopsy of extraterrestrials to militarypersonnel? Could it be more than just a test of the psyche, and actually a testof one’s reaction to extraterrestrials themselves? According to the variousleaks that have occurred, the “autopsy movie” would have been shown to militarypersonnel for two decades at the least. This is a long time. Why make such awell-made fake ET autopsy film if there are no ETs? Why promote such anoutlandish belief – unless the ET presence on Earth were real, and it wasnecessary to gauge the reaction of various personnel whose career paths mightbring them into contact at some point with “the program.” It would be importantto find out in advance whether such personnel could be trusted psychologically,whether they would constitute a security risk. dcclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1957086] Dalnegorsk: The Soviet Roswell?Less than a day after the Challenger tragedy, an unknown object crashed into thearea of Dalnegorsk, a mining town in the eastern Soviet Union. The local timewas 7:55 p.m. on January 29, 1986, but time zone differences meant that itoccurred less than 18 hours after the Challenger explosion. Local people saw areddish-orange sphere flying southwest at low altitude, perhaps 2,000 to 2,500feet, moving in a level flight path and absolutely silent. This was a very slowmoving object. The object was tracked by a chronometer at the very slow speed of15 meters per second, or a little more than 30 miles per hour. The objectapproached a low mountain near the town and apparently slowed down. Somewitnesses said the object rose and lowered itself six times. Each time it rose,the light became brighter; each time it descended, the light weakened. Theobject then dived at a sharp angle, dropping like a stone, and burned at theedge of a cliff for an hour.A scientific team arrived on February 3. It was led by Valeri Dvuzhilny, head ofthe Far Eastern Commission for Anomalous Phenomena. Although the entire area wasblanketed by heavy snow, there was no snow at the site. The team found a numberof physical traces, including lead and iron balls, pieces of glass, a fine meshor netting, traces of high temperature activity, magnetic anomalies and damageto nearby trees and stumps. Laboratories from several universities and researchinstitutes studied the remains, and the Soviet newspaper Socialist Industrypublished some of the details of laboratory results. The so-called lead balls,for instance, were only roughly fifty percent lead, but also containedsubstantial amounts of silicon, aluminum, and iron. In addition, many elementswere found in much smaller amounts: zinc, titanium, magnesium, silver, copper,lanthanum, praseodymium, calcium, sodium, vanadium, cerium, chrome, cobalt,nickel, and molybdenum. There were a number of other surprises about thematerials recovered, as well as the crash site itself. Members of the “Councilof Scientific and Engineering Societies’ Commission on Paranormal Events,” A.Petukhov and T. Faminskaya, wrote that “vivid interest was ... evoked by themesh, a carbon-based composite of unknown origin.” They wrote that the specimencontained quartz filaments 17 microns thick, and golden wires inside eachfilament. On-site researchers also showed biological effects, according toPetukhov and Faminskaya, specifically a reduced count of leucocytes andplatelets within their blood, as well as changes in the structure oferythrocytes. For several years afterward, the crash scene was something of an“anomalous zone.” Many UFOs were reported there, insects avoided it, and localresidents appeared to have health problems.Some investigators concluded the object was an extraterrestrial space probe ofsome sort. V. Vysotsky, a doctor of chemistry, stated his belief that theDalnegorsk object was “a high-technology product and not a thing of natural orterrestrial origin.” Dvuzhilny agreed that the object was “an automatic scoutprobe” of alien origin. Others argued the object was a “natural plasmoid.” YuriRylkin, a physicist with the Tomsk Polytechnical Institute, presented a paperfor a UFO conference in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1989, arguing that the object wasof an electromagnetic nature, perhaps caused by anomalous stresses nearfaultlines (“geological breaking”) and passing parallel to high-voltagetransmission line. The “plasmoid” may have selectively absorbed some chemicalelements in the process. Still others, such as noted Soviet UFO skeptic YuriPlatov, suggested the object “was connected with the conduct of a technicalexperiment.” While this is certainly possible, there were no known rocketlaunches that evening, and no civilian or military traffic in the area. ARussian ufologist, Gennady Belimov, presented information in 1993 that theobject was a Soviet military probe, and V. Psalomschikov, an aviation crashexpert, also said the crash was of a Soviet manufactured probe. He even claimedto have ultrathin filaments, similar to those found at the site, in hispossession.Clearly, whatever crashed at Dalnegorsk was not a natural phenomenon, butsomething manufactured. If Soviet, it seems odd that the fragments would havegone to so many institutions for analysis; presumably this would have includedclassified technology. Why send it to scientific institutions for analysis if itwas home-made? Why, also, did it take so long for a team to arrive on the scene,and not even a military team? This too seems confusing if the object were aSoviet manufactured object. The Dalnagorsk crash is a prime example of theblurring of the lines between what is supposed to be “alien” and “human.” Ananswer to what crashed there may be very long in coming.One important point of note, however, remains. On February 6, 1986, just eightdays after the crash, two yellow globes were seen to approach the crash site at8:30 p.m. They circled overhead four times, then turned back and flew away.dcclxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1957287] Geopolitics and Chernobyl in 1986The rise of Mikhail Gorbachev made international politics very interesting. InJanuary 1986, he offered to eliminate all nuclear weapons by the Year 2000, andproposed a bilateral agreement to remove all intermediate range nuclear missilesfrom Europe. Many in the West regarded this as “lacking seriousness.” Others sawit as simply another Moscow propaganda trick: without missiles, the Sovietswould have an overwhelming conventional force in Europe. Meanwhile, Afghanistanhad become a horrible mess for the Soviet Union, its greatest disaster. WhileReagan continued to support the Islamic fundamentalist Mujahideen (the “freedomfighters”) both publicly and covertly, Gorbachev wanted nothing more than topull all Soviet forces out as soon as possible. He offered the U.S. a timetablefor withdrawal in exchange for American support of an Afghani coalition ofCommunist and Mujahideen participants. America’s answer was “no.”America’s military was feeling its oats, so to speak. On April 15, anextraordinary air strike was made against Libya, involving 18 F-111 fighteraircraft flying from RAF Lakenheath without any European support. The strike wasagainst Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. It failed to kill him, though abomb exploded near him, his house was destroyed, at least 15 civilians died,along with with an unknown number of Libyan military personnel. An interestingsidelight of this attack is that the F-117 stealth fighter was not used, eventhough it was fully operational. The existence of the aircraft was still secretat this time, and it was considered so important that the risk of its disclosureoutweighed its obvious tactical advantages. Considering the likelihood ofreverse-engineering programs related to UFOs, one is reminded that the moreexotic the technology, the more rarified its use might be. Something asradically advanced as a ‘home made flying saucer’ might well be reserved formissions having nothing to do with ordinary politics.The Libyan raid and the rise of Gorbachev were both overshadowed by the worstnuclear disaster in history. On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear powerstation in the Ukraine was scene to a series of operator errors and reactordesign deficiencies that produced a devastating steam explosion and fuel-coremeltdown in Unit 4. Deadly radioactivity streamed across Europe, causingcontamination, disease, mutations, and death. Considering the substantial covertfootprint left by the UFO phenomenon on world history, it should not besurprising that there have been claims that a UFO was at Chernobyl.While the explosion was enormous, it was a thermal blast – not a nuclearexplosion. As one commentator put it, had the blast been nuclear, “half ofEurope would not currently be depicted on any maps.” According to certainclaims, technicians arriving at the scene shortly after 4 a.m. saw a fierysphere floating near the reactor. For several minutes, two red rays extendedfrom it toward the reactor; the rays then vanished and the object drifted away.The technicians said the UFO appeared to affect the radiation level, whichdropped from 3,000 to 800 milliroentgens per hour. Others are said to have alsoobserved an object over Chernobyl; several witnesses said it was there for sixhours and that hundreds of people saw it. Some drew sketches of what they saw.For years afterward, stories persisted in the Ukraine that “the world was savedby UFOs” – that the object lowered the radiation levels enough to prevent anuclear explosion. Of course, there is no official acknowledgment of any UFOconnection to the Chernobyl disaster. dcclxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1957645] Research: The Old and the NewOne day after Chernobyl, Allen Hynek died in Scottsdale, Arizona, at the age of75. For the past several years, he had been increasingly revered, often beingreferred to as the “Dean of Ufology” – even once as the “Galileo of Ufology.” Ofcourse, his relationship with many other researchers had long been strained, butby the end, the dominant assessment of Hynek emphasized the courage of hisgradual transformation from skeptic to believer. For sure, Hynek had been in adifficult position as a professional scientist and academician. For many years,he was virtually alone among scientists in devoting so much time to UFOs. Andwithout providing compelling physical evidence, he had to be circumspect in hispresentation of the topic, else become an outcast among his colleagues. No one’slife, certainly not Hynek’s, can fit into a neat category. His contribution toufology was undoubtedly substantial, in particular his emphasis on “scientificufology,” which elevated the level of discourse among researchers. During theearly 1970s, after UFO research had been rebuked by the Air Force’s “scientificstudy” of UFOs, the Condon Committee, this was very important.Regarding any approach to the matter of UFOs, there will be strengths andlimitations. The limitation of a strictly scientific approach was in itsfailure, or unwillingness, to investigate the political ramifications of UFOsecrecy – that is, the cover-up. Such was the dominant thread of UFO researchthroughout much of the 1970s. When that began to change, Hynek’s unwillingnessto consider that a genuine cover-up was underway became seen as an archaism atbest, or complicity at worst. Still, as long as the wide range of researchersare able to recognize the value in alternate approaches, each perspective canprovide valuable insights. Certainly, this is true of scientific ufology. dcclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1958000] A few months after Hynek passed away, James Lorenzen died. His wife, Coral, wasnow the sole leader of APRO, but was herself in declining health and essentiallyno longer able to run the far flung organization. The result was that APRO wasdead in the water.Contemporary UFO research was not becoming unscientific per se, but simplymoving into areas of high controversy not easily amenable to controlledscientific study. The secret of MJ-12 was beginning to leak to other UFOresearchers. Among them were Robert Hastings and Lee Graham. In March 1986,Graham gave Hastings copies of some of the alleged documents that mentionedMJ-12, including the Project Snowbird paper and the Project Aquarius telex. WhenHastings asked Graham who gave these to him, Graham said only that the personworked for the government as an intelligence operative or information conduit.This would be William Moore. Around this time, Hastings also met with PaulBennewitz at the latter’s home in Albuquerque. During their conversation,Bennewitz used the phrase “extraterrestrial biological entities” to describe thealiens. This matched the phrase in the MJ-12 briefing papers, and was a fullyear before the public release of these documents. Clearly, Bennewitz would nothave known of this phrase without having been told by someone, presumably Dotyor Moore, unless he was getting them from the signals he was receiving fromKirtland. dcclxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1958201] Meanwhile, FOIA requests regarding Project Aquarius (the allegeddocument which contained reference to MJ-12) was stalled. The NSA stated inApril 1986 that such information “has been found to be currently and properlyclassified” and that its disclosure “could reasonably be expected to causeexceptionally grave damage to the national security.” In a 1987 correspondenceto Senator John Glenn, the NSA stated that their Project Aquarius did not dealwith UFOs, but that “apparently there is or was an Air Force project by thatname which dealt with UFOs.” dcclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1958480] And thus themystery continued.Another deepening area of controversy concerned alien abductions. By this time,Budd Hopkins had concluded that thousands of people had probably been abducted,most had multiple experiences, and the phenomenon itself had been going on forat least 50 years. This is a long, long way from where research had been just afew years before. He added that genetic experimentation of some sort was oneapparent motive. Entire families seemed to be the objects of study which spannedseveral generations – thus the selection of candidates for abduction was notrandom. By the end of the year, the author Whitley Strieber described his“experiences with the visitors,” and revealed that his encounters were stillcontinuing. Strieber’s arrival to UFO research was a key moment that would sooncontribute to the field essentially exploding. dcclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1958836] May 1986 - The Brazilian Air ForceOne of the most important UFO sightings of 1986 took place in southeasternBrazil. On May 19, six military jet interceptors from the Brazilian Air Forcewere scrambled to attempt an interception of a UFO which was tracked on radarand seen visually. According to a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report, “atleast 20 unidentified objects were observed by several aircrews and on radar.”At 6:30 p.m., control tower personnel at the São José dos Campos airport,noticed two very bright lights about ten miles away that did not correspond toany known aircraft. Thirty minutes later, personnel in São Paulo and Braziliaconfirmed to São José that they had three unidentified targets on their screens.At 8 p.m., CINDACTA (Brazil’s air traffic control system, similar to that of theU.S. FAA) detected up to eight targets. By 8:30, another object was seen throughbinoculars at the São José tower to approach the tower and then retreat; it hadwell-defined edges and was red-orange in color.All of this coy behavior was strange enough. Then, at 9 p.m., an executive jetcarrying the head of the state oil company Petrobras , Colonel Ozires Silva, wascoming in to land at São José, when Silva and the pilot, Commander AlcirPereira, saw in their path several colored lights resembling ping pong balls;these were also detected on their aircraft radar. The jet attempted to followthe lights for 10 minutes, then came in for a landing. At this moment, a new,large, luminous object headed toward the aircraft. The São Paulo tower confirmedtwo echoes: the Xingu and an unknown. Within minutes, the Air Control Center inBrasilia (ACC-BR) informed Brazilian Air Defense Command of the situation. By9:25 p.m., the unknown radar target was gone, and the executive jet attemptedanother landing. However, the São Paulo tower reported yet another object, whichwas seen by Commander Pereira. He briefly attempted to follow the object, but at9:30 p.m. was at 10,000 feet altitude and about to attempt a third landing. Atthis point ACC-BR reported yet more objects. Silva and Pereira both saw threeluminous objects flying low over the Petrobrás refineries and moving towardsSerra do Mar. Finally, the men landed in São José dos Campos. Sporadic sightingsof luminous objects were reported from São José dos Campos, including onesurrounded by smaller lights at 9:50 p.m.Finally, at 10:23 p.m., an F-5E jet fighter was scrambled from nearby Santa CruzAFB, and another at 10:45 p.m. A Mirage F-103, armed with Sidewinder and Matramissiles, was also scrambled from Anápolis AFB. By 10:55 p.m., Anápolis detectedthe unknown objects on radar. The Mirage pilot, flying at 850 mph, could not seeany UFO, but did detect a target on his onboard radar. He came to within 6 milesof his target, which was zigzagging on his radar scope. Suddenly, itdisappeared. A second and third Mirage F-103 were soon scrambled from Anápolis.At 11:15, Lt. Kleber, who was piloting one of the F-5Es, made visual contactwith a ball of light, confirmed by ground-based radar, and chased it at about850 mph. He got to within 12 miles of it. This object also zigzagged from leftto right, then began to climb out over the Atlantic Ocean. The pilot followed itto 200 miles over the ocean, the limit of Brazil’s territorial waters. Anotherof the F-5Es had established radar contact with 10 to 13 objects near São Josédos Campos. “The sky was clear,” he later said, “but I didn’t see anything,”even though radar reported the objects to be a mere 20 miles distant inexcellent visibility. At one point, ground radar informed him that the objectswere closing on him just two or three miles behind: six on one side, seven onthe other. He engaged in evasive maneuvers, and the objects disappeared.Brazilian military jets remained in the air until 1 a.m. The objects hadcompletely baffled them. They also outperformed them, moving with astonishingmaneuverability at speeds between 160 and 990 mph. Brazilian President JoséSarney learned of the chase late that night. Within days, the Brazilian militaryheld a major press conference about the event, led by the Brazilian Minister ofAeronautics, Brigadier General Otávio Moreira Lima. It was the first time that asenior Air Force officer of any nation had come forward to admit the presence ofUFOs, to say nothing of failed intercepted attempts. According to General Lima,President Sarney was “interested and curious” about the event. Lima said theobjects saturated the Sao Paolo radar system and interfered with air traffic asfar away as Rio de Janeiro, more than 200 miles to the east. The General statedthe matter plainly:... at least 20 objects were detected by Brazilian radars. They saturated theradars and interrupted traffic in the area. Each time that radar detectedunidentified objects, fighters took off for intercept. Radar detects only solidmetallic bodies and heavy (mass) clouds. There were no clouds nor conventionalaircraft in the region. The sky was clear. Radar doesn’t have optical illusions.We can only give technical explanations and we don’t have them. It would be verydifficult for us to talk about the hypothesis of an electronic war. It’s veryremote and it’s not the case here in Brazil. It’s fantastic. The signals on theradar were quite clear.Major Ney Cerqueira, head of operations at the Brazilian Defense Center, who wasdeeply involved in the radar trackings of that night, said he had never seenanything like this case. All the pilots had something interesting to say. Klebersaid the object he chased “was not a star. It couldn’t have been another plane.It couldn’t be anything now existing.” Silva said that what he saw “wasn’t likeany of the classical flying objects seen in the movies. It wasn’t in the form ofa flying saucer or plate. Instead, what I saw were illuminated points.”News services around the world reported the event, although the case receivedonly limited coverage in the United States. Chilean UFO reseacher AntonioHuneeus aptly compared the Brazilian event, in its scope and defense impact, tothe famous Washington D.C. case of 1952, with the major difference being in howthe respective governments handled the matter publicly.As to what exactly happened that night, a variety of explanations were offered,including a meteor shower, a reflection of the full Moon, ball lightning, radarmalfunction, space debris, and spy planes. None of these seem plausible in lightof the radar data and visual descriptions. A British space researcher namedGeoffrey Perry noted that the Soviet space station Salyut-7 ejected severalboxes of debris that night which reentered the Earth’s atmosphere incentral-western Brazil (reasonably close, but still more than a thousand milesaway). The Brazilian press also theorized about the re-entry of NASA’s Solarwindsatellite. Both theories were discounted by Brigadier José Cavalcanti, fromBrazil’s Air Defense Command. “A metallic box with space debris can be detectedby radar, but it will always fall in the same direction and at constantvelocity. That was not the case of what was seen in Brazil, where the objectsdetected by radar had speeds that varied from very slow to extremely high.”The U.S. Defense Attaché office commented on the incident to the DefenseIntelligence Agency. “While RO [Reporting Officer] does not believe in UFO’s orall the hoopla that surrounds previous reporting, there is too much here to beignored. Three visual sightings and positive radar contact from three differenttypes of radar systems, leads one to believe that something arrived over Brazilthe night of 19 May.” dcclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1959109] UnFunded OpportunitiesOn July 11, 1986, a U.S. Air Force F-117 stealth fighter, the existence of whichwas still classified, crashed near Bakersfield, California. Rumors quicklyspread of a secret stealth aircraft. The Air Force sealed off the crash site,extending a national security zone more than a mile out that was off-limits tocivilian aircraft. One wonders whether a similar scenario could occur in thecase of something even more classified than stealth technology. dcclxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1959818] Meanwhile, an interesting correspondence was occurring between two prominentmembers of the aviation community. Ben Rich, head of Lockheed’s “Skunkworks”Division, where several of the world’s most famous and exotic aircraft wereconceived and made, received a letter from John Andrews. Andrews was a long timefriend of Rich’s, and an illustrator for the Testor Corporation. On July 10,Andrews wrote:The topic is UFOs. I ‘believe’ there are lots of UFOs. I am also tending to‘believe’ they are of two categories:A. Manmade UFOs.B. Extraterrestrial UFOs.I believe with certainty in manmade UFOs. I am tending to believe there are alsoextraterrestrial UFOs. Having the highest respect for you and Kelly [Johnson],I’d appreciate knowing if your belief covers category B as well as category A ofthe above? Purpose of question? Precision. Dr. [Robert] Sarbacher’s response waswithout question a statement of his belief in category B. Do you also includecategory B, Ben?Ben Rich’s reply was succinct, and yet a tad enigmatic. “Yes,” he wrote back toAndrews on July 21, “I’m a believer in both categories. I feel everything ispossible. Many of our man made UFOs are U n F unded O pportunities. In bothcategories, there are a lot of kooks and charlatans – be cautious. Best regards,Ben Rich.”There are several key points here. First, it is noteworthy that the 1983 letterof Dr. Robert Sarbacher to UFO researcher William Steinman was well known tothese two men. In that letter, Sarbacher had spoken explicitly of a UFO crashretrieval program within the U.S. national security and scientific community. Hehad also spoken of what he had heard about the aliens themselves. The letter didnot receive a great deal of publicity; its existence was known to some UFOresearchers, and now – with Rich and Andrews as exhibits A and B – to selectindividuals within the defense community.Then there is the matter of what Rich actually said. “I’m a believer in bothcategories.” A great deal of meaning can be contained within these words. Bysaying he believed in both, Rich was in fact saying he believed in theextraterrestrial presence on Earth. That much is clear. From the head of theworld’s most prestigious aviation division, such belief certainly carries a gooddeal of weight. After all, one can assume that Ben Rich, in the course of hiscareer, had access to individuals of the highest intellectual caliber who inturn had access to some of the most sensitive secrets in the country. He himselfwas one such person, having managed the program to build the F-117 StealthFighter. By 1986, it would be safe to say that Ben Rich would have been in aposition to know as much as anyone in the world on the matter of UFOs.Whether or not he did is another matter. Thus, it is possible that by saying he“believed” in both categories, that he actually did not know, and was stating apersonal position rather than offering certain knowledge. This is possible.However, it is also quite possible – likely, in fact – that Ben Rich would nothave revealed everything he knew on this matter in a simple handwritten note,even to someone who was a personal friend, as John Andrews was. Ben Rich was aCEO of a major defense corporation, a man who even under relaxed and friendlyconditions would always remember who he was, and what he was. Such people chosetheir words carefully.The most provocative part of Rich’s reply is his remark about manmade UFOs being“Un Funded Opportunities.” As to what this meant, two possibilities come tomind. One could be that the program to build UFOs was so secret, so “black,”that all funding would be so deeply hidden as to be “non-existent” – hence theproject would be “unfunded,” so to speak. Such an explanation, however, does noteasily explain the meaning of the word “opportunity.” The other possibility isthat man-made UFOs were derived from the active study of extraterrestrial UFOs,presumably in the form of crash retrievals or other “freebies.” This would infact give a more complete interpretation of the phrase “Un FundedOpportunities.” Ben Rich left the matter ambiguous, though suggestive.Meanwhile, it was in 1986 that the first reports emerged of strange sonic boomscoming from near Los Angeles, going out to Groom Lake, Nevada. In other words,from the area known as Antelope Valley, home to many of America’s leadingaviation and aerospace companies: Lockheed, Northrop, and McDonnell-Douglas.Something new was being flown in the area, and nobody was sure what it was.Suspicion would soon settle on the alleged “Aurora,” a hypersonic replacement tothe venerable, but aging, SR-71 Blackbird, as America’s leading high-speed,high-altitude, reconnaissance aircraft. dcclxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1959990] Indeed, the line between “ours” and “theirs” seemed to be increasinglyproblematic to those people studying the matter of UFOs. Politics and Scandal in late 1986Little UFO activity was reported through the summer and fall of 1986, but thelongstanding Cold War was showing signs of possible breakthrough. On October 11,Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met in Reykjavik, Iceland. Expectations werelow going in, but Gorbachev surprised the Americans by offering comprehensivereductions in strategic arms, intermediate range missiles, and space weapons.Reagan did not have his prepared notes with him; he decided to “wing it.”Secretary of State George Shultz called Gorbachev’s opening position“fundamentally acceptable.” The two sides continued the following morning, andagreed to a complete withdrawal of intermediate range missiles in Europe, aswell as a 50 percent reduction in ballistic missiles (ICBM, SLBM) over fiveyears. After lunch, they continued to surprise each other. Gorbachev suggestedeliminating all strategic nuclear weapons within ten years. The response fromReagan was nothing short of astonishing: why not eliminate all nuclear weaponswithin ten years?One problem remained in the way: Star Wars. Gorbachev called for SDI research tobe limited to “the laboratory,” as under the terms of the 1972 Anti BallisticMissile (ABM) treaty. But here Reagan drew the line with a firm “no.” It isdifficult enough, said Gorbachev, to restrict arms on Earth; it will beimpossible to restrict them in space. With this disagreement, the Reykjaviktalks collapsed. A failure, but a near-great success. Reagan remarked that “thesignificance is that we got as close as we did.” Standard histories of the talksnote that key U.S. allies, such as the U.K. and West Germany, were greatlyrelieved by the failure of Reykjavik. To this, it must be added that enormoussectors of the western defense establishment and the international financialstructure had been feeding off of it for generations.The good will of Reykjavik was dampened by several revelations that came out ofthe Reagan White House during late 1986. In October, a plane flown by CIAoperative Eugene Hasenfus crashed in Nicaragua. Documents recovered by theSandinistas were soon linked to Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North andthe White House. dcclxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1960139] This was partof a secret campaign of intimidation and secret war in Latin America,coordinated from Washington. Much of this was designed to win support for thecontra war in Nicaragua, according to classified documents and interviews withU.S. and foreign officials. Toward the end of 1986, this campaign included aneffort to force Panamanian General Manuel Noriega from power. The reason hadnothing to do with Noriega’s well known (within U.S. intelligence circles)participation in drug trafficking. Rather, it was his refusal to honor apersonal request from U.S. National Security Advisor John Poindexter to increasetraining support for the Contras and assist with planning scenarios for theinvasion of Nicaragua. Thus Noriega, a long-time CIA asset, was actually askedby Poindexter to resign. When he refused, the United States cut off aid toPanama, then leaked damaging classified documents about him to The New YorkTimes and NBC News. Thus began the public chain of events that would culminatein “Operation Just Cause” in 1989. dcclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1960282]Meanwhile, the Iran-Contra scandal unfolded in November 1986. This was thebiggest public scandal of the entire Reagan administration. Money from theillicit sale of weapons to Iran was being channeled to the Nicaraguan Contras.This was Reagan’s first and most important publicity problem. It hurt hiscredibility around the world. Amazing Encounter Over AlaskaOn November 18, 1986, over the frozen Alaskan landscape, one of modern history’smost important UFO events took place. This was the encounter by Japan Air Lines1628, a Paris-Tokyo cargo flight filled with expensive French wine, with whatthe pilot later described as an immense object and two “space ships.” The flightwas in its middle leg, from Iceland to Anchorage, Alaska, having flown by theNorth Pole. In command was Captain Kenju Terauchi, a man with three decades offlying experience, accompanied by a copilot and a flight engineer. The weatherwas clear as the Boeing 747 flew at 35,000 feet over the Beaufort Sea tonorthern Alaska. At 5:11 p.m. local time, while on approach to Fort Yukon,Terauchi and his crew saw unexpected lights to their left and below. They gainedthe distinct impression that the lights were flying along with them. The factthat the lights were below their own altitude ruled out astronomical causes – animportant point that would arise later when skeptics attempted to explain thesighting. dcclxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1960726] Matters became more interesting a few minutes later. With great speed andsuddenness, two objects – “spaceships,” said Terauchi – maneuvered to theairplane’s 11 o’clock position, one positioned above the other, both extremelyclose. The witnesses estimated the distance was not more than 1,000 feet,perhaps as little as 500 feet, nearly directly in front of them. They wererectangular or squarish and were so bright that Terauchi said the inside of thecockpit lit up and that he felt heat. Both objects had a dark stripe acrosstheir center that resembled black charcoal dotted with glowing orange embers.Terauchi estimated their size to be comparable to a DC-8 jet. In other words,fairly large. For three to five minutes, the two objects paced the jet, swayingslightly as they moved through the air, one positioned above the other. Then,abruptly, they rearranged their orientation to side-by-side.Realizing that they were seeing something that was supposed to be impossible,the perturbed pilot and crew radioed Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center(AARTCC) at 5:19 p.m. The flight controller asked them to identify what theywere seeing. They could not do this, but stated the objects had strobing lightsthat were yellow and white. The fact that none of the crew were fluent inEnglish meant that some inaccuracies occurred in their descriptions toAnchorage. Later interviews indicated the actual colors were yellow, amber, andgreen. Communication was further hampered by the apparent radio interferencecaused by the objects: transmissions were garbled and weak during much of theUFO encounter.Then, at 5:23 p.m. the objects very suddenly and quickly moved away. Theyappeared to have moved several miles to the left, toward a long, horizontal,pale light. To Terauchi, it looked as though the light connected to an immenseobject. The aircrew decided to use the on-board radar equipment to search forany nearby objects. “There it was on the screen,” recalled Terauchi: a large,green, round object seven or eight miles away to their left. The crew informedAARTCC, although Anchorage had still not detected any radar anomalies. However,AARTCC did contact the nearby USAF Elmendorf Regional Operational Control Center(ROCC) to learn whether they had tracked anything.At 5:25 p.m., before ROCC could even answer, AARTCC picked up an anomalous radartarget. Although the position was wrong – five miles behind the JAL jet when infact the object was to the left – at least something was being recorded. BruceMaccabee, who later provided an in-depth analysis of this incident, concludedthat the full radar data “indicated that the object was quite large and yetquite a weak reflector.” In other words, it could have been able to reduce itsradar cross section through some form of stealth technology. After all, the U.S.was already employing operational stealth aircraft at this time.Moments later, the ROCC radar controller reported back to AARTCC that he wasobtaining an occasional radar echo without a transponder signal. All commercialaircraft have transponders, which provide a specific signal to air trafficcontrollers. This is distinct from “primary radar,” which traffic controllersalso use to identify aerial objects. There were no military aircraft in thearea, and the ROCC controller wondered if his tracking was erroneous. The AARTCCcontroller told him: “negative, it’s not erroneous.” At 5:26 p.m., both radaroperators were tracking the unknown target eight miles ahead and to the left ofthe JAL flight.A minute later, the object disappeared from all radar. But not visually. JAL1628 was now approaching Fairbanks. At 5:30 p.m., there was enough ambient lightfrom the Moon and possibly from Fairbanks below for Terauchi to see the objectthat had been pacing his airplane. Several miles off to his left, the horizontalpale white lights were still visible, but now he saw something else: “thesilhouette of a gigantic spaceship.” The object was of staggering size. Terauchiestimated its length as being equal to two aircraft carriers. Feeling anoverwhelming need to get away from this object, the crew requested a change ofcourse. The fifteen seconds during which they waited for permission seemed likean eternity. Finally, AARTCC instructed them to turn 40 degrees to the right.The JAL crew executed the turn, only to see the huge object still pacing them.They then received permission to descend to 31,000 feet and turn twelve degreesto the left. The unidentified object also descended and continued to pace thejetliner.This was becoming too much. At 5:36 p.m., Anchorage air traffic instructed theJAL jet to make a full-circle, 360 degree turn. The crew gladly complied. Whileengaging in the turn, they lost sight of the object, and hoped they mightsucceed in escaping from it. Many miles to the south, ROCC radar picked up anunknown target following the plane. Once again, the object gave no transpondersignal, only a primary return. As Terauchi completed his long circular turn, helooked to his left and backwards: the UFO was still there.The JAL jet was running low on excess fuel and needed to get to Anchorage.Meanwhile, a United Airlines passenger jet had left Anchorage and was headingnorth toward Fairbanks at 29,000 feet. AARTCC asked the UA pilot to look for theJAL flight and any accompanying traffic. By 5:48 p.m., the two airliners werefast approaching. At this time, the UFO dropped back from the JAL jet, and waslost from the airplane’s short range radar. By 5:50 p.m., the UA pilot saw theJAL airplane, but no UFO. When the planes passed each other a minute later, theJAL crew could no longer see their mysterious companion.The final half hour of their flight was quiet, and JAL 1628 landed in Anchorageat 6:20 p.m. The crew was interviewed immediately by an FAA official whodescribed them as “shook-up but professional.” Two special agents also werethere. One of them, Special Agent James Derry, wrote that he called a dutyofficer at NORAD, and learned that NORAD had tracked both JAL 1628 and the UFOon radar.For a month afterward, the media was unaware of this case. As Christmasapproached, one of the crew members appears to have leaked the story, and itbroke worldwide on December 29. Terauchi had no hesitation telling anyone whowould listen that the object most likely came from another world. The FAAconfirmed the event and reopened its inquiry into the matter a few days later.Contradictory statements emerged from the FAA. Spokesman Paul Steuckeacknowledged that air traffic controllers tracked something pacing the JAL 007,that the encounter was a “mystery” and “a violation of air space.” But there wasalso “nothing to investigate.” The FAA records were being reconstructed, hesaid, and the alleged uncorrelated echoes could not be found. As for the AirForce, said Steucke, it no longer possessed its radar data but was attributingthe apparent UFO to “clutter.”Steucke referred to the radar signal of the JAL and UFO as a “split image”caused by the FAA primary radar signal and JAL’s transponder. Such things canhappen, although hardly ever in the region of the JAL encounter. Normally, thetransponder signal and the primary signal would be either directly adjacent oroccupying the same spot. Steucke was in fact saying that the primary returnreported by the AARTCC and ROCC controllers was a malfunction of the radar set,causing the two types of signals to separate and look as though they weredistinct objects. Bruce Maccabee pointed out in his detailed analysis that ifthis were true, the extra echo would have come back with every sweep of theradar, which it did not. Steucke also did not mention that three AARTCC trafficcontrollers who were on duty explicitly denied this explanation. They told anAnchorage journalist that, while the radar signal from the UFO was notespecially strong, it was not due to a split radar image. Everyone in thecontrol room believed it was an actual object.On January 22, long before the FAA inquiry was finished, the skepticorganization CSICOP issued a press release announcing that Philip Klass hadsolved the case. In apparent seriousness, Klass argued that the UFO sighting hadbeen the planet Jupiter, and possibly Mars. He suggested that the crew wasunaware of Jupiter’s presence, even though it was very bright that evening.Klass had no access to the radar tracking data, and therefore could not know theprecise locations and various directions of the plane. He ignored how thejetliner’s onboard radar tracked an unknown object. He ignored statements by theother crew members which fully supported Terauchi, in particular about how thetwo objects had appeared in front of the plane. He failed to mention howTerauchi saw a “gigantic spacecraft” behind and to his left, in a directionnearly opposite the planets. Incredibly, he ignored Terauchi’s widely publicizeddrawing of the object, which was as clear as could be. Klass’s fast and sloppyexplanation caused Maccabee to remark, “it appears that the CSICOP press releasewhich was marked For Immediate Release should have been marked For PrematureRelease .” But CSICOP won the public relations battle. The media quicklyaccepted the “explanation” and let the matter drop.A year later, Klass revised his explanation, arguing that the JAL crew wasconfused by reflections of moonlight from the clouds and “turbulent icecrystals.” These thin clouds also caused false radar echoes, argued Klass. Thissecond attempt was a little better than the first embarrassment, although itremained highly speculative. It also failed to address the spectacular nature ofthe two objects that maneuvered in front of the jetliner: their brightness andmaneuverability, the heat that Terauchi felt from them, and their description bythe two other crew members (the co-pilot likened them to the lights of anoncoming aircraft).On March 5, 1987, the FAA announced that it “was unable to confirm the event.”It repeated Paul Steucke’s January statement that the second radar target was a“split radar return” from the JAL jet. No attempt was made to explain the visualsighting – perhaps because CSICOP had already done so, after its own fashion.The story died after this. Captain Terauchi was “grounded” for several years. Itwas primarily through the research of Richard Haines that Terauchi’s reputationwas restored with his employer and he was flying again. Considering such asevere penalty for reporting the event, it is no surprise that pilots so seldomcome forward. One can only wonder how many other dramatic air encounters havetaken place, but are never discussed outside the cockpit.One interesting postscript to this case came in the person of FAA official JohnCallahan, Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch of the FAAin Washington, D.C. Many years later, Callahan revealed that the day after theevent, FAA administrator, Admiral Donald D. Engen, convened a special briefingwhich included the FBI, CIA, a scientific study team from President Reagan, andothers. Evidence in the form of videotaped radar tapes, air traffic voicecommunications, and paper reports were compiled and presented. At the conclusionof this meeting, the attending CIA members instructed everyone present that “themeeting never took place” and “this incident was never recorded.” Theyconfiscated all evidence that was presented, but did not realize there was more.“They never asked anyone if we had copies, so I never told them I did,” saidCallahan, who possessed videotape and audio evidence of the event. The CIA alsoadvised the group that the media would not be informed of this event, as “itwould scare the public.” Years later, Callahan provided testimony of hisinvolvement in this affair, including official memoranda and pilot transcripts,to Steven Greer, which were reprinted in Greer’s book Disclosure . dcclxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1961086] As an aside, it may be worth noting that one week after the JAL 007encounter, a KGB “Blue Folder” UFO incident occurred at roughly the samelatitude, although nearly 2,000 miles away in Eastern Siberia. As with most ofthe Soviet reports, details are lacking, but as the story goes, on the afternoonof November 25, 1986, civil and military personnel in Magadan Airport discoveredan unidentified radar target. Since there was another aircraft flying in thevicinity, air traffic control advised the pilot to be aware of a possibleunknown object in his area. It turned out that “the plane and unknown objectpassed clear of each other,” although no details were given. After this,however, “the object turned right [east] in the direction toward Shelekhov Bay.”Soon it was traveling at 3,000 kph, or roughly 1,800 mph – that is,astonishingly fast. The object flew over water toward Kamchatka until it waslost from the radar screens. It is not clear whether the pilot ever obtained avisual of the UFO. dcclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1962252] The Young InternetA final interesting development in 1986 hinted toward greater things to come.This was the growth of computer-based UFO information services such as ComputerUFO Network (CUFON) and the bulletin board service known as Paranet. CUFON wasoriginally managed by Michael Hart, but was taken over in 1986 by Dale Goudie.Operating out of Mercer Island, Washington, it functioned as a UFO bulletinboard using a voice and data line connected to an IBM XT, an early personalcomputer for the consumer market. CUFON received most of its reports from BobGribble of the National UFO Reporting Center, which in turn received manyreports from airports around the country. By late 1986, according to Goudie,CUFON had over 700 members and was receiving many calls per day. (MUFON membersmade up the largest segment). Most of these were “raw reports” with mundaneexplanations. Still, MUFON members, within the limits of their capabilities, didinvestigate a number of these sightings. dcclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1962488] Paranet started in 1986 as a facet of what was then the heart of the youngInternet: the bulletin board system collectively known as Usenet. Managed byMUFON member James Speiser from 1986 to 1988, Paranet quickly developed into athriving community where a full range of researchers, believers, skeptics, andcranks could “post” their articles. Michael Corbin became administrator in 1988and ran it until the mid-1990s, when the World Wide Web supplanted Usenet as thedominant arena of the Internet. It eventually became evident that computerizedservices like Paranet and CUFON were more than just important new tools forresearchers. They portended changes on an order of magnitude not seen sinceGutenberg invented the printing press five centuries earlier. The InformationHighway was arriving, and UFO researchers were learning how to drive along witheveryone else. The biggest immediate impact was that it dramatically expandedthe number (and types) of people who would be contributing to the field. Ascould be expected, this was a double-edged sword, since opinions are free andhence available to anyone with a mouth (or in this case fingers to type).However, there is no question that the young Internet, even in 1986, wasexpanding the world of ufology, transforming it from a small club to somethingmuch larger and, dare one say, populist. Tracking Fastwalkers at Cheyenne MountainA final, fascinating, UFO event closed 1986, described by New York Timesjournalist Howard Blum. dcclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1962778] This tookplace near the middle of December, at the U.S. Space Command’s SurveillanceCenter inside Colorado’s Cheyenne Mountain, where the thousands of satellitesand miscellaneous space debris in Earth orbit are tracked. Commander SheilaMondran was in charge when sensors detected something tripping the U.S. NavalSpace Surveillance System – known as The Fence. This is a man-made energy fieldthat reaches nearly 15,000 miles into space, and is able to determine the speedand size of any object in its range. The intrusion occurred in the skies aboveLake Kickapoo, Texas.Most such events are not a cause for concern, but this particular object fit noknown category. Commander Mondran’s team tracked its seemingly impossiblemaneuvers, including loops, backtracks, “crash dives,” and astonishingly fastclimbs. Mondran wondered whether the intruder could be an electronicintelligence (ELINT) or anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. She discussed thesepossibilities with her technician, who was doubtful. According to Blum, when sheasked his opinion, he replied, “just between you and me, ma’am,” he replied, “itlooks like we got someone joyriding up there.”Mondran sent a Flash Alert to CINC-NORAD. Such an alert was usually reserved forpotentially dangerous situations, and always ended up on the desk of thePresident. But as suddenly as the object appeared, it then disappeared. Twosearches were immediately ordered: one by the Space Detection and TrackingSystem, which was a worldwide network of radars, telescopes, cameras, andradios. Another was made by a computer linked system of sophisticatedtelescopes. Neither search found anything.The Flash Alert was recalled the following day, but no answers were forthcoming.A summary of the incident was sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well asPresident Reagan for his daily briefing. Essentially, an object had penetratedU.S. air space doing the impossible, then vanished. Blum reported that the UFOstory caught President Reagan’s attention. Without a trace of humor Reaganannounced that he also had once seen a UFO while he was Governor of California.He recommended a follow-up investigation, but none is known to have occurred.According to Blum, the NSA eventually favored the ASAT theory, although no oneunderstood how the Soviets could have made an object move that way. The way itdisappeared also caused some concern that the Soviets might possess stealthtechnology. Still, the obvious, unavoidable question was, “was this an actualUFO?” dcclxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1962998] A So-Called UFO Working GroupBlum wrote that a report about the fastwalker ended up on the desk of a “ColonelHarold Phillips” in the DIA’s Directorate for Management and Operations. Blumrevealed that “Phillips” was also the DIA’s “Associate Coordinator of SpaceReconnaissance Activities.” This was a powerful and sensitive position whichhelped determine missions for the U.S. spy satellites. Blum then described howPhillips organized an interdisciplinary “UFO Working Group” beginning in 1987.It was comprised of scientists and officers from throughout the defense andintelligence community, and worked deep within a secured “vault” within thePentagon. dcclxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1963150] Certain elements of Blum’s narrative were correct. However, the name, timeframe, and numerous other details were wrong. Later investigations by at leastthree researchers (Grant Cameron, Timothy Good, and the author) have correctedand added more detail to what actually occurred, although most of the group’sactivities still remain unknown to the public.The identity of “Harold Phillips” is known to be Colonel John B. Alexander.Alexander was a former Green Beret Commander who participated in the Phoenixprogram during the Vietnam era, searched for Atlantis in the Bimini Islands, wasan official of the Silva Mind Control organization, and a world expert in thefield of non-lethal weapons. He had extensive background and knowledge of remoteviewing as well as acoustic weapons which could embed subliminal messages oraffect a person’s physiology. dcclxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1963301]In forming this group, Alexander sought to avoid undue attention, and certainlynever called it anything as obvious as a “UFO Working Group.” Instead, heselected the more suitably vague title of “Advanced Theoretical Physics Group.”According to one group member who confidentially spoke to the author, the groupmet a total of four times: on May 21-22, 1985, August 6-7, 1985, April 24, 1986,and November 18, 1987. The first three meetings took place at the BDM McLeanSecure Facility in Virginia, and the last at the Pentagon. dcclxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1963602] A memo leakedto Grant Cameron included information about the first meeting (according towhich occurred from May 20 to 25, 1985), and included a partial list ofattendees. Timothy Good later received a complete list of that meeting, whichincluded Robert Wood (McDonnell Douglass), Ronald Blackburn (Air Force andformerly Defense Nuclear Agency), Milt Janzen, Don Keuble (Lockheed Aircraft),Harold Puthoff (head of SRI’s remote viewing program, formerly employed by theNSA), Ed Speakman (Army Intelligence), Howell McConnell (NSA), and BillWilkinson (CIA), and Alexander. dcclxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1963919] According to Good, the group’s research effort appeared to be connected to a“major engineering project” under Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former CIA DeputyDirector, Director of Naval Intelligence, and Director of the NSA. This impliesreverse engineering of alien hardware, although one member of the group told theauthor that such a statement was offered as a speculation, and that thispossibility should be checked. “We had hard data on sightings,” he said, “but nohard data on hardware or reverse engineering.”None of the group’s members has publicly offered much information about itsproceedings. Dr. Robert Wood, who attended two meetings, has perhaps been themost forthcoming. Wood said that although the meetings themselves wereclassified Top Secret, he heard “virtually nothing that was truly classified.”He gave a presentation on UFO propulsion incorporating many ideas of the lateNASA scientist Paul Hill. dcclxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1964196] Other people known to the author to have had some sort of connection to thisgroup were General Alexander Stubblebine, former commander of the ArmyIntelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) where he worked with Alexander, JackHouck (a systems engineer at Boeing with an interest in paranormal phenomena),and remote viewer Ed Dames (who was said to have given a presentation on remoteviewing alien bases on Earth with the suggestion that teams be sent toinvestigate them).Blum also incorrectly described the group’s purpose, which was not insipidly toexplore whether the human race “was alone in the universe,” or even if UFOs wereextraterrestrial. dcclxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1964501] Its aim wasmore pragmatic. Alexander wanted to create a highly qualified study group thatwould obtain the best UFO evidence. He hoped that this in turn would enable himto locate and gain access to actual deep-black programs related to UFOs, orperhaps to provide consultation to such groups. In other words, he and hismembers held an implicit assumption that there was such a group, and they wantedin. The obvious question is, did Alexander succeed?According to Alexander’s public statements, the answer is no. Alexander saidthat he had reached very high levels within Pentagon (e.g. 4 star) and stillfound no evidence of any such program. “I’ve looked,” he told listeners at a UFOconference, “and it’s not there.” dcclxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1964657]The author, however, spoke to several group members who expressed skepticism andeven outright denial about Alexander’s position that there is “no evidence” of ablack UFO program. One of them stated that he had key information about such aninside group. Although he would not or could not pass on any specificinformation, he implied strongly that there was an international ortransnational structure to this group, something beyond the formal or fullcontrol of the U.S. President, or any other part of the official U.S.government.At least two members of the Advanced Theoretical Physics Group belonged toanother, somewhat overlapping group. This was a quiet collection of individualswith backgrounds in intelligence who shared an interest in UFOs and relatedtopics. By the late 1980s, it would become known as “the Aviary.”The AviaryThe Aviary is one of the more romantic pieces of UFO lore, subject to muchspeculation. People have wondered whether it served as a secret UFO controlgroup, or perhaps as a debunking or disinformation source. Others have seen itas a group of interested insiders who sought to navigate their way through thelabyrinth of secrecy. Others still as simply a group of loosely associatedpeople with a mutual interest in the topic.The core of what became the Aviary appears to have been started by retired USAFColonel Ernie Kellerstrauss, who had worked at the Foreign Technology Division(FTD) at Wright-Patterson AFB. In the fall of 1986, Kellerstrauss invited anumber of individuals – Harold Puthoff, John B. Alexander, C. B. Scott Jones,Robert Collins, William Moore, and Jaime Shandera – to his home in Beavercreek,Ohio. Puthoff and Alexander, already discussed, were currently involved in theAdvanced Theoretical Physics Group. Scott Jones was a Ph.D. and former Navyfighter pilot who was an aide to Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI). Collins was anAir Force Captain who, like Kellerstrauss before him, was working atWright-Patterson’s FTD. Moore and Shandera, of course, were UFO researchers,although some people who knew Moore suspected him to be connected with the CIAor perhaps another intelligence organization.In various permutations, this group met from time to time, generally discussingUFOs, the extraterrestrial presence on Earth, and Nevada’s Area 51 (well beforethe area became public knowledge). Kellerstrauss, for one, had a great deal tosay. He had known an Air Force officer named Robert Hippler who, saidKellerstrauss, had been in the “real Project Blue Book.” Kellerstrauss knew ofphysiological studies that had been done on alien bodies during the 1960s. Healso claimed that during the 1970s, the chief scientist at FTD, named AnthonyCacciopo, had a copy of a book which provided the complete covert UFO historyfrom 1947 on. Kellerstrauss also discussed the presence of an alien base nearArea 51, a bit northwest of Groom Lake. People who wandered into the area “neverreturned.” The area was simply off limits, even to U.S. government personnel.dcclxxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1964891] It is not clear that such meetings amounted to anything more than thesharing of stories and theories about what was believed to be going on. Clearly,some of this information could be accurate. Bruce Maccabee, for example,researched the career of Robert Hippler, and determined that what Kellerstrausssaid about Hippler could well have been true. dcclxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1965109] Other stories,such as the alleged alien base, were just that – stories – although one couldargue that Kellerstrauss may have been in a better position than many to havegleaned something about it.By the late 1980s, Moore and Shandera became concerned that their telephoneswere monitored, and so decided to assign a bird name to whomever they talkedabout. This could include any one at all (the President, for instance, wasreferred to as Eagle). Many of these people were associated with the grouparound Kellerstrauss, although this was hardly their primary connection. Some ofthem had professional and personal connections to each other, and most of themhad a background in the world of science or intelligence. While they all shareda strong interest in the subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials, there was also agreat deal of variance among them. Some of them had high level securityclearances, others did not. Many of them disagreed on important issues.By 1988 at the latest, Moore was referring to this collection of “birds” as theAviary. Over time, the bird names have not been consistent, but the names appearto be as follows: Kellerstrauss was Hawk, Puthoff was Partridge, Jones wasHummingbird, Alexander was Chickadee, Collins was Condor. Other men had alsobecome avians: Christopher (Kit) Green, a senior CIA officer with access to theAgency’s UFO material – the so-called Weird Desk – was Blue Jay. Dale Graff,formerly of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was Owl, Air Force OSI AgentRichard Doty became the surrogate Falcon when the “real” Falcon was unavailableor dropped out.Some of these people had substantial interest and some leverage within elitecircles. One, known only as “Raven,” appears to have been the most powerful ofall, and within a few years would be connected to an alleged abortive disclosureof UFO reality. But the Aviary did not have any formal status among its“members.” We can best understand it as a loose association of friends andassociates, often with different assessments and attitudes concerning UFOs,given a name by Moore for reasons of convenience and security. SummaryThe middle of the 1980s were something of a holding pattern for ufology. Noquestion, there were interesting events, both in research and sightings. Withinthe U.S. intelligence apparatus, circumstantial evidence points to thelikelihood that some effort was made to cause confusion in the ranks, inparticular regarding the case of researcher William Moore. However, Moore wasriding high at this time, widely respected as one of ufology’s top researchersand perhaps the best hope at ending the cover-up. Perhaps Moore himself believedthis, as he often indicated. If so, it looks as though he was handed a falsebill of goods, unless of course his involvement went deeper than this.This holding pattern was now about to end quite dramatically. The year 1987would prove to be the most important year in UFO research in decades, perhapsever. The repercussions from these research developments would make a permanentimpression on popular culture, as well.

A World About to ChangeThroughout the 1970s and most of the 1980s, the world of UFO research evolved ata steady pace. Slowly but surely the idea of “scientific ufology” had taken holdamong researchers and become a desired goal among the major UFO organizationsnot only in America, but around the world. Of course, budgets and means remainedlimited, but the goal was there. Within this environment, new issues likeabductions, cattle mutilations, and crop circles had intruded, to say nothing ofFOIA documents, black helicopters, and ever-increasing leaks from the blackworld. Dissension was the rule rather than the exception, but the debates tookplace within the relatively limited confines of UFO journals and conferences.The MUFON UFO Journal , for instance, had a circulation of less than 1,500copies per month throughout most of the decade.But things were about to change – computers were about to take over the world.The nascent information highway reached ufology before it reached most otherfields. By early 1986, a bulletin board system (BBS) was dedicated to UFOs andrelated topics. ParaNet, founded by Jim Speiser, rapidly gained a following –and more importantly, participants – opening the field to a much larger public.At the same time, the MJ-12 and abduction controversies broke open intoextensive public discussion. Within a few short years, UFO research would betransformed. Redefining UfologyOn February 16, 1987, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev made his own commentson a hypothetical alien threat. At a conference at the Grand Kremlin Palace inMoscow, he referred to Ronald Reagan’s statement in Geneva, that if Earth facedan invasion by extraterrestrials, the U.S. and the Soviet Union would joinforces. “I shall not dispute the hypothesis,” said Gorbachev, “although I thinkit’s early yet to worry about such an intrusion. It is much more important tothink about the problems that have entered in our common home.” dcclxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1965408] Perhaps Gorbachev did not take an alien threat seriously; perhaps hedid. The American general public did, at least according to a 1987 Gallup Poll.Forty-nine percent of respondents believed UFOs were extraterrestrial craftpiloted by aliens, and nine percent claimed to have seen a UFO. One third deniedthe existence of UFOs. In general, these numbers were the same as those from adecade earlier. dccxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1965611] But in 1987, Ufology was about to undergo challenges so profound thatcollectively they amounted to a revolution. Within a few short years, attitudesof researchers and the general public alike would be transformed. Gone were thedays of speculating whether UFOs were alien spacecraft here studying the Earthin preparation either to invade or help – a common theme from earlier years. Nowa sense of darkness, urgency, and even fear became almost palpable. Claimscentered on a long-term relationship between “us” and “them.” A deal, so tospeak. In this new scenario, the “visitors” were here for the long term, andelements of the U.S. government, perhaps a shadow government, were complicit.Researchers were beginning to believe that abductions were taking place on ascale never before contemplated. Some argued that, in return, technology wasmade available to human scientists working in the black world. Meanwhile, thegreat mass of humanity were mere pawns, “sold out” by their human masters andused by the aliens for their genetic material and who knew what else. AbductionsFebruary 1987 saw the near simultaneous publication of two of the mostinfluential books on alien abduction that ever appeared: Whitley Strieber’sCommunion and Budd Hopkins’ Intruders . Both superbly written, they handled thesubject with a depth and immediacy that, to many students of the field,represented a leap forward in understanding the beings operating UFOs.Acceptance of alien abductions had developed slowly. During the 1950s and 1960s,most researchers flatly rejected claims that anyone had interacted with actualoccupants of UFOs. It was as if the idea of alien spacecraft was strange enough,and the limits of belief had not yet grown to accommodate anything more. Intime, this changed. Cases like the 1961 Hill abduction led researchers to admitthat occasional interaction with (and abduction by) aliens did occur. Averitable explosion of alien abduction cases appeared during the 1970s. In 1979,the publication of The Andreasson Affair by Raymond Fowler introduced the ideaof alien implants, and Budd Hopkins’s Missing Time the following year argued thephenomenon was much more widespread than had even been suspected.Now, with Intruders in 1987, Hopkins went further, describing the experiences ofa family who encountered ongoing intervention by alien entities, entailing asophisticated program of genetic experimentation involving sperm extraction andartificial insemination. To accomplish such a program, an incredible logisticsoperations involving the monitoring of abductees, in some cases since childhood,was called for.Kathie Davis had written to Hopkins in 1983 after reading Missing Time . Duringone early evening in July 1983, she and her mother saw a light about two feet indiameter moving around the family pool house. Some days later they noticed asection of their backyard had turned brown, a circular area about eight feet indiameter. Hopkins spoke with Kathie and her family, and uncovered a pattern ofstrange events which had affected them for years. It appeared that Kathie, hermother, and two of her children were abducted at different points in theirlives. Kathie and her mother had identical scars on their lower legs fromapparent childhood abductions, and Hopkins believed that Kathie and her sonTommy had implants inserted near their brains, one through the nasal cavity andthe other through the ear.During hypnotic regression with Hopkins, Kathie revealed that her firstpregnancy occurred in 1977, when she had a UFO sighting. Her doctor was curiouswhen he later found her to be no longer pregnant. “Somebody took my baby,” shetold Hopkins. Hopkins described other accounts of abductees experiencingpregnancy while still virgins, then having the fetuses taken from them in laterabductions. Several women remembered being shown infants aboard the alien craftand being made to feel that they were their offspring. Hopkins concluded that“abductions represent a genetically focused study of particular bloodlines,” andthat “the human species itself is the subject of a breeding experiment.” dccxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1965766] Hopkins consistently emphasized the physical nature of the abductionphenomenon. He cited a “mass of evidence supporting the view that something isgoing on.” Elements within reports, such as bodily marks or scars, werereplicated from case to case to case. The marks, he said, were entirelyconsistent and were usually either a straight cut or scoop mark – a kind ofdepression in the skin. “These two patterns turn up over and over again.” Heshowed the marks to physicians who replied that they looked artificial, perhapssuggesting surgery. dccxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1965931] This was notsome fantasy out of a deluded person’s mind, but tangible evidence.In general, UFO researchers were deeply impressed by Hopkins’ work. Skeptics,however, saw him as a dangerous man: a brilliant and persuasive writer whohappened to be wrong. Probably the most severe criticism leveled at him was thathe was not a qualified hypnotherapist or medical professional and was actuallydoing harm to people who had suffered real trauma of some sort – not alienabductions. dccxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1966154] Hopkinsreadily rebuffed such criticisms. He pointed out that in a number of the caseshe investigated, the hypnotic regressions were performed by a licensedpsychiatrist. In any case, his own ability to perform regression was neverquestioned by professionals who observed his work. He pointed out (in 1988) thattwo psychiatrists, four psychologists and 11 psychotherapists had come to himfor hypnosis to help them recall the missing pieces of their own abductionexperiences. He had inserted specific protocols so as not to elicit “favored”responses, and maintained that at all times his overriding concern was to helpthe person experiencing the trauma. It so happened that time and again theindividual under regression would spontaneously recall the classic indicators ofalien abduction. Moreover, he added, hypnosis was not responsible for allabduction claims: roughly a quarter of the cases he worked on involved consciousrecall by the percipient of his or her experience. dccxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1966348] Yet, many skeptics failed to be convinced. Small body marks hardly impressedthem. They doubted the existence of implants – none of which had been recovered,or else had vanished before analysis. And where were the reliable, independentobservations of any abduction? Most likely, they hypothesized, there was somefactor in the background of alleged abductees that caused them to go intosomething like an altered state of consciousness under hypnosis. Under such astate one could create an abduction story – and then sincerely believe it to betrue. Presumably these would have been the result of some prior, non-alienrelated, traumatic experience. To such skeptics, the idea of the “fantasy pronepersonality” seemed best to explain the phenomenon.The concept was fairly new in psychiatry. A small but significant percentage ofthe population – experts said about four percent – fit the fantasy proneprofile. Such people typically made excellent hypnotic subjects. As children,they lived in make-believe worlds, replete with fairies and other airycreatures, but learned to become secretive about their fantasy life. As adults,they tended to spend a great deal of time fantasizing. They usually had vividdreams, regarded themselves as psychic in some fashion, and were more likelythan the average person to have an out-of-body experience or see apparitions.Yet, in every other respect, they were socially aware, normal, and healthyindividuals. dccxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1966557] The problem with this hypothesis was that, in 1987, no work had beendone to see whether abductions actually happened to such individuals. Hopkinsfor his part called the theory “plainly wrong.” The vast majority of UFOabductees, he said, including many who had been psychologically tested, were notfantasy-prone individuals. dccxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1966819] There is another issue concerning the “fantasy-prone personality” idea.Its creators clearly adhered to a distinctively materialistic conception ofreality. To such a mind, anyone who was inclined toward psychic interests, orwho claimed to experience other dimensions of reality, or who claimed to seeotherworldly beings, was someone who lived in a “fantasy.” But what if the shoe,so to speak, were on the other foot? In other words, what if it was true thatpeople who fit the “fantasy-prone” profile were more likely to have experienceswith these other beings – but not because they were prone to fantasy? Instead,what if the reason was because their inherent sensitivity to other realms ofexistence made them more likely? What if the presumed extraterrestrials hadpsychic or telepathic capabilities that made them more interested in suchpeople? If one substituted the phrase “fantasy-prone personality” with“psychically sensitive personality,” the characteristics described in the typewould still fit, but would give a very different coloration to the matter. Afterall, members of the U.S. military and intelligence community had been usingremote viewers for quite some time, readily accepting that at least certainhuman beings possessed apparently powerful psychic gifts. This was apossibility, however, firmly outside the parameters of acceptable science andmuch of ufology in 1987.Intruders made a major impact on UFO research and also sold well. Communion ,however, became the number one best-selling paperback in the United Statesduring its first three months of listing by the New York Times , and formillions of individuals became the first UFO-related book they ever read. Italso boasted the most famous cover a UFO book ever had, a captivating portraitof an alien face by artist Ted Jacobs.Whitley Strieber’s account of his abduction experiences was personal, intense,and disturbing. On a night in December 1985, while resting in bed in his upstateNew York cabin, he awoke to a strange whooshing sound which seemed to be comingfrom downstairs. His burglar alarm panel, situated near his bed, showed nodisturbances. His bedroom door opened, and a small figure quickly approachedhim. Strieber made out two dark eyes, a rounded hat of some sort, and a squareplate on its chest. He was paralyzed and floated naked out of the room. Outsidein the woods, he drifted up to a room where small beings moved quickly allaround him. He noticed four types of beings: a small robotlike creature, a groupof short, stocky beings in dark blue overalls, a slender being about five feettall with black slanted eyes, and several smaller beings with round black eyes.One took out a hair-thin needle; telepathically, Strieber was told it would beinserted into his brain. When he began screaming, another being, whom he sensedwas female, asked him telepathically, “what can we do to help you stopscreaming?” He replied, “you could let me smell you.” One of the beings put ahand against Strieber’s face. It smelled like cardboard, and this helped giveStrieber “an anchor in reality.” An operation was performed on Strieber’s head.His legs were separated and a long object was inserted up his rectum, which hethought was to take a sample. Although he felt no pain, he felt violated andfurious. A painless incision was also made on his forefinger. That appeared tobe the end of the procedure.Strieber awoke the next morning not remembering his abduction, but feelinguneasy. All he could remember from that night was the image of a barn owlstaring at him through the bedroom window. His right forefinger became infectedand he felt rectal pain every time he sat. After he mentioned pain behind oneear, his wife noticed a tiny scab there. Then, one day, he suddenly recalled asmell, and the memories flooded back to him.Strieber had heard of Budd Hopkins and contacted him. The two soon met. Whiletalking, Strieber recalled another possibly odd encounter at the cabin fromOctober 1985. At Hopkins’ recommendation, Strieber hired Dr. Donald Klein of theNew York State Psychiatric Institute to perform hypnotic regression. WithHopkins present, these sessions began in March 1986, and Strieber’s memoriespoured forth. From the October encounter, Strieber remembered a short, hairlessbeing with large slanted eyes standing over his bed. When the being touched hisforehead with a silver tipped rod, Strieber saw a series of disturbing images ofthe world exploding and of his son dying. The being then raised the wand andcaused a bang, waking everyone in the house. From the December encounter, heremembered telling the aliens they had no right to abduct him; they replied that“we do have a right,” and “you are our chosen one.” From further sessions,Strieber developed the belief that he had been abducted as a child.Strieber continued to have strange experiences during 1986, at one point findingtwo small triangles inscribed on his forearm. He came to believe that theabduction experience had its “symbolic center in the number three and thetriangular shape.” The visitors often appeared in threes, they wore triangularemblems, and triangular marks often appeared on abductees.Strieber was already an accomplished novelist before he wrote of his abductionexperiences. As such, he was aware of the power of the human imagination.Although he believed his experiences were objectively “real,” he could not statewith certainty that the visitors existed independently of their observers.dccxcvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1966999]Others wondered if Strieber the novelist was simply spinning a good yarn.Skeptics argued that the story was either an outright hoax, or “a classic,textbook description of a hypnopompic hallucination” (e.g. “waking dream”) froma fantasy-prone personality. dccxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1967182]San Antonio journalist Ed Conroy was one of those initially skeptical ofStrieber’s story. Conroy interviewed Streiber and many others who knew him. Tohis surprise, Conroy himself began to have experiences in 1987 and 1988 similarto those reported by Strieber. These coincided with strange helicopter flybysover his office, noticed by several of his neighbors and even Strieber’s ownfamily on one occasion. Conroy observed that several people close to him alsobegan to report nighttime experiences with entities, balls of light, and otherstrange phenomena. He began to believe that a “social element” accompanied thevisitor experience – one person’s experience being a catalyst for that of others– and that the abduction phenomenon had a direct link somehow with humanconsciousness. dccxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1967440]During the spring of 1987, Streiber and Hopkins were both busy responding to themedia and writing articles for publication. dccc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1967611] Meanwhile,others continued to perform abduction research. One was Thomas Bullard, aresearcher with a Ph.D. and expertise in folklore. Bullard, more cautious thanHopkins or Strieber, noted the great similarities within hundreds of abductioncases over many years, from many countries, and by witnesses from all walks oflife. While he believed no certain final answer was possible, three solutionscame to mind. One, that abduction reports were essentially real experiences.Two, that they told of a purely subjective, mental experience, no less vividthan real events and believed by the witness. Or third, “abduction reportssimply tell a story.” That is, people learn what an abduction ought to be likefrom someone else’s story, and then repeat it with a few modifications of theirown. For Bullard, “a final verdict disappears miragelike whichever way weapproach the evidence.” One problem that plagued Bullard was, if abductions werereal, why did they share so much in common with religion, mythology andfolklore? The only solution: more research. dccci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1967979] Indeed, Bullard himself soon undertook a large scale comparativeanalysis of all known abduction narratives. He concluded there was a “sharpdistinction between real and imaginary ones.” In other words, those purportingto be real were consistent and coherent; not so with the known imaginary cases.At the same time, the first experimental test of the Fantasy-Prone Personality(FPP) thesis was conducted by Dr. Kenneth Ring, a psychologist at the Universityof Connecticut. He found no discernable psychological differences betweenindividuals who reported having UFO close-encounters and a control group ofnon-UFO witnesses. In other words, there was no evidence that a so-calledfantasy-prone personality contributed either to seeing a UFO or believing onehad an abduction experience. dcccii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1968184] Nevertheless, Ring saw abductions as something much stranger thanstrictly physical phenomena. He likened abductions to what he termed “imaginal”experiences. The word sounds pejorative, but Ring did not mean that theexperiences did not occur. Rather, he hypothesized the existence of an “imaginalrealm” as an intermediate place between mind and matter, or the source of“border phenomena” that “seem at once to partake of otherworldly and objectiverealities.” Like stigmata – a physical effect that has been reliably witnessedwith no discernable physical cause – many UFO and abduction encounters alsoexpressed “the curious and disturbing blending of the seemingly objective withthe bizarre and absurd.” Those who had been labeled “fantasy-prone” were verylikely accessing this reality, and Ring likened them more to visionaries thanschizophrenics. As other folklorists have sometimes done, Ring argued that theimaginal realm is a self-existent world, accessible through altered states ofconsciousness. Real beings live there, with the ability to interact with theeveryday material world “in ways that defy rational understanding.” Ringsuggested that researchers jettison their “outworn Cartesian habits of thought”and stop searching for aliens out in the galaxy. Not surprisingly, he came underwidespread criticism from many abduction and UFO researchers, but simply repliedthat they must one day “deliteralize” him. dccciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1968634] As to whereexactly this imaginal space was located, presumably the answer would lie inother “dimensions” of existence, perhaps explainable by contemporary theories inphysics.Matters became stranger still within a few years with the publication (in 1990)of Raymond Fowler’s The Watchers . Fowler had already written two books on thecase of Betty Andreasson Luca, a landmark in UFO abduction investigations. Asmentioned previously, this investigation introduced the idea of the “alienimplant,” and was also one of the earliest investigated cases of a life-long“repeater,” that is someone with abduction experiences throughout his or herlife. There seemed to be no question about the honesty of the witness, and theonly way to dismiss her detailed descriptions of alien beings, examinations, andexperiments would be as a possible confabulation. A close reading of her case,however, makes this a very difficult argument. A new twist in The Watchers weredescriptions of being out of her body during many of these experiences. Inaddition to encountering the short, grey aliens that others had described, Bettyhad out-of-body experiences (OBE) during which she sometimes encounteredentirely human-looking beings that were tall, blonde, blue eyed, and white robed– very much like the typical descriptions of “nordic” alien beings. They wereapparently in charge of the other aliens. It appeared to Betty that the humanrace was being “watched” by these beings, who (as they told her) foresaw seriousproblems in the future regarding the survivability of the human species and hadtherefore been collecting an enormous repository of genetic material for thefuture. dccciv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1968862]Abductions were becoming strange indeed when they did not always appear toinvolve the physical body. Needless to say, this was a controversial position,but supported by Fowler’s careful and even cautious investigation, the detailand consistency of the material uncovered, and the character of the witnessherself, a conscientious and intelligent percipient. Cracks in the Secret WorldBy 1987, it was reported that the Pentagon had a “black budget” which managedclassified projects, the sum total of which was larger than the federal budgetfor Education, Transportation, Agriculture, or the Environment. Programs withinthe black budget were classified above Top Secret, and few, if any, federalinvestigators had the security clearances to audit them. In February, journalistTim Weiner estimated its size at $35 billion, or eleven percent of the totalPentagon budget, and three times the total it was believed to have been in 1981.The Pentagon maintained that expenses were still overseen by members of theHouse and Senate Armed Services Committees. This may have been true in sometechnical, legalistic, sense. In practice, oversight did not appear to berigorous. dcccv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1969071] The black budget had existed for a long time. That it was finally beingreported was a sign that cracks were appearing in the wall of secrecy that haddominated the Reagan White House. In April 1987, Knight-Ridder newspapers ranheadline accounts of a secret meeting in early October 1980 between an emissaryof Iran’s Khomeini government and Richard V. Allen, who had been the chiefforeign policy adviser of the Reagan-Bush Presidential Campaign. At thismeeting, a deal was allegedly discussed to hold the American hostages untilafter the election, an act that would thereby ensure the defeat of incumbentJimmy Carter. That Reagan’s people were meeting with Iranian emissaries at thattime would be not simply illegal, but politically explosive, a deliberateundermining of the elected U.S. government – aside from toying with the hostageswhose lives were in jeopardy. The stonewalling and obfuscation by the WhiteHouse ultimately saved the day from legal reprisals, but like the O.J. Simpsontrial of the 1990s, it left the distinct impression that the guilty party gotaway with the crime. The available evidence suggests that the ReaganAdministration shipped arms to Iran, both through Israel and directly, from 1981until 1987, as payment for Iranian cooperation on that matter, and probably dueto Iranian blackmail as well. dcccvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1969338]Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress was conducting unprecedented investigations intothe relationship between the CIA and drug traffickers. In April 1986, SenatorsJohn Kerry (D-MA) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) proposed that hearings beconducted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding charges of Contrainvolvement in cocaine and marijuana trafficking. The Contras were theright-wing rebels in Nicaragua who opposed the Marxist Sandinista government.Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-IN) chairman of the committee, agreed to conduct thehearings. Meanwhile, Kerry’s staff began its own investigation, which took ayear and involved interviews with many witnesses.By 1987, the subcommittee had amassed a mountain of evidence indicating that Lt.Colonel Oliver North and other members of the Reagan administration had set up aprivate network involving the National Security Council (NSC) and the CIA todeliver military equipment to the Contras. Not only had none of this beenauthorized by Congress, but much of the funding came from drug trafficking. Thetestimony of DEA agents such as Celerino Castillo and Michael Levine made thisclear enough. From 1985 to 1987, when Castillo ran anti-drug operations in ElSalvador, he discovered that the Contras were transporting cocaine through ElSalvador’s Ilopango airport. Castillo tried to bust the operation, butdiscovered the traffickers were protected by the CIA. He came to realize “howhopelessly tangled DEA, the CIA, and every other U.S. entity in Central Americahad become with the criminals.” Castillo was himself subjected to an internalinvestigation, and his career ended. Levine also worked in Central America andechoed these sentiments. “I watched the CIA protect drug traffickers throughoutmy career as a DEA agent,” he said. “I have put thousands of Americans away fortens of thousands of years for conspiracy with less evidence than is availableagainst Ollie North and CIA people.” The subcommittee learned that money waseven laundered through the U. S. State Department for Contra drug traffickers –in some cases after the traffickers had been indicted by federal law enforcementagencies on drug charges. dcccvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1969607]The news media consistently buried the results of these investigations. A July22, 1987 issue of the Washington Post actually ran a headline stating “HillPanel Finds No Evidence Linking Contras to Drug Smuggling.” In truth, theopposite conclusion had been reached. Committee member Charles Rangel (D-NY)informed the newspaper of this fact, but the Post refused to publish his letter.Not surprisingly, the combined House and Senate Iran-Contra hearings later in1987 also ignored the drug issue. Instead, investigators granted immunity toOliver North. dcccviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1969914]"},{"pageContent":" Another problem was beginning to leak in 1987. This was the corruptionand drug smuggling of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Noriega had been oncontract to the CIA since 1967, so insiders had long known he was rotten to thecore. dcccix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1970140]The problem was that, by the mid-1980s, his brutality had become transparent,and his criminality impossible to hide. Despite becoming a liability, Noriegacontinued to retain U.S. government support throughout 1987, while spurningbribes to retire. When it became clear that he would not leave quietly, theWhite House began demonizing him in 1988 (as it would soon do to SaddamHussein). dcccx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1970312] The specific reasons for these leaks were varied, but generally speakingthey were part of a simple backlash. By 1987, Ronald Reagan was in the secondhalf of his final term as President. Insiders had long known about illegaloperations that had been going on under the umbrella of his administration;there are always such open secrets in Washington, not to be publicly discussed.But in all U.S. presidencies, unspoken agreements seem to break down once theend is in sight. Preventing the leaks is impossible; the trick is in damagecontrol, and this was accomplished reasonably well. The Washington Post , by thenature of its coverage at this time, clearly relished its role as Defender ofOrthodoxy. Leaking MJ-12William Moore, Jaime Shandera, and Stanton Friedman had been holding the MJ-12documents for more than two years. They had brought a limited number of otherresearchers into the secret, but Moore still hesitated about releasing thedocuments. Decades later, certain details still remain unclear, but it appearsthat Moore was receiving pressure from Richard Doty to release them. When hefailed to do this, Doty took other measures.The stories of British researchers Timothy Good and Jenny Randles becomesignificant here. In late 1986 and early 1987, both were working on UFOconspiracy books, knowledge of which was fairly well known in the UFO field.During that period, they both received leaked information directly relevant toMJ-12.Good received the MJ-12 documents in early 1987 – the same ones Moore andShandera had received. How exactly this happened has long been a matter ofspeculation, as Good for many years has not revealed the exact source. dcccxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1970621] In July 1987,he told Jenny Randles that he felt the source “was probably the same” as thesource that sent the file to Jamie Shandera. dcccxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1970933] In his 2006book, Need to Know , he stated the source was “American.” dcccxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1971131] Incommunication with the author, Good confirmed that the source, while not RichardDoty himself, was probably connected to Doty. dcccxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1971354] This shouldnot surprise researchers who have looked into the matter, but until Goodexplicitly reveals his source, this is all conjecture.More dramatic was an encounter by Jenny Randles during late 1986 over mattersclosely related to MJ-12. On October 28, 1986, she received a phone call from aBritish military man who refused to give his name or phone number. He said hiscommanding officer had given him Randles’ phone number and suggested she mightwant what he had – about 600 pages of UFO-related reports which had come intohis possession. One document appeared to be a report from 1948 which used theterm ‘befabs’ to describe “beings from alien objects.” Another file, fromWright-Patterson AFB in 1977, was titled “Elimination of Non-Military Sources.”Randles was suspicious yet intrigued. The two spoke again on the 30th and agreedto meet at a local pub. Randles got his consent for her to bring along a friend,a UFO researcher named Peter Hough. When the two researchers met theirinformant, they were surprised that he was in his late twenties. Nevertheless,this young man (Randles gave him the pseudonym, “John”) was impressive. Indetail, he told them how he had came to possess the files.“John” said he had been in a branch of the Royal Army Corps until he left inFebruary 1985. In 1983, his commanding officer spent time on assignment in theUnited States and had befriended a USAF officer at Wright-Patterson AFB. TheAmerican officer was a computer technician who accidentally tapped into UFOfiles. He copied many of the files, but was soon arrested for being in a securearea without permission. During interrogation, the American officer withheld theinformation that he still had copies of these files. Then, somehow, he told hisBritish officer-friend where the files were, and asked him to get them out ofthe country. A few days later, while on remand, this American officer died in acar crash – the death certificate put down the cause as “intoxication.” TheBritish officer (John’s commanding officer) returned to the U.K. with the files,and for a long time did nothing with them.John noticed that occasionally his commanding officer would discuss UFOs withhis men, picking out those in whom he saw a reaction and speaking with them inprivate. John had no idea why. In his own conversations with his commandingofficer, John felt as though he was being tested. For two years, John was shownreports that had been submitted to the British Ministry of Defence, as well as aphoto of a daylight disc that had come from the U.S. Air Force. In 1985, he leftactive duty to become a civilian.A year later, in August 1986, John returned for a weekend reservist trainingcamp. At that time, his commanding officer told him of the UFO files and gavehim a key to where they were stored. Take them and read them, his commandingofficer said, and if you have a good feeling after talking to Jenny Randles, youcan give her the files. The files looked dusty and unimpressive, and since Johnknew little of UFOs, he merely flipped through them. However, the day before hismeeting with Randles, he decided to take the time to study them more carefully.It was then that he appreciated their explosive content. He began to fear forhis family, and was glad to get the documents off his hands.Randles and Hough asked many questions, and seemed to be satisfied with theextensive answers John gave to them. “Never once did he strike us as evasive ordishonest,” she later wrote. Neither researcher saw an obvious motive for ahoax. Still, they pointed out that they had to satisfy themselves this was not aset-up. Perhaps he was an “innocent messenger boy,” unaware of the bogus natureof his material. John doubted this, and the researchers agreed the materialmight be genuine. But they made it clear that they did not want to look likefools. The meeting ended with an agreement for John to deliver the files thenext time they met. For a long while afterward, Randles and Hough sat in thecar, shaking their heads and saying, “my god – if he’s telling the truth....”A meeting was planned for eight days later. On the appointed day, Randles andHough arrived and waited. Several hours went by, but John never appeared.Some days later, John sent a letter to Randles. He claimed that two days aftertheir meeting in the pub, “events took a dramatic turn.” He had been invited tohis home base “to assist in an internal investigation.” He said this involvedthe use of force, and he was “urged” to remain on base for several days whilethe investigation was completed. He was interrogated about “sensitive” documents(whose nature was never discussed) and told these were “the creation of aneducated prankster” to which “no credence could be attributed.” He was finallyreleased and told it was in his own interest that no mention be made of thedocuments. He apparently told this to Randles in order to “spread around enoughinformation to insure that nothing can or will happen to me or my family withoutsuspicions being aroused.” He apologized for letting her down. She never heardfrom him again.Randles never believed this was a simple prank in which, for instance, thehoaxer got cold feet at the last minute. She believed “John” had indeed been inthe British miliary, just as he claimed, and that there were indeed documents ashe described. Whether these documents were genuine or disinformation, this wouldindicate the British military was involved. If genuine, the implications arethat the military was dealing with an extraterrestrial presence on Earth and wasperpetrating a massive cover-up. If disinformation, the question arises: whycreate disinformation, unless the topic warranted it?Randles acknowledged the possibility that John’s story was true. Still, she alsoentertained the theory that the affair was “a plot to try to dupe me intopromoting a dubious tale via my book.” If so, it was aborted, and she left theaccount out of her next book, The UFO Conspiracy. It was only after the MJ-12documents were made public that she told it. dcccxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1971578] The MJ-12 Affair BreaksAs Good’s research opus Above Top Secret was due to appear in Britain during thesummer of 1987, it became clear to Moore that he was in danger of being“scooped” on the MJ-12 issue. Thus, in the spring of 1987, Moore began to talk.He mentioned that for the past six and a half years, he and a few closeassociates had “succeeded in establishing a cooperative relationship with anumber of well-placed contacts within the American intelligence community.” Heprovided a copy of one page of the MJ-12 documents. In this version, some textwas blacked out in the typical FOIA style. dcccxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1971775] Shortlythereafter he wrote another article on Majestic 12. This time he includedphotocopies of all pages of documents. Now, however, certain areas that had beenformerly blacked out were readable, although some blacked out segments continuedto exist – unlike the completely clean copy printed shortly later by Good.dcccxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1971957] Whywere there different versions of these documents? The answer turned out to besimple: Moore deliberately blacked out sections of the document in order to holdcertain data back. In the event that the document was leaked elsewhere (as infact it was), one could compare versions. dcccxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1972134] Moore alsorevealed another document at this time, known as the Cutler-Twining memo. Thishad been found in the U.S. National Archives through the combined efforts ofMoore, Stanton Friedman, and Jaime Shandera. Dated July 14, 1954, it was aone-page memorandum from Robert Cutler, Special Assistant to PresidentEisenhower, and was directed to Air Force General Nathan Twining. Its subjectline was “NCS/MJ-12 Special Studies Project,” and referred to a briefing thatwas to take place on July 16. The memo did not identify MJ-12 or the reason forthe briefing.On June 11, 1987, Moore, Friedman, and Shandera held a press conference on theMJ-12 documents and the Cutler-Twining memo. Acknowledging that they were not ina position to endorse the authenticity of the documents, they neverthelessclaimed the documents appeared to be genuine. Friedman, for instance, found thatEisenhower did attend a briefing in Washington on November 18, 1952 – the datelisted on the “Eisenhower Briefing Document.” Also, his research on DonaldMenzel was a true eye-opener. Friedman had managed to obtain permission fromMenzel’s widow to visit his archives at Harvard University. He discovered that,unknown to anybody – including Menzel’s widow – the astronomer lived a doublelife. The first was his public life as a world famous astronomer and UFOdebunker. The second was as a leading cryptographer and elite member of the U.S.intelligence community. Menzel had high clearances and met regularly with theleadership of the NSA, CIA, and other intelligence organizations. It was notsimply a case of Menzel working for the national security community, as so manyscientists have done; Menzel was a leading light within that community. TheMJ-12 documents had therefore provided Friedman with a fruitful lead. If theywere a hoax, how could the authors have known about Menzel’s secret life? Was itsimply a lucky guess? dcccxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1972315] With the documents now in the public realm, the debates began. Moore andPhilip Klass appeared on a June 24 Nightline episode with Ted Koppel, then Moorespoke two days later at the MUFON symposium in Washington, D.C. One of the mostprominent early points of contention were the claims about Menzel. Menzel’sclosest living friend was Dr. Ernest H. Taves, who happened to be a member ofCSICOP. Taves strenuously denied that Menzel lived a double life or was involvedin a UFO cover-up. He did, however, provide a strange defense for his oldfriend. “If an alien spaceship had crashed,” Taves said,Donald would certainly have been one of the first to be called to participate inan investigation. He would have welcomed this with the greatest enthusiasm. Ifnational security were involved – which some might have thought to be the casefor several months or a year or so – Donald would have gone along with that. Butas it became clear – as indeed it has, over the years – that if this incidenthad happened it had no bearing upon national security, he would have been unableto continue to participate in a misguided and unnecessary cover-up.The flawed logic is not hard to see. Taves acknowledged that Menzel would havebeen an excellent choice for an MJ-12 group, but would have balked at thesecrecy. How Taves concluded this is a mystery. The MJ-12 documents explicitlyclaimed that the reason for the secrecy was the crash of several alien UFOs.Rather than imply that such events were irrelevant to national security, Tavesbrushed them aside. His concept of national security was startlingly naive,apparently assuming that people in the classified world could reveal secretswithout serious repercussions. dcccxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1972575] The U.S. National Archives wasted no time in disclaiming the documents.On July 22, a spokesperson said that after extensive searches among its holdingsfor the USAF, the JCS, and the NSC records of the Truman and Eisenhoweradministrations, they found nothing to support the existence of an MJ-12 group.The lone exception was the Cutler-Twining memo, but the spokesperson offered a10-point argument citing problems with the document. He concluded that simplybecause the National Archives maintains custody of a document, it could not“authenticate documents or the information contained in a document.” One wondersif this argument had ever been offered for any other document that came from theU.S. National Archives. Briefly, the problems were: inquiries into MJ-12 withother agencies turned up empty, the memo was unsigned, lacked a top-secretregistration number, carried an incorrect classification (“Top-SecretRestricted” on the first line, and “Security Information” on the second), had adifferent typeface from other Cutler memoranda, and lacked the characteristiceagle watermark that was said to be on all government onionskin paper. dcccxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1972753] A month later,Philip Klass essentially repeated these claims in an official press release byCSICOP.Moore was unfazed. None of these arguments held up under careful examination, hesaid. In the first place, unsigned memoranda were common among governmentdocuments of that period, and besides, Cutler was out of the country at the time– he could not possibly have signed it. The memo covered only a minoradministrative detail and would have been handled by Cutler’s staff. The lack ofa top-secret registration number meant nothing; this too was common from thatera. Regarding the classification “Top Secret Restricted Security Information,”Moore and Friedman both found that the caveat “Top Secret Security Information”was commonly used throughout the early 1950s. Also, the term “Top SecretRestricted Data” was in use for certain types of information connected withatomic energy. Objections on the document typeface were also misplaced, saidMoore. Preliminary examination of the memo indicated that it was typed with anEmanuel Remington-Rand typewriter of proper vintage – commonly used bygovernment offices. In any case, other Cutler memoranda from that era displayedseveral type styles. Finally, the absence of an eagle watermark on the onionskinpaper was not unusual. Government offices at that time used many types ofonionskin, some of which bore no watermark. dcccxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1972937] Friedman added that when visiting the document review portion of thearchives – which is where the Cutler-Twining memo was found – researchers wereprohibited from bringing their own materials. The memo was not folded, so itwould have been especially difficult to sneak in, and it was “obviously” anunsigned carbon on old paper. Also, the person working at the archives declaredthat it was certainly genuine. dcccxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1973120] Adding impetus to the MJ-12 momentum was the release of Timothy Good’sAbove Top Secret during the summer, which contained clean copies of thedocuments. In general, the mainstream reviews of Good’s book were dismissive,occasionally hysterical. Adrian Berry, science editor of the London Spectatorwrote that it was “an evil book,” practically primed to foment revolution andresurrect the guillotine. “Mr. Good’s ideas are those of a maniac,” Berrybreathlessly exclaimed. “I have no reason to believe that Mr. Good advocatestorture and murder. But he does not seem to realize that such things could alltoo easily happen if a frenzied mass movement were to take up his ideas.”dcccxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1973335]Still, Good’s book and the MJ-12 documents began quietly receiving attentionwithin the U.S. national security community, as more than one military andintelligence source has told the author personally.Even so, a week after the CSICOP press release, the New York Times restatedKlass’s argument as though it were unarguable scientific fact (“Report of U.F.O.Crash in ‘47 Called False by Science Panel.”) dcccxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1973541] The “SciencePanel” referred to CSICOP. Most of the major media outlets covered the story ina similar fashion, generally with an openly skeptical approach.Such establishment denials frightened away many UFO researchers from thedocuments altogether. Others wondered whether the documents were a moresophisticated form of disinformation. Jenny Randles, thinking of her recentencounter with allegedly leaked documents, speculated that the recent FOIA gainsprompted a counterattack of sorts. This would be to release false papers “makingextreme claims of sufficient plausibility to UFO researchers ... but yetreporting things so bizarre (e.g. autopsies on dead aliens) that they have theeffect of making many objective commentators question the valid material.”Randles suspected that Moore’s work on the Roswell case made him a target, andshe found it “incredibly suspicious” that she and Good both received covertapproaches offering documents. dcccxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1973771]FOIA researcher Barry Greenwood gave one of the most prominent critiques of theMJ-12 documents. These were hoaxes, he said, most likely contrived by RichardDoty. No one knew where the documents came from – a significant problem byitself, compounded by the fact that no archive or library had found any otherdocument mentioning MJ-12. Moore’s longstanding association with Doty was alsoproblematic. Greenwood cited a 1983 conversation between Doty and Peter Gerstenin which it came out as a “virtual certainty” that Doty was Moore’s source formuch of his information. Doty had been the OSI agent on duty at Ellsworth AFB in1977 when a report, later alleged to be a hoax, emerged about aliens having agun battle with security guards. Suspiciously, Doty’s later home base ofKirtland AFB happened to be mentioned several times in the variousMoore-Shandera-Friedman papers.Greenwood also questioned the content within the MJ-12 documents, mostsignificantly the disparity between its extensive discussion of the Roswellcrash, and the mere seven lines of text on an alleged 1950 crash in Texas. Itseemed likely that this was simply because the forgers had only a limited amountof information about the less-well-known Texas crash.He also argued that the Cutler-Twining memo was planted – by whom, he would notspeculate. It was found in a virtually empty box containing a small number ofnon-UFO documents. How could it have escaped the notice of those whodeclassified it? If Moore and Shandera said they found it as early as 1985, whywas their copy dated from January 1987? After all, researchers throughout 1985and 1986 had wanted to find a way to verify the MJ-12 claims. To Greenwood, itappeared that someone planted the memo before 1987 and set it up to be“officially” discovered and officially released by archive personnel. AlthoughFriedman claimed such a thing was virtually impossible to do, in fact it iseasy, wrote Greenwood. He had been able to sign in at the desk, obtain aresearcher’s card and walk in without anyone so much as peaking at his folders.He had two folders filled with copies of government documents to help him in hisresearch. During the time he was at the archives, Greenwood said, he had “ampleopportunity” to have planted or stolen documents while the archivist was takingphone calls.Greenwood’s argument had a strong influence within ufology. Judging from theresearchers he thanked in his postscript (Peter Gersten, Robert Todd, RobertHastings, William Steinman, John Lear, David Jacobs, and others) it was clearthat sides were being drawn regarding MJ-12. dcccxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1973970] Several of Greenwood’s arguments turned out to be flawed, however. BruceMaccabee cleared up one issue regarding the Cutler-Twining Memo. The reason thememo was stamped from early 1987, explained Maccabee, was because he had gone tothe archives himself to get his own copy. Moore had shown him the document in1985, Maccabee said. When Maccabee decided to write an article regarding MJ-12,he decided that he needed to confirm the existence of the memo. Using Moore’sinstructions, he easily located the document and made his own copy. Hefurthermore had the date stamped on the front, instead of the back (Moore’s copywas stamped on the back), and sent Moore a copy for use on his June 1987 pressrelease. Maccabee believed the memo’s physical features pointed to itsauthenticity. It was a blue carbon copy on white onionskin paper. Yellowingaround the edges suggested that it sat flat in a pile of papers or at least waspressed into a file in such a way that the air could circulate freely around allfour sides. The paper was creased, indicating it had at one time been foldedinto thirds, as if for insertion into an envelope. “A comparison of thisdocument,” concluded Maccabee, “with other known Cutler memos suggests that itis genuine.” dcccxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1974210]By the end of 1987, not only had the MJ-12 question caused a schism among UFOresearchers, but serious questions about Moore himself were being raised.Gersten made the explosive assertion that “William Moore, rather than being aninnocent dupe, was and still is actively and intentionally engaged in acontinuing program of disinformation involving fraudulent documents.”Considering that Moore had been one of the most prominent UFO researchersthroughout the 1980s, this was strong stuff. dcccxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1974396] Much more damning was the research being done by Robert Hastings. Shortlybefore the June press conference, Hastings spoke with researcher Lee Graham, whohad several dealings with Moore. Over the previous few years, Graham had comeinto possession of several documents that were relevant to MJ-12, including the“Project Snowbird” and “Project Aquarius” documents. Graham had told Hastingsthat his source for these documents worked for the government, either as anintelligence operative or information conduit. As a result of this, Graham hadreceived a visit from two agents from the Defense Investigative Service (DIS).They wanted to know why Graham, who possessed a “Q” security clearance,possessed allegedly secret government documents that had not been properlyclassified.Now, however, in 1987, Graham freely told Hastings that it had been Bill Moorewho had given him the Snowbird and Aquarius documents. Hastings asked if thismeant that Moore worked for the U.S. government. Graham replied that when Moorefirst approached him with the documents, he showed Graham a government ID card.It had Moore’s picture on it, but an alias typed beneath it. Moore indicated hewas working for the U.S. government in order to release sensitive UFO-relateddocuments. An astounded and still skeptical Hastings asked Graham which agencyMoore claimed to work for. Graham replied that Moore’s ID badge was identical tothe badges shown him by the DIS agents. Hastings asked, “You mean to tell methat Moore’s badge looked like the DIS badges?” Graham said, “no, it wasidentical to them.”Graham said he had been introduced to Moore’s “superior,” whom Moore would onlyidentify as “Richard.” Graham wrote to the DIS about Moore’s approach to him onMay 8, 1986, yet, Moore appeared never to have been interrogated by any othergovernment agency for impersonating a government agent – which after all is acrime. This would seem to imply that either Moore’s visit to Graham wassanctioned by the U.S. intelligence community, or that he was an actual agent.And one is left to wonder whether “Richard” was Richard Doty.None of this looked good for Moore, although one might argue it was a separatematter from the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents. But Hastings wondered aboutthose, too. For one, Moore had a history of “retyping” documents. This was thecase with the Project Aquarius document, the first known document to refer toMJ-12, and which was declared fake by AFOSI Headquarters. According to RichardHall, Moore had privately admitted in 1983 that he had done a “cut and pastejob” and then “retyped” the document. Why would any researcher do such a thing,wondered Hastings? Clearly, the retyped version, once discovered to have beentampered with (as would inevitably happen) would only raise doubts about thecredibility of the information it contained. Moore never provided an originalversion of the document. How could anyone know if it were real?Hastings did not formulate his results into a paper until 1989, but researcherswere talking privately about Moore in this vein throughout the late 1980s. WhenMoore learned of these statements, he refuted them vehemently, but at timesrather ineffectually. The Lee Graham incident had been a “joke.” The government“ID” was a laminated MUFON card, Moore said. However, it is hard to believe thatsomeone of Graham’s background would not have noticed the difference between agovernment ID badge and a MUFON membership card. dcccxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1974563]Ufology was heading for a showdown. Dr. Eric WalkerDuring the late summer of 1987, another important development in the MJ-12 sagatook place – albeit behind the scenes – when researcher William Steinman phonedDr. Eric A. Walker. Several researchers had been involved in cultivating Walker.In 1983, Dr. Robert Sarbacher had told Stanton Friedman that he knew of at leastone person who had attended meetings at Wright-Patterson AFB concerningrecovered flying saucers, but could not remember the name. When Steinman spokewith Sarbacher in 1984, they realized the man was Eric Walker. Walker’s mosthigh profile public job had probably been as President of Penn State University,but he had a long history at the highest levels of national security planning.For five years he was Chair of the Institute for Defense Analysis (IDA),probably the most elite military think tank in the U.S. Previous to this, in1950 and 1951, he was Executive Secretary of the Military’s Research &Development Board. It was in this capacity that Walker was said to have attendedmeetings at Wright-Patterson concerning UFO crash retrievals.Friedman phoned Walker and Steinman wrote to him. Both got the brush-off.Steinman’s letter was actually sent back, with an added statement typed on thebottom: “STOP! DON’T TRY TO FIND ME....” Both researchers moved on to othermatters.The publication of the MJ-12 documents, however, added impetus to theinvestigation. Steinman decided to contact Walker again, this time by phone. OnAugust 30th, 1987, the two men spoke. Steinman told Walker he was calling “inreference to the meetings that you attended at Wright-Patterson Air Force Basein/around 1949-1950, concerning the military recovery of Flying Saucers, andbodies of occupants.”Amazingly, Walker replied that he had: “Yes. I attended meetings concerning thatsubject matter.” Why was Steinman so worked up over it, Walker wanted to know?Incredulous, Steinman reminded Walker that they were, after all, “talking aboutthe actual recovery of a flying saucer not built or constructed on this earth!And furthermore, we are talking about bodies of the occupants from the craft whowere analyzed [to be] human-like beings not of this world!”“So,” replied Walker, “what’s there to get all excited about? What’s all theconcern?”Steinman had expected a challenging interview, but Walker’s nonchalance was asurprise. He continued to ask questions: had Walker ever heard of the MJ-12group or Project Majestic 12? Once again, Walker surprised the researcher withhis frankness:Yes, I know of MJ-12. I have known of them for 40 years. I believe that you’rechasing after and fighting with windmills. . . . You are delving into an areathat you can do absolutely nothing about. So, why get involved with it or allconcerned about it? Why don’t you just leave it alone and drop it? Forget aboutit!Steinman replied that he was not going to drop it, that the public had the rightto the truth. He continued to press. Did Walker remember any details regardingUFO recovery operations and analysis? Walker said he was sure he had notesconcerning the meetings at Wright-Patterson AFB. “I would have to dig them outand read them over in order to jog my memory,” he said. Walker said he mightcontemplate cooperating further. “That’s the best I can say for now,” heconcluded. dcccxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1974774] Steinman wrote back to Walker the next day, asking whether he knew of ProjectAquarius and reminding him to look for those notes. He also sent Walker a copyof the MJ-12 documents. Three weeks later, Walker replied, and a very odd letterit was. “Some things you have right,” he wrote, “and some things you have verywrong.” There was a “machine” recovered, “obviously a landing vehicle only,”fully within the realm of current knowledge, and he believed it was still beingstored near “Wright Field.” No dead bodies were found at the site – only fournormal looking males who were very much alive. Yet, the implication from theletter was that they were nonetheless alien:Unfortunately, they had no memory of anything in the past (probably by design),but they were highly intelligent. They learned the English language within a fewhours and it was our decision not to make public spectacles of them, but allowthem to be absorbed into American culture as soon as we were sure that they didnot bring any contamination with them.Each of the four, according to Walker, became highly successful in variousfields of human endeavor: technology, sports, and finance. Walker could notremember what happened to the fourth individual. The letter was signed only bythe initials, “E.A.W.” dcccxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1975063] Steinman puzzled over the letter. So did Grant Cameron and T. Scott Crain, twoother researchers who were communicating with Steinman and looking into thismatter. The letter was strange, to be sure. But it also contradicted statementsin Sarbacher’s 1983 letter to Steinman – Sarbacher had indicated the aliens wereinsect-like, not human. Frankly, it seemed implausible that the U.S. militarywould allow four human-looking aliens to merge seamlessly into human society.The three wondered if the letter was a joke, but decided against it. After all,Steinman could have chosen to publish the letter, which would surely causeembarrassment to Walker. But why write back at all? The researchers decided thatWalker may have thought Sarbacher had revealed much more than he actually did.Such was the state of affairs regarding Eric Walker circa 1987. The next severalyears would see further developments. T. Scott Crain, Jr. lived within ten milesof Walker’s State College residence. For the next several years, he and GrantCameron investigated as much of Walker’s past as they could. Meanwhile, Steinmanwrote again to Walker at his Florida residence in April 1988. Walker’s letter ofSeptember 1987 had “bewildered” Steinman, but now he wanted to know aboutcurrent members of MJ-12. “I understand,” wrote Steinman, “that some of itspresent day members are: (1) Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, (2) Gnl. Lew Allen, (3) Dr.Edward Teller, (4) Bobby Inman, and (5) Vice Pres. George Bush.” Steinman askedfor information about these men, and asked Walker to “talk with the others toend this dangerous alliance that was set up with the other world beings (ProjectAquarius).”Walker gave another bizarre reply. Within a week of receipt, he mailedSteinman’s handwritten note back to him – not from Florida but Penn State.Apparently, he considered the letter interesting enough to take with him toPennsylvania. Over various words Steinman had written, Walker had writtennumbers from 1 to 26, in minuscule size and no recognizable pattern. At the topof Steinman’s letter, Walker wrote “Must reply, did code (-1).” NeitherSteinman, Cameron, nor Crain could make sense of the “Code Letter,” untilCameron realized that Walker had once been Chairman of the Institute for DefenseAnalysis, an organization that had made and broken codes and ciphers for theNSA. But Walker’s code itself remained an enigma.Later in April 1988, Crain phoned Walker. As soon as Crain mentioned the U-word,Walker simply said, “that is a subject that I don’t talk about.” Crain tried toget Walker to budge, but to no avail. Walker did not deny anything, he simplyoffered no comment. Crain made several attempts during 1988; Walker gave himnothing. Steinman also called Walker again in November 1988. This time Walkeracted as though he did not remember Steinman. No matter how much Steinman triedto jog his memory, Walker replied, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”Clearly, Walker had found a strategy that worked. dcccxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1975351] That is, it worked on Steinman and Crain. But there was one other researcherwho was able to engage Walker in extended conversation about this topic. Thiswas Dr. Henry Azadehdel (also known as Dr. Henry Victorian), a British-Armenianphysicist who had corresponded with Cameron and learned about Walker. He firstwrote to Walker in December 1989, and the two established a cordialrelationship. On January 26, 1990, Azadehdel telephoned him. Perhaps because thetwo could communicate as scientific colleagues, Walker opened up.They first discussed a South African UFO case Azadehdel was investigating, whichconcerned alleged “insect-like” alien beings. Although Walker had previouslywritten to Steinman that the aliens he knew about were perfectly human looking,Walker asked Azadehdel many questions about the specifics of these beings,appearing to accept Azadehdel’s research and opinions with no problem. Someselected highlights of their conversation were as follows:A: Doctor, have we ever captured anything at all? We must have.W: Sure.A: ... did we learn anything?W: Yeah, I think so.A: Is it determined from which star system they come from?W: Ah, I do not think so.A: Have we ever been able to make contact with them on the communication basis?W: We promised not to tell.A: Do they constitute any threat to the national security of any country?W: Everybody decides that on his own.A: Do you know whether there is any cooperation between them (EBEs) and us, asan advanced civilization?W: I think so. There have been occasions, but then I can speak only for myself.Azadehdel was understandably encouraged by this conversation, and phoned Walkera second time on March 8, 1990. More highlights:A: Are the [MJ-12] documents authentic?W: I don’t think so.A: Doctor, but is there any such group still alive?W: (Silence). How good is your mathematics?A: As good as it could be for a doctor in physics. But why?W: Because only a very few are capable in handling this issue. Unless your mindability is like Einstein’s or likewise, I do not think how you can achieveanything.A: Well, Doctor, for many years now I have been trying. But, are theregovernment scientists?W: Everybody mistakes about this issue. I gather by that you mean whether theywork for the Defense establishments of the military.A: Yes, Doctor, that is what I meant.W: Well, that is where you are wrong. They are a handful of elite. When you areinvited into that group, I would know.A: Is this group like the Bilderbergs, Pugwash, or the Trilaterals?W: (Silence for a long while). Something like that.A: Are you a member of that group?W: I cannot answer that. How good is your seventh sense? How much [do] you knowabout ESP?A: I know to some degree about ESP and EVP. But, what has that got to do withit?W: Unless you know about it, and know how to use it, you would not be taken in.Only a few know about it.A: Doctor, are there any military people in that group?W: No.A: Have we used any derivative of the learnt technology in the military?W: I cannot answer that question. You are trying to squeeze the answers out ofme.A: Are the members 10, 12, 14, are they all Americans?W: I cannot give you the numbers, and no, not necessarily, they are not allAmericans.A: Doctor, have we master[ed] the knowledge, are we working together with theentities?W: No, we have learnt so much, and we are not working with them, only contact.A: Have we captured any saucers, any material from the discs to study?W: The technology is far behind [author note: Walker apparently meant “beyond”]what is known in ordinary terms of physics that you take the measure and obtainmeasurements. You are pushing for answers, aren’t you? .... As I said, it is farbehind (sp) the known level of physics that is known. A very few have knowledgeof it.A final phone conversation between the two occurred on August 18, 1990. Thistime, Walker was more guarded. Increasingly, he stated that such matters werenone of Azadehdel’s business, and that he was not going to receive answerssimply so that his personal curiosity could be satisfied. “It is not going to doany damn good except make you happy. Is it not true? Are we to change all theplans and regulations just to make you happy? If you say that you are lookingfor the truth, you will never get it anyway, so forget it.” dcccxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1975643] Walker spent his remaining years dodging questions from researchers. Hedied on February 17, 1995 of a heart ailment. The notebooks of his UFO meetingswere presumably either at his home, possibly handed over to his children, orpassed over to the Penn State University archives. Crain made several visits tothese archives. Not only was there nothing related to UFOs, but there was alsonothing concerning Walker’s relationship to the Military’s Research &Development Board, for which he served as Executive Secretary. According toWalker’s son, Dr. Brian Walker, all of his father’s official papers had beengiven to Penn State. Among the unofficial papers, of which he said he reviewedsome 10,000 pages, he said he found no mention of UFO-related information.dcccxxxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1975934]What can one make of the Eric Walker tale? Ultimately it may come down to howone chooses to value certain types of evidence. Walker’s statements may or maynot have been entirely truthful, but there is no question that – if thestatements of Steinman and Azadehdel can be believed – he gave the impression ofknowing a great deal about an ET presence on Earth. Certainly, his status andcredentials were unassailable. The general appearance is that a member of the“inner circle,” during his later years, decided to let his guard down with anoccasional researcher or two. Whereas the Walker case cannot amount to “proof”of the existence of an MJ-12 type of group, it is suggestive and credible. Suchis the inherent nature of off-the-record insider leaks.Eric Walker’s connection to UFOs and MJ-12 remained unknown to all but a fewresearchers in 1987. Still, his story makes it clear how the opening of onesecret – whether fully genuine or as disinformation – could lead to otheropenings. Cracks were appearing, both in the secrecy and an increasinglyfractured ufology. 1987: A Quiet Year of UFOsWhile ufology was exploding throughout 1987, the year was strangely quietregarding actual UFO activity. Of course everything is relative. As skepticshave long argued, even one good UFO case should be enough to prove thephenomenon.Something strange happened in Britain’s North Yorkshire area in March 1987. Nearthe town of Bishop Monkton, Jenny Randles investigated and obtained informationfrom an anonymous military witness. At around 3 a.m., during a 24-hour Britishmilitary exercise, several military witnesses reportedly saw a strange red lightin sky. Within twenty minutes, the light completed three circuits around theimmediate area. Two F-4 Phantom fighter jets then gave chase, resulting in thetypical UFO cat-and-mouse scenario. “One moment it was in front of thepursuers,” the witness told Randles, “the next it would move at speed behindthem.” After five minutes, the object accelerated away at incredible speed. Thewitness did not report the sighting through official channels. dcccxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1976197] The Hudson Valley continued to generate a trickle of reports. On May 26,in the town of Newtown, Connecticut, over 100 people saw a slow, silent, lowflying, and circular formation of lights. The object passed over route I-84,causing many cars to pull over and some to lose power. A state police officerwas sent to investigate the event and photographed the object, which showed anearly complete circle of multi-colored lights. Another witness named RandyEtting, who was an experienced commercial pilot, saw the object throughbinoculars. He called the state police, explaining that he had never seenanything like this before. The officer told him that he had merely seenultralights in formation. Etting called this answer, “the prattling of idiots.”Bruce Maccabee analyzed the photo. His findings indicated that the object washuge, perhaps over a thousand feet across, and that the lights showed a definitepattern. dcccxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1976363] An interesting UFO sighting from Ghana on July 27 generated a U.S.Defense Information Report, and was also reported in the local news. Witnessesnear the city of Accra and in the Volta region in southeastern Ghana reported alarge and apparently silent object over southeastern Ghana and the Gulf ofGuinea shortly before midnight. Some people reported the sound of explosionsassociated with the sighting. According to a U.S. Defense memo, a Ghana AirForce pilot privately said that he saw the object from the ground from nearAccra. It traveled south and disappeared over the ocean. He initially wonderedif the object was a falling meteorite. It then displayed a large, yellow lightat its trailing end, similar to a rocket. Indeed, it was shaped very much like amissile or aircraft fuselage, except it was much larger – he estimated it to betwo to three times larger than a Boeing 747. However, the object stopped fallingand then began to climb. As it was gaining altitude over the ocean, he couldmake out details better in the clear evening sky. At this point, the singlelight disappeared, and eight smaller, bluish lights appeared. They were arrangedin a circular formation around the end of the object, and seemed to be theobject’s source of propulsion. All the time, the witness never heard a soundfrom it. The U.S. Defense memo commented that the officer was a “qualified jetfighter pilot” who was “well known to the DAO [Defense Attaché Office] andothers as a serious professional, not given to flights of fancy or to any desireto attract attention to himself.” The memo added that he appeared to beembarrassed and mystified by his sighting and provided the details reluctantly,“mainly because the Air Force commander had asked the DAO to help identify theobject.” dcccxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1976621] An interesting event is said to have occurred in the Soviet Union inearly August 1987, repeated in a number of sources. Five servicemen from theLeningrad Military Region were sent to a unit in northern Karelia to guard anobject which had recently been discovered to the north, near Viborg. They wereordered to prevent anyone getting near it. When someone disclosed to them thatit was a UFO, they took a peek. The object resembled an American space shuttleand was said to be 46 feet long, 15 feet wide, and 8 feet high. It was seamless,greyish-tan in color, and smooth-looking, although its surface felt somewhatrough. The anonymous source for the story said the men experienced pain whenthey approached the object. A week after the object’s arrival, a specialcommission of officers arrived to analyze it. They were unable to enter theobject, and instead moved it to a hangar. The guards were sent back to theirunit at this point, but the informant later learned from an officer thatinvestigators were eventually able to enter part of it. Two men could barely fitinside, although there were two armchairs and what seemed like steering wheelsand a control panel. It took one man 30 minutes to figure out how to put hishands on the “steering wheel.” No one dared to sit in the chairs. The men triedto break off some shiny rods varying in length from 8 inches to 3 feet. Althoughthey were wearing gloves, they burned their hands nonetheless. The object wasgone by late September. Obviously, whether there is any truth, or evendisinformation, to this story cannot be known without more investigation anddocumentation. dcccxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1976875]In the United States, some activity was being reported in the eastern regions.According to Stan Gordon’s research, a “a continuous wave of UFO activity” beganin Pennsylvania during the summer of 1987, and which continued through theremainder of the decade. Hundreds of state residents were the source of manygood-quality reports by MUFON and the Pennsylvania Association for the Study ofthe Unexplained (PASU). Many of these were close encounter cases. dcccxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1977381] Other sightings were sporadically reported. On August 11, inOsbornville, New Jersey, a witness reported seeing a shiny, oval object thathovered, became brighter, and took off like a shot, leaving a white trail. Itthen stopped abruptly, maneuvered, flashed more lights, and shot straight up outof sight. dcccxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1977588] Another casewas reported from September 1, in Bangor, Washington. An elliptical-shapedobject with windows beamed a light down upon children at a playground. Thechildren said they could see two humanoid-type creatures in the object. dcccxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1977757] Starting inSeptember, a concentration of UFO sightings were reported in the Arkansas townsof Foreman and Ashdown. Over the next four months, the sheriff’s office inLittle River County took about 60 reports. dcccxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1977927] On September 9, 1987, the interesting “Joe Le Taxi” landing case tookplace in France. This involved the sighting of “an intense light and soundphenomenon,” followed by leaf damage to a tree and “functional disturbance ofthe photosynthetic system.” A biochemical analysis was carried out by ProfessorMichel C. L. Bounias of the Biochemistry Laboratory at the INRA (NationalInstitute of Research in Agronomy), University of Avignon. dcccxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1978093] On October 5, in Southern California’s Antelope Valley – a desert regionclose to Nevada and a major center of aerospace technology – a father and histwo daughters (ages 14 and 11) saw a UFO. The Moon was full and the sky clearwhen, at 10:30 p.m., the older daughter pulled back the curtains of her bedroom.Through the window she saw “a perfectly round object encircled with lights,spinning, and moving slowly at low altitude past the edge of the roof.” Theyounger daughter also saw it, and the girls became afraid. They called theirfather. He came over and saw the object, but was mystified by it. It lookedlarge, and seemed to have a bulge on its topside as well as a kind of flangearound the rim. The object passed from view beyond the rooftops of theapartments across the way. It passed through a narrow corridor between EdwardsAFB air space and that controlled by Palmdale air traffic control. The fatherreported the sighting to Edwards AFB and the Antelope Valley Sheriff’sDepartment. No follow-up is known or recorded about the incident. dcccxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1978605] In the middle of October, an interesting multiple witness sighting took placein the Hudson Valley. This was in Candlewood Lake in western Connecticut, aregion with a history of UFO sightings during the 1980s. According to onewitness, at around 6 p.m. he was driving home from work and saw what looked likea low-flying aircraft pass over trees to his left. He heard no sound and saw nocrash, and so remained unconcerned. After making a turn, he noticed four carsstopped with no lights on, mostly on the side of the road. Then his car “justdied.” He had no electrical power at all. He got out and approached the otherdrivers, who were out of their cars, too. They said excitedly that a very largeand bright aircraft flew over and seemed to have gone down over the hill in thewest. The aircraft, they said, was very large, white in color, triangular inshape, and had amber colored lights. They added that it was also silent.It was getting dark, and the witness saw a glow in the woods. Thinking theremight have been a plane crash, he took his flashlight and went in alone, as noone wished to accompany him. He went about a quarter of a mile and came to ahill. The glow on the other side of the hill was getting brighter. As he reachedthe top, he saw a lighted object through the trees. He climbed down and came toa clearing. To his shock, he saw what looked like a dark triangle hovering inthe trees. The object, he later emphasized, was not above the trees, but inthem. “Like a ghost,” he continued. “I mean an object that size should havebroken tree branches and its engines should have been blowing the trees around,but there was nothing, just silence.”He moved closer and heard a noise coming from it. He then saw a figure wearingsome kind of suit approaching the object. The witness hid behind a bush andwatched “the man or whatever it was” get into the object and look in hisdirection. The witness heard thoughts in his head saying he should not comecloser. He was “more than willing to obey.” The figure raised his hand andvanished in a flash of red light. “The object then vanished like someone hadjust turned it off.”He ran back to the road and saw that only one motorist remained, and decided notto discuss his experience. He did, however, discuss the case with PhilipImbrogno. dcccxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1978865] Toward the end of 1987, the Soviet Union recorded more interesting UFOreports. The largest display occurred in the Dalnegorsk and Primorye areas onthe night of November 28. According to Soviet ufologist reports, 33 unknownobjects flew at low altitude over the eastern coast of Primorye, near the Sea ofJapan, between 9:10 pm and midnight. Many people saw the spectacle, assumingthey were watching aircraft “crashing,” although no one heard a sound. Theydescribed varied shapes: cylinders, cigars, globes. Inquiries made by Dvuzhilnyshowed there had been no flights of civil or military aircraft at that time, andthat no carrier-rockets had been launched from Soviet cosmodromes. Moreover,continued Dvuzhilny, “the objects observed had nothing in common with theeffects of rocket launching that are quite different. They were not likefireballs, ball lightning or plasmoids.” Of the 33 UFOs, 13 flew overDalnegorsk, the scene of a possible previous UFO crash. More than 100 witnesseswere questioned by the Far Eastern Commission. The objects also reportedlycaused a two minute disruption of electrical circuits, including televisions andcomputers. According to the Far Eastern Commission, 45 UFOs were registered inthe Dalnagorsk region in 1987, with more in subsequent years. dcccxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1979025] Sightings continued about 1,000 miles to the northeast, in Kamchatkawith many sightings of ball-shaped UFOs near the Shiveluch Volcano. One officercorrelated their appearance with the scheduled launching of combat vehicles, butothers said these small “objects” did not appear in relation to any launching.For example, on December 16, 1987, an hour after a warhead had fallen to theground, an orange ball was seen moving slowly and silently from north to south.Other sightings like this happened frequently and continued through much of1988. dcccxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1979340] Gulf BreezeSince the mid-1980s, fewer UFOs had been reported worldwide, but 1987 ended witha very important development. Indeed, in terms of controversy, it nearly equaledthe significance of the MJ-12 documents. This was the Gulf Breeze phenomenon.dcccxlix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1979524]Gulf Breeze, Florida, lies at the Gulf of Mexico, at the very end of the Floridapanhandle, just south of Pensacola. It is situated near many active U.S. Air andNaval bases, most notably the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Whiting Field NavalAir Station, Eglin AFB, and Hurlburt Field Air Force Special Operations Command.All of these bases are reachable within a half-hour’s drive or less. Furthereast along the panhandle is Tyndall AFB, about 90 miles away. Roughly five mileswest is the Pascagoula Naval Air Station and nearly 100 miles west is KeeslerAFB.On November 11, 1987, the first five photos of an unusual UFO were taken by EdWalters, a local building contractor and member of the Gulf Breeze City PlanningBoard. His wife, Frances, was president of the high school PTA. According toWalters, he was working late that afternoon when, at about 6 p.m., he noticed alight approaching his house from the west. He could barely see it through thebranches of a pine tree in his front yard. He went to his front door to get abetter view, and was astonished to see an object with the shape of a top,hovering just above the road and showing a glowing ring around its bottom. Ithad a row of dark squares which were separated with portals between them. Hisfirst thought was to call the police, but he realized the object could be goneby the time they arrived and he would have no proof of what he had seen. So heran into his house and grabbed his Polaroid camera. He then stepped outside thefront door and took several photos of the craft before deciding to get closer.As he paused in the street to take more photos, it moved almost directly overhis head and hit him with a bright bluish beam, lifting him from the ground.Walters claimed to hear a voice say, “Don’t worry, we will not harm you.” Imagesentered his mind, “as if they were turning the pages of a book,” said Walters.The next thing he remembered was falling face down onto the road, turning overand finding that the glowing UFO was gone.The sighting was certainly dramatic, and the photos were formidable. The veryfirst photograph Walters took, in fact, was interesting in that it showed theobject clearly behind a tree. If it were a hoax, it was very, very good.However, what gave the sighting more power still were the claims by otherwitnesses to have seen the same UFO in the sky earlier during the same day. Thefirst to see the object was Billie Zammit who, at about 2:30 a.m., took her dogoutside and was startled to see the object hovering over the canal in herbackyard. A blue beam of light came down from the object and illuminated a spoton her dock. In her words, it was “about one mile high, 15 degrees to thenorthwest and there was a stream of light that came down into our canal.” Afterwatching this object for about five minutes she became so frightened that shegrabbed the dog and ran into the house. dcccl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1980125] About sixhours later, at 8:15 a.m., Jeff Thompson saw a similar object that moved slowlyand hovered. Then, as two jets approached from the east, it zoomed upward with aflash of light. About nine hours later, and about half an hour before EdWalters’ sighting, Charles and Doris Somerby saw the same object moving throughthe Gulf Breeze sky in a direction that would take it toward Walters’ location.Charles was the former editor of the local newspaper, The Gulf Breeze Sentinel ,and his stepson Duane Cook was the current editor.The following week, on November 17, Walters took his photographs to the Sentinel. He wanted anonymity, however, so he told Duane that a person wishing to remainanonymous had given him the photos. Walters also related “Mr. X’s” bizarreencounter with the craft. Soon after, he wrote a letter to the newspaper fromMr. X. With some misgivings, Duane planned to publish the photos. But then hisfather-in-law and mother visited the newspaper office and saw “Mr. X’s” photos.They told Duane they had seen the same thing. All misgivings were removed andDuane published the photos and Mr. X’s story. The story became big almostimmediately. But for Walters, the journey was just beginning.On November 20, he heard a hum and voices, as if communications were being madebetween individuals. Going outside, he noticed a small dot of light which wasfalling from the sky. It stopped and began to hover. He took a photo of it. OnDecember 2, Walters received another visit. He was awakened at about 3:30 a.m.by the sound of his dog barking. He walked to his French doors and opened theblinds. There he saw a creature about four feet tall with large black eyes. Hepanicked and fell down from the shock. According to Walters, the being stared athim for a moment and then began to walk away. Walters followed it to the porch,but as soon as his body was no longer covered by the porch roof he was hit by ablue beam from above and immobilized. Meanwhile, the creature fled into thevacant field at the back of his house. The beam disappeared, and Walters couldmove again. He ran into the house, grabbed his camera, ran back outside andphotographed the UFO shooting a blue beam into the field. “I believe that it waspicking up the creature I had seen,” wrote Walters. This was his eleventh photo.More events followed on the morning of December 5th. A UFO hovered below thetree level near the high school behind Walters’ house. Walters saw it from thefenced-in pool area behind his house. He heard a voice say “Do not resist. Staywhere you are. You are in danger. We will not harm you… Zehaas.” It thenincreased in height and hovered above the trees near the school. Waltersphotographed the object. According to Walters, the object moved toward him andhe heard a voice say, “Step forward.” Walters’ angry response was “Come and getme.” Then the object suddenly zipped upward and disappeared.Before long, MUFON and CUFOS were looking into Ed Walters’ story, as well asCSICOP and numerous independent investigators. MUFON considered the “Mr. X”sighting reports to be important, not because there were photos (which, as theyknew, could in principle have been faked) but because of the reports by otherwitnesses who claimed to have seen the same object. Starting in November, MUFONinvestigator Donald Ware began to suspect that Walters, not the fictitious Mr.X, had taken the photographs. Late in November, he enlisted a friend of Walters’son to serve as a “spy.” The young man was very familiar with the Walters house,but never found anything unusual.For the next several years, Gulf Breeze became the most electrifying andcontroversial UFO case, an ongoing event that drew more and more visitors, andEd Walters was at the center of the storm. In time, MUFON officially supportedWalters (MUFON Director Walter Andrus eventually called it “one of the mostincredible cases in modern UFO history”), while CUFOS and CSICOP argued that hehad hoaxed his photographs. By the end of 1987, however, all that lay in thefuture, as well as the fact that Gulf Breeze would soon become, like Roswell andthe MJ-12 papers, one of Ufology’s most polarizing issues. The Lear LettersThat most interesting year of 1987 ended with yet one more controversy andportent of things to come. In December, two important letters by John Lear werepublished to the Internet’s UFO forum known as Paranet. John Lear was the son ofWilliam Lear, who invented the Lear Jet and the 8-track tape. During themid-1950s, the elder Lear claimed to have seen a UFO while flying in hisaircraft. He had also made suggestive statements to the press that hinted ofanti-gravity research in the defense community. By the late 1950s, however, themedia had ceased reporting on such developments.The younger Lear was also a man of significant accomplishment. Forty-five yearsold in 1987, John Lear was one of the world’s top commercial pilots. Accordingto a biographical statement at that time, he was a captain for a major charterairline, had flown 160 types of aircraft in over 50 countries, and held 17 speedrecords for the Lear Jet. He had flown missions worldwide for the CIA and othergovernment agencies, and at the time was the only pilot to hold every airmancertificate issued by the FAA. dcccli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1980334] He alsoinherited his father’s interest in UFOs. By late 1987, John Lear was MUFON’sState Director for Nevada. dccclii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1980568]But it was Lear’s public letters that gained him notoriety. For some time, hehad been talking with Paul Bennewitz, and in two letters released on an Internetbulletin board in December 1987, he strongly reflected the themes Bennewitz hadbeen dealing with. dcccliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1980754] “The United States Government,” wrote Lear, “has been in business with littlegrey extraterrestrials for about 20 years” and – “with the best of intentions” –has betrayed its citizens. Germany probably recovered a flying saucer in 1939,and the U.S. government has been examining flying saucers since at least 1946.UFOs were also recovered near Roswell, Aztec, and Laredo. The creaturesoperating this technology are vastly more advanced than us, and James Forrestal(incorrectly referred to as “General” by Lear) committed suicide over the“horrible truth.”There were several types of alien species, according to Lear, including threetypes of “Greys,” various human-looking types, even inter-dimensional beings(oddly, he did not mention any reptilian types). Direct communication between atleast one of these alien groups and the U.S. Government was initiated on April30, 1964 at Holloman AFB in New Mexico. Then, between 1969 and 1971, MJ-12 madea deal with the aliens by which they would secretly receive alien technology. Inreturn, however, they would ignore abductions of people and suppress informationon cattle mutilations. The aliens said these abductions were simply a standardmonitoring of “developing civilizations,” and MJ-12 insisted that abductee namesbe submitted to themselves and the National Security Council. During 1972 and1973, Lear wrote, the secret facility at Groom Lake, Nevada (still unknown tothe general public in 1987), was closed so that a huge underground base could bebuilt “for and with the help of the EBE’s.”MJ-12 was pleased by its deal with the devil. But problems soon became all-tooapparent. The alien need for body parts – both human and other – was muchgreater than they had let on. At least some of these aliens had a “geneticdisorder” – possibly due to past wars or other mishaps – which had resulted inan atrophied digestive system. As a result, they used “an enzyme or hormonalsecretion obtained from the tongues and throats of cows or humans.” Thissecretion was mixed with other substances and absorbed through the skin, throughwhich waste was also excreted. In other words, according to Lear, aliensconsumed the enzymes and blood of cattle and humans, often apparently while thevictims were still living.Body parts were taken to underground laboratories, one of which was near Dulce,New Mexico, deep inside Archuleta Mesa. This was an enormous, jointly occupied(CIA-alien) facility where humans of all ages were kept in large test tube-likevats. The facility at Groom Lake was also apparently involved in this program.Incidentally, even though the Groom Lake facility was now equipped with alientechnology, only the aliens were able to use it. Thus, by the late 1970s, the“deal” was not looking very advantageous, after all. Then, in 1979, “analtercation of sorts” occurred at the Dulce laboratory. Several people haddiscovered the gruesome truth about what was going on there, but were trappedinside. Delta Force was called in to try and free them, but 66 soldiers died ina futile effort.After this, MJ-12 realized “that things were not going as planned.” It becameclear that the scope of the alien abduction program was massive – much more thana case of “simple monitoring.” Aliens were inserting probes into human brains.They were making post-hypnotic suggestions about something important “that willoccur in the next 2 to 5 years” (presumably between 1989 and 1992), at whichtime they would give certain instructions. They were creating a human-alienhybrid race. And many of the nation’s missing children were actually beingconsumed by the aliens as food.Not surprisingly, Lear continued, the prevailing mood among MJ-12 was close topanic by the early 1980s. All through the 1970s and early 1980s, they hadpromoted the “Good ET” concept to the public through such movies as “CloseEncounters of the Third Kind” and “ET: The Extraterrestrial.” They had even beenplanning to reveal the ET reality by the late 1980s. That plan now had to bescrapped. One faction wanted to alert the world to the horrible truth; the otherargued that secrecy remained paramount, and that anti-ET weapons must besecretly developed under the guise of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).According to Lear, MJ-12 member Edward Teller managed that project. Other MJ-12members named by Lear included Henry Kissinger, Bobby Ray Inman, and “possiblyAdmiral [John] Poindexter.”Lear dropped other bombshells. He said that William Moore was being used as aconduit by MJ-12 to release information about the alien presence on Earth. Mooreeven received a videotape of an interview by two “well known newsmen” of amilitary officer associated with MJ-12 (Moore denied this). This officer gaveinformation about the history of MJ-12, the recovery of flying saucers, theexistence of a live alien (one of three living aliens, designated as EBE1, EBE2,and EBE3) being held in a facility at Los Alamos, New Mexico. This officermentioned Harold Brown, Richard Helms, General Vernon Walters, and (the lateTheodore) Von Karman as somehow connected to MJ-12. Most explosive of all wasthe officer’s statement that the EBEs claimed to have “created” Christ. Theyeven possessed a holographic recording of his crucifixion. Moore allegedlyshowed this interview video to about “five well-known persons” to judge theirreactions. One of them was his friend, the well-known radio commentator PaulHarvey (who was apparently skeptical of at least some of this material).Lear speculated that Moore might be an MJ-12 agent. As evidence, he offered theLee Graham episode, as well as Moore’s insistence that cattle mutilations were a“hoax” fostered by Linda Moulton Howe. Lear reasoned that if these events wereto force a disclosure of the existence of aliens – and at the same time if thesealiens were believed to be hostile – MJ-12 might decide to admit to aliens whileconcealing the more explosive information about mutilations and abductions.Thus, Moore might simply be toeing the party line. What was actually going on, wondered Lear? After having engaged in probablyhundreds of thousands of abductions and built countless underground bases, werethe aliens ever planning to return home? Were they planning something big forthe future? The most likely scenario, he thought, was that “the invasion isessentially complete and everything is over but the screaming.” Forget the masslandings and ray guns, said Lear. A highly advanced civilization could probablycomplete its program before anyone knew what happened.Lear’s letters immediately made waves. His background and credibility were hardto question. He seemed sincere to those who met with him. Still, could he beplying disinformation? After all, his claims were far beyond mainstream UFOresearch, and even beyond the cutting edge established by Budd Hopkins andWhitley Strieber. Aliens eating humans sounded like a bad science fictionplotline, not anything resembling responsible ufology.People wanted answers from Lear. In May 1988, MUFON Director of InvestigationsDan Wright posed a series of open questions to Lear, nearly all of whichconcerned Lear’s sources. Lear answered that most of his information came fromconfidential sources within the intelligence community, while a lesser portioncame from open sources and his own “informed speculation.” dcccliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1981081] Deciding what to think about John Lear has never been easy for many UFOresearchers. Was he genuinely reporting inside information, as he claimed, orspreading disinformation to undermine the credibility of the field? This authorhas spoken confidentially to several individuals with reasonably goodconnections to Lear. All have indicated that he was indeed in a good position tohave gained potentially “inside” information; several commented on his eruditionand broad-ranging intelligence; many were skeptical or even frankly incredulousat his claims. The discrepancy is not easy to resolve. 1987: The Year in ReviewIn every respect, 1987 marked a watershed in the history of UFOs. The abductionphenomenon moved to the forefront not simply of UFO research, but became a topicof national discussion. The idea of a “government conspiracy” also became amajor issue. The release of the MJ-12 documents had much to do with this, as didTimothy Good’s Above Top Secret . Later in the year, Philip Imbrogno’s researchon the Hudson Valley cases was also published, adding fuel to the fire. dccclv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1981363] Manyresearchers were surprised by the generally positive mainstream coverage theyreceived, particularly on television. As the year progressed, more and more ofthe attention became critical, often zealously so, as in the over-the-top reviewof Above Top Secret in the August 1 edition of the London Spectator (“an evilbook.”) dccclvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1981602] Such strong reactions could be expected, considering the deepimplications of all this new research. By its very nature, the abductionphenomenon raised troubling questions: who were these abductors and what wastheir agenda? The study of UFOs was no longer a safe, theoretical, intellectualendeavor, but the confrontation with a truly alien intelligence that seemed coldand manipulative. It was also a far cry from the idea of friendly “spacebrothers.” In its own way, the MJ-12 topic also brought an unsettling sense ofdanger. What if the fundamental claims about MJ-12 were true? What if there wasa secret agency dedicated to maintaining control and secrecy over the UFO topic?Disclosing its existence could threaten the foundations of political stability,to say nothing of exposing secrets that could be very dark indeed. Hence theimportance of the statements by John Lear, which built directly upon thefoundations laid by the MJ-12 controversy and opened Pandora’s box.Lear’s letters heralded another new factor in UFO research. This was theworld-changing nature of the Internet. Undoubtedly, the existence of Internetnewsgroups like Paranet enabled his statements to attract immediate andwidespread attention. This would have been vastly more difficult in earlieryears. The Internet, even at this early stage, was showing very robustcapabilities in easing communication among researchers throughout the UnitedStates, and indeed anyone in the world able to get “on line.” It would help totransform a great deal of UFO research in the next few years, just as it wouldchange so much else in the world.Finally, the sightings of something unusual over Gulf Breeze, Florida, proved tobe an energizing factor that brought many people to ufology. It also contributedto a deep rift among researchers that would last for quite some time.Thus, 1987 marked the year that UFO research exploded. It was an exciting yearfor those who lived through it, and anticipation was high that the followingyear would bring new developments and revelations. Indeed, according to JeromeClark, rumors persisted at this time that the orchestrators of the cover-up were“deeply concerned about the direction of UFO events” and feared that thecover-up might soon be over. This might force them to “come clean.” dccclvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1981824] Such rumorshad existed for years, of course. The coming year would see this one only growstronger. The Knowles Family EncounterWith the exception of Gulf Breeze and a few other developments, 1988 was notespecially notable for UFO sightings. Even so, several of these were memorable,interesting, and occasionally well-documented.One of the strangest cases occurred early in the year along the south coast ofWestern Australia. A family was driving east across the continent, along thedesolate Eyre Highway. Faye Knowles was accompanied by her sons Patrick (24),Sean (21), and Wayne (18), as well as their two dogs. It was 4 a.m. on January21, and the sky was still dark. Sean was driving, and the family had just passedthe tiny town of Madura on the way to Mundrabilla. dccclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1982034] A bright light appeared ahead, low over the road. As the family approached, itlooked like “a slightly angular egg in an egg-cup shape.” It swayed back andforth and was nearly blinding. Sean approached very close to it and swerved tomiss it. In the process, he almost hit a station wagon coming at him in theother direction. After this near-miss, the egg-like object began to follow thestation wagon. Fascinated by this unknown object, Sean made a U-turn to pursueit, and for a short while followed the station wagon and the bright light.However, he soon developed second thoughts, as it looked like the object hadchanged course and was coming toward him. Now positively frightened, he turnedaround again and tried to speed away from the UFO.The family was in a panic, and Sean was frantically driving at close to 100 mphwhen they all heard a loud thud on the roof of their car; a weight or force waspressing down on them. Worse still, the family felt their car being lifted offthe road, or at least this is what they all later insisted. Faye Knowles bravelyrolled down the rear window and reached for the roof. She felt something verywarm, soft, and rubbery that covered her hand in a blackish dust. “It felt likea warm sponge,” she said. Patrick, in the front passenger seat, rolled down hiswindow and became covered in dust. A smell like dead bodies filled the car. Thiswas followed by a high-pitched sound which agitated the dogs.The family became disoriented. Their voices felt slower and lower in pitch. Theythought they were going to die. Faye said she felt something “going into ourheads,” and Patrick felt that his “brain was being sucked out.” According to thefamily, the car was in the air this whole time (how high or how long is notknown). But now they hit the road, bursting the rear right tire. Sean screechedto a halt and the family ran out, hiding for 15 minutes by some bushes beforechanging the tire and driving to the nearest town.During the Knowles family encounter with this UFO, a truck driver named GrahamHenley – who was ahead of the Knowles’ on the road – saw an intensely brightlight in his rear view mirror for five minutes, although he did not see any carheadlights beneath it. He said the light looked like a “big fried egg hungupside down,” rather similar to the description offered by Sean Knowles. Shortlyafter Henley pulled into Mundrabilla, the Knowles family arrived in a state ofpanic and disorientation. They described their experience to him; he inspectedthe damaged tire, saw the dents, and smelled something burnt. Accounts differ asto whether he saw the fine black ash inside the car: some say he did; othersindicate he saw only normal road dust. dccclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1982328] Henley thenwent with another trucker to inspect the scene of the incident. They found freshskid marks and footprints. Ten hours after the incident, the family spoke to police in Ceduna, who notedtheir emotional distress and the dents in the roof. Samples were collected forforensic analysis. Meanwhile, police soon learned that the same or a similarobject was witnessed 30 minutes later and 50 miles away from the Knowlesencounter by some tuna fishermen in the Great Australian Bight. These menclaimed that a UFO buzzed their boat, and that the crew suffered the same kindof voice distortion reported by the Knowles family. The police investigator wascertain the fishermen could not have known about the other incident. The RoyalAustralian Air Force stated that it had no aircraft in the region at the time.The police forensic analysis apparently was never conducted, but about half ofthe material was later returned to Australian ufologists Keith Basterfield andRay Brooke, who gave it to an independent laboratory for testing. The testrevealed ordinary materials: sodium chloride, sodium, aluminum, magnesium,sulphur, silicon, potassium, chlorine, clay particles and calcium.Meanwhile, the affair quickly became a media sensation. The family was offered afee by Australian Channel 7 television in return for exclusive rights. Not onlydid this make it difficult for independent researchers to gain access to thefamily, but the family soon became disillusioned by the circus atmosphere andended all interviews. Channel 7 arranged for additional samples to be collectedfrom the car. These were tested at the Australian Mineral DevelopmentLaboratories (AMDEL), which found a similar composition to the independentanalysis. AMDEL’s conclusion: this was dust from a tire blow-out. The smell,smoke, and vibrations from the incident were attributed to running on a blowntire. The lab also concluded that the roof dents were not recent.A third set of samples were taken from the car some 700 miles from Mundrabilla,by the Victoria UFO Society (VUFORS). Materials were sent to two differentlaboratories, again with commonplace results: brake dust, ordinary dust, doghairs, fibers and common elements such as carbon, oxygen, aluminum, silicon andcalcium. However, one analysis, by Dr. Richard Haines in the United States,concluded that the interior and exterior dust were different and that there wasa “possible trace of astatine, which is a radioactive chemical that can only beproduced synthetically.” Astatine has a very short half-life, and its presencewas inferred only when the particles were under extreme magnification, as theyexhibited signs of potential radiation. What makes this of possible importanceis that Faye Knowles’ hand became red and swollen in the days after the event, asign of possible radiation exposure (and something that had occurred in 1980 toBetty Cash after her encounter with a diamond-shaped UFO near the town ofHuffman, Texas).Skeptics offered several possible explanations for the encounter. The family hadbeen on the road for 24 hours and could easily have been overtired. In such astate the first hint of a rising sun could have combined with atmosphericconditions or some other optical illusion to startle them. One physicist saidthe culprit was a rare carbonaceous meteorite. Others blamed a rare type ofelectrical storm.There are good reasons to be cautious about the Mundrabilla encounter. Thelaboratory tests offered nothing conclusive. Of course, unless the dust werefrom the Moon, one wonders what conclusions could be reached. Still, thepotential of radiation cannot be discounted. The possibilities seem to be eithera gross misidentification of some unexpected but natural phenomena by overtiredand panicky people, or else something solid, intelligent, and perhapsradioactive was attacking cars – and boats – in Southern Australia. If thelatter, one has to wonder about the black dust, which according to the Knowlesfamily smelled like dead bodies. A gruesome scenario comes to mind, easilyleading the casual or serious observer fervently to hope the truth lies in thedepths of an overtired, overactive, imagination. dccclx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1982650] The U.S. Coast Guard Encounters a UFOSix weeks after the Knowles family encounter in Australia, another dramatic UFOevent occurred. This one was in the United States, and was much betterdocumented. On the evening of March 4, 1988 near Eastland, Ohio, not far fromthe Pennsylvania border, Sheila Baker and her children were driving home alongthe shore of Lake Erie. At 6:30 p.m., their attention was drawn to a large,bright object apparently hovering over the lake. It seemed almost like a blimp.Bright lights appeared at each end of it, and the whole thing was rocking end toend like a seesaw. The brighter of the two lights was strobing. Once home, shepersuaded her husband, Henry, to accompany her and the children to the beach.There, standing on the shore of Lake Erie, they all saw the object. It wasgun-metal grey and positively enormous – Henry later said it was “larger than afootball held at arm’s length.” It made no sound that they could hear. Somehow,however, it caused the lake ice to rumble and crack, perhaps by application ofheat. The object then began to circle slowly over part of the lake, comingnearly overhead at just 1/4 mile altitude.Feeling nervous, they drove back and watched the object from their home. Fromthere, they saw it descend; red and blue blinking lights were along its bottomedge. More interesting, however, were five or six bright yellow triangularlights that detached from its side. These lights hovered around the main object,then darted and zig-zagged in the night sky at high speeds. Henry believed theseobjects were smaller than a one-seat Cessna and “crossed 50 mile stretches lowover the ice in the snap of a finger.” They approached the shore, maderight-angle turns, and shot straight up. Several passes were toward the nearbyPerry Nuclear Plant. One neighbor of the Bakers also saw this display, and tried(unsuccessfully) to photograph the object.In response to several phone calls, two members of the Coast Guard, Seaman JamesPowers and Petty Officer John Knaub, drove to the beach. As they arrived, thetriangular objects approached them, prompting them to turn off their vehicle’sheadlights. The men continued to watch the triangles fly over the lake, one ofwhich accelerated straight at them, then veered east, zoomed straight up, andcame down beside the parent object. The Bakers were back at the beach now, andlistened to the Coast Guard personnel communicate by two-way radio with theirbase in Detroit. What they overheard was:. . . be advised the object appears to be landing on the lake .... There areother objects moving around it. Be advised these smaller objects are going athigh rates of speed. There are no engine noises and they are very, very low. Beadvised these are not planets.At the same time, 15 miles to the southeast, not far from the Perry NuclearPlant, Cindy Hale was walking her dog. She saw a triangular light hovering aboveher, and her dog began to whine. The triangle flashed a sequence of multicoloredlights, and she responded by flicking her cigarette lighter. This went on for 30minutes, until the triangle accelerated and left without a sound.Another local resident, Tim Keck, was watching the stars through his telescopewhen he saw a bright triangular object. Luckily, he had his camera with him – acheap 110 Instamatic he had received as a Burger King promotion, but it worked.He took a picture of the object before it silently moved beyond the horizon,catching about half of it before it moved fully out of the frame. Because of thenature of the camera, part of the object appeared beyond the formal edge of thenegative’s frame.Meanwhile, back at the lake, the large ship was nearly directly on the ice.Henry Baker continued to listen to Powers and Knaub tell their base, “you shouldbe advised that the object is now shining lights all over the lake and it’sturning different colors.” The ice made cracking noises so loud that Powers andKnaub had to yell in order to be heard. Suddenly the triangles were back,returning one by one into the large object. The ice boomed louder and louder,then all the lights went off, the ice stopped making noise, and everythingbecame “dead silent.” After another 30 minutes, the object could not be seen.The witnesses could only assume it had gone below the surface.On the morning of the 5th, unusually huge pieces of broken ice were seen wherethe object had been. That day, a Coast Guard representative told the Bakers thatthey had been instructed by the Army and NASA (whom Sheila had also phoned) notto investigate the matter further, nor to take their ice cutter out to the laketo examine the ice. The matter was “out of their league and out of their hands.”They said all information was being forwarded to Wright-Patterson AFB and afacility in Detroit. For its part, Wright-Patterson refused to confirm or denyany interest in the matter.The Coast Guard created an Incident Report on March 5, 1988, describing theevent in concise detail. The report stated that a large object had landed aquarter mile east of the nuclear power plant, and that it had... dispersed 3-5 smaller flying objects that were zipping around ratherquickly. These objects had red, green, white, and yellow lights on them thatstrobed intermittently. They also had the ability to stop and hover inmid-flight. dccclxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1983401] During the night of March 5, Sheila Baker saw what she thought was thesame UFO, hovering over the lake, only at a higher altitude than the nightbefore. The Coast Guard sent some men out who arrived too late and saw nothing.The Coast Guard then contacted the Lost Nation Airport in Willoughby, Ohio. Thecontrol tower operator told them that “the two bright lights” were Venus andJupiter, which were in near-alignment. The flashing lights were “gases in theatmosphere.” Never mind that Baker did not mention two bright lights, but alarge object. The Coast Guard promptly wrote a follow-up report on the originalencounter, laying the whole matter to rest. dccclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1983596] The entireseries of events was then debunked in the Cleveland Plain Dealer and othernewspapers. dccclxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1983791]Whatever the cause of the March 5 sighting, to attribute the events of March 4to Venus and Jupiter goes well beyond the boundaries of credibility. MUFON, toits credit, continued to investigate the sighting, even placing a classified adin the newspaper looking for witnesses. The tactic worked; others did comeforward, including Cindy Hale, Tim Keck, and others. All of these peopledescribed UFO activity from that night between 10 and 10:30 p.m., and alldescribed triangles. Bruce Maccabee analyzed Keck’s photograph, determining thatit was a legitimate image of an unexplained object. Years later, Shiela andHenry Baker remained adamant about what they saw. dccclxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1984059]Amazingly, according to Hudson Valley-based UFO researcher Philip Imbrogno, anumber of triangular objects were seen by multiple witnesses near the IndianPoint nuclear facility in New York State on March 4, 1988 – that is, the samenight as the sightings in Ohio. Not much in the way of followup occurred,however, and little else is known of the incident. dccclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1984491] Due to the caliber of the witnesses, the official documentary evidence, thephotographic evidence, and the intrinsic nature of the event itself, the LakeErie UFO incident must be considered one of the most compelling UFO events inmodern history. All evidence points to the conclusion that an intelligentlyoperated and enormous object came down over the Lake Erie ice; that this objectreleased several bright triangles that flew beyond the ability of any knownaircraft; that these triangles were interested in the nearby nuclear facility;that they interacted with the witnesses who observed them; that the Coast Guardofficials were convinced the event was something important; that the Coast Guarditself was prevented from pursuing this incident by higher agencies; and thatthe matter was successfully disabled by the national security apparatus and themedia.There was one other interesting triangle sighting during the spring of 1988.This took place on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, in Stafford, Britain,on the evening of May 16. A couple out on a stroll saw two triangular shapeshovering over trees. The objects were “lit up, but somehow they didn’t seem likesolid objects.” Very suddenly, they disappeared and then reappeared, thenfinally disappeared for good. The objects were “absolutely silent.” Anotherwitness saw the object through binoculars, accompanied by two neighbors. She sawit move slowly and silently across the sky, looking exactly as described by thecouple. She commented on an array of lights that were orange, red, and blue.Jenny Randles, speaking for the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) toldthe press that the sighting was probably the American stealth fighter – not yetofficially revealed but widely assumed to exist – or possibly a remotely pilotedvehicle. dccclxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1984674] It is interesting how the stealth fighter and bomber have so frequently beenused to explain UFO sightings. In this instance, the connection is specious.While both aircraft are quieter and can fly at slower speeds than previousgenerations of aircraft, they cannot simply drift across the sky or hover. Norare they silent. On top of this would be the illogic of flying a stealth fighterat low altitudes over populated British towns when the aircraft’s very existenceremained classified. Nor do they light up like Christmas trees. The theory of aremotely piloted vehicle holds more promise, although it would be a matter ofgreat significance that an RPV would be the solution to the tenacious mystery ofthe triangles. Gulf Breeze: 1988The sightings in Gulf Breeze, Florida, became a major event in UFO history notbecause Ed Walters took many photographs of unidentified objects starting in1987, nor because other people claimed to have seen the same objects. The GulfBreeze sightings became a major event because the sightings simply would notcease. Throughout 1988 and beyond, this region near Pensacola became the majorhotspot of UFO activity in the United States.Still, during 1988 it was the photographs of Ed Walters that amazed people themost and garnered most of the attention. Walter had sightings and experiencesthrough 1988, continuing to take photographs that were astounding for theirclarity and dramatic import. For example, during the evening of January 12,1988, he took what is possibly his most famous photo – a brightly lit objecthovering just above a road.The MUFON investigation began in November but it wasn’t until early January,1988, that Walters was willing to admit that he had been “Mr. X”. 19[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1769240] Localinvestigators Donald Ware and Charles Flanagan interviewed Walters at length,learning for the first time of his many sightings and photos that had not beenreported in the newspaper. They interviewed the Walters family, feeling that Edand his wife Frances were truthful. Budd Hopkins visited in February, gainingthe same impression. Hopkins then asked Bruce Maccabee to review thephotographic evidence. Maccabee was skeptical, but arrived on February 19. Afterspending several days interviewing Walters and performing photo experiments withWalters’s camera, he was still undecided. dccclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1984881] Meanwhile, Ed Walters passed two polygraph tests given by a skepticalpolygraphist, Harvey McLaughlin, on February 18 and 23, 1988. On the 26th, hetook ten photographs of a UFO with a wax-sealed stereo camera provided by ThomasDeuley and San Antonio MUFON. Walters also sketched this object, which wascigar-shaped with many lights. Walter Andrus flew to Pensacola and arranged apress conference for March 4. There, with television cameras documenting theprocess, Andrus cut away the camera’s wax seal, removed the film canister, andhanded it to the manager of a local photo service for developing. All tenexposures contained four images of the object, since each of the four lenses inthe camera had recorded an image. All images were given to local newspapers andtelevision, as well as to Deuley and Maccabee for analysis. dccclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1985082]Throughout March and April, a major sighting flap occurred in Gulf Breeze,independent of Ed Walters. Many of these cases were investigated by MUFON. OnMarch 2, one woman saw a twenty-foot long, dark oval object slowly pass througha wooded area adjoining her property. She ran outside and saw evenly spaced,round yellow-white lights. During the five minutes the lights were in view, shewas amazed that they avoided the trees as they continued in a straight linethrough the woods. dccclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1985275] During theearly evening of March 11, a minister and a babysitter observed a silentrotating disc hover nearby, then move off beyond a treeline. It gave off abluish light from “windows” on the lower half. dccclxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1985459] On the 14th,two women, while driving, followed a “disc with portholes” for three minutes. Itgave off orange light and had a ring of light underneath. At one point, it moveddirectly in front of their car. They tried unsuccessfully to photograph it.dccclxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1985716] OnMarch 17th, and 20th, Ed Walters took more UFO photos with his stereo camera,still telling the world that the anonymous “Mr. X” had taken the pictures. OnApril 28, a retired military aircraft technician saw a circular object travelingabove the treetops as he was driving. When he turned onto a road toward hishouse, he saw that it had a bright orange light at the bottom, emitted a bluebeam of light across the highway, and another beam downward. He stopped andwatched it for ten seconds or so. It was quite close to him: about 150 feet awayand 100 feet above ground. His car window was open but he heard no noise. Hedrove quickly the rest of the distance to his house and went inside to get hiswife. However, by the time they went outside it was gone. Ten to fifteen minuteslater he saw three small aircraft circle the area. dccclxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1985925] This sightingoccurred less than a mile from the location of Ed Walters’ “road shot” describedabove.There is another interesting case from that spring, although it was not reportedor investigated until the following year. At around 9 p.m., a woman whiledriving saw a very large, dark “arrowhead” or boomerang-shaped object movingabove nearby treetops. It was slow enough that a jogger could have kept up withit. She estimated it to be more than 150 feet wide, and more than 100 feet long.Around its entire perimeter were floodlight-sized white lights. She slowed downher car, and noticed other drivers doing the same. The object passed slowly overher car. Through her open sunroof, she noticed that the underside comprisedsections and panels rather than a continuously smooth surface. She drove on,apparently passed it again, and continued to see it in her rearview mirror for ashort while. The sighting lasted for five minutes. dccclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1986135] Gulf Breeze - CriticismsThe Gulf Breeze sightings were spectacular. Like those in the Hudson Valleypreviously, they were poised to break out into a major media event. Adocumentary had already been produced, and the sightings were on the ascendant.But criticisms surfaced early. In the spring of 1988, Robert D. Boyd and RayStanford argued that the Ed Walters photographs were “most probably” a hoax.Stanford was a long-time UFO investigator and photographic analyst. Studying thephotos from Walters’ first sighting, he argued that the cloud images in the skyproved that they were not taken on November 11, as Walters had claimed. However,a MUFON investigation showed that Stanford’s analysis was incorrect: Stanfordhad mixed up sighting directions. Therefore Stanford withdrew his analysis.Boyd was a member of both CUFOS and MUFON, and had been asked by Andrus to helpinvestigate. He prepared a report and then co-authored a paper with CUFOSDirector Mark Rodeghier. “Ufologists have better things to do with theirvaluable time and resources,” the two wrote, “than spend endless hours listeningto tales of UFO visitations from Mr. X.” The fact that Walters passed twopolygraphs was irrelevant – “sociopathic personalities” could be lying and stillpass such tests, they wrote. dccclxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1986318] (Walters’polygraphist, who claimed to have done several thousand such tests, laterexpressed his opinion that Ed was not a sociopath capable of faking the test.)dccclxxv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1986590] Jerome Clark of CUFOS also added what many people were thinking: thatthe photographs simply did not pass the smell test. The Gulf Breeze UFO, asphotographed by Walters, was unlike any other UFO photograph. Clark thought theimages looked like small models. The fact that “Mr. X” had photographed thisobject so many times, or that he claimed to be in some kind of telepathiccommunication with the beings inside, certainly did not help. dccclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1986797]The position of CUFOS caused a rift with MUFON’s leadership. Andrus thought someof the criticisms bordered on slander. Boyd’s report was “biased” and “in directcontradiction to good investigative practices, procedures, and policies,” Andruswrote. When Boyd pointed out that Ed Walters’ wife had not even signed anyformal statement supporting her husband, Frances Walters replied with a 27-pagerebuttal to each of the Boyd’s accusations. dccclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1986997] These early Gulf Breeze criticisms focused primarily on the photographs by EdWalters. Although this left out the already large number of other witnesses fromconsideration, it is true that Walters was always in the thick of it. StartingTuesday, April 26, 1988, Walters began a nightly “skywatch” at Shoreline Park.He wanted to find out if he could get a good stereo photo with a special“self-referencing” stereo camera he had built according to the design proposedby Bruce Maccabee. He and Frances went out during three nights. They sawnothing. On Friday, Frances had to leave with their son to attend a four-dayhigh school “band trip.” She implored Ed to stay at home during the nights thatshe was gone, but he rejected her request. He saw nothing Friday night so hewent out again Saturday night. He set up the camera on the shore at about 11:30p.m. and waited. This time he did have a sighting during which he succeeded intaking stereo photos using two Polaroid 600 LMS Sun cameras, mounted 2 feetapart and supported by a heavy tripod. It was 1 a.m. on May 1, and Walters wasin his pickup truck when he heard the familiar hum in his head. He immediatelymanned his cameras. At 1:10 a.m., he saw a lighted object in the southeast skytoward the Bob Sikes Bridge. He took excellent simultaneous photos with theright and left cameras, each image clearly showing an object with a dimhorizontal glowing line, and an intense glow coming from beneath. Walters alsonoticed a smaller lighted object closer to him. This startled him and heflinched and squeezed the right hand camera shutter button, taking one morephoto with the right camera. Immediately, he said, he was hit by a white lightand passed out. He awoke lying face down in the sand twenty feet away from hiscameras. Feeling dizzy, he walked back to his cameras and noticed that the timewas now 2:25 a.m. There was a black substance under his fingernails and a badodor emanating from his right hand. Suddenly he thought of his daughter at homealone. He immediately picked up the camera and drove home where he sat outsideher bedroom door until dawn.The next morning at home, he noticed a red mark on his forehead between hiseyes, red marks on his temples, and a bump at the back of his head. The marksremained visible for days and MUFON investigator Charles Flanagan photographedthem. During the following weeks, Maccabee analyzed the UFO images. Theexcellent parallax data, which included images of lights on the Bob Sikes bridgethat provided a reference for calculations, enabled him to deduce that thebright light was about 500 feet away and 14 feet in diameter. The smaller objectwas 134 feet away and about 3 feet long. Although a hoax was remotely possible,Maccabee concluded, it would have required exceptional photographicsophistication, well beyond the capabilities of Walters.The investigators of the case wrote in the MUFON UFO Journal that “theoverwhelming evidence is in. Gulf Breeze is indeed one of the most incrediblecases in modern UFO history....” dccclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1987425] Maccabee wasalso won over. He cited many reasons: the evidence of the stereo photographs;Walters twice passing a polygraph test; the inability of local investigators tofind any proof of hoax; an unexplained circle of dead grass behind the Waltershome; Frances’ testimony; the many UFO reports (including some with photographs)by others in Gulf Breeze; Walters’ “obvious distress” when describing toMaccabee his May 1 sighting and missing time experience just 12 hours after ithappened; Maccabee’s failure to find any reason in Walters’ background to createa UFO hoax; Walters’ continual cooperation in carrying out the many requests forinformation and his willingness to perform experiments that could have providedconclusive proof of a hoax.Walters also had gone through several psychological tests and eight hours ofhypnotic regression by Dr. Dan C. Overlade, a clinical psychologist who had beenthe President of the Florida Psychological Association. This appeared to uncovernumerous abduction experiences, including from May 1. Overlade felt that Ed wasa “classic abductee.” Like the polygraph tester, Harvey McLaughlin, Overladebelieved that Walters was sincere, entirely normal and not a sociopath.dccclxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1987859]There matters stood until late June 1988. Then, at the MUFON Symposium inLincoln, Nebraska, key members of CUFOS (including Jerome Clark, Donald Schmitt,and George Eberhard) listened to detailed analyses of the Gulf Breezephotographs by Maccabee and Andrus. Maccabee, who took about three hours topresent his complete report, did not go so far as to pronounce the Waltersphotographs to be genuine. Instead, he argued that they could not be easilywritten off as a hoax. Referring to the many other sightings in the area, hereasoned it was illogical to declare Walters’ sightings a hoax while acceptingall or any of the similar reports as true. This was especially so regardingsightings in which the witnesses claimed to have seen the same thing thatWalters photographed. dccclxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1988067] The CUFOSmembers also met with investigator Donald Ware, who presented evidence of about65 “non-Walters” sightings by Gulf Breeze residents. These objects seemed verymuch like those in Walters’ photographs. The CUFOS contingent was persuaded thattheir skeptical position was premature. Clark publicly changed his mind. “GulfBreeze proponents,” he wrote, “clearly have the lead in the debate.” Doubters,he said, first had to explain where Maccabee went wrong and what all those otherwitnesses were seeing. dccclxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1988286] But doubters remained. Researchers Richard Hall and Willy Smith admittedthe difficulties of a hoax, yet remained agnostic, perhaps skeptical. In thefollowing months they argued that claims had outstripped the evidence, and noone other than Maccabee had done any photo analysis. The claim that there were alarge number of supporting cases was “totally unfounded.” they said. Worsestill, Ed and Frances were in the process of publishing a book, which threwdoubt over their motivations, and they were even receiving help from Ware,Hopkins, and Maccabee. This lack of detachment was not scientific, argued Halland Smith – outside investigation was necessary. They were especially suspiciousof Ed Walters, and continued to suspect he was hoaxing, using his knowledge oftaking double exposures with his Polaroid camera. dccclxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1988648] Pennsylvania Wave of 1988There may well have been other areas of heavy UFO activity during 1988, butgiven the nature of UFO sightings in general, in which witnesses frequentlynever file reports, such matters are inherently difficult to judge. TheCommonwealth of Pennsylvania was fortunate, however, that it had a dedicatedresearcher in Stan Gordon, who year after year methodically accepted andinvestigated reports of UFOs and other anomalous phenomena (including Bigfootsightings). Other regions surely had fine investigators out there; Gordon justalways seemed to have more dedication than most. He was not only an activemember of MUFON and contributor to its journal, but created and ran anindependent organization called the Pennsylvania Association for the Study ofthe Unexplaned (PASU). Starting in the latter half of 1987, Gordon recorded adramatic upswing in reports of UFOs among Pennsylvania residents, mostly in thestate’s western half, which continued throughout 1988. Dozens of these remainedbaffling after an investigation.A case from February 10, 1988 occurred in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, notfar from Johnstown. That evening, several independent witnesses saw a 60-footlong object with several rows of lights. One said it looked like “a small cruiseship in the sky.” The object passed over cars and trees at an altitude between50 and 100 feet over the ground, giving off a slight humming sound andprojecting several bright beams of light toward the ground.Several bizarre cases were recorded in July in the vicinity of the Homer CityPower Plant. For several weeks, residents reported slow dropping fireballs andstrange sounds. On the night of July 17, several people saw a pair of objectswith red and green flashing lights make two criss-cross passes near thefacility. One object later dropped from the sky and made two passes about 200feet off the ground. It was about the size of a large car, circular in shape,and had four lighted legs protruding from the bottom. A hissing noise was heardas the object passed close by.In the town of Ebensburg, another small town in central-western Pennsylvania,during a sunny afternoon on September 2, a man sitting by a pond at home saw astrange object come out of the sky from the north. It moved toward him andhovered just 50 feet away from him, less than 30 feet off the ground. It wasspherical and about 15 to 20 feet in diameter. The upper section was red, andthe underside orange-red. A glass-like amber colored window divided thesections, and lights flashed inside it. He said it hovered silently for twominutes, giving off a kind of mist before it departed back toward the north.After it left, the tall grass below was swirled in a counter clockwise fashion.PASU’s last important case of 1988 took place in eastern Pennsylvania onDecember 4, in Dauphin County. A law enforcement officer driving to work at 5:25a.m. noticed a brilliant glow in the sky ahead of him. It was so bright that hecould hardly see, and he swerved to a stop. About 150 feet in the air was a75-foot long, highly polished silver object shaped like an elongated oval. Itgave a humming sound and bathed the car in intense light. It moved left andright, shot straight up in the sky and stopped. Then it departed out of sight.Afterwards, the officer felt ill, suffered from a sunburn-like effect on hisface, severe eye irritation, headache, and neck pain. The paint on his car alsoappeared to be dulled, and an unusual powder-like substance was found on thecar’s exterior. dccclxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1988904] Presidents Talking UFOsDuring his campaign to become President, George Bush was unexpectedly corneredinto making a statement regarding UFOs. On March 7, 1988, at a political rallyin Rogers, Arkansas, Bush was about to meet with reporters when a man namedCharles Huffer approached him. Carrying his tape recorder, Huffer asked Bush if,once elected President, he would “tell the truth about UFOs.” “Yeah,” repliedBush – quickly adding, “if we can find it, what it is. We are reallyinterested.” “You’ll have it, you’ll have it,” said Huffer. “It’s in there.Declassify it and tell us, ok?” “Okay, alright, yes,” Bush said as he enteredthe building to meet with the press.When Bush re-emerged some time later, Huffer was still there. Tape recorderrunning, he said, “going to hold you to that promise.” “Alright,” replied Bush.“Okay,” said Huffer, “you’re going to get it,” meaning the UFO information. Bushcleverly replied, “why don’t you send me some information about it?” he asked.“Naw,” said Huffer. “You’re a CIA man. You know all that stuff.” “I know some,”replied Bush. “I know a fair amount.”This was a very interesting revelation. The current Vice President and formerCIA Director openly stating he knew “a fair amount” about UFOs. The problem wasthat Huffer was just a private citizen, not a journalist, and so the story nevertook off. True, UFO researchers quickly learned that there had been some kind ofconfirmation made by the Vice President, but the details were unclear. Someversions had him admitting to being a member of MJ-12, which he had not done.Huffer had come close to a surprise breakthrough on the UFO cover-up. The lackof follow-up by American journalists, however, ensured that the story died bythe time Bush became President. dccclxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1989125]Two months later, on May 4, President Ronald Reagan made yet another referenceto an alien invasion. Significantly, he made it when asked what he considered tobe the most important need in international relations. “I’ve often wondered,” hesaid, “if all of us in the world discovered that we were threatened by ... apower from outer space, from another planet. Wouldn’t we all of a sudden findthat we didn’t have any differences between us at all, we were all human beings,citizens of the world, and wouldn’t we come together to fight that particularthreat?” dccclxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1989305]"},{"pageContent":" In early June 1988, Reagan met with Gorbachev in Moscow. Still, noprogress had been made on the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Soviets wantedSDI gone, and Reagan would not budge. At one point during their talks, Gorbachevasked Reagan directly, “what is SDI for? What missiles is it supposed to bringdown if we eliminate all nuclear weapons?” Reagan’s reply: “it will be therejust in case.” dccclxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1989484] The End of APROCoral Lorenzen, founder and dominant force behind the Aerial Phenomena ResearchGroup (APRO), died on April 12, 1988. Her husband James had died in 1986. TheLorenzens had never cultivated anyone to succeed them in the management of theirfar-flung organization. With her death, the remaining board members decided todissolve the group. It was a sad ending to such a noteworthy enterprise, onewhich had played such a critical role in the history of UFO research.The greatest tragedy, however, concerned APRO’s files. This consisted of 18filing cabinets filled with files, letters, photographs, fragments, andartifacts. Among its contents were the famous 1957 Ubatuba, Brazil UFO fragmentand the gloves worn by Steven Michalich during his physical encounter with a UFOat Canada’s Falcon Lake in 1967. It has been estimated that 15,000 UFO sightingreports were contained within the filing cabinets, many of which existed nowhereelse. Jim and Coral Lorenzen had wanted their files to remain together andfreely available to all researchers. Tragically, neither Lorenzen leftinstructions on this matter in a will.The APRO files could easily have gone to CUFOS, which had a reasonably goodrelationship with the Lorenzens (unlike Walt Andrus of MUFON, whom CoralLorenzen despised). Indeed, according to Mark Rodeghier, CUFOS was attempting topurchase the archive, when someone convinced Larry Lorenzen, Coral and Jim’sson, that the files should not go to CUFOS. Larry, who had no interest in UFOs,advised the APRO board not to deal with CUFOS. He also said he wanted thearchive to stay in Arizona. Rodeghier believed that “whoever spoke to LarryLorenzen did so for malicious reasons.” dccclxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1989692] Enter two individuals named Tina Choate and Brian Myers, the former ofwhom is said to have come from the wealthy and well-connected Choate family inMassachusetts. dccclxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1989959] In 1985, Myersand Choate had created a Phoenix-based UFO research group, and Choate thenpersuaded J. Allen Hynek to move to Arizona with promises of money and support.Hynek, however, quickly became disillusioned with Choate and Myers, and died thefollowing year.With their dubious Arizona-based organization now named the “InternationalCenter for UFO Research” (ICUFOR), Choate and Myers convinced the APRO Boardthat they were the most logical recipients of the files. The board members knewonly that Hynek had worked with the two, not that he had quickly soured on them.Clearly, they were able to talk a good game. They were willing to take thepriceless files off the APRO board’s hands. Thus, a year after Coral Lorenzen’sdeath, the board agreed and gave the files to Choate and Myers – free of charge!dccclxxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1990302]Years later, former APRO board member Robert Dean called the two “a couple ofscam artists,” adding that their acquisition of the files was “one of thedarkest points of my life.” dcccxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1990779] Immediately upon taking control of the files, Choate and Myers barredanyone else from reviewing them. Although ICUFOR had a small office for a while,most of the archive was apparently kept in their garage, alternately said to bein Scottsdale, Tucson, or perhaps Sedona. dcccxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1990948] But what were the pair trying to do? Several sources have described themas a contactee-oriented couple. dcccxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1991213] Eventually, itbecame clear that they had no interest in actual UFO research, and someobservers assumed they simply acted out of greed and were planning to sell thearchive for the right price. Robert Dean was one who believed this. But afterthe blunt refusal of every purchase offer, Dean later speculated that “one ofthe agencies” was involved. dcccxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1991492]It is unavoidable to speculate otherwise, even lacking proof. Two unknown peoplesweep APRO’s board off its feet, obtaining the irreplaceable APRO archives forfree, and permanently close them off to everyone, forever, and answer noquestions about the matter, to anyone. Strangeness in the Antelope ValleyGulf Breeze was not the only region in the U.S. experiencing a wave of strangeaerial sightings in 1988. Another was Southern California’s Antelope Valley, alarge, arid region east of Los Angeles. For many years, the area had been a keymilitary and aerospace center. Edwards AFB, where a great deal of flight testingoccurs, is there. USAF Plant 42 in northeast Palmdale is also there, home to –among other aerospace concerns – Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Northrop-Grumman, andBAE Systems. Among the many aviation/aerospace projects designed or produced inthe Antelope Valley were the space shuttle, the B-2 stealth bomber, and theF-117 stealth fighter. For many years the region was sparsely populated, but areal estate boom in the 1980s led to a dramatic growth in the local population.dcccxciv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1991664] During the summer and fall of 1988, residents reported variousodd-shaped objects. On July 16, a woman living in Lancaster allegedly saw twodark objects “shaped like ice cream cones” descend silently near her yard ataround dusk. They looked smaller than private planes and seemed perforated,somewhat like a fishing net. After descending, they ascended and were lost tosight. dcccxcv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1991839]Another odd sighting took place in Lancaster during the late morning of August3, when a woman saw an object come in from the northwest, hover briefly over theSierra Highway, and vanish in a matter of seconds. “It wasn’t a dirigible, itwasn’t a plane and it wasn’t a helicopter,” she told the local media. “It wasshiny ... slow. It hovered. All of a sudden, it just evaporated. It disappeared.Became invisible. It was so unusual, it stuck out like a sore thumb.” dcccxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1992003] Boomerang-shaped craft, similar to those reported across the country inthe Hudson Valley, were also being reported in the region. A multiple-witnesssighting of two such craft occurred shortly after 8:30 p.m. on October 26, 1988.These craft were very large (estimated span of 600 feet) and traveling at a mere30 mph. Stranger still, about 15 to 20 smaller disc-shaped objects followed thetwo large boomerangs. The last one of the discs flashed a light that alternatedbetween yellow and red. Later in the evening, about 150 miles to the northwest,residents of Fresno saw two similar or identical boomerangs. dcccxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1992243]Many of these UFO investigations were done by William Hamilton. Among thestranger cases was an apparent abduction event that summer concerning twoindividuals and a subterranean base. The two, named Ray and Nancy, worked at theNorthrop B-2 assembly facility in Palmdale, and had taken a midnight trip to theTehachapi Mountains. Near 1 a.m., they were watching the stars when they noticedone of them moving. They directed a flashlight at it, then saw abasketball-sized orb hovering nearby. When they woke up next morning at sunrise,the last thing they could remember was approaching the orb. Four hours of timewere missing. They knew Hamilton, who introduced them to a local hypnotist, whothen regressed Ray (Nancy refused, fearful of what she might learn). Rayremembered the two of them being abducted and taken underground. He said therewas an area near the Tehachapi Mountains called “the Kern River Project.” This,he said, was a large underground base – indeed, a city – with huge hangers,laboratories, and tunnels connecting to everywhere. Aliens were in there, too,said Ray, performing humans dissections with government knowledge. With greatdistress, he recalled grey aliens strapping Nancy to a table, but the two alsobelieved they had contact with a benevolent race of aliens who had observedtheir capture.Some months later, Ray and Nancy told Hamilton that they no longer wanted totake part in any investigation. According to Hamilton, they were afraid of beingmonitored and announced their intention to go to Bible classes. They wanted“refuge from this enormous evil that had encroached upon their lives.”dcccxcviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1992511]The reference to the “Kern River Project” is certainly odd. This was the name ofthe first interstate pipeline built in California, which began transportingnatural gas in early 1992. It took seven years to plan and build. dcccxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1992680] By early 1988,construction was well underway in the area. Why would Hamilton’s witness usethis name in conjunction with an alien-military underground facility? Was thecouple having fun at Hamilton’s expense? Judging from Hamilton’s assessment,this seems unlikely. Perhaps a delusion was involved, although much of it wouldhave been jointly shared – a “folie a deux.” Considering that both individualshad responsible jobs in the defense industry, this would be surprising. Or, wasa covert operation using a public one for cover?Enter Bill CooperUFO researchers had long been used to strange stories, but by now stories werebecoming really strange. During the summer of 1988, Jim Speiser’s Paranetbulletin board service received a post by a man claiming to have had a UFOsighting while serving as a U.S. Navy sailor onboard a submarine, the USS Tiru,in 1966. The poster added that, based on his own insider knowledge, he couldverify “50 percent” of John Lear’s 1987 paper (this would later be changed to“150 percent”). That poster’s name was Milton William Cooper. cm[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1993000] A few days after posting his submarine story, Cooper claimed on Paranetthat he had been fired from a high paying job because of his previouscommunication, as well as because he spoke with Stanton Friedman. Followingthis, he posted several files dealing with UFO information he claimed to haveseen while in the Navy. In an August 1988 posting, Cooper claimed he had held aTop Secret SI Clearance, and said that after leaving the Navy he had remainedinvolved in intelligence work until 1980. At this time, Cooper fully supportednot only John Lear, but William Moore and Jaime Shandera regarding their MJ-12research. cmi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1993196] On October 4, 1988, Cooper and Lear spoke by phone for the first time. OnOctober 8, Cooper received a FedEx package from Lear. In addition to sending hisown writings to Cooper, Lear’s package included several other historicallyimportant items.One of these was the “O. H. Krill” document. This had been written shortly afterJohn Lear’s hypothesis was published in December 1987 by an Air Forcenon-commissioned officer named John Grace. Grace had composed his thoughts onthe extraterrestrial situation, very much in line with those of Lear. Notwanting to use his own name, as he was still on USAF active duty, Grace askedLear for any ideas on a pseudonym. Lear came up with “Krill,” an inside jokereferring to an entity (“Crlll”) allegedly channelled by a woman in RobertEmmenger’s film, UFOs: It Has Begun . According to Lear, Grace added theinitials O. H. “out of thin air.” Thus, the O.H. Krill document was born. Italso seems likely that Lear sent Cooper another document written by Grace (underthe pseudonym Valdamar Valerian) entitled The Matrix . This had been privatelypublished in September 1988 with a limited print run of 100 copies, and wasessentially a much-expanded version of the O.H. Krill document. cmii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1993498] Among the Krill document’s many conclusions were that the U.S. government had alongstanding working relationship with aliens with the goal of perfectinggravitational propulsion, beam weaponry, and mind control. Advances in these andother areas vastly exceeded anything the public knew about, and the spaceprogram was a public relations cover for more serious space operations. Livealiens had been “hostage” to the U.S. government, alien autopsies had beenconducted, and abductions, murder, and mutilation had all occurred in connectionwith the UFO situation. People were being killed to hide the truth. The CIA andthe NSA were so deeply involved that exposure would threaten their veryexistence. The aliens, according to Krill/Grace, had intervened in human geneticdevelopment and religion, had bases on the Earth and Moon, and activelycontrolled elements of human society. But this was not a simple situation ofextraterrestrial beings; humans inhabited a multi-dimensional world visited by alarge number of hostile and friendly entities from other dimensions. The Krilldocument predicted an overt alien presence “within five to ten years” (e.g. by1993 to 1998).Lear also sent Cooper a version of the Zapruder film depicting the assassinationof John F. Kennedy. Lear himself had received it from an investigativejournalist named Lars Hansson. Hansson knew two men who believed that Kennedy’strue assassin had been his limousine driver, Secret Service Agent William Greer.Although skeptical, Hansson helped the two enhance the film (already a fourth orfifth generation copy) and to their shock they saw what looked like Greershooting a pistol at the moment of the fatal shot. Hansson needed financing tomake a movie; he knew that Lear had an interest in conspiracies, and assumed hewas heir to the Lear family fortune. Hansson cleaned up the tape, added titlesand narration, and mailed it to Lear. It was titled, “The Truth Betrayed, DallasRevisited.” Lear sent a copy along to Cooper. cmiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1993951] Another document Lear sent to Cooper was his personal transcription ofstatements by a former Green Beret captain named William English. These wereregarding an alleged Project Grudge/Blue Book Report #13. The USAF had releasedmany Blue Book reports, culminating in Report #14. cmiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1994155] Report #13 hadnever been published, however, and many researchers assumed it never existed.But in 1977, English was working at an RAF listening post as an informationanalyst. His job was to evaluate intelligence reports and judge each one’sprobability of being true. He claimed that in June of that year, he was asked toanalyze the 624-page Grudge Report #13.The report showed many UFO photographs from around the world, containedunsettling discussions of lopsided military encounters with UFOs, alienabductions, even more unsettling claims about missing children, and gruesomephotographs of human mutilations by aliens. There was also a great deal on theretrieval of crashed UFOs, including photos of discs and alien autopsies. Thecreatures depicted were very short, had dark bluish-grey skin, a slightlyenlarged “rounded cranium,” almond-shaped eyes, slits where a nose would be,holes where ears would be, an extremely small mouth, and no visible genitalia.Their arms were proportionately longer than a normal human arm, with the wristcoming to within 2 to 3 inches of the knee. There was no identifiable hand, butsimply three digits (no thumb) extending from the wrist. Some photos showedinternal organs, but no apparent stomach or digestive track. An analysis in thereport theorized that nourishment was taken in through mouth but that the wasteproducts were excreted through skin. The report concluded that the photosdepicted a genuine UFO crash and alien body. Startlingly, at least one signatoryto the report was J. Allen Hynek. Hynek apparently had not viewed the bodiespersonally, but had studied the photographs and autopsy reports.English’s personal story was equally spectacular, and he told it over the nextfew years with great detail, consistency, and passion. Unfortunately, it alsolacked proof of any sort, and sounded like the plot of a Hollywood movie.According to English, after he read the Grudge Report in June 1977, he wasabruptly terminated from his position and deported to the U.S. Presumably he wasnot meant to read it. He began experiencing brushes with death, including firesto his home and black limousines attempting to run him off the highway. Hejoined APRO and got to know the Lorenzens and William Moore. Moore interviewedEnglish extensively – there was no Grudge Report #13, Moore told him. Englishalso spoke privately with Allen Hynek about the report, which Hynek initiallydenied existed. However, after English heatedly confronted him about what heknew, Hynek admitted to it, but added that he would never admit it publicly.English asked Hynek “why me?” (e.g., why it was he who had to analyze thedocument and lose everything). Hynek replied, “Somebody had to do it.” cmv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1994395] Indeed, English also telephoned Linda Moulton Howe in March 1980. Heexplained his story to her and said the Grudge Report #13 was real. Howe did notknow what to believe at the time. Since this was not long before the broadcastof A Strange Harvest , there was not enough time to research English’s claims,and so the matter was not included in her documentary. Howe did, however,publish the account in her 1989 book, An Alien Harvest . cmvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1994704] Events culminated for English in 1982 when he met with his former supervisorsfrom Britain, who had also been forced out of their jobs. One of them had heardthere was an alien craft somewhere along the edge of the White Sands MissileTest Range. Because it was too large to transport, it was simply buried there.“Being the fools that we were,” English wrote, “we decided to check it out.”They purchased a van, stocked it with provisions and electronics, and drove off.Late in the evening, they reached their destination and brought out the metaldetectors. They had been there for 90 minutes, slowly poring over the area.English was walking in front; behind him were his two companions in the van,driving with the headlights on. English heard the sound of an incoming rocketand instinctively hit the dirt. The rocket hit the van and killed hiscompanions. For several days, he traveled alone at night, avoiding helicoptersand search parties. Eventually, he reached the home of Wendelle Stevens inTucson, then decided it was “time to disappear.” He trekked to San Diego, LosAngeles, and eventually his mother’s farm in Virginia. For several years heworked at radio and television stations as an announcer and cameraman.English stayed out of circulation until July 1988, when John Lear went searchingfor him and contacted his father. English did nothing until September. He gotback in touch with Wendelle Stevens (who had assumed he was dead), and thencontacted Lear, who flew to Virginia to meet with him. Privately, he told Learthat he maintained inside contacts and believed the U.S. Government definitelysupported a project dealing with UFOs and captured aliens. According to hisinformation, he said one alien being was still alive in captivity. Leartranscribed English’s statement and now sent this along to Cooper.Yet another bit of data Lear sent to Cooper was a paper on a Project“Excalibur.” This came from Lear’s new friend Bob Lazar in September, 1988.Lazar had claimed to have written the paper while working at Los Alamos, andsaid the project was about an “earth-penetrating, nuclear-tipped missiledesigned to destroy underground facilities.” cmvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1994915] Cooper spent the morning and afternoon going through it all. By his ownadmission, the experience left him “numb.” The information Lear had sent him, hesaid, “confirmed everything I personally knew and had seen first hand.” cmviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1995352] It was notlong before Cooper would create a series of breathtaking lies about thisinformation, and in so doing turn himself into a legend, of sorts. UFO Cover-Up? Live!Outer space and aliens were popular entertainment during the 1970s and 1980s.UFOs, on the other hand, were usually ignored in the major media, seldom takenseriously, and never considered in connection with conspiracy. That would be forthe next generation to deal with – and the first such attempt at this was UFOCover-Up? Live! , a two hour documentary which aired throughout North America onOctober 14, 1988.Produced by Michael B. Seligman and hosted by Mike Farrell (of TV’s “ M*A*S*H*”), the show highlighted interesting recent cases, such as the Cash-Landrumincident of 1980 and the Hudson Valley sightings. William Moore, Jamie Shandera,and Stanton Friedman were interviewed regarding Roswell and the MJ-12 documents.Alien abductions were featured, hypnotic regressions were videotaped, and BuddHopkins was pitted against a skeptical medical doctor. Rather more off thebeaten path was the alleged Holloman AFB film, said to have depicted the landingof an alien craft. Film maker Robert Emenegger said that he was shown Air Forcefootage of three flying saucers, one of which landed. Three human-sized alienscame out; they had grey complexions, large noses, tight fitting jump suits, andcommunication devices on their heads.Much of the above was already controversial within 1980s ufology, but the showalso delved into murky waters where even dedicated UFO researchers werecautious, if not skeptical. Two men described as “Falcon” and “Condor” presentedalleged inside information about the longstanding relationship between the U.S.government and extraterrestrials. Although their faces were darkened and theirvoices electronically altered, they were later identified respectively asRichard Doty and Robert Collins, both recently retired from the Air Force.The two made a number of statements on controversial topics long familiar to UFOresearchers. Regarding UFO crash retrievals, they said there had not merely beenthe one crash of a UFO at Roswell, but several. MJ-12, they said, was apolicy-making group based at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. WithPresidential approval, MJ-12 handled all ET-related matters, entrusting fieldresponsibility and policy implementation to the U.S. Navy.Much of what they said accorded with the recent statements of John Lear. Therehad been three successive alien “guests” of the U.S. government, they said, thethird of which was still alive in U.S. custody. There was also an exchangeprogram of sorts, in which one or more humans were living with the aliens. TheU.S. agreed to conceal the aliens as long as the aliens did not interfere inhuman society and agreed to operate from a base within the United States. Thisbase was in Nevada, in a place called “Area 51” or “Dreamland.” (This was thefirst time Area 51 was ever mentioned on television). Within their designatedarea, the ETs had complete control, although human scientists were very muchinvolved in studying and testing alien technology. Indeed, according to Falcon,the Cash-Landrum sighting had actually been an alien craft piloted by themilitary that had developed flight problems.But it was the show’s discussion of the aliens that really turned heads. Thesewere described as less than four feet tall, with large eyes, almost no nose, andinsect-like in appearance – rather different from Emenegger’s aliens. Theirbrains were highly complex and their IQs were believed to exceed 200. They hadfour fingers with no thumb, and their feet were web-like. They normally livedbetween 350 and 400 Earth years.There was a book known as “The Bible,” containing a history of relations withthe extraterrestrials from the Truman era through the present, as well astechnological and biological data about the aliens (including autopsy data), andeven information of their social and political structure. A “Yellow Book” waswritten by the second alien guest. It discussed their origin (the Zeta Reticulistar group), culture, and interactions with humans. There was also a crystalwhich could display images of the alien home planet or of Earth’s distant past.The aliens had a religion of sorts, in which they posited the universe itself asa supreme being. They were said to enjoy all types of music, and were most fondof ancient Tibetan music. They liked eating vegetables, but their favorite snackwas strawberry ice cream. cmix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1995563] Years after the show aired and was all-but-forgotten, people rememberedthe remark about strawberry ice cream. But herein lies the failure of thedocumentary, in which so much had been possible and nothing accomplished. Theshow’s chief writer, Barry Taff, expressed disgust at how the hard work and goodintentions of the show’s researchers were wasted by producer Seligman. When theoriginal treatment and teleplay were presented, Seligman allegedly told Taffthat the subject matter was too serious: he wanted “copy, schlock, camp... notscreenwriting.” Attempts to persuade Seligman to use FOIA documents were to noavail. cmx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1995778] Italso appears there were other forces and motives at work. In Bill Moore’s ownwords, “some of the stuff on the show was real, and some was disinformation.”Unfortunately, he never expanded on this statement, or revealed which was which.cmxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1995978] With a few exceptions (Walt Andrus called it “outstanding” cmxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1996130] ), mostufologists were unimpressed, even appalled. Bill English was furious. For years,Moore had been claiming that English was lying about Grudge Report #13. NowEnglish watched in disbelief as Moore’s “two song birds” parroted everythingthat he had been saying all along. “If I’m a liar,” said English, “what doesthis make him?” cmxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1996314]Most interesting was the absence of commentary by the mainstream media orpolitical community. Major claims had been made on national television which, ifeven one of them were true, should have caused a political firestorm. Butresearchers scoured the broadcast and print media in vain for any word on theshow. The resultant vacuum prompted one long-time UFO afficionado, booksellerRobert Girard, to wonder whether the program was a test of a “conditioningprogram” designed to deaden the public with mindless entertainment As he put it,... time was – until very recently – that some spokesperson would have to stepin and save the day when the masses showed signs of paying too much attention toa flurry of UFO activity. But the last 12 months have seen a steady barrage ofleaks of highly sensitive UFO information (or disinformation – actually, it nolonger matters which), and a series of books which just a few years ago wouldhave been soundly suppressed in the ‘interests of national security.’ cmxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1996625]This was true. A program like UFO Cover-Up? Live! would have been unthinkable inearlier decades, precisely because the public reaction would have beenexplosive. Girard had discovered a profound truth: that a deft combination ofdisinformation, entertainment, spin, and public apathy were more effective atconcealing truths than old-fashioned, heavy-handed censorship. Into the Dark SideFOIA and Leonard Stringfield had begun the politicization of ufology during thelate 1970s, making it clear that a major cover-up was under way. By 1987, theMJ-12 controversy had taken center stage in this process. Now, just a yearlater, ufology had become the Lear and Cooper Show or, as many were now puttingthe matter, “the dark side” had taken over ufology.Cooper’s actual credentials have long been debated. His 1975 honorable dischargefrom the U.S. Navy showed an E-6 paygrade and the rank of Quartermaster FirstClass. There is some evidence, although not conclusive, to show Cooper did havea connection to UFOs at that time. Researcher Linda Moulton Howe spoke to aclose friend of Cooper’s from the early 1970s, named Robert Swan. Swan had evenbeen the best man at Cooper’s wedding in 1972. In 1989, he told Howe that he andCooper used to discuss UFOs frequently. Swan was not in the military, and therewere things Cooper simply could not discuss. But Cooper did tell Swan that“every space flight was accompanied by UFOs.” Swan also said that the nightbefore Cooper’s wedding, he was shown “some documents which I believe to beclassified information. It was about an alien base on the back side of theMoon,” as well as other unspecified matters. Years later, Swan still believedthe documents were legitimate and true. “Unfortunately,” he continued, “all Ican remember is space shots and the bases on the Moon.... Discussions of theassassination of JFK came up but I cannot remember where they led. I have giventhat evening a great deal of thought ... this is all I can come up with.” Headded that Cooper had given him copies of certain documents that night as a kindof insurance, but they had disappeared. cmxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1996805]It appears, then, that Cooper had a longstanding interest in UFOs. The fact thatSwan could not remember anything relevant pertaining to the Kennedyassassination, however, is intriguing. One would think that anyone wouldremember the claim that Kennedy’s driver was the killer – unless one argues thatCooper would have deliberately held such information back. The few matters Swandid recall are interesting, but they are different from the themes Cooper wasworking in the late 1980s. Some time later, John Lear stated that, while hedoubted much of Cooper’s story, he still believed that Cooper had learned a fewthings about UFOs while in the Navy. cmxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1997140] Whatever Cooper knew during his years of military service is unlikely to beproven. What is beyond question, however, is that by 1988 he had a hair-triggertemper, a penchant for drink that only made him meaner, and an evident abilityto believe fanatically anything he said. Such qualifications would soon enableWilliam Cooper to become the most famous person in UFO research, especiallyamazing since he was never a researcher.The combined effect of Lear’s FedEx package and UFO Cover-Up? Live! affectedCooper deeply. Back in August 1988, he had spoken with great gravity on “TopSecret Magic-Restricted Data,” and claimed that the MJ-12 documents produced byMoore were “photographic copies of genuine documents which were procured atgreat risk.” Now, on October 15, 1988, just a week after receiving Lear’smaterials (and one day after the airing of UFO Cover-UP? Live! ), Cooperannounced to Paranet that any document using the term “Magic” (sic) was a fraud,and that he could prove “beyond a shadow of a doubt ... that most of theinformation released by William Moore, et al.... are obvious and deliberateforgeries.” His public explanation for the turnaround was that he had beentesting researchers all along.Cooper also began to make other suspiciously timely claims. He, too, had readGrudge Report #13 during the early 1970s, while in the U.S. Navy’s Intelligencesection, CINCPAC. He, too, had known about Kennedy’s limo driver, William Greer,from another report he had read at that time. Kennedy, Cooper would soon tellthe world, was about to say the wrong things about UFOs and had to be silenced.20 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1769483] Cooper soonwent further. He would soon tell the world that he had also read the KrillReport, again while he was in “Naval Intelligence” during the early 1970s! When,in the spring of 1989, John Lear asked Cooper incredulously how he could makesuch a claim – when the Krill Report had obviously been written in early 1988and for which Lear himself had contributed the title – Cooper called Lear a liarand CIA disinformation agent. And that would be that.Thus, by late October 1988, Paranet administrator Jim Speiser was seeing hisbrainchild being dragged into the mud. Another disturbing development convincedhim that Cooper was a menace who had to be stopped. Speiser had met a young mannamed Jeff Felix who claimed to have been an NSA cryptology technician. Felixclaimed that while “fooling around” on the NSA computer, he had stumbled acrossthe Majestic and Aquarius files. Speiser spoke to several people withintelligence backgrounds and returned to Felix with follow-up questions to testwhether he was legitimate. According to Speiser, Felix failed the test. Felixdid mention, however, something called “Project X-calabur” (sic). When Speiserasked Cooper during a phone call if he had heard about this project, Cooper saidhe had, but that it was very top secret and knew nothing else about it. Laterthat same day, Cooper called Speiser back and said that “Project Excalibur” wasa project by MJ-12 to extract technology from extraterrestrials. At this point,Speiser became deeply suspicious of Cooper.On top of this, it must be remembered that Lear had sent Cooper information on aProject Excalibur, courtesy of Bob Lazar. Lazar’s version was not aboutextraterrestrials, but about missiles that would destroy underground facilities.Lazar later heard Cooper talking about this project, claiming to have knownabout it in the early 1970s, which would have been an impossibility.As a result, on October 26, 1988, Speiser ejected Cooper and Lear from theParanet BBS. cmxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1997418] At the time,it was a significant move, as there were few places on the nascent Internet forin-depth UFO-related discussion. But even at this early stage, there was oneother place: the CompuServe network.On December 18, 1988, Cooper made another statement about MJ-12 and alien lifeforms. He claimed to have seen two key reports while serving as a quartermasterwith an intelligence briefing team for U.S. Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, Commanderin Chief of the Pacific Fleet. These were the Project Grudge/Blue Book Report #13 and the “Majesty Briefing.” His description of the Grudge Report # 13 wasvery close to that of William English, while the “Majesty Briefing” containedinformation on the alien presence on Earth. Cooper released names and summariesof various secret projects and terms, including Aquarius, Pounce, Pluto,Redlight, Snowbird, Luna, Gabriel, Excalibur, ALF, and others. Redlight was totest fly recovered alien craft, Snowbird was a cover for Redlight. Gabriel was aproject to develop a low frequency pulsed sound generator, believed to beeffective against alien craft. Luna was a code name for an alien undergroundbase in New Mexico, and Excalibur was to develop a ground penetrating weaponsystem to destroy underground alien bases (not, as he had recently told Speiser,to extract technology from extraterrestrials). Cooper mentioned an alien base onthe far side of the Moon, which had been seen by Apollo astronauts. He alsomentioned the “National Reconnaissance Organization” – the existence of theNational Reconnaissance Office (NRO) was still classified in 1988, although ithad been exposed in the New York Times in 1985. cmxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1997734] ALF was anabbreviation for “alien life form” – ironically, Cooper neglected to mentionthat “ALF” was a sitcom television show that ran from 1986 to 1990, dealing withan “alien life form” secretly living with an Earth family. Whether this was ajoke on his part, or someone else’s part, or whether the television showproducers were provided with inside knowledge is anybody’s guess. 21[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1769726] Cooperdiscussed alien “guests” held in exchange for humans who had become “guests” ofthe aliens. He also said there was an alien craft at a hangar in Edwards AFB inCalifornia, heavily guarded by “non-Edwards personnel, NRO-Delta forces.”On January 10, 1989, Cooper revised his statement. This time, instead of givingthe title “Majesty Briefing” for one of the reports, he said the actual titlewas “Majority Briefing.” The reason he gave a different title this time was thathe was testing “the reactions of people, especially the government, to the wrongnames in the first version.” From Cooper’s perspective, in which he argued hislife was in danger and enemies were everywhere, this could be seen as a clevertactic. Naturally, detractors could point out that he had a history of makingmistakes in his pronouncements, then needing to perform the requisite clean-up.One thing is certain, by the time 1989 had arrived, the field of UFO researchhad been turned upside down. What had recently been dominated by an enclosedgroup of researchers was now a wide-open field where a flurry of newcomers, mostof them not true researchers but claiming deep inside knowledge, were trumping –or appearing to trump – the old guard who had relied on the conventional methodsof cautious argumentation and fact checking through use of open sources. Thereis no question that the advent of computerized bulletin boards were a criticaldevelopment in this process. “Scientific ufology” this certainly was not. Thereal question, however, was whether it was getting closer to the truth.If so, Cooper could not claim any credit. There is no evidence that he hadanything to contribute, except stories stolen from other people – primarily viaLear – which he claimed as his own. It is easy to conclude that Cooper was aliar, plain and simple. This could well have been so, except that in the opinionof several people who knew him, he seemed very sincere. It has been suggestedthat Cooper was not so much a manipulative deceiver as someone who was naive andeasily manipulated. Getting to the bottom of William Cooper, however, is adifficult undertaking. All that can be said for certain is that he entered theUFO field, latched on to stories that were then circulating, and promptly laidwaste. Revealing Stealth SecretsThe F-117A Night Hawk stealth fighter, built by Lockheed, had been secretlyoperational since 1983. Through the 1980s, there were a few instances in whichsightings of the aircraft had to be covered up by the authorities. But by 1988,the Air Force wanted to expand its operations for the F-117A, including daytimeflights. It would be impossible to keep the secret much longer. cmxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1997949] Then there wasthe problem of the new stealth bomber: the Northrop B-2 Advanced TechnologyBomber, of which the USAF was expecting to develop a fleet of 132. Some sort ofadmission became as obvious as it was inevitable. cmxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1998108] Thus, on November 10, 1988, the U.S. Air Force made a virtue ofnecessity and revealed the existence of the F-117A. Less than two weeks later,on November 22, it also displayed the B-2 – surely one of the most distinctiveaircraft in aviation history. cmxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1998249] Acknowledgingthese two aircraft to the world was good public relations: little hard data wasactually given, and the Soviets already knew in general terms that Americans haddeveloped stealth technology. cmxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1998448] Both majorpowers had developed an impressive system of global signals intelligence; verylittle was being hidden from each other. cmxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1998630] But there remained important secrets. Although the Pentagon gave somegeneral information about the B-2’s outward design and stealth capabilities, itwas silent about much else. Indeed, two decades later, the U.S. Air Force hasstill never revealed any image of the B-2 with its access panels removed thatshow the engine placement. However, in the early 1990s, black-world scientistsdisclosed to Aviation Week and Space Technology that the B-2 electrostaticallycharged its leading edge wing with a high positive charge, while a stronglynegative charge was given to the exhaust gasses. cmxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1999146] What thismeant was that the B-2 could in fact have an electrogravitic propulsion system.22 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1769928] Electrogravitics had been pioneered by American scientist ThomasTownsend Brown. Following on concepts derived from Nicola Tesla, Brown’sresearch from the 1920s onward led him to conclude that an electric field couldpolarize an object, and that this in turn could counteract or alter the effectsof gravity. Brown maintained that this effect was different from well-knownelectrostatic effects, and that electrogravitics could be used as a means ofpropulsion for aircraft and spacecraft. During 1956 and 1957, enthusiastic talkof electrogravitics made it into the mainstream press, then disappeared. Thereason for the sudden disappearance has been disputed. Conventional opinionholds that the research hit a dead end and nothing worthwhile came of it. Itsurely did not help that Brown was intensely interested in UFOs – he was theoriginal founder of NICAP in late 1956. The connection to UFOs is one reason whymainstream scientists avoided electrogravitics for so long. There are scientificobjections, however, to electrogravitics as a form of propulsion. A 2005 paperon the Levi-Civita effect (which shows distortion of the spacetime metric byelectric and magnetic fields) shows that, at least in terms of present generalrelativity theory, the field strengths generated by high-voltage electrograviticexperiments have been too weak for practical use. cmxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1999442] Still, others have argued that electrogravitic research went “black”during the 1950s. cmxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos1999732] Regarding theB-2, the idea is that the high electrical charge of the aircraft would, intheory, create a kind “gravity well” in front and a “gravity hill” behind. Oncethis was established, one could shut off the engine and ride a gravitationalwave. Considering the awesome cost of each B-2 (more than $1 billion each in thebeginning, and more than $2 billion each by the end), perhaps some of that costwent in this direction. Such was the speculation in AWST .The AWST article prompted Dr. Paul LaViolette, an expert in electrogravitics, toexpand on the matter. In 1993, he proposed that the B-2 was essentially arealization of Townsend Brown’s patented electrogravitic aircraft. Anelectrogravitic drive would enable the B-2 to cut its fuel consumption possiblyto zero under high speed flight conditions. It would essentially be able tocreate “an artificial gravity field.” A caveat was that the system could only beused under dry flying conditions. cmxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2000203] The concept met with skepticism or outright dismissal within the mainstream.Yet, as late as 2000, the respected aviation writer, Bill Gunston, studied thespecifications of the B-2 and concluded that it was vastly underpowered – unlessthere was a way to reduce its mass or increase its lift beyond conventionalaerodynamic means. “I have numerous documents, all published openly in theUnited States,” wrote Gunston,... which purport to explain how the B-2 is even stranger – far, far stranger –than it appears.... They deal with such topics as electric-field propulsion, andelectrogravitics (or anti-gravity), the transient alteration of not only thrustbut also a body’s weight. Sci-Fi has nothing on this stuff. cmxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2000449]Indeed, the B-2’s official thrust/weight ratio is 0.205, obviously a far cryfrom fighter aircraft, some of which have a ratio in excess of 1.0 (enablingvertical ascent). But even for a bomber, it is very low, possibly the lowest forany major bomber aircraft in the world. By comparison, the B-52 Stratofortressand B-1B Lancer have more typical ratios of 0.31 and 0.37, respectively. cmxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2000636] Still, theclaim that the B-2 is underpowered has not gone unchallenged. As the aircraft is“a pure flying wing,” its thrust/weight ratio can be deceptive. Unliketraditional aircraft with a fuselage and stabilizers to create drag, all of theB-2’s surface creates lift. For cruise purposes, at least, some analysts believethe B-2 to be adequately powered. cmxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2000903] Nevertheless,it seems strange that an aircraft which costs from $737 million to over $2billion each (depending on how many costs one wishes to factor in), has such amediocre official flight performance. cmxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2001217] Nick Cook, a senior aviation editor at Jane’s Defense , also examinedclaims about the B-2. He asked a Northrop-Grumman spokesman whether the B-2charged its surface electrostatically. “Absolutely not,” was the answer, as sucha system “would fry the onboard electronics.” However, a physics consultant ofCook’s called the spokesman “either an idiot or a liar.” Cook then learned that“Northrop won the contract based on its use of electrostatics to make itultra-stealthy.” Although he personally doubted the B-2 employed anyanti-gravity, Cook learned that electrostatics “improved [the B-2’s] aerodynamicefficiency and reduced its drag.” cmxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2001830] One matter regarding such claims comes immediately to mind: if it is true thatthe B-2 used electrostatics, or some form of electrogravitics, and furthermorethat such a system could generate substantial savings in fuel, the implicationsfor commercial aviation would be extraordinary. There is little question thatthere would be many angry individuals and groups in the “white world” over thehoarding of such classified knowledge for so long. Considering the astoundingamount of fuel expended by commercial airliners every day, such anger could bevery difficult to assuage.As an aside it is worth noting that during the late 1980s, there were manyrumors in the aerospace community of a stealthy reconnaissance aircraft capableof Mach 6 – the fabled Aurora . Even the New York Times in February 1988 hadreported insider Pentagon allegations that the Air Force was working on anaircraft of this type. Subsequent attempts to follow-up, however, ran into adead-end. cmxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002005] Well into the1990s, Ben Rich at Lockheed’s Skunkworks Division denied the existence of theAurora, but never offered a plausible explanation for what Lockheed had been upto since the last F-117A had been built in 1990. In the opinion of aviationexperts, neither the YF-22 prototype nor F-22A Raptor could account for thetremendous activity going on at Skunkworks. cmxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002198] Actually,there never appears to have been a flying vehicle called Aurora , although thereseem to have been hypersonic craft that fit the general description. In alllikelihood, the aircraft mistakenly known as Aurora has gone under one or moreof the following codenames: Blackstar, Copper Coast, Copper Canyon, BrilliantBuzzard, and Centennial. According to aviation researcher Michael Schratt, it isa virtual certainty that America had been building trans-atmospheric vehicles(TAV), despite the absence of official acknowledgment. cmxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002359] Deniability on such matters, to say nothing of UFOs, would be impossiblewithout the active cooperation from the major players in the news media. Lestone entertain the notion that the major media outlets functioned as a true“watch dog” for the general public, consider the words of Washington Postpublisher Katherine Graham in 1988. That year, Graham told a CIA gathering:... there are some things the general public does not need to know andshouldn’t. I believe democracy flourishes when the government can takelegitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether toprint what it knows.” cmxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002559]When the publisher of one of the nation’s leading journals of record makes astatement like this, it is easy to understand why the rank and file of Americanjournalism is generally unwilling to challenge national security strictures. Itis also easy to fear for the health of a democratic society. The Norton/Lockheed ARVEven more sensitive than the specifications of the B-2 or probabletrans-atmospheric vehicles was the astounding event of November 12, 1988. Onthat day, Norton AFB in California held an open house and air show. According tothe detailed statement of one individual, a hangar at Lockheed’s Palmdalefacility the same day contained what appeared to be three fully functioningflying saucers. Within classified circles, this type of craft is known as the“Alien Reproduction Vehicle” (ARV), as well as the Flux Liner. cmxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002716] Aviation illustrator Mark McCandlish received this account directly from aclose friend, aviation designer Brad Sorensen. McCandlish has twice held secretsecurity clearances, and has done extensive conceptual art for leading aerospaceindustry defense contractors. The two had planned to attend the airshowtogether, but McCandlish had other last-minute obligations. Sorensen attendedthe airshow at Norton that day, accompanied by a friend. This was no ordinaryfriend, but a very important gentleman. According to Sorensen, he had beenprominent within the Department of Defense – although Sorensen never revealedhis identity, the person had been either a former Secretary or Undersecretary.While they were at Norton, Sorensen’s friend said “follow me.” They walked tothe other end of the airfield, away from the crowds, and arrived at an enormoushangar – nicknamed “The Big Hangar” at the base. This was surrounded by a cordonand military police armed with M-16 rifles. Sorensen’s companion requested thatone of the guards go inside and bring out an acquaintance of his, who was incharge of the show. The two men recognized one-another, and when the man incharge inquired about Sorensen’s presence, Sorensen’s companion said thatSorenson was his “aide.”At this point the story becomes somewhat confusing. Sorensen originally toldMcCandlish and others that the exhibit of exotic craft took place within the BigHangar. In later tellings he added a twist: that in fact the demonstration didnot occur at Norton. Rather, the group was escorted aboard an Air Forcepassenger jet and flown 50 miles northwest to Palmdale. They arrived at theLockheed Skunkworks facility at the west end of the complex, and it was herethat the entire exhibit was held. It appears Sorensen was originally trying towithhold certain pieces of the story.They entered the Lockheed hangar, and it was obvious that the exhibit was forpoliticians and military officials who were cleared for high-securityinformation. As McCandlish and aviation researcher Michael Schratt later put it,“the expressed purpose of the exhibit was to garner additional support forclassified ‘black,’ or SAR ‘special access required’ programs.” cmxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2002993] Evidently,Sorensen’s powerful friend was surprised by the magnitude of what was inside. Hetold Sorensen:There are a lot of things in here that I didn’t expect they were going to haveon display – stuff you probably shouldn’t be seeing. So, don’t talk to anybody,don’t ask any questions, just keep your mouth shut, smile and nod, but don’t sayanything – just enjoy the show. We’re going to get out of here as soon as wecan.The pair were shown several fascinating aircraft, each of which had a plaquehighlighting their various specifications. Among these were theLockheed-Rockwell losing competitor to the Northrop B-2. There were also twoadvanced hovercraft, which later went to the commercial market. Finally, therewas a flattened football, diamond-shaped aircraft, known as the Pulser or“Flaming Pumpkinseed.” This last craft was an unmanned vehicle which couldlaunch a 1/10th megaton warhead within less than a tenth of a second. Accordingto Schratt, 18 of these extremely fast and stealthy craft were built during theReagan Administration. Its exterior also featured the same heat ablative thermalresistant tiles that were used on the space shuttle, strongly indicative of atrans-atmospheric capability and mission. cmxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2003205] But it turnsout this was only the warm-up.A large black curtain divided the hangar into two areas. Behind the curtain wasa large, darkened area. The men turned on the lights and saw an astonishingsight. In McCandlish’s words, they saw “three flying saucers floating off thefloor – no cables suspended them from the ceiling holding them up, no landinggear underneath – just floating, hovering above the floor.”The three objects were all of different size: 24 feet, 60 feet, and 130 feet indiameter. One of them had some panels removed, and Sorensen saw large oxygentanks inside. He meticulously noted that the tanks were between 16 and 18 inchesin diameter and about 6 feet long. An interesting feature of the craft was asmall articulated robotic arm. Evidently, this could be extended, perhaps forreleasing satellites or collecting samples. cmxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2003483]Nearby, a general (number of stars unclear) was speaking at a lectern to a groupof people. He referred to the vehicles as “Alien Reproduction Vehicles,” also asthe Flux Liner (because they used high voltage electricity). He mentionedseveral fascinating features of the ARV. One was that it could perform at “lightspeed or better.” Another was that it ran on energy obtained through the vacuum– presumably this is the zero point energy field, better describedscientifically as the “quantum zero point fluctuations of the vacuum.” It hadextraordinary acceleration and maneuverability, able to move from a ground-levelhovering position to 80,000 feet within 2.5 seconds. 23[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1770313] It was alsoapparently stated that the ARV had by this time already performed a generalreconnaissance of all planets of the solar system in a search for life, and thatno life was found. Sorensen noted that the ARV looked “ancient” and as though ithad been used extensively. A video exhibit nearby showed the smallest of thethree vehicles hovering over a dry lake bed. It made three quick, hoppingmotions, then accelerated straight up and out of sight within seconds. It wasunclear whether the vehicle was silent, or whether the tape simply lacked sound.Sorensen observed as carefully as he could. Eventually, he told McCandlish whathe had seen. Not all was revealed right away; the process took several months.Sorensen never sought publicity about this, and over the years spoke only to avery select few investigators – not always in the most forthcoming manner. Henever confirmed the identity of his distinguished benefactor.In 1992, McCandlish met a man named Kent Sellen who had been a crew chief atEdwards AFB years before. In 1973, Sellen unintentionally went into an areawhere he saw a craft exactly matching the description of Sorensen’s ARV. At thatpoint, he was thrown to the ground at gunpoint, blindfolded, taken into custodyand interrogated about his presence there and what he thought he had seen.Sellen even provided McCandlish with details and data about the object that hadbeen unknown to Sorensen. cmxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2003754]It would appear, then, that this was a fully operational American-made spaceship– not merely a liquid propelled space shuttle. The statement about derivingenergy from the vacuum is suggestive, naturally, of zero point energy. This isintriguing because the seminal work in ZPE by Dr. Hal Puthoff was in itsearliest stages. cmxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2003932] If true, itwould mean that “black world” science had achieved a substantial, revolutionarybreakthrough on this matter well ahead of “white world” science. This issue hasbeen debated over the years: can major scientific breakthroughs be made outsidethe open, public world of science, where a much larger exchange of ideas andtalent would theoretically exist? Many scientists think not. However, with anenormous supply of money, and the ability to create a massive classifiedscientific infrastructure, is it really impossible? Consider how for decades theCold War itself inhibited the exchange of scientific ideas among so manyintellectual disciplines. It can truly be said that, to a large extent,Soviet-bloc and western societies represented two fundamentally separateinfrastructures that co-existed and competed for generations. Could not aclassified infrastructure, with sufficient money – perhaps unfettered by legal,environmental, or ethical restrictions – become a rival to, or even master of,the official infrastructure?In early 1995, a video was leaked to the television show Hard Copy that showed avery unusual object zipping around the airspace of what was later confirmed tobe Nellis Test Site. It had been captured in flight by radar-controlled trackingcameras. Two range operators could be heard discussing the object, mystified atwhat they were seeing. “I don’t know what the hell that is,” one of them said,“that’s a helo [helicopter], isn’t it?” “What is that?” “I have no idea!” “It’sweird looking!” and so on.In addition to showing the image itself, the video displayed the time, radarreturn signal, continuous range, bearing, and height readings of the object.This made it possible for analysts to conduct a detailed study. At certainpoints in the video, the object looked as though it could change shape, althoughthis cannot be certain. At times, it looked like a smaller version of the ARV,roughly 15 feet across and 10 feet high. Within just a few minutes, it moved asslowly as 30 mph and as fast as 700 mph. It made a right angle turn atapproximately 140 mph. cmxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2004521]The Nellis UFO can be reasonably conjectured to be in some sort of relationshipto the Norton/Lockheed ARV. It may be the same type of craft, or perhaps a latergeneration. Its basic shape looked the same, and its flight characteristics werecomparable to those attributed to the ARV.A final comment on the ARV. Its very name, “Alien Reproduction Vehicle,”obviously implies that it was built by reverse engineering an actual aliencraft. How such a craft was obtained – whether via the Roswell crash, othercrashes, or some other means – was not indicated by Sorensen. It does, however,lend support to the idea of UFO crash retrieval, which had been developed duringthe previous decade by Stringfield, Friedman, and others. Sightings in the World, 1988Outside of the United States, there were few especially dramatic UFO sightingsduring 1988. A few interesting instances of triangular craft were observed inBritain, most notably in September 1988, when many people in Essex saw a largeblack object that appeared triangular. It was said to be silent, very low in thesky, and had red, green, and yellow lights. cmxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2004907] More unusualaerial activity was reported the following month, in Kent and Sussex. Theseincluded police and civilian witnesses, all giving similar descriptions,typically of an oval-shaped object with four bright white lights and a red lightin the center, flying low, and giving off a deep hum. Two witnesses said theobject suddenly climbed vertically into the evening sky. cmxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2005066] The Soviet Union also had a few UFO events, the most notable occurringin September. That month, two bright, fiery spheres were said to have beenobserved over the nuclear reactor at the Kiev Research Institute. They gave offbright red rays, and were described as almost identical to the UFOs claimed tohave been over Chernobyl in 1986. cmxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2005224] On the 17th ofSeptember, two separate cars near Vladivostok had close encounters with a UFO.One driver lost control of his car. Another report, undated, from the KrasnoyeZnamia (Red Banner) newspaper, discussed an entire section of Vladivostok beingilluminated between 2 and 4 a.m. by an unknown beam of light. cmxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2005404]SummaryTwo short years changed UFO research dramatically. The MJ-12 revelations hadsplit the field and opened up many new research leads. Even considering theargument that the documents could have been planted in some way by theintelligence community, they had led to such individuals as Dr. Eric Walker.There appeared to be fire as well as smoke.The documents were problematic for several reasons, including lack of knownprovenance as well as alleged intrinsic features. One could look at thedocuments in two ways. They could feasibly be variations of a legitimatedocument, one of presumably several versions, some of which may have beendestroyed, others still existing. It is not hard to imagine that factions coulddevelop among those with a “need to know,” that the decision-making procedureeven on something as important as the UFO cover-up is not monolithic, and thatas a result certain documents with a genuine pedigree could be leaked.They also certainly could be fakes. If so, there is only one scenario that seemsfeasible. This would be an intelligence community operation, as evidenced by theApril 9, 1983 meeting between Richard Doty and Linda Moulton Howe. Thatencounter proves beyond any reasonable doubt that some version of the MJ-12documents was being disseminated by Air Force intelligence. If Moore was laterinvolved in creating or faking the documents, all evidence points to his doingso in a helper-type role. Of course, if the documents were fakes, the mostlogical purpose would be to disable the genuine threat that was then being posedto UFO secrecy. By the 1980s, there were two such threats: the newly releasedFOIA documents and the growing number of UFO crash retrieval stories. Neitherhad been significant prior to the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, their ultimateimpact was still an unknown factor. Disinformation in the form of falsedocuments and stories could well have been the most effective counterstrike.Either way then, as authentic or fakes, the MJ-12 documents point to theimportance of the UFO topic to the U.S. intelligence community.But the MJ-12 leaks were only part of the story of these pivotal years. Althoughthese were not the most dense years of UFO sightings, several cases providedstrong evidence that somebody’s technology was flying about – technology thatappeared to be far beyond anything that was supposed to exist. It seems unlikelythat all of these sightings were “ours,” but surely some could have been,especially when reviewing certain leaks emanating from the world of secrecy,most specifically the so-called ARV. It is of course unknown how much truth isinherent in such leaks, but it is undeniable that they were increasing. It makesperfect sense that if UFO crash retrievals had ever taken place, programs wouldbe created to exploit them. By the 1980s, it is possible that breakthroughscould have been made. If, however, the ARV did represent a breakthrough inpropulsion, and if it occurred by way of using the “vacuum,” then it did so in away that contemporary “white world” scientists still do not understand.Behind all the change of 1987 and 1988 was the revolutionary presence ofpersonal computers and the young Internet. Although it was nothing like theWorld Wide Web of later years, the bulletin board system was radical enough toenable a dramatic expansion of communication among researchers and otherinterested parties. Like all major changes, the results were positive andnegative. More communication meant more fresh ideas; it also meant a greaterfrequency of irresponsible and disruptive people becoming involved. For betterand for worse, the playing field had opened up. Chapter 8 Into Dreamland and Beyond1989-1990 . . . almost as if it were fashioned out of wax and then slightly melted.― Bob Lazar, describing an alleged flying saucer at Groom Lake, Nevada,1989.We are being manipulated by a joint human/alien power structure which willresult in a one-world government and the partial enslavement of the human race.― William Milton Cooper, 1989.The whole story of Government/ alien involvement, treaties with aliens,underground bases, a plot to take over the planet . . . . was all cooked up bythe counter-intelligence people for the purpose of discrediting [Paul]Bennewitz.― William Moore, 1993.The UFO hovered above the ground and then flew with a speed exceeding that ofmodern jet fighters by two or three times. . . .

The Bush White HouseOn January 20, 1989, George Bush became the 41st U.S. President. He generallycontinued Reagan’s policies while tweaking a few areas. Relations with theSoviets underwent a full review – Bush and his key advisors 24[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1770577] (wrongly)concluded that Gorbachev’s reforms were “cosmetic.” Although they understoodthat the Brezhnev era was long gone, they noted that the Soviets were stillgiving weapons to the hated Sandinistas, and in any case a military coup seemedlike an ever-present possibility. The future still looked unpredictable.Attitudes toward the Strategic Defense Initiative also changed. Bush neverexpressed the zeal for this program that Reagan had shown. His public statementsstressed that the technology was too expensive and too exotic; he wonderedwhether it was diverting funds from more practical, conventional needs. cmxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2005686] Conventionalanalyses of Star Wars have called it a “brilliant failure” – the first time thatspace was considered seriously as a theater of war, and a program that led toantisatellite (ASAT) systems, “the inevitable next step of warfare.” cmxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2006069] Such anunderstanding of SDI leaves out the many rumors of a covert side, one that wasrelated to UFOs. Whether a shift away from SDI led into more deeply secret spaceprograms is another possibility. The demonstration of the ARV had taken placeimmediately after George Bush’s election victory. It therefore looked as thoughthe real space program was going to continue just fine, no matter what happenedto the very public SDI. A study of available data from the DSP satellites, forinstance, makes it clear that fastwalkers were being tracked on a regular basis,with information going to Air Force Intelligence and the NRO, at the very least.A covert component to the SDI program would appear to be a “no brainer.” It mustbe considered that the de-emphasis of SDI was nothing other than a means toprovide cover for a deep black space program: a proposition that cannot beproven but which nonetheless has merit.Certainly the Bush administration continued the Reagan policy carte blanche foractivities by CIA and other intelligence agencies – much of which were hiddenbehind shell companies existing on paper only. If one needed to supply (forexample) the Islamic fundamentalist Mujahideen rebels in Afghanistan withstinger missiles, then one had to find money that was not bound by Congressional(or other legal) restrictions. Thus, the notorious spike in heroin production inAfghanistan after 1979 was a carefully designed project of the CIA, controlledby CIA assets. Money from the sale of drugs and weapons was recycled through CIAshell companies and banking institutions around the world into “covert money.”Such shenanigans were becoming increasingly understood by critics by the late1980s, as demonstrated by the scandal involving the Bank of Commerce and CreditInternational (BCCI). Founded in London by a Pakistani financier, the bankengaged in a massive money laundering operations. In 1988, BCCI was implicatedin drug trafficking and was called “the CIA’s money-laundering facility.” It wasalso available for the National Security Council when the NSC needed a conduitfor Contra money or other covert measures. BCCI not only financed arms dealsthat governments wanted to keep secret, but the bank shipped goods in its ownships, insured them with its own insurance agency, and provided its own manpowerand security. Drugs were a major part of its revenues. Among clients of BCCIwere Manuel Noriega, Ferdinand Marcos, and Saddam Hussein. Not only this, butone of the inside sources of the murdered journalist Danny Casolaro told himthat the bank financed large private business deals between George Bush andManuel Noriega, as well as between Bush and Saddam Hussein. These were notgovernment deals, but private business deals. By 1991, BCCI was shut down, with$10 billion missing. The Justice Department vigorously impeded an investigationof its activities. But BCCI was only one bank; there were many others ready toservice the needs of the world’s power players. cml[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2006253] Then there was the UFO connection. Throughout the Reagan and Bush years,rumors spread through the UFO community that George Bush was a member of MJ-12.It appears that this rumor spread in part due to the brief exchange betweencandidate Bush and Charles Huffer in 1988, although MJ-12 was never part oftheir conversation. When UFO researcher Grant Cameron contacted the BushLibrary, he was informed that there was only one UFO document in the entirePresidential collection. This prompted Cameron to ask rhetorically whether UFOsdisappeared during the Bush years, or was all relevant data simply deflected toother agencies such as the Air Force, NASA, or black-budget programs set-up todeal with the information. cmli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2006631] Another UFO story concerns an attempt by the new National SecurityAdvisor, General Brent Scowcroft, to be “read into” the secret UFO program. Hewanted to see the Project Manager, who happened to be known as “Raven” withinthe Aviary. According to Robert Collins, who told the story, Scowcroft “askedlike a child: may I see something please?” cmlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2006784] The identityof Raven is not publicly known. The two main candidates are Jack Verona, asenior Pentagon scientist and former head of the DIA’s Scientific and TechnicalIntelligence Directorate; and Richard Helms, Director of the CIA underPresidents Johnson and Nixon. Additional speculation has centered on HenryKissinger. cmliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2006967] Paranoia and Its DiscontentsWhile the U.S. intelligence community continued to operate without meaningfuloversight, the rift between the ufologically paranoid and the conservative grewever wider. Jerome Clark dismissed the wild claims of the “new school ofunhinged types” who believed extraterrestrials were here to serve men ala “somecosmic McDonald’s.” While “even democratic” governments had secrets, scandalssuch as Watergate and Iran-Contra showed that conspirators were usually caught.Lest one marvel at such naivete, Clark conceded that rules were differentregarding UFOs. Here, the watchdogs were not merely sleeping on-the-job; theywere not even on-the-job. Even so, he argued that it remained highly speculativeas to just what the government did and did not know about such topics as Roswellor UFOs in general. Rushing into conspiracy theorizing, he maintained, did nothelp scientific ufology. cmliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2007528]Claims and counter-claims of conspiracy, however, ruled the day. Early in 1989,William Moore stated that he was not “a forger, a hoaxer, a fabricator orcounterfeiter; nor, to the best of my knowledge, have I ever participated in anyillegal or un-American activity in connection with my more than eight-yearinvolvement with the MJ-12 controversy.” cmlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2007724] As time wouldsoon prove, this was not exactly true, unless one considers the wittingunhinging of a friend (Paul Bennewitz) in the cause of disinformation to beproudly American.Leonard Stringfield continued to research and uncover new leads regarding UFOcrash retrievals. In early 1989, he issued a new Status Report which discussedpossible recent cases, as well as alleged intimidation and cover-up by militaryagencies. cmlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2007906] Abduction issues also remained highly charged, including debates onwhether or not cross-species hybridization would ever be possible (no accordingto Michael Swords; yes according to David Jacobs). cmlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2008117] In anotherargument, Hopkins and Jacobs took sides against Jacques Vallee, who questionedthe utility of hypnosis in abduction research and accused ufology’s twobest-known abduction researchers of lacking proper training and credentials toperform hypnotic regression. “Regression,” wrote Vallee, “should never beconducted by individuals who hold strong personal beliefs about the nature ofthe experience they are investigating, and who are searching for confirmation oftheir specific interpretation of the phenomenon.” cmlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2008302]Another interesting development was the growing suspicion of some UFOresearchers about Dr. Carl Sagan. Sagan, one of the world’s most famousastronomers, had once been host to the enormously successful television show,“Cosmos.” Over his career, he frequently expressed his belief that the universewas teeming with life. His public statements on UFOs were a different matter.Based on minimal evidence of research or effort, Sagan dismissed theextraterrestrial hypothesis, arguing that such beliefs amounted to little morethan wish fulfillment. cmlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2008519] In late 1988,Sagan stated that “every flying saucer ‘sighting’ when given a genuinely toughscientific scrutiny has been judged either a mistake or a fraud.” cmlx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2008728]In one of history’s intriguing coincidences, Stanton Friedman and Sagan had beenclassmates at the University of Chicago. In early 1989, Friedman wrote an openletter to Sagan (his third) expressing his sadness at having to correct “falseand misleading” statements on UFOs. Contrary to Sagan’s claim,. . . every large scale scientific study of flying saucers has produced asignificant number of cases which not only cannot be identified, but whichclearly indicate that some so called flying saucers are manufactured objectsbehaving in ways that we Earthlings cannot yet duplicate with our manufacturedobjects.Friedman suggested that Sagan had taken over from Donald Menzel the role of “UFOdisinformation specialist.” cmlxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2008865] The Eastern Empire Cracks1989 marked Mikhail Gorbachev’s fourth year as leader of the USSR. His promotionof perestroika (“restructuring”) and glasnost (“openness”) electrified thepeople under Soviet rule, even as the Bush administration remain unimpressed,perhaps nonplused. What had started as an attempt to bring competitiveness tothe economy of the Soviet Union was already beginning to spiral out of control.Once “openness” had become a part of official policy, it became increasinglydifficult to hide the full extent of past government criminality and misdeeds.It was well known that Stalin’s rule had brought misery, famine, and terror tothe nation, but such things had never been openly discussed. What would happenwhen they were? Would the very legitimacy of the Communist Party itself bechallenged? Moreover, how would the many non-Russian subject nationalitiesrespond to the chance to express themselves more openly?The answer to this question was already known. Major riots had occurred inAzerbaijan back in 1987, brought about by a Muslim populace that had never beenhappy under Soviet rule. Other nationalities were now about to follow. InJanuary 1989, the Hungarian parliament allowed freedom of association andassembly. It was the first Eastern bloc country to do this. In March, the USSRheld its first largely free elections in seventy-five years. Several key partychiefs failed to get elected, although the popular Mayor of Moscow, BorisYeltsin, was swept back into power. Riots in Soviet Georgia took place in April;these were brutally suppressed with the resulting deaths of twenty protesters.In May, Hungarian border guards cut down the barbed wire fence that marked theAustrian boundary. It was the first chink in the Iron Curtain; thousands wouldsoon flee to the West.Events were moving faster than anyone had expected. When U.S. Secretary of StateJames Baker met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in May, he wasmet with the announcement that the Soviets were unilaterally withdrawing 500nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe. He had nothing to offer from Washington.However, on May 12, President Bush, speaking to the graduating class at TexasA&M University, stated that the United States was ready to welcome the SovietUnion “back into the world order.” cmlxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2009066] In mid-May,Gorbachev met with Deng Xiaoping in China to normalize relations. It was thefirst visit by a Soviet head of state to China in thirty years and signaled thebeginning of troop withdrawals at the Sino-Soviet border.Meanwhile riots in Beijing were getting worse. China, after all, had slowly beenliberalizing under Deng’s leadership, and the Chinese people were heartened bywhat they were learning about the Soviet example. They too wanted greaterfreedom of expression. The result was the disgraceful massacre of Chineseprotesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 3, 1989. CNN carried livecoverage of the deaths of hundreds of Chinese citizens at the hands of theirmilitary. It became clear that China’s leadership was bent on purely economicreforms while retaining political orthodoxy. Ironically, this showed EasternEuropeans that they could succeed with large demonstrations, knowing theirgovernments could not engage in the same crackdowns. In June, Poland’s communistleadership allowed open elections, and the opposition party, Solidarity, won 99of the 100 seats in the Senate, as well as a majority in the lower house.Several strange events occurred within the Soviet Union during this time. Mostprominent of these was the failure of the Phobos 2 Soviet probe to Mars. Phobos1 and 2 were launched by the Soviet Union in July 1988 to study Mars and itsmoonlets Phobos and Deimos. Each probe was a complicated set of devices withthree television cameras, a spectrometer, guidance system, and video recordingsystem. Although the probes were Soviet, there was substantial internationalsupport, with much cooperation coming from the U.S., France, and Switzerland.Data was transmitted to the European Mission Center and NASA.Phobos 1 experienced a software error that led to its shutdown on September 2,1988. Phobos 2 also had several problems on the way to Mars: by late 1988, manyof its instruments were “running hot,” it had lost two of its three televisionchannels, and was using a backup transmitter. Still, the probe made it into Marsorbit on January 29, 1989. It then undertook an orbit that brought it insynchronicity with the moonlet Phobos, just a few hundred meters away. One ofits main missions was to emit a laser ray at the surface of Phobos in order tocause a small explosion; it was then supposed to gather data from the evaporatedsubstances.Problems developed when Phobos 2 aligned itself with its namesake. In mid-March,the probe took video images of the Martian surface. While appearing on Soviettelevision, two oddities were evident. First, near the Martian equator was anetwork of straight lines with geometric relationships; some lines were short,others long, some were thin, others were wide enough to look like rectangularshapes. The pattern covered an area of some six hundred square kilometers (morethan two hundred and thirty square miles). During the same broadcast, an unusualoblong shadow became apparent on the Martian surface. It was clearly a shadow:surface features of the planet could be seen in the lighter portions at theends. It was very different from the shadow that would have been cast either bythe probe itself or the moonlet Phobos.Then, on March 25, 1989, the probe took an infrared photograph of what appearedto be a large and long cylindrical object very close to the moonlet Phobos. Ifthis “Phobos Mystery Object” (PMO) was at the same distance as Phobos itself, itwould have been roughly two kilometers wide and 20 kilometers (roughly 15 miles)long. Its surface brightness was the same as that of the moonlet. Its sides wereparallel and both the ends were rounded; the end towards Phobos narrowedslightly; the other end seemed to have a slight protrusion.This was the last image captured by the probe. On March 27, Phobos 2 failed tore-establish communications with Earth: it was commanded to reposition itselffor an imaging session, but did not do so. Instead, it had gone into a spin. Onthe next day, the Soviet mission control center announced that they had lostcommunication with the spacecraft.The images are puzzling. The “shadow” image does not conform to any knownobject; indeed, the only object it bears a superficial resemblance to is theequally strange PMO. Alexander Dunayev, Chairman of the Soviet Glavkosmos spaceorganization, discussed the failure of Phobos 2 on March 29, mentioning that anodd-shaped object was seen between the spacecraft and Mars. He speculated thiswas either debris or an autonomous propulsion sub-system that was jettisonedafter the spacecraft was propelled into Mars orbit. Not everyone seemedconvinced. Other Soviet experts went on the record to mention the PMO asanomalous. Roald Kremnev, of the Babokin Space Testing Center, stated on April14, 1989 that the most discussed aspect of the Phobos 2 mission was the giganticobject registered just days before the accident. Two years later, Colonel Dr.Marina Popovich, a Russian cosmonaut and pilot, publicly revealed the PMO image,arguing that the object was anomalous. More conventional explanations followed:the object was said to be a “trailed moonlet” traveling at a faster speed thanthe probe or Phobos itself. As the exposure time of the photograph was eightseconds, the elongation could have been caused by the object’s motion. cmlxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2009334] This seemsreasonable, except that it does not explain the irregularities of the PMO,including its apparent narrowing at one end, its protrusion at the other, andthe many small bumps that are evident along its shaft.Are the anomalies related to each other? Did something “out there” cause thefailure of the mission? Whatever the cause, none of these oddities are mentionedin official accounts of the Phobos 2 mission. Instead, mission failure isusually attributed to a malfunction of the on-board computer; this resulted infaulty positioning of the solar cells, ultimately leading to a drained battery.cmlxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2009604] The failure of the Phobos 2 mission was the most intriguing Soviet UFOevent of early 1989, but the cracking of the Iron Curtain enabled many otherstories to reach the west. A large, low-flying cylindrical UFO was reported inthe Transcaucasus region by “thousands” of witnesses on February 13. It hadspotlights in front and back, porthole-like openings along the sides, andtraveled at the leisurely speed of about 65 mph. As it flew over the city ofNalchik, it drifted down to an altitude of 150 feet, then flew off. cmlxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2009969] Another large object was seen hovering at an altitude of 1,000 feet overthe city of Cherepovets on April 24. cmlxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2010146] Two monthslater, in the central Russian Vologda region on June 6, school children near thevillage of Konantsevo saw a luminous dot in the sky. It became larger, turnedinto a shining sphere, landed in meadow, and moved to a nearby river. Thechildren watched it from a quarter-mile away. It seemed to split and “somethingresembling a headless person in dark garb” appeared. The creature and spherebecame invisible; three more spheres were later said to have landed in the samemeadow. cmlxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2010321] All verystrange, all questioned by a skeptical western media. Yet, matters would becomeeven stranger in the Soviet Union as the year progressed. Fyffe, AlabamaElsewhere in the world, most of the interesting UFO activity was occurring inFlorida’s Gulf Breeze and Nevada’s Area 51. However, one sighting from early1989 stands out among the rest. This occurred in the area around a small town innortheastern Alabama named Fyffe, a stone’s throw from the Tennessee and Georgiastate lines. On the night of February 10, the DeKalb County Sheriff’s officereceived over 50 telephone calls from citizens over a 25 mile radius regarding“a silent thing streaking through the dark.” The first report came in at 8:42p.m. when a woman in the town of Grove Oak told the Fyffe police department thatshe had watched the object for over an hour with a pair of binoculars. Theaircraft was curved, she said, with the side upright, like a “banana.” There wasa red light on each end and a white light in between them, she told the police.The top of the curve was outlined in green light. When the craft turned, thegreen lights splayed outward “like fireworks” in a circular shape. Police ChiefJunior Garmany and assistant chief Fred Works drove to the site. The twoofficers saw the object immediately. It was at an altitude of roughly 1,000 to1,500 feet, and completely silent. “We got out of the car and we turned off theengine and the radio,” said Garmany. “When we started towards it, it beganmoving away.” The officers drove after the object, following it for about twelvemiles when it suddenly reversed direction and silently flew over them. “Wefigured it was going about three or four hundred miles an hour,” said Garmany.Initially, it looked like an airplane, but the shape was difficult to describe.It appeared diamond-shaped, but rounded on the edges, with flashing green,white, and red lights along the sides. Three white lights were along the bottom,“like landing lights.” Works said the white lights underneath appeared to shineupward, illuminating the bottom of the craft. It did not appear to be especiallythick from top to bottom, and had no windows, lettering, or wings. “I’m notsaying it was a flying saucer,” said Works. “But what really got me was the lackof sound.”After the object left, it was seen by a state trooper and by police officers inthe towns of Crossville, Geraldine, and Collinsville. On one occasion, policeofficers reportedly saw three of the aircraft at one time. Several citizens weredeeply upset by what they saw. A county official said that one terrifiedresident was “about to have a heart attack, and his wife was screaming.” MaxwellAFB had no explanations, and a weather service official ruled out weatherballoons.A few nights later, on the evening of February 15, 1989, Fyffe police officerSgt. Dennison Scott, along with two other officers, investigated a citizen’sreport of a strange object in the sky. Scott said the hovering object could beseen from anywhere in the city, flashing multi-colored lights for more than anhour, until it moved away to the northwest toward Huntsville. A report was sentto the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Officials at nearby Fort Rucker,Fort Benning, Maxwell AFB, and the FAA could not identify the object. JuniorGarmany and Fred Works believed they saw the UFO again on February 17, and othersightings were reported in subsequent days and weeks.The sightings near Fyffe received extensive news coverage. Many people in theregion began to stay out at night to try to spot UFOs, sometimes with success,often without. As the word spread, thousands of outsiders came. For a while,Fyffe rivaled Gulf Breeze and Area 51 as a UFO hotspot where tourists vastlyoutnumbered the locals. Next came the jokes, directly against Fyffe policeofficers or against the town in general. A case in point was the March 7 issueof the British tabloid the Daily Star , which described the late pianistLiberace descending over Fyffe from a giant banana in the sky, playing oldshowtunes. Garmany later stated, “if I had known the kind of ridicule we weregoing to get, I’d have kept my mouth shut. And I’d have shot Fred if he’d openedhis.”Sightings in Fyffe continued in March, while thousands continued to descend uponthe town (including representatives of MUFON, as well as unconfirmed reports ofFBI and Air Force investigators). There were weeks in which sightings occurredevery night, often multiple witness affairs. While national and internationalmedia phoned the Fyffe police department looking for a story, citizens continuedcalling in their UFO reports. The four-man police force was kept busy. Some ofthe sightings called in were determined to be stars, classic misidentificationsof bright celestial objects like Venus. Others were suspected by law enforcementand MUFON representatives to be aircraft. But on Sunday night, March 12, severalwitnesses saw an extremely large object with red and green flashing lights onthe side, and two white lights on the bottom, hovering about five miles away.While one witness went to get binoculars, the object simply vanished before theeyes of the remaining witness. At the same time, another man was directly underthe object, which he said was the size of a football field. In addition tonoticing the same lighting configuration described by the more distantwitnesses, he noticed a metallic blue color to the craft, which he said wouldprobably not have been visible against the night sky without the huge lights. Hewent inside the house to get a camera; the object was gone when he returned.There did turn out to be a series of interesting photographs taken in March by aphotographer and journalist team of the local Weekly Post newspaper. Using timelapse photography, they captured the bright UFO at some distance low in the skyas it was ascending, just before it vanished. The photograph shows no featuresof the craft at all, simply its movement, which does not correspond to that ofany aircraft.One other factor regarding Fyffe is that before and after the UFO wave, the areahad been the scene of many animal mutilations, mostly of cattle. This phenomenonlasted well into the 1990s and was subject to serious concern by Chief of PoliceGarmany and the Mayor, Boyd Graben. Just like the many cases of mutilations thathad occurred elsewhere, the dead animals in Fyffe showed signs of “precisesurgical cutting.” No one was ever caught in the act, and no agency ever tookresponsibility for the actions. cmlxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2010500] Ultimately, these events in northeastern Alabama remain unexplained. Aswith similar developments elsewhere, either answer to the “ours” versus “theirs”issue leads to unsettling implications. cmlxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2010783] The Bob Lazar StoryIn the spring of 1989, journalist George Knapp of KLAS-TV in Las Vegas beganairing a series of interviews he conducted with a scientist who claimed to havespent a brief period at a secure area inside the Groom Lake facility called S4.This was just south of the then-barely-known but already legendary “Area 51.”The scientist, known by the pseudonym “Dennis,” was shown only in silhouette.The military, he said, had nine extraterrestrial flying discs and was trying to“back engineer” the technology. He had broken his security oath, and now hadgone public in order to protect his life. By the end of 1989, “Dennis” wasrevealed to be one Robert Lazar. Over many interviews with Knapp and subsequentinvestigators, he told an astonishing story.During the early 1980s, Lazar said, he earned Masters degrees from MIT and CalTech in physics and electronics technology and also worked as a physicist at LosAlamos National Laboratory (LANL). During this time, he had occasion to meet thefamous physicist Edward Teller. The two had a cordial conversation, as Lazar hadjust been mentioned in the local news for having installed a jet engine on hiscar. 25 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1770801] By1988, however, Lazar was out of physics – a bored 29 year-old proprietor of asmall photographic processing business. He wanted a career opportunity and begansending out resumes, including Teller as one of the recipients. On November 29,1988, Teller called him and gave him the name of someone in Las Vegas. Lazarphoned this person (later losing the name and number), and some time laterreceived a phone call from EG&G, a company dealing in high technology and withcontracts in the Nevada test site. Lazar interviewed with them on December 1,but was informed that he was overqualified for the position in question. A dayor two later, however, EG&G contacted him regarding a position in propulsion –in “an outer area” – connected to the U.S. Navy. He interviewed again on Monday,December 5, 1988. This seemed like a part-time position, at least for a while,which would allow him to continue his duties as a photolab processor. The nextday, December 6, Lazar reported to the EG&G building at McCarran Airport. There,he met with a security officer named Dennis Mariani. Mariani escorted him on hisflight to Area 51 at Groom Lake, where Lazar signed a secrecy agreement thatrequired intensive monitoring of his activities. He and Mariani boarded a buswith blacked out windows and rode for a half hour down a dirt and gravel road.They arrived at a base near Papoose dry lake bed, otherwise known as S4. Armedguards were everywhere. Lazar’s ID was prepared, he was given a physical and wastested for allergic reactions to unknown substances.The precise activities and chronology of Lazar’s few reported visits to S4 arenot entirely clear. He claimed to have gone out to S4 on six or seven occasionsbetween December 1988 and April 1989. The first two visits were apparentlyfilled with “briefings,” where he sat alone in a room and read documents. Mostof this was to become acquainted with his project, named “Galileo,” which dealtwith gravity and propulsion. He also read about a second project, named “LookingGlass,” which was concerned with the physics of seeing back in time. There wasalso some hands-on bench work to learn the operation of an “anti-matterreactor.”Lazar said he was at S4 twice before he saw a disc. The first time he saw it wasessentially a “look but don’t touch” visit. He walked into a hangar. There,resting on three legs, was an absolutely classic-looking flying saucer. It borea striking resemblance to the “perfect” UFOs allegedly photographed by BillyMeier. Lazar had an ominous feeling, “almost ... that you shouldn’t be there.”The object was roughly 35-40 feet in diameter and 15 feet tall. It had a singlecolor of grey pewter. Believing it was manmade, he thought, “well, this explainsall the UFO stories.”Following this visit, he read more briefings which explicitly described thecraft as extraterrestrial. During his stay at S-4, according to Lazar, he saw atotal of 9 flying saucers, each distinctive in design and size. His assignment,however, concerned just the one craft: the perfect one he had nicknamed, “thesport model.” cmlxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2011684] Lazar returned for a second time to examine the craft, followed by securitypersonnel. He walked around the craft. It had no sharp corners, “almost as if itwere fashioned out of wax and then slightly melted.” It had three levels; he wascleared for the lower two. He crawled underneath on the sub-floor. There werethree gravity amplifiers. Their function was to amplify and focus the “GravityA” wave, which in turn came from the “total annihilation” reactor, situated inthe center level of the craft. Lazar then entered the center level. Other thancontaining the reactor, this level was fairly empty. A few items had apparentlybeen removed or sawed off at the base. There was a possible control panel, and aspace where another panel might have been. There were extremely small chairs –much too small for human-sized pilots. There were no obvious sleeping quarters,but Lazar did notice possible “evidence of writing.” Rather amazingly, part ofthe skin of the craft could become transparent, and one could see outside as ifit were a window. Even without seeing the top level, Lazar was now convinced hewas dealing with extraterrestrial technology.According to Lazar, the fuel for this craft was the super-heavy Element 115,which was housed in the reactor. There, it underwent bombardment and spontaneousfission, producing anti-matter particles that were converted to electricity with100 percent efficiency. While this appeared to contradict the first law ofthermodynamics, Lazar said there was no detectable loss of energy in theprocess. This tremendous power then operated the amplifier, distorted thesurrounding gravitational field, and caused the craft to become invisible. Moreimportantly, it allowed the vehicle to shorten the distance to a charteddestination. In effect, the craft could bend space and time. Speed of lightlimitations were irrelevant. The problem with Element 115 was that it could notbe manufactured on Earth. Nevertheless, Lazar said, there were roughly 500pounds of it available (courtesy of the aliens). It was also remarkably stable,he said, and just 223 grams of it would fuel a craft for a very long time.cmlxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2011858] 26[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1771326] On one occasion, said Lazar, he was brought outside to see ademonstration of a craft. Several other people were there, including one personnext to Lazar who was in radio contact with it. The disc “lifted off the ground,slid over to the left, then back to the right, and set back down.” cmlxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2012329] Lazar’s conviction that these craft were extraterrestrial was reinforced byadditional reports he read. He always emphasized that what he read was “simplywords on paper,” and could have been disinformation. But by his own estimate, heread more than 100 documents. These dealt not only with Element 115, the discs,and other technical matters, but the aliens themselves.The documents said the aliens traveled about 30 light years to Earth from theZeta Reticuli 1 & 2 star system. Popularly known as “greys,” the Reticulans weregreyish in color, 3 to 4 feet tall, and weighed 25 to 50 pounds. Their heads andeyes were large, their nose, mouth, and ears were practically non-existent, andthey had no hair. Lazar even saw photographs of alien bodies, including detailsthat would surface again in 1995 with the infamous “Alien Autopsy video” of RaySantilli. According to Lazar, the alien “carcass” was cut up and had whatappeared to be very dark blood. It also “seemed to [have] one large organ in thebody as opposed to identifiable heart and lungs and that sort of thing.”cmlxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2012519] The Reticulans referred to humans as “containers” (whether of geneticmaterial, souls, or something else), and claimed to have genetically “externallycorrected” human evolution up to 65 times over the last 10,000 years. Thedocuments mentioned a great deal about recombinant DNA methods and viralweaponry, and there was speculation that viruses were used to redirect humanevolution – since viruses are the only known organism that can attach to humansand impart a new genetic code. The Reticulans also claimed to have givenhumanity its religion “to prevent the ‘containers’ from destroying themselves.”27 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1771529]Disconcertingly, they were able to exert a form of mind control on people, mosteffective when the subject was relaxed, preferably asleep. Stimulated states ofconsciousness made mind control difficult.The documents also mentioned an exchange of information and hardware between theU.S. government and the Reticulans until 1979, when a conflict occurred – verymuch like the scenario offered in 1987 by John Lear. The aliens left at thattime, but were expected to return in the future. This was when, according to thedocuments, the U.S. government began its back-engineering program. Then, in May1987, some scientists took an antimatter reactor to an underground Nevada testfacility. Unfortunately, their experiment required them to cut the reactor open,and they were killed. Lazar was a replacement for one of those scientists.All in all, an exciting adventure for an unemployed physicist who had justturned 30. Hardly any conversation ever took place among Lazar’s estimated 22co-workers. Still, he once asked someone how the UFO secret could be kept for solong. The answer: it was “the easiest thing to keep secret,” precisely becauseit was so unusual.But Lazar had a cavalier attitude about secrets. He soon told Gene Huff and JohnLear about S4 and the discs. On March 21, Lazar asked Lear if he wanted to seeone of their test flights. Sure, replied Lear, but how can we do that? Lazarsaid he knew a spot where they could see it from public land every Wednesdaynight. Thus, on the evening of Wednesday, March 22, Lazar took his wife, Huff,and Lear to the Groom Lake road. Before long, they saw a bright light rise abovethe mountains between them and S4. Through Lear’s Celestron telescope, they sawwhat looked like a saucer-shaped object. A week later on March 29, Lazar, Huff,and Lear repeated the trip, taking Lear’s Celestron telescope and videoequipment. At around 8:30, they saw a disc – the videotape shows a bright lightapparently maneuvering. When the camera zoomed in close to the object, it seemedto be spinning. The three men watched it descend behind a mountain. cmlxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2012728] The group did this once more on Wednesday, April 5, 1989. This time they werechased off Bureau of Land Management land. According to Huff, “a Lincoln countycop ... pulled us over and hassled us. He took our I.D.s and radioed ouridentities into the security base station.”This ended Lazar’s career at S4. His security clearance was revoked, and hissuperiors tried to convince him to go out to the Nevada Test Site for a “finaldebriefing.” He refused, believing that he might never be allowed to leaveagain. Concerned for his safety, Lazar decided to go public. In May 1989, Learintroduced him to journalist George Knapp. Knapp was surely the best option forLazar, possessing strong investigative skills and an open mind. Knapp alsopossessed a good knowledge of activities at the Nevada test site. His interviewswith Lazar (“Dennis”) were a sensation, helping him earn a UPI individualachievement award.Lazar’s story raised more questions then it answered. Verifying his backgroundproved to be an ordeal. cmlxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2012898] Knapp checkedLazar’s credentials, but found no records of his schooling – no trace of Lazar’salleged attendance at either MIT or Cal Tech ever turned up. Knapp also receiveddenials from Los Alamos National Laboratory that Lazar had ever worked there –although he did find Lazar’s name in a LANL telephone book from the early 1980s,as well as several Los Alamos persons who remembered Lazar. He then found a LosAlamos newspaper article of June 27, 1982 that featured Lazar, and even foundspeeding tickets of Lazar’s indicating he lived in Los Alamos. This was enoughevidence to persuade Knapp that Lazar had worked at Los Alamos in some capacity,apparently as a physicist.The Bob Lazar story percolated throughout 1989, publicized by degrees throughthe investigations of George Knapp. On November 10, 1989, Knapp began airing aseries of stories about Area 51, using Lazar as his principal source, and atthis time revealed his true name. Lazar repeated his basic statement: the secrettechnology being tested at the S4 sector of the Nevada Test Site was of alienorigin, that he had worked at Los Alamos National Laboratories in 1982 and 1983,possessed a degree from MIT, and so on. Now that Lazar had gone “official,”other investigators had the opportunity to verify his claims.Stanton Friedman quickly found problems with them. Like Knapp before him,Friedman tried to obtain records of Lazar’s time at MIT; and like Knapp wasunable to do so. None appeared to exist. Lazar also told Friedman he had alsoattended Pierce College and Cal State, but Friedman could only verify that Lazartook electronics courses at Pierce College, without obtaining a degree. Lazarclaimed that his academic records were missing because the government was tryingto turn him into a “non-person.”There were other problems with Lazar’s story. It was learned that earlier in hislife, Lazar was known by a different name, which made it difficult to follow hispersonal history. His polygraph test was inconclusive. His memory of largeblocks of time was also fuzzy – Lazar suspected his employers used mind controltechniques to block his memories. To overcome this, he met with Layne Keck, alicensed hypnotherapist. Keck found the results of his sessions with Lazarpuzzling, and suggested that mind-altering chemicals may have been used toconfuse Lazar’s memory. cmlxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2013426]For the next several years, questions about Lazar dominated ufology. In additionto the problem of his academic credentials, many researchers expressed deepskepticism over a number of other issues. Among these was the alleged stabilityof Element 115. Another was Lazar’s apparent ability to traipse into anincredibly secure “dream job” with no pedigree or prior credentials. Anotherstill was his ability – once within this secure environment – to obtain suchrapid access to information concerning aliens, their background, and theirtechnology. Finally, researchers wondered why any person who obtained such asecurity clearance would so quickly and carelessly reveal it all to the world.Many experts in the field of UFOs, aviation, and Area 51 (such as Tom Mahood,Stanton Friedman, Glen Campbell, John Alexander, and others) spent a great dealof time investigating Lazar’s claims, generally concluding they were fraudulent.Edward Teller was on one occasion confronted about Bob Lazar. After the Lazarstory broke, Teller was asked by a television reporter if he had helped Lazargain employment, and if he knew what was going on at Area 51. Teller’s reply:Look, I don’t know Bob Lazar. All this sounds fine. I probably met him. I mighthave said to somebody I met him and I liked him, after I met him, and if I likedhim. But I don’t remember him . . . I mean you are trying to force questions onme that I simply won’t answer. cmlxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2013672] Still, Lazar has retained supporters over the many years. Knapp, whileacknowledging the problems with Lazar’s account, continues to maintain acautious acceptance of its core – in no small part because he subsequentlyobtained corroboration from some two dozen other Groom Lake insiders regardingkey parts of Lazar’s scenario. Another person who voiced strong support forLazar was DSP satellite expert Ron Regehr, who knew Lazar throughout most of the1980s and told the author that Lazar was “one hundred percent” authentic. Huff,too, has continued to be a strong advocate for Bob Lazar.Lazar never seemed to care what UFO researchers thought of him. Despite theincredible nature of his story, his manner of presentation was always low-keyand scientific in tone. In the many interviews and talks he gave during the1990s, he was as consistent as he was laconic, never seeking to speculate,guess, or expand on what he claimed to have directly experienced. He evenacknowledged he may have been manipulated, or even subject to mind control,while he was at S4.Along these lines, one may engage in the following speculation. If the allegedzero-point breakthroughs of the Lockheed ARV (as described by Brad Sorensen in1988) were true, one might consider allowing Lazar into S4 specifically so thathe might leak incorrect data. If flying saucers were thought to require Element115 – jokingly referred to as “unobtanium” – then private attempts to replicatethe technology would be doomed to failure. It would imply a dead end toprospective researchers seeking the next propulsion breakthrough. Could it bethat Lazar was quickly “sized up” and deemed to be a useful conduit for therelease of such disinformation? Such speculation cannot be proven within thehall of mirrors that is the U.S. national security establishment. It could bethat Lazar was a fraud, plain and simple; or that he was telling the truth as heknew it; or that he was manipulated in some way for purposes unknown.Whatever the ultimate truth behind Lazar’s story, it was the dam breaker. AfterLazar, throughout most of the 1990s, Area 51 drew interested people to itsperimeter, armed with cameras and video equipment. The most secret place in theworld suddenly became the star attraction of conspiracy hunters everywhere. Notall the attendees were interested in UFOs; presumably guards were on the lookoutfor “tourists” with especially sophisticated equipment engaged in espionage ofthe more traditional sort. Still, if one assumes that crash retrievals of UFOshad taken place, and accepts the possibility that some of the retrievedtechnology had been taken to “Area 51” (or, more accurately, S4), then it iseasy to understand the concern that might be elicited from behind closed doors. Cooper on the Secret Government and MJ-12Meanwhile, William Cooper crystalized his newly found ideas into a paper thatquickly became an underground “classic.” This was “The Secret Government: TheOrigin, Purpose, and Identity of MJ-12.” cmlxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2013933] Quite simply,Cooper let it all hang out, incorporating many elements of the UFO reality intothe broader realm of one-world-government conspiracy theories. He presented anearly overwhelming amount of facts, many of which were entirely true, othersunverifiable, and others provably false.His claims included: at least 16 downed alien craft, 65 bodies, and one livealien retrieved between 1947 and 1952; at least 10 more UFO crash retrievalsduring the Eisenhower years. 28[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1771754] Such asituation forced the creation of a “secret government,” dominated by the CIA andAir Force during the early years. Insiders who objected to the new system, suchas former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, were eliminated. Cooperdescribed Forrestal (very generously and none too accurately) as “a veryidealistic and religious man who believed that the public should be told.”Further measures were taken during the 1950s to manage the UFO/alien problem.The National Security Agency was founded in deep secrecy in 1952, primarily forthe purpose of “alien communications.” The true MJ-12 group was born, saidCooper, during the early 1950s, when President Eisenhower brought NelsonRockefeller into the picture. Similarly, the Bilderbergers were founded in 1954,at least partly in order to enable the international elites to manage theUFO/alien situation. Other secret societies had connections to the secrecy,including the Jason Society, Skull and Bones, the Council on Foreign Relations,and the Trilateral Commission.Speaking of the aliens, there were several types, said Cooper, including thosethat looked totally human; others with large noses. One group met with PresidentEisenhower and signed a treaty with the U.S. According to Cooper, the firstAlien Ambassador was named His “Omnipotent Highness Krll” – pronounced Krill –although the Americans secretly called him “Original Hostage Krll.” This ofcourse was lifted directly from John Grace and John Lear. Cooper also describedan early version of what years later became known as the Serpo story, involvingan exchange of human and alien “guests.” The alien flag was known as the“Trilateral Insignia,” and was on their craft and uniforms.Much of the money to hide relevant programs was controlled by the MilitaryOffice of the White House. Cooper accurately discussed this office, using as hissource a 1980 expose entitled Breaking Cover . cmlxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2014247] The author,Bill Gulley, described the layers upon layers of secrecy connected with thatoffice and (in language nearly lifted nearly verbatim by Cooper) described howmoney “was channeled through a circuitous route the cleverest spy, oraccountant, would have trouble following.” Gulley did not state there was a UFOconnection to the many underground facilities funded by the Office, but Cooperdid.There was much more in Cooper’s 12,000 word paper. His main thesis was that“...we are being manipulated by a joint human/alien power structure which willresult in a one-world government and the partial enslavement of the human race.”Cooper was generally dismissed and shunned by UFO researchers, which was notsurprising considering the unfounded nature of some of his claims, to saynothing of the instances in which he was known to fabricate his data. It must besaid, however, that much of Cooper’s research in his paper was solid enough, andall-too-ignored by mainstream researchers, whether within ufology or beyond.Writing about the influence of the Bilderbergers, the Council on ForeignRelations, the Trilateral Commission, or Skull and Bones was simply not done in1989. Whether Cooper got everything right is another matter, but bringingwidespread attention to the powerful influence exerted by these entirelynon-elected groups was long overdue. His work was surely derivative from other,more careful researchers, but Cooper put together an outline that seemedplausible to many researchers seeking to understand the true structure of powerin the world. The problem was that this scenario was irretrievably soiled by hisown obvious mental instability and repeated instances of plagiarism.But there was one thing Cooper was not: a right-wing, “fascist” conspiracytheorist, which is how he was frequently characterized. cmlxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2014452] Cooper’spolitical orientation was in fact opposite that of true fascism, which (asclassically demonstrated by Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco) demanded intimatecollaboration between corporate and government loci of power, and the subsequentstifling of all opposition. It was exactly this development that Cooper opposed,something that he argued was being created not merely within the United States,but on a global basis. Before long, it would have a name: The New World Order. Bill Moore’s ConfessionBy 1989, suspicion about William Moore was widespread among UFO researchers. InJune, Robert Hastings published a damning article about Moore in the MUFON UFOJournal . Hastings lined up an impressive series of main points. It was notsimply, he said, that the MJ-12 papers remained an orphan child, with nogovernmental agency claiming them. The Project Aquarius message was known tohave been faked (as in altered) by Moore. Moore had also acknowledged thatRichard Doty – with whom he was known to collaborate – forged the Ellsworth AFBdocument. Doty’s typewriter at Kirtland AFB was also implicated in the Weitzelcase from 1980, an incident that did have a core UFO sighting which was greatlyaltered by Doty. Doty had given data to Linda Moulton Howe in April 1983 thatwas similar to but contradicted data in the Eisenhower briefing memo. 29[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1771970] Moore, by hisown account, faked a government ID card and passed himself off as anintelligence operative to at least one person for two years. Hastings’ argumentwas simple: how could anyone believe Moore and Doty were truthful regarding theMJ-12 documents? cmlxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2014657] Matters blew up at the MUFON International UFO Symposium, held from June30 to July 2, 1989 at the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The theme,appropriately, was “The UFO Cover-Up: A Government Conspiracy?” Before thesymposium even began, several MUFON members had resigned from the organization,upset that John Lear had been asked to chair the conference. cmlxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2014868]The real news was over William Moore’s presentation. Before a packed house,Moore – going well beyond his allotted time – “confessed” his connection to theU.S. intelligence community. “In early September 1980,” he told a stunnedaudience, “I was approached by a well-placed individual within the intelligencecommunity who claimed to be directly connected to a high-level governmentproject dealing with UFOs.” He later code-named this person “Falcon,” whom hestressed was not Richard Doty, who instead served as the liaison between Mooreand Falcon. As Moore was then on the Board of Directors at APRO, he was expectedto provide information on that organization’s activities, and also those of PaulBennewitz. In return, Moore was promised inside information relating to UFOs andthe cover-up.Bennewitz, of course, had been filming and photographing unknown objects overKirtland AFB and Manzano Weapons Storage Area. He was also monitoring what hebelieved to be low frequency EM signals whereby aliens communicated withsurgical implants placed in human abductees. He had written a computer programto translate these signals. Moore suggested the signals were notextraterrestrial, but related to something else of importance, perhaps SDI orsomething related, and therefore attracted the attention of the AFOSI. Bennewitzhad to be defused with disinformation, and Moore collaborated with Doty “largely[as] a freelancer providing information on Paul’s current thinking andactivities.” He had visited Bennewitz several times, gave him deliberatelymisleading information, such as the Aquarius document, and reported back to hissuperiors.Amid growing numbers of shouts, accusations, and walk-outs from the audience,Moore said this disinformation campaign succeeded beyond their expectations. Butit went beyond Bennewitz. Moore had withheld information from certainresearchers, and had also reported on their actions to his intelligencecontacts. He had withheld and blacked out certain parts of UFO-relatedgovernment documents. He said that AFOSI’s disinformation had succeeded againstLinda Moulton Howe in 1983. It was not until 1984, said Moore, that he realizedthe documents he received from AFOSI were false, at which point he withdrew fromparticipation (although he would receive MJ-12 negatives at the end of thatyear).The false scenario portrayed by Doty and AFOSI, perpetrated against Bennewitzand the UFO research community, “contained the notion that two groups of aliensare present on the planet, one benign, and one, the ‘greys’, not so benign.” Thegreys were responsible for cattle mutilations, human abductions, and implants inhuman abductees. According to this false scenario, the greys also made and thenbroke a secret treaty with the U.S. government, maintained a secret undergroundbase under Mount Archuleta near Dulce, and supplied the U.S. government withdefective space hardware and weapons. All of this preceded the scenariodescribed by Lear and Cooper by five years or more. All, said Moore, originatedas disinformation directed at Paul Bennewitz, who ended up in a psychiatrichospital in large part as a result of this campaign. Moore promised all would berevealed in due time, answered no questions, and left the stage through a backdoor. cmlxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2015091] By the time Moore walked off the stage, his reputation as a credible UFOresearcher was in ruins. Moore later argued that he provided a service toufology in “coming out” as he did, that he could have continued to keep mattershidden. But this was not really true. If nothing else, Hastings was alreadycausing problems for him, and other researchers were surely ready to follow up.Many rejected everything Moore had said and done as tainted. Others saw shadesof grey, recognizing that, as Moore later said, “you don’t learn how to swimunless you get into the water.... When you do get involved, there are rules. Andthey’re not your rules. You either play by them, or they very quickly findsomebody else who will.” cmlxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2015368]In a 1993 interview with his friend, Gregory Bishop, Moore elaborated hisposition.The whole story of Government/ alien involvement, treaties with aliens,underground bases, a plot to take over the planet, implants, two different racesof aliens, one hostile and one friendly, etc. was all cooked up by thecounter-intelligence people for the purpose of discrediting Bennewitz. He boughtit, and a lot of other people in the UFO community bought it, and they continueto buy it today. All of that stuff was cooked up as part of the operationagainst Bennewitz. Bennewitz was meeting with everybody who was anybody andtelling that story to anyone who would listen. John Lear, and ultimately throughhim to Bill Cooper, Bill English, Wendelle Stevens...they all revolved aroundthat information. It was the kind of paranoia that they wanted to hear.... ThenI get up and tell them, “Folks, you’ve been had. And here’s how I know. It isn’tthat I’ve heard it, I was part of it. I was there. I watched it happen. I knewwho was doing it, and I was privy to it. cmlxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2015560] Not that this campaign discredited the gravity of the UFO phenomenon, continuedMoore. On the contrary, it indicated that powerful interests took it seriously,and continue to do so.There is something to the subject that is so important that they’re devoting allthis time and effort to it. They wouldn’t devote it to stories about Hitlerbeing alive in Antarctica. It says there’s something there: What? .... Whateverthe secret is, it’s such a high magnitude of importance and would have such animpact on the mundane day-to-day circumstances of our society that anyone whogets close enough to see what it is says, “Oh my God. We can never tell anyonethis. Because if we do, it will bring down the whole fabric of our society.”That to me automatically suggests certain things. cmlxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2015751]An interesting statement. Over the years, there has been a tendency amongresearchers to support Moore’s statement that the disinformation from AFOSI wasto divert Bennewitz not from ET related data, but more conventional fare. Yetthis 1993 interview four years later could well be seen to imply that an ETconnection was in fact the case.Meanwhile, the bad feelings within MUFON over John Lear’s participation hadprompted Walter Andrus to remove him from the symposium. This was an especiallystrong snub, considering that the proceedings were taking place in Lear’s hometerritory of Las Vegas. Lear quickly organized his own “alternate” symposium forSunday morning. In addition to himself, he brought in William Cooper, Don Ecker,and William English, each with dedicated followers. Many who attended were lessthan impressed, however, feeling that little evidence supported some of theassertions, especially those emanating from Cooper. Not surprisingly, Cooperagain claimed that Kennedy’s driver had shot him in November 1963, that a groupof 80 dissident scientists opposed to the alien/US government diplomatic treatywere massacred in a single day, and other equally sensational – and unsupported– claims. cmlxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2015943] UFOs Mundane and ExtraordinaryAs summer arrived in 1989, more sightings of strange craft occurred inCalifornia’s Antelope Valley. During late May and into June, a security guard atAir Force Plant 42 reported several highly unusual objects. Late one sunnymorning, while a B-1B was performing “touch and goes” on the landing strip,“Archie” observed a silvery object high in the sky, moving slowly from north tosouth. The following week, the same object reappeared, this time coming from thewest. It stopped low in the sky, maintained its position, then moved southacross the base. On his radio, Archie asked the FAA control if something hadfallen off the B-1; the answer was negative. The silver speck disappeared; then,from the same spot, three round balls appeared out of nowhere, moved south,changed color, then disappeared. This prompted another call to the controltower. “I don’t know what the hell is happening around here,” he told them, “butI just saw three balls fly across the base.” The control tower replied, “webelieve you.” Soon, a large white helicopter with Air Force markings flew infrom the north and orbited in the vicinity for ten minutes, then left. The storywas researched and reported by William Hamilton. The fact that a helicopter wassent to investigate would seem to indicate that the silver balls were unknown tothe base operators. Were they secret technology of some other portion of thenational security infrastructure? Were they part of a “Majestic” group, beyondthe reach of ordinary military and legal control? Were they alien? The answer isunknown. cmlxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2016134]As the 1980s neared its end, greater numbers of UFO videos were being taken. Onewas taken on July 6, 1989 in the central Japan city of Hakui, along the westcoast facing North Korea. During a clear sunny day, an observer used a Sonyvideo recorder to capture over a minute of video of the object as it descendedrapidly toward the Earth. It then changed directions and rose at a steep angleso rapidly that it disappeared from several frames. It was not an airplane,balloon, kite, or model airplane. The object initially appeared as a bright spotagainst the blue sky, but when the photographer, Yasuhiko Hamazaki, zoomed in, aSaturn-shaped object with a ring encircling it in the horizontal plane becameplainly visible. The video was shown on Japanese and American television. Dr.Richard Haines and Dr. Bruce Maccabee independently analyzed it, finding theobject to be a genuine unknown. cmlxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2016406] Of course, mundane objects are often mistaken for UFOs. One was capturedon video the following month in Spain along the southeastern coast in the townof Estepona, not far from Gibraltar. At around 9 p.m. on August 10, Dr. WilliamHeijster, a Dutch military psychologist who worked at the Ministry of Defense inThe Hague, was driving with his family when they all saw an object hovering overa mountain. Heijster stopped the car, retrieved his camcorder, and videotapedthe object off and on for the next hour. He thought it appeared to be rotatingrapidly, but the video did not show this. However, the video did show anapparent change in its shape from conical to circular. After an hour, the objectsplit into two parts, which separated and then faded away. This part was notcaptured on video, however. Bruce Maccabee performed an initial analysis, butthe case was plausibly explained by Spanish researcher Vicente-Juan BallesterOlmos, who learned that a series of atmospheric balloons launched from Sicilycorresponded precisely in time, location, and appearance to the objectsvideotaped by Dr. Heijster. cmxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2016865]In Britain, triangles were being seen. That summer in Essex, a witness saw oddhovering lights, then watched them through binoculars. “It certainly was no anaircraft,” he told investigators. “All I could see was a triangular shape and itwas fairly big.” This was one of many sightings investigated by the MoD. cmxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2017222] But there wasone sighting of a triangle that summer which was unquestionably of a manmadecraft. This occurred in August, 60 miles off the Norfolk coast at a North Seagas rig. The witness was a former Royal Observer Corps member named ChrisGibson, one of the world’s leading experts in aircraft identification. Gibson infact was writing an aircraft recognition manual at the time, and activelycompeted in international recognition tournaments where a long distance image ofan aircraft would be flashed on a screen for a fraction of a second. Whileworking at the rig, Gibson observed a matte-black aircraft refueling from aKC-135, accompanied by two F-111s. The aircraft was slightly bigger than anF-111, and was “a perfect triangle,” with a 30 degree angle at the nose. Theformation was heading towards the UK coast. “I am trained in instantrecognition,” Gibson said. “But this triangle had me stopped dead.... I wastotally out of ideas. Here was an aircraft, flying overhead, not too high andnot particularly fast. A recognition gift and I was clueless. This was a newexperience.” cmxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2017380] The sighting was not made public until 1992. When it was, General WalterHogle, chief of USAF Public Affairs, suggested that the aircraft might have beenan RAF Vulcan bomber – an aircraft not only incapable of refueling from aKC-135, but which is almost as large as the tanker. Gibson replied, “A Vulcan? Ithink I learned that one when I was three years old.” The Air Force finallyacknowledged the sighting “will probably remain unchallenged, simply becausethere is not enough information available to even hazard a guess.” cmxciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2017536] Not surprisingly, several aviation experts have offered guesses as towhat Gibson saw. Bill Sweetman pointed out that the craft corresponded “almostexactly in shape and size” to hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft studied in the1970s and 1980s by McDonnell Douglas and the USAF. Sweetman knew of no otheraircraft, other than a highly supersonic vehicle, or a test aircraft for such avehicle, that had ever been built or studied with such a planform. cmxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2017731] Otherspeculation has suggested the craft may have either been a prototype of thecanceled U.S. Navy A-12 Avenger II, several of which are reported to have flown,or perhaps the TR-3A Black Manta, allegedly built by Northrop. cmxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2017922] The A-12,built by McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics to be an all-weather,carrier-based stealth bomber, was canceled in 1991 due to high costs.Officially, only mockups were ever built. The Black Manta, widely believed to bea subsonic stealth spyplane, has always been denied by the Air Force even toexist. The real problem is that both of these are of the wrong shape to matchwhat Gibson so precisely described, with the angles of their respective nosesbeing far wider than 30 degrees.One thing that can be taken away from the experience is the virtual certaintythat the U.S.-U.K. military establishment was flying a perfectly triangularaircraft, the existence of which has been denied to the present day. The (Non) UFO Shootdown Over Long IslandDuring the night of September 28, 1989, UFO activity was recorded over LongIsland and Connecticut, roughly speaking within a 35 mile north-south stretch.For many years, the claim has been made that a UFO was shot down that night byan American “Star Wars” weapon over Moriches Bay along the south shore of LongIsland. 30 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1772226] At the center of the controversy was John Ford. During the mid-1980s,Ford developed an overriding interest in UFOs – some called it an obsession –after learning about the nearby Hudson Valley sightings. In 1985, he co-foundedthe Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), whose activities were described in Ford’sLong Island UFO Newsletter. Ford soon claimed to have developed inside sourcesdescribing the extraterrestrial presence, how U.S. satellites monitored ETactivity, and other aspects of the cover-up. In the ten years he activelyinvestigated UFOs, Ford also claimed to have learned about three UFO crashretrievals on Long Island. Ford was not just an investigator, he saw himself assomeone who would single handedly bring down UFO secrecy. Soon, he was engagedin street activism to end UFO secrecy. He made countless telephone calls tofellow researchers as well as designated enemies. John Ford was nothing if notintense. But the real question is whether or not he was reliable. Certainindications point to a negative conclusion.Ford claimed that a UFO was shot down and retrieved at Moriches Bay in LongIsland on the night of September 28, 1989. cmxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2018099] It turns outthat UFOs were reported that night from the southern coast of Long Island up toConnecticut. The problem is that Ford’s accounts show gross inaccuracies andexaggerations where cross-checking is possible, throwing doubt over the rest ofhis account.At around 5:30 p.m., residents of Moriches Bay noticed strange lights hoveringover the bay. Ford said this was a large triangle which interfered with TVreception of some households. Something was still there after 7 p.m., and by 8p.m., a few miles north near the town of Calverton, a woman and her son saw sixbright amber lights above a field. According to Ford, they discerned a hugetriangular craft silhouetted against the night sky, which the mother assumed wasan experimental aircraft from the nearby test facility.At 8:10 p.m., UFOs were seen across the Long Island Sound in Connecticut. Fordclaimed that he learned from Philip Imbrogno that there had been a major UFOsighting at the “Hartford International Airport” in Connecticut. There, saidFord, employees saw an immense object hovering over an unused portion of theairfield. They described it as boomerang-shaped with six bright amber lights. Asthey watched in disbelief, a blue beam of light came down from the object, onwhich five beings glided down to the ground. Some of the airport workersreportedly chased the creatures, but the beam lifted them back to safety.According to Ford, one of these witnesses later spoke with Imbrogno on thecondition of anonymity, saying that he and his co-workers had been warned by theFAA to keep silent about the affair.Imbrogno did investigate a UFO sighting over an airport in Hartford, althoughnot the Hartford International Airport (which does not exist). It concernedunidentified lights that were seen by employees: no clearly identifiable object,no beams, no aliens, no enforced silence. When asked about Ford’s claims,Imbrogno had no explanation, except to say that they were untrue. Imbrogno didadd, however, that Ford frequently presented him with UFO videos and otherevidence. Unfortunately, detached observers almost never saw the “UFOs” thatFord was convinced had been captured on film or otherwise documented. cmxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2018478]Ford claimed that UFO activity continued over Moriches Bay well into the night,some of which was videotaped by a local resident. The culmination was said to bean encounter between a large number of military and police helicopters and atriangular UFO, which (Ford said he later learned from an inside source), wasshot down with a “Star Wars” type weapon that penetrated the UFO’s plasma field.There may be truth in here, or not. Presently, it is impossible to know. Thereis, however, one suggestive fact that might cause one to wonder: Moriches Baywas where TWA flight 800 mysteriously crashed in August 1996. Federalauthorities attributed the probable cause of that crash to an explosion of thecenter wing fuel tank, most likely as a result of faulty wiring. However, nearly40 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light or bright object ascendvertically and hit the aircraft. cmxcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2018653] What was thisstreak of light? Could it have been related to technology from nearby BrookhavenNational Laboratory, which Ford was convinced was part of the UFO cover-up andwas developing ET-related weaponry?Ford’s story ended tragically not so much because of UFOs as because he became anuisance, maybe a threat, to a powerful man. This was John Powell, the head ofthe Suffolk County Republican Party, whom Ford accused of covering upinformation on UFO crash retrievals and engaging in an array of criminalactivities. Whether Powell had any knowledge of UFOs is not known, but within afew years he pleaded no contest to charges of extortion and racketeering. Fordwas clearly on to something about the man, but picked the wrong fight. Ford toldfriends his car was vandalized, and a physical attack occurred against LIUFOmember Joe Mazzachelli in which he was warned by the assailants to “stay out ofour business.” Then, on June 12, 1996, Ford and Mazzachelli were arrested in asting operation involving phone taps and a wired paid informant. In aconversation filled with laughter and garbled statements, the informant saidthey should kill Powell and two other local politicians by tainting thetoothpaste of the victims with radium. Police immediately broke in to arrestFord and Mazzachili. It is not hard to imagine a man as corrupt as Powell makingarrangements to have this nuisance gotten rid of. cmxcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2018828] The scenario seems improbable, even absurd. The idea of breaking into Powell’ssecure residence, locating toothpaste solely for Powell’s use, and somehowgetting enough radium inside the tube – all without being caught – is clearly animpossible plan. In any case, such radium poisoning would hardly be fatal withinan efficient period of time, possibly not for many years. Some openly wonderedwhether the radium found in Ford’s house had been planted, although PhilipImbrogno told the author that Ford did collect radium from old watches, albeitin amounts that were insignificant.Among people who knew him from LIUFON, Ford had his defenders and detractors.Elaine Douglass, who would continue on in UFO research, said that those who knewFord never doubted his innocence, and that none believed him capable of the actof which he was accused. m[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2019016] A differentview of Ford was expressed by LIUFON’s former Director of Investigations, JohnStout, who claimed that Ford was a fanatic who regularly and conveniently foundcrashed saucers near his house. Stout claimed the 1989 Moriches Bay incident wasanother instance of Ford seeking to prove a preconceived fantasy. In reality,said Stout, that event was a mistaken identification of “a mast light on a boattraveling at night.” mi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2019201] Whatever Ford’s personality, he appears to have been railroaded. He hadno criminal record, but was jailed and denied bail for well over a year. Apsychological team hired by the DA’s office concluded that, even though Fordunderstood his legal predicament very well, he was not competent to stand trial.It seems that Ford was sunk by his conspiracy beliefs. Of particular comment, inthe opinion of Robert H. Berger, director of Forensic Psychiatry at BellevueHospital Center, was Ford’s belief that “the criminal case against him [was] inreality an intelligence operation being run by the CIA together with the Israeliintelligence agency Mossad.” Despite this medical pronouncement, the prosecutionrefused to drop charges. John Ford was sent to a mental institution after hisconviction. He has never been released. mii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2019408] The Strange Soviet Summer of 19891989 was a year of high strangeness, and events in the Soviet Union werestrangest of all. Perhaps it was merely coincidence that the world’s oldestcommunist society was spiraling out of control, or perhaps the intelligencebehind the phenomenon took extra interest in that country. Or, perhaps thegreater number of reports were simply due to the new openness that permeatedSoviet life. What is undeniable is that the UFO phenomenon became major news inthe Soviet Union, and Soviet UFOs became news around the world.In July, while the once-conquered nations of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia weredeclaring their sovereignty as independent nations, the USSR was seized by awave of UFO sightings and encounters without known precedent. Quite a fewabduction cases were reported in the sober journal, Socialist Industry on July9. One especially striking case occurred on July 4 – one reason is because itwas a failed attempt. At twilight, two women were walking with a six year oldgirl by the shore of the Dnieper River in a park near Kiev, when they saw a“boat” with three beings aboard. According to the witnesses, the three hadabsolutely identical faces: extremely pale, long blond hair, large eyes, andcollarless silver shirts which looked like nightgowns. Not surprisingly(considering the circumstances) they informed the women they were from anotherplanet. “Every day,” they told the astonished women, “we take one person fromEarth to our world. We will take you. Our ship is nearby, we will show it toyou.” They all walked together, during which time the women experienced oddphysical sensations and begged to be let go. They saw a ship behind some trees,and the small girl became frightened. The beings relented. “We will findothers,” they said. They entered the craft by a ladder which then retracted, thedoor silently closed, and the craft departed without a sound. It soon appearedas a small star. Alexander F. Pugachev, with a Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics,investigated the case and believed it to be genuine, although in general Sovietacademicians ignored this and the many other cases reported that summer. miii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2019838]Quite a few military encounters occurred during the year. Although no exact dateappears to be available, it appears that sometime during 1989 an advanced Sovietinterceptor was lost, flown by an experienced pilot, while a UFO sighting wasbeing reported. This was in a statement from Moscow PVO (National Air DefenseForces) district commander Anatoly Kornukov in a 1993 press conference. Kornukovwas among the most senior Soviet generals, and had been the man who gave theorder in 1983 to shoot down the KAL-007 flight. miv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2020018] Then there are the KGB “Blue Folder” reports which came to light as thenation was disintegrating in 1991. One of these includes a radio transcriptdescribing UFOs near the Black Sea coast in Krasnodar Krai on July 26, 1989. At2:40 p.m., the Sochi Airport controller, R. H. Stepanian, received informationfrom a crew flying from Simferopol that they had seen UFOs at a distance of30-50 kilometers (20-30 miles). According to the pilots, first one, then two“strange objects” paced them to their left. One was almost exactly square, whilethe other was elongated in the shape of a rhombus. At the time of the radiotransmission, the two objects were swiftly moving away and beginning toseparate. Apparently two other flights reported multiple UFOs to the airporttraffic control center. mv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2020263] Another KGB case, complete with first-hand testimony from soldiers,described a July 28-29, 1989 incident near Kaspustin Yar, the rocket launch anddevelopment site in the southeastern Soviet Union. 31[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1772542] The file isundoubtedly incomplete, but provides enough information to indicate somethingfascinating happened. Near midnight, a disc shaped object flew silently towardthe rocket weapons depot, flashing an intensely bright light from its underside.It then hovered above the weapons site at a height of 20 meters. It was roughly13 to 17 feet in diameter, and its hull was illuminated with a dim green,phosphorus-like, color. A bright beam appeared from beneath it, and the objectcircled two or three times. It moved toward a railway station, still flashingits lights, then returned to the weapons depot at a height of 60 to 70 meters.According to the available documents, orders were made to scramble a fighter jetto intercept the object, “but it was not able to see it in detail, because theUFO did not let the aircraft come near it, evading it. Atmospheric conditionswere suitable for visual observations.” mvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2020558] The objectremained visible in the vicinity for more than an hour. At around 1:30 a.m., itflew towards the town of Akhtubinsk and disappeared.Testimony from seven Soviet soldiers and officers strongly corroborate eachother. Three individuals, from their vantage point, stated that the objectperformed incredible acrobatic maneuvers, and at one point approached them veryrapidly. It then divided itself into three shining points and took the shape ofa triangle. “No aircraft could fly in this manner,” said one witness, a CorporalLevin. Another witness, Lieutenant Klimenko, stated that the object “acceleratedabruptly and also stopped abruptly, all the while doing large jumps up or down.”Before this object left, another appeared, and then another still, at lowaltitudes of 300 to 400 meters. The last of these gave flashes of red light atconstant intervals, then lights of all colors. Witnesses made it out ascigar-shaped. It flew to the first UFO, and the two disappeared beyond thehorizon. The available records do not make it explicitly clear, but it seemsthat a second jet intercept took place at this time, although this might havebeen the same attempt as previously mentioned. Unfortunately, no information onthe scramble mission or radar data was ever made available. mvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2020890] The similarity of this case with countless American cases is evident.This does not appear to be a misidentification of weather phenomenon; thewitnesses all described a maneuvering craft that outperformed intercepting jets.Explaining this as secret “black” technology raises interesting questions: wouldit be the same group that presumably was responsible for similar air spaceviolations over American or European bases? The available evidence indicatesthat the Soviets did not know the origin of these UFOs, just as it shows theAmericans were equally in the dark regarding their UFOs.If anything, things became stranger as the year progressed, just as thepolitical situation continued to radicalize. On September 10, 1989, the nationof Hungary announced that its border to the West would be available to EastGermans. This was an unprecedented decision, and effectively made the BerlinWall obsolete, although it lasted for two more months. Within days of thisannouncement, thousands of East Germans left their country. Through it all, theU.S. remained cautious, even aloof to the point where Senator majority leaderGeorge Mitchell accused President Bush of being “almost nostalgic about the ColdWar.” mviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2021344] Bythe end of September, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker met in Washington withSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. The Soviets gave up their formeropposition to Star Wars, agreed to dismantle a giant phased array early warningradar installation at Krasnoyasrk, Siberia (without asking for any correspondingAmerican actions in Greenland or Britain), and made other major concessions –all in the hopes of kick-starting arms reduction talks. Finally, the Bush teamrealized that the Soviets were “for real” with their reforms. Still, Bakerrejected all Soviet proposals. This was a hard defeat for Gorbachev, who neededsomething to appease his hardliners. mix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2021588] The Soviet collapse continued apace. In October, Hungary officially abandonedLeninism and declared itself to be a free republic. On October 6, 1989,Gorbachev was in Berlin for the 40th anniversary of the German DemocraticRepublic, telling the Germans to get started on their reforms, listening tochants of “Gorby save us,” and being glared at by East German leader ErichHonecker. The day after Gorbachev’s departure, 70,000 protesters marched inLeipzig. Honecker had actually given the order to open fire, but local partyleaders refused. Instead, Honecker was ousted and replaced by Egon Krenz, inwhat was the final gasp of the East German regime.Throughout the remainder of the year, landing cases and abduction casesproliferated within the Soviet Union. Between August and November, according toa Soviet UFO researcher at the Academy of Sciences, there were thirty recordedUFO landings in the single Ukrainian region of Nicolayev near the Black Sea.These landings were analyzed in the field and laboratory by teams of scientists.mx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2021760] Several ofthese were truly spectacular and fantastic, such as a September 16 case in whicha young woman waiting for a tram was lifted 160 feet in the air; the crowd belowher screamed, and she was eventually returned to the ground. mxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2021932] On the sameday, about 300 miles north in Chernobyl, an amber colored, elliptical object wasonce again reportedly seen when another radioactive leak occurred at Reactor 4.mxii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2022104]As incredible as they were, these and all the other Soviet cases wereovershadowed by the events in Voronezh, a city of nearly a million people a fewhundred miles to the east of the Ukrainian sightings, within Russia proper. Fortwo and a half weeks, between September 21 and October 7, a heavy UFOconcentration took place, including four landings and three different kinds ofentities being reported. These cases were sensational, and it is almost certainthat if they are true, then significant distortions have occurred in thetelling. Several boys were said to have seen a landed sphere on the evening ofSeptember 21, with two humanoid beings and a robot-like entity emerging from it.mxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2022281] On the24th, an engineer saw a maneuvering object that resembled an airship. mxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2022455]It was the event of September 27, however, that raised eyebrows around theworld. It was covered by the Soviet news agency, Tass , and as such carriedsomething of a stamp of approval. Still, despite the advent of glasnost, thestory was incredible enough that many researchers doubted its veracity. Sortingthrough the sensationalism to find the facts has been a challenge ever since.As reported in Tass , during the early evening, a large number of schoolchildren were playing in the park, supervised by about forty adults. At 6:30p.m., people noticed a pink or red light in the sky. This became a dark redsphere which circled forty feet above the ground and soon flew away. A fewminutes later, it returned and hovered over the park. While still in the air, ahatch opened up and an enormous being appeared – ten feet tall. It woresilver-looking coveralls and bronze colored boots. It also appeared to havethree eyes, or at least two eyes plus something else that looked like an eye.The being observed the terrain and then closed the hatch. The sphere came lower,brushed against a tree, and landed. It appeared to be forty-five feet indiameter. The tall being re-emerged, accompanied by a robot of some sort. Thebeing said something unintelligible, and a luminous rectangle, about four feetlong, appeared on the ground. It said something else, and the rectangledisappeared. It then adjusted something on the robot’s chest, causing it to walkin a mechanical way. One of the boys cried out in fear and the alien looked athim. When it did so, the boy became “frozen,” unable to move. People began toshout, and the sphere and beings vanished on the spot. That was not the end ofit, however. Within five minutes, the sphere and the being reappeared. Thistime, the being carried a tube about four feet long and pointed it at a teenageboy. In front of the astonished crowd, the boy disappeared, the alien enteredthe sphere and flew off, and the boy reappeared at the same time.The case was initially investigated by Genrikh Silanov, head of the VoronezhCommittee for the Study of Anomalous Phenomena. He and his group were speakingwith witnesses by early October. Silanov stated that although the Soviet mediatook creative license with his report, an extraordinary event seems to havehappened, supported by extensive corroboration among many high caliberwitnesses, including members of the local militia, a police lieutenant, a senioreconomist, a chief engineer, and other professionals. Something appeared to haveeither come down very low or landed. Many witnesses spoke of an unnaturallystrong fear in the presence of the object. What exactly this event was may wellremain shrouded in conjecture and folklore for many years. mxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2022619] Tass reported the Voronezh story on October 9, 1989; within days it wasworldwide. While a few UFO researchers were willing to believe somethingimportant happened, few if any took the story at face value. While the opinionsamong researchers ranged from caution to outright skepticism, the western mediastarted with skepticism – then moved on to ridicule. Many believed the case tobe a hoax. mxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2022921] One of thestrange additions to the story was that Soviet television displayed an insignia,allegedly worn by the alien, that was none other than the discredited UMMOsymbol. This had been a near-certain hoax case that was prominent in Spain andFrance during the 1960s and 1970s, involving alleged communications withextraterrestrials. Jacques Vallee, who had traveled to the Soviet Union toinvestigate Voronezh, and also had investigated the UMMO affair, considered it aspurious addition, “the result of unfortunate contamination induced byoverenthusiastic believers.” mxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2023536] Still, he wasappalled by the Western media’s portrayal of the case as emanating from childrenin a park with nothing better to do than make up fantasies. mxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2023713] Meanwhile, the strangeness continued. An incident in the city of Kirovtook place on October 5, with reportedly more than one hundred objects seen inthe sky. mxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2023891]A dangerous close encounter case reportedly occurred on October 11 near the townof Nalchik, in the Caucasus region. A sixteen year old young woman saw a “net”falling from the sky, apparently around her, in the center of which was a brightpoint. She tried to push it away, but received a shock. She screamed (her voicesounded distorted) and her family rushed out of the house. A flying disc washovering less than fifty feet away, but soon vanished. The girl was leftparalyzed for a while, the tips of her fingers burned and enlarged, and she washospitalized. Investigators described her as intelligent and rational. mxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024064] On October 7, Pravda reported that the Soviet Union had just opened anofficial center for the study of UFOs, located near Moscow. Physicists,geologists, astronomers, and psychologists were to teach courses on the variouscharacteristics of UFOs that had been reported and were to be given theequipment necessary to investigate. mxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024239] On October 12, just after announcing the Voronezh story, Pravda reportedthat a group of scientists visited a field in Perm Oblast to investigate claimsthat a UFO had landed in the area and left behind a circular impressionmeasuring 62 meters in diameter. mxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024401] It was soonsuggested that mass hysteria was playing a role in the Soviet UFO reports, andthe Soviet media was blamed for fanning the flames. Skeptical Soviet scientists,for instance, believed that recent fragments supposedly from an extraterrestrialcraft (such as the Dalnegorsk case) were actually from failed rocket launches.Other sightings, they argued, probably resulted from the inability of people torecognize ball lightning. mxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024570] Maybe so, but there were people within the Soviet Union taking thisseriously. A conference later in October in Petrozavodsk included about 100Soviet scientists representing various branches of science and technology. Theirmain topic of discussion was the multitude of claims of recent UFO sightings inthe USSR. According to the magazine Soviet Culture , “more questions about UFOswere raised at this conference than answered.” mxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024739]Also, mass sightings continued. The October 21 edition of Socialist Industryreported that hundreds of residents had reported a UFO in Omsk, many of whomreported the story directly to the newspaper’s office in that city. It includeda report by a Major V. Loginov, who said that it was a shining sphere about oneand a half times the apparent size of the Moon. Radar failed to detect it as itpassed over.Four projectors – some parallel and some at angles to the Earth – were castingvery bright beams. The object was in the field of vision for about 5 minutes ...hovering ... over the civil airport before descending a little. Then theprojectors were turned off and a whirling plume trail instantaneously appearedaround this shining sphere.... Pilots were able to observe it visually, but theycould not detect it on their radar screens....Radar signals could not bereflected from it. This object was immediately reported up the chain-of-command,and our colleagues in the Altay Kray, in the area toward which the object flew,reported back to us within 5 minutes that they had it under visual observation.That means that it had covered a distance of approximately 600 kilometers at aspeed of about 7,000 kilometers per hour. It is entirely possible that theestimates of speed were incorrect, but this appears to have been an object ofunusual design that had complete radar-stealth capability combined withexceptional maneuverability. mxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2024903]A KGB “Blue Folder” report described a case from the same day, more than 2,500miles away in the eastern region of Magadan. Near the village of Burkhala,several local residents watched a flying object silently approach an electricpower transmission line, then sharply change course and climb. Higher in theair, it reduced speed, enabling the witnesses to see it more clearly. Aboutseven to nine lights were seen shining along the edge of the object. One of thewitnesses, who had formerly worked at the Baikonur space center, estimated theobject’s speed at close to 1,000 kph (600 mph). He knew of no aircraft thatcould have executed such a maneuver. mxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2025074]Strange sightings went on into November and December. By then, Voronezh hadbecome a pilgrimage by correspondents seeking sensational news for theirnewspapers, regardless of the nature of the evidence of the actual event. mxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2025308] The monumental news of late 1989, of course, was the opening of theBerlin Wall on November 9 – a date of longstanding significance to Germans. 32[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1772755] The Wall hadbeen a fixture of German and international politics since 1961; now, withbreathtaking speed, it was gone. Indeed, it can easily be argued that with thefall of “die Mauer” marked the real end of the Cold War itself. Yet, Gorbachevhad not intended this result when he had begun his reforms. Like Stalin manyyears before, he now privately worried about the likely reunion of theGermanies. But events were spinning out of control. Before the end of the year,bloodless revolution would sweep through Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia; and abloody one would strike Romania with lightning speed. All this can be seen asthe unintended consequences of liberalization within a repressive regime.With the fall of the Berlin Wall, there appear to have been a few quietconversations and reassessments as to whether or not a UFO cover-up wasnecessary any longer (more on this later). After all, with the “evil empire” onthe verge of crumbling, what need would there be for secrecy? From whom were thesecrets being kept, if not America’s longtime enemy, the Soviet Union?Actually, the collapse of Soviet power itself is instructive by way of answeringthis question. Consider the parallels of Soviet and UFO secrecy. Gorbachevinherited a Soviet regime that had existed for seven decades, during which ithad systematically falsified its history, repressed nationalities, murderedmillions, and committed countless other crimes. Within the United States of1989, (and surely other nations), the UFO secret had been going for at leastfour decades. It, too, required a systematic falsification of history andundoubtedly the creation of a substantial secret infrastructure equal to thetask of managing the problem. Such an infrastructure would by definition beillegal within any reasonable understanding of what constitutes an “open”society – or at least there would be many people expressing that opinion. Adisclosure of the UFO reality would unquestionably lead to revelationsthreatening the established order. Initially, as with Gorbachev’s reforms, theprocess might begin slowly, but uncomfortable questions would inevitably arise:What is the extent of the black infrastructure that deals with this issue? Howmuch money has been diverted? Has revolutionary technology been hidden from thegeneral population? Why did the mainstream media and academic institutionsignore this for so long? What, if any, international cooperation and secrecy hasexisted on this matter? Who are the beings that are here? Do they abduct people?Has the military abducted people? Have alien beings influenced our society inany way? If so, have they recorded our history – and if so, what revelationswould a review of that history unveil? Would such claims even be believed?All by way of starting the conversation. Undoubtedly, much more would open up,bringing revelations that could well result in a tidal wave. The Belgian TrianglesBy 1989, sightings of triangular UFOs had been going on for some time. Indeed,the first major flap occurred fourteen years earlier in North Carolina, andsporadic sightings even earlier than that. The Hudson Valley sightings of theearly 1980s made the triangle phenomenon into something that serious researcherscould no longer ignore. Sightings of triangles and boomerangs over California’sAntelope Valley (amid other strange aerial objects in that region) also becamean important element of UFO research during the late 1980s. These were stillgoing on there at the end of 1989 – a case in point was a November 18occurrence, when a large, black, boomerang glided over downtown Lancaster duringthe early evening. Low intensity lights, similar to stars, outlined its frame.The witness, Robert Puskas, estimated its size at between 800 feet and 900 feetin span. Off its left tip he saw a silvery metallic disc, about 30-40 feet indiameter, reflecting the street lights. mxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2025472] Placing an exclamation point on the triangle phenomenon were the extended, masssightings over the nation of Belgium in 1989 and 1990. From late autumn throughthe spring, triangular UFOs were frequently seen traversing Belgian skies.Sightings had taken place through November 1989, but the first major event tookplace at the end of the month, on November 29, in the city of Eupen, very closeto the German border.Just before 5:30 p.m., two on-duty Belgian police officers saw a largetriangular craft descend close to their position at a low altitude. It had abright light at each corner, and a large reddish-orange pulsating light in thecenter. They were sure this was a large structured craft, perhaps as long as 200feet. It glided over the terrain, stopping and starting with ease, and wasnearly completely silent except for a faint hum. As it hovered over a fieldclose to them, it gave off a brilliantly intense light, much brighter than astandard searchlight. This illuminated their patrol car. When the object beganto move again, they decided to follow it. They watched it move toward theGileppe Dam, whereupon it descended and hovered directly over the water for 45minutes. While this was going on, a second triangle rose from a nearby ravine –a perfectly silent, brightly lit, enormous object with a lit dome on top, lessthan 300 feet away from the awestruck policemen. It departed toward the town ofHenri-Chapelle.There were other witnesses to triangular craft that night. The Belgian UFOresearch organization, SOBEPS, collected nearly 120 reports from November 29.One of the objects moved southwest about 13 miles and hovered over the city ofSpa for 30 minutes before disappearing. In the nearby town of Lontzen, a familysaw the object, which frightened the children. The mother called the police invarious places, including Aix-la-Chapelle. She later told a serious investigatorthat the police laughed at her derisively. mxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2025737] Sightings continued at a high pace throughout December. On the eveningof December 1, several witnesses described a four-cornered, lozenge-shapedobject over Eupen, more than 100 feet long. Large and intensely bright whitelights flashed on and off regularly, while in the center was an orange light. OnDecember 5 or 12 (the witnesses, trying to recall the event, could not be sure),a married couple was driving in the town of Aix-la-Chapelle at 9:50 p.m., whenthey saw a flying object cut across the road directly in front of them. It hadvery bright lights, and emitted beams downward. It also had an orange light onthe underside. The witnesses initially wondered if it was simply anexceptionally low-flying aircraft, but its maneuvers and lighting arrangementsdid not support this theory. While home near Aix-la-Chapelle at 11:15 p.m., theysaw the exact same object flying low above their street. It was extremely largeand made no sound. mxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2026123]"},{"pageContent":" A landing case reportedly occurred on December 12, 1989, at 2:15 a.m.,at the town of Jupille, about 35 miles southwest of Eupen, by an enormous ovalobject which seemed jammed between several trees. It had small lights, changingback and forth from red to blue, around its circumference. The witness couldmake out a logo of sorts on the object, which were several ellipses crossingthemselves. Several times the object rose slightly, settled back to the groundand gave off a different sound each time it did so. It moved toward a neighbor’smeadow, shining down three beams of light. For a while the witness lost sight ofthe object, but then saw a bright, well-defined, shaft of light shoot out intothe sky. The witness reported this incident to the police and military, whichsoon investigated and found a gigantic circular trace in the meadow. At thecenter, the grass had been expertly shorn as if by a lawn mower, but grassclippings were nowhere to be found, and the grass within the circle had turnedyellow. The witness later reported to local UFO investigators that the militaryexpressed little interest in his testimony, “as if they knew what it was allabout.” mxxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2026317]Sightings like these continued throughout the remainder of the year andthroughout most of 1990.From the beginning, attempts were made to explain these sightings away. UFOresearcher Auguste Meessen discovered one of the early attempts by a Flemishjournalist who had written an article under the impressive sounding headline“Explanation from Washington.” It suggested that all the “hysteria” was causedby secret flights of the F-117A. When Meessen contacted the journalist, helearned that the writer had simply read an article on the F-117A. No researchhad gone into the sightings themselves. Thus started the baseless but tenaciousrumor that the Belgian triangle was actually the stealth fighter. One definiteeffect of such reporting was to dampen the public’s willingness to report whatthey saw, even though most estimates put the witness total at around 3,000 for1989 and 1990. mxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2026522] Abduction in Lower Manhattan1989 was truly an extraordinary year of UFOs. As the Belgian flap was in itsearly phase, a spectacular event occurred on the other side of the Atlantic.This was the Linda Cortile (pseudonym for Linda Napolitano) 33[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1772979] abduction caseof November 30, in which she was taken out of the twelfth floor window of herlower Manhattan apartment by a beam of light, accompanied by alien beings, andtaken into a UFO. More than a dozen independent observers appear to have seenthis, many of whom were directly interviewed by Budd Hopkins, and three by thisauthor. One of the witnesses to the event was a major political figure, whoseidentity Hopkins has never revealed but is widely understood to have beenthen-Secretary General of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar. Indeed,as shall be seen, de Cuellar was in all likelihood not just a witness, buthimself an abductee that early morning. Two other witnesses were security menwho were with de Cuellar, another was a woman who happened to be driving acrossthe Brooklyn Bridge while the abduction was occurring. Years later, two otherwitnesses, truck drivers for the New York Post , came forward and added yet moresupporting testimony. All of these people saw a UFO hovering above the apartmentbuilding, a bluish white beam of light shining down from its underside, andwatched Linda, together with three aliens, floating high above the street.Long before the event, Linda had held a belief that she had experienced alienabductions, and had been meeting with Budd Hopkins for that reason. By 1989,however, she assumed her abductions were a thing of the past. On the morningfollowing her experience, she phoned Hopkins in a very agitated state. She wokeup feeling that she had been dropped into her bed, and had tried to wake herhusband. He was so unresponsive that she thought he was dead. Her childrenseemed the same way. She thought, “they’ve killed my family.” She even retrieveda hand mirror and placed it under the nose of one of her sons to check. Onlythen did she experience the relief that her family was alive, after all. Soonafter, they all woke up in a groggy state.Three days later, Linda met Hopkins for a hypnotic regression session. Duringthis, she recalled three or four small figures approach her bed, move her intothe living room, and take her outside through a closed window into abluish-white beam of light. Floating vertically, twelve stories above theground, she ascended into a large object hovering above the building, and wassubjected to a “fairly typical” physical examination. It appeared that when shewas returned to her bed, her family was still “switched off,” which is why theyappeared dead.In early February 1991, more than a year after the event, Hopkins received atypewritten letter, signed by the names “Richard” and “Dan.” They said they werepolice officers who had seen a woman being lifted out of the window of a largebuilding between 3 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. in late November 1989. They described thebright light, the object, and three “ugly but smaller humanlike creatures”accompanying her. They said they wrote to Hopkins out of a feeling of guilt andworry over what happened to the woman. Since they knew where she lived, theyalso soon contacted her. It was an emotional meeting, and the two were amazedthat they actually had gotten to meet her. In time, Richard and Dan informedHopkins that they were not actually police officers, nor were they alone intheir car that morning of the abduction. They were, in fact, security agentsescorting an important political figure to a downtown heliport.Hopkins also learned that Linda had received correspondence from a man whoclaimed to have witnessed the abduction. His car had stalled two blocks away, hesaid, and he and the two men with him had seen the whole event at around 3:30a.m. In other words, this was the important political figure being protected byRichard and Dan.This man was United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. It turnedout that Perez de Cuellar was in New York City, traveling from a heliport withhis two secret service agents. After further investigation, Hopkins determinedthat Perez de Cuellar was not simply a witness, but had been abducted as well.This fact was confirmed by Linda’s son, who identified de Cuellar from twentyphotos of men shown to him by Hopkins. This, said Linda’s son, was the man whowas with him and comforted him during the abduction. Hopkins contacted Perez deCuellar about the incident, and met with him face-to-face on one occasion.Significantly, de Cuellar did not deny his involvement, but Hopkins declined toname him in his book. 34[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1773268] Another witness (pseudonym: “Janet Kimble”) came forward in the fall of 1991and described the abduction as it appeared from her vantage point on theBrooklyn Bridge. In a manilla envelope, she sent a letter and drawings toHopkins, describing what she had seen. She had been returning from a retirementparty, and was more than halfway across the Brooklyn Bridge on her way toManhattan when, just before 3 a.m., her headlights dimmed and then went out.Through her rearview mirror she saw other cars in the same situation. She sawwhat she thought was a building on fire in Manhattan. “The whole sky lit up. Mr.Hopkins, words can’t express what I saw that morning up on the BrooklynBridge....” Her drawings were of the bright lights and the object she saw; thesecond showed four figures (“children,” she wrote) being lifted in the air.“While I watched,” she added, “I could hear the screams of the people parked intheir cars behind me.” The third drawing described the craft rising above thebuilding and departing at a fast speed.“I have often wondered what happened to these poor children,” she concluded. “Itfelt good sharing this with you, but I don’t think I will ever share this withanyone again.” She left her phone number, and Hopkins phoned her. Heinvestigated her claims, which showed no sign of deception, and they met for anextended face-to-face interview.“She answered every question I asked withcomplete openness, accuracy, and appropriate emotion,” Hopkins later wrote. Heeven drove over the Brooklyn Bridge at 3 a.m. to see what he could see. Indeed,Linda’s building was clearly visible. It was just as “Janet Kimble” described.There were other witnesses to the event that Hopkins interviewed, and a greatdeal of miscellaneous investigation. Eventually, he put the story together in a1996 book, Witnessed . After the story gained notoriety, other witnessescontinued to come forward. One of these, a driver for the New York Postnewspaper (whose headquarters are in the neighborhood where the event tookplace), recalled the event years later, after seeing a documentary about it ontelevision. Under the pseudonym Yancy Spence, he described his experience ofhaving seen the abduction at 3:15 a.m. while he was driving over the ManhattanBridge. Moreover, he learned that other Post employees on the job also saw it.Spence and another New York Post employee later met with Budd Hopkins. Theauthor also interviewed both of these individuals, as well as a third New YorkPost employee, all of whom provided consistent testimony. One of theseindividuals recalled not simply being a witness, but also being abducted aswell. Indeed, they also provided clear witness evidence to the (highly unusual)presence of a line of stretch limousines outside the Post newspaper office atthat late hour, and description of what strongly appeared to have been JavierPerez de Cuellar. mxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2026725] The likelihood that this case involved one of the world’s most prominentleaders is of undoubted importance. But what might it mean? Steven Greer – whodid not believe this was an alien abduction but rather a “covert kidnapping” –said that “a first hand witness” (a friend of de Cuellar and himself a head ofstate) personally related the details of this abduction to him. Greer said deCuellar was trying to promote a disclosure of the extraterrestrial reality and“was made to disappear, as it were, in a faked or hoaxed abduction attempt.”Once on board, de Cuellar was told to “cease and desist from any further attemptto bring this information out.” The group behind the abduction was opposed toany disclosure plans, and would terrorize anyone foolish enough to think thatthe end of the Cold War might augur truly radical change. Greer added that hissource and de Cuellar both believed the event to be an actual alien abduction –even though Greer implied that he knew better. It is for reasons like this thatmany researchers have considered Greer’s longstanding opposition to the claimsof alien abduction as nothing less than dogma, blindness in the face of anoverwhelming mass of data. This author heard Greer on one occasion statecategorically that all cases of alleged alien abduction were in reality militaryabductions. As of this point, the identity of the captors can only beconjecture, although it must be acknowledged that all of the abducteesmaintained their captors were alien.Greer added another interesting claim: that the event had so panicked the BushWhite House, its own UFO disclosure plans were immediately called off. Althoughevidence for this is lacking, UFO researcher Grant Cameron raised several pointsthat support the idea. Was there a plan to release the UFO secret following theend of the Cold War, wondered Cameron, and was the abduction an attempt by somegroup – whether human or alien – to stop it?Cameron noted that on the day following the abduction, President George Bushleft Washington for Malta to meet with Gorbachev and announce the virtual end ofthe Cold War. Also, just hours before the abduction, Canadian Prime MinisterBrian Mulroney had briefed Bush at the White House regarding his recent meetingwith Gorbachev. There were also rumors that Mulroney traveled to New York Cityfollowing his visit with Bush, and was part of the de Cuellar motorcade.Finally, according to “Richard” (one of de Cuellar’s two secret service agents),the motorcade was heading for the heliport at Governors Island – a securecomplex managed by the U.S. Coast Guard. The year before, it had been the siteof a summit that included President Reagan, President-elect Bush, and Sovietleader Gorbachev.Thus, the timing and location of the abduction, as well as the high-levelperson(s) connected to it, suggest geopolitical significance. As Cameron put it,this event occurred on a night that the U.N. Secretary General and other worldleaders “were in New York, in effect, to oversee the end of the cold war.”mxxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2027436] Still,without more information, the most one could say is that there are severalpossible agendas to the events in lower Manhattan. Panama: Dress Rehearsal for a New World OrderThe collapse of Soviet power changed everything. For generations, whenevereither superpower contemplated a major action, it had to consider the likelyresponse of the other. Now, the United States was unexpectedly liberated fromthat concern. This would be most obviously expressed during the 1991 Gulf War,but an important dress rehearsal took place at the end of 1989, in Panama. Theinvasion of Panama was an event of global importance. Although it lacked directconnections to the UFO phenomenon, it was a key moment in the development of theAmerican “National Security State” and as such demands a brief analysis.By the time he became President, George Bush had turned on his old friend,Panamanian “strong man” Manuel Noriega. The public change started at the end ofthe Reagan years, when Vice President George Bush and New York Senator AlfonseD’Amato demonized Noriega as a drug-dealing dictator who brutalized his ownpeople. All of which was true, but Noriega had done these things for many yearsas a key asset of the CIA since the 1950s – on contract with the Agency since1967. 35 [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1773477] Hewas trained at the infamous School of the Americas at Fort Gulick (Panama) andFort Benning (Georgia), and trained in psyops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Foryears he had acted as a back channel to the communist government of Fidel Castroin Cuba, and was described by an Air Force colonel as “the best source ofinformation the United States had in Latin America.” mxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2027591] Noriega’s real problem was that he had become a wild card who knew too much. Hehad acquired a list of telephones throughout Latin America that were tapped bythe NSA. Worse, he had collected incriminating evidence of the CIA’s involvementin the Iran-Contra affair – including the smuggling of cocaine into the U.S. Hewas suspected of supplying intelligence not only to the U.S. and its allies, butto Cuba as well. Then there was the matter of the Panama Canal. Built by U.S.money and manpower in the early 20th century, ownership of the canal was due torevert to Panama in 1990. As long as a loyal regime was in power during thistransition, the situation might be tolerable to U.S. policymakers. In lateryears, Noriega insisted that U.S. hostility developed from his refusal tosupport the right-wing Nicaraguan Contras. “Made” and protected by the U.S.intelligence community in order to run Panama, Noriega’s loyalty was no longerassured. He had to be removed.In April 1989, on the eve of the Panamanian Presidential election, the U.S.secretly supplied Noriega’s political opponents with $10 million. The amountseems small by American standards, but in a poor nation with a population ofjust over 2 million people, it was a staggering sum. Noriega canceled theballoting, violence broke out, and the U.S. sent in 2,000 troops. The CIA wasgiven $3 million to arrange a coup d’état . Meanwhile, General Colin Powell,Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, and Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitzplanned Noriega’s demise. Troops and weapons were secretly moved into theregion. A U.S. Delta Force team staged phony “attacks” on U.S. soldiers; thesewere reported in the media as attacks by “terrorists” against Americanpositions. American troops set up roadblocks in civilian neighborhoods,conducted offensive maneuvers outside U.S. jurisdiction, and challengedPanamanian Defense Force (PDF) troops – all in an effort to provoke Noriega intodoing something foolish.Laws and customs that might have inhibited U.S. actions were brushed aside. Onesuch law prohibited the White House from ordering the assassination of foreignleaders. The obvious loophole was to plan an operation in which Noriega wouldprobably be killed, without explicitly ordering his death. mxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2027786] AssistantAttorney General William P. Barr did his part to facilitate a legal revolution,when he argued that U.S. law enforcement officers were, in fact, allowed toarrest foreign leaders inside their own country and deliver them to U.S. courtsfor prosecution. U.S. law was also re-interpreted to allow American soldiers toconduct covert operations targeting foreign politicians, effectively a licenseto kidnap. mxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2027974]On December 16, 1989, a group of U.S. Marines that specialized in provocationswere fired on in front of PDF headquarters. An Intelligence Officer was killed,and a Navy officer and his wife were detained and beaten. President Bush now hadhis pretext for “Operation Just Cause.” Officially, it involved 26,000 U.S.troops, and was America’s largest military action since Vietnam. Soon, B-1bombers, Apache attack helicopters, and F-117A stealth fighters engaged in amassive attack on Panama City. The initial midnight bombardment killed between3,000 and 4,000 civilians – the exact number was never revealed, as more than adozen mass graves were quickly dug in secrecy. Witnesses also testified thatthey saw many captured PDF soldiers bound and summarily executed by U.S. troops.The United Nations and the Organization of American States both condemned theinvasion, and declared the civilian deaths to be a war crime. Little of thisreceived comment in the U.S. media. Instead, Americans were treated to the dramaof how to remove “Pineapple Head” (as Noriega was dubbed) from the safety of theVatican Embassy.The Pentagon tested many of its new weapons, all with great success. Stealthfighters, for example, representing only two percent of the attack aircraft inthe theater of war, destroyed over forty percent of the strategic targets.mxxxviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2028389] Alsotested were a variety of other secret weapons such as poison darts fired fromthe air and laser weapons that sliced through automobiles and “melted” humanbodies. mxxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2028554]The war obliterated the PDF to such an extent that in 1991, Guillermo Endara,Panama’s new leader, proposed abolishing the Panamanian army. The U.S. Congresssoon passed a law calling for a renegotiating of the Panama Treaties, as Panamaclearly could not defend itself or the canal. The U.S. therefore maintainedcontrol. Incidentally, not only did the new Panamanian regime fail to “restoredemocracy” (one of the stated goals of President Bush), but narcoticstrafficking noticeably increased, possibly doubling. mxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2028795]The invasion of Panama offered a glimpse not only into American realpolitik ,but also of the contempt held by America’s leadership for its professed ideals,and the extent of America’s secret and illegal international activities. Ittherefore highlighted most starkly the desperate need by its leaders to suppresstruth at all cost – a fact of significance in the matter of UFOs. Americaremained a democracy in name and republic in form, but these terms were losingall meaning. The reality was that America had become an oligarchy using theforms of the old republic for its own ends. Perhaps it had always been so, assome have argued. Perhaps the difference was that now, without the Sovietcounterweight, America was losing her inhibitions. “Victory” in the Cold War hadbrought with it the fatal poison of hubris . Going to Area 51With the coming of 1990, as the world was in the process of transformation, therevelations of Bob Lazar were already turning the Groom Lake facility into thePromised Land for UFO devotees. Lazar had said that the best place to see theseobjects was called “the Mailbox,” at the 29½ mile marker on the road closest toArea 51. Wednesdays were the best night to go. In January 1990, video captured avery unusual light phenomenon moving like a kite in the wind, except thedistances covered and speed were vastly greater. By way of comparison, the videoalso captured a standard aircraft which showed conventional flightcharacteristics. mxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2029033] On February 21, Norio Hayakawa, a television journalist, took a crew tosee the test flight of an object from Groom Lake. Shortly after sundown, thegroup saw an orange-yellow light appear above the hills. They had a secondsighting later that evening when an object went to the right, descended,performed a back turn, and a 5,000 foot sudden descent, more or less instantly.“I have never seen anything like that in my life, ever, said Hayakawa. “It isdefinitely a test flight of a highly unusual object.” mxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2029201]A week later, on February 28, a man named Gary Schultz went to the Mailboxaccompanied by his wife, Pearl. At 7:30 p.m. he leaped out of his lawn chairwhen the first craft came out. Every 45 minutes, a new object arrived – six inall. According to Schultz, two or three of the craft were “amazing” bright,pulsing, ellipsoid objects. He took photos, one of which clearly captured anobject shaped rather like a bell. mxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2029369]More dark rumors and claims continued to percolate. In early 1990, on thepopular Billy Goodman KVEG radio talk show in Las Vegas, an anonymous callerwith the pseudonym of “Yellow Fruit” claimed to be a security officer at theNevada Test Site. He said that Area 51 contained underground bases and tunnelsconcealing activities relating to aliens. William Hamilton met with thisinformant at Rachel’s Bar and Grill, located fairly close to the Test Site.There, he gave Hamilton an account of an impending conflict between the“benevolent ones” and another group of small aliens – the EBEs. He told Hamiltonthat “Yellow Fruit” was the designation for the first level of security at Area51. The second level, much harsher, was called Seaspray. These classificationsdid indeed exist. Groups named Yellow Fruit, Seaspray, Delta Force, QuickReaction Team, Task Force 160, Intelligence Support Activity, and SpecialOperations Division were creations of the Pentagon, fully functional by 1981with no Congressional oversight. They staged secret missions throughout CentralAmerica, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, complete with front companiesand proprietaries. Perhaps they were doing work at Area 51, as well. mxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2029538]The Wackenhut private security firm worked closely within this structure,providing perimeter security for the Nevada Test Site. To UFO hunters combingthat perimeter, the “Wackenhut SS” became a familiar sight. Toting machine guns,wearing military camouflage but no insignias, and driving unmarked 4x4 vehicles,they became notorious for their harassment of citizens who got too close, evenwhile they were on public land and well within their legal rights. Thiscat-and-mouse game between UFO watchers and security personnel would continuefor several more years, until the Air Force took all the useful bordering landsthrough a Congressional grant. Gulf Breeze RevisitedThroughout 1988, 1989, and into the 1990s, Gulf Breeze continued to be the sceneof UFO sightings, as much of a Mecca for UFO watchers as Area 51. Whatever onethought of Ed Walters, it was obvious that something very interesting was goingon there. By early 1989, more than 135 of Gulf Breeze’s 6,000 residents hadreported seeing strange craft hovering in the skies during the previous year anda half. mxlv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2029917] Sightings were a common occurrence throughout 1990. A particularlyinteresting one occurred on the night of February 8, 1989, when a Gulf Breezeman woke to the sounds of a restless dog outside. He saw a small objectdescending low over a nearby lot. It appeared to be two connected discs, one ontop of the other, not more than three feet in diameter. A white light was ontop, many other lights blinked in shades of red, orange, and green. The witnessclearly had strong nerves: he decided to bring the object into his house. As heapproached it, however, it disappeared in a flash of light. The entire eventlasted for about 12 minutes; it was investigated by MUFON’s Charles Flanagan.mxlvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2030229] Laterthat spring in nearby Crestview, Florida, another stout-hearted witness observeda humming, hovering disc with a brilliant white light on its underside. This manaimed his rifle at the object, but a light beam engulfed him, and he misfiredhis rifle. The object then sped away. mxlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2030415] For its part, nearby Eglin AFB claimed that it had no record of UFOsightings or radar trackings. The base director of public affairs vehementlydenied that Air Force planes had pursued unknowns, and denied that Eglinpersonnel were studying the Gulf Breeze incidents. He did hint that some of thesightings might inadvertently have been caused by base activities: “we normallyoperate in the daylight hours, but some systems need testing at night.” Asimilar statement was made by the Pensacola Naval Air Station, which emphasizedthat it had very little after-dark activity. Residents, however, did notice twolarge vans with NASA logos parked at various locations throughout Florida’spanhandle during the late 1980s. A NASA spokesperson said they were not there tomonitor UFOs. mxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2030594] Perhaps not, but more than once the U.S. military appeared to beobserving them. On January 8, 1990, half a dozen Gulf Breeze residents saw adark object, either round or elliptical, moving across the sky with a red light.Several witnesses photographed it, then noticed military helicopters apparentlyfollowing. The following day, witnesses checked with the air traffic controltower at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, and were told that “unusual activityover Gulf Breeze requir[ed] the deployment of search and rescue helicopters.”When asked what they were searching for, traffic control said, “given the natureof things that are going on over Gulf Breeze, take your best guess.” mxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2030816] Interesting cases continued throughout the spring of 1990. A womanfeeding her infant on March 7 noticed a beam of white light about three feet indiameter descend to the ground beyond her window. She felt a slight vibration,and two seconds later it was gone. The following morning her husband found acircle of burned grass eleven feet in diameter near the window. Several peopledetected a strong “perfume” odor from the scorched area. The case wasinvestigated by MUFON. ml[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2031039] Another Gulf Breeze case occurred on April 5, 1990, also investigated byMUFON. A motorist driving near the shore at 8:15 p.m. saw what looked like a jetfighter about to crash. Meanwhile, two military jets approached from the north,and the original object immediately shot laterally southward, halting one to twomiles away. The man got out of his car to watch. The object appeared to be awhite disc, with red and green lights spaced evenly around the side, and anunlit dome at the top. Slowly, it began to rise. He got to a telephone andcalled a friend (who contacted MUFON investigators) and also the Sheriff’soffice. Two deputies were soon on the scene, and for the next two hours thethree witnesses watched a bright light continue to ascend slowly and at variancewith the stars. mli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2031225] Five days later, a couple driving north on the Bay Bridge saw an objectthat looked like a long isosceles triangle with a centered red light on thebottom and pairs of white lights at the three apexes. In other words, an objectwith a passing resemblance to the Belgian triangles. As they neared the end ofthe bridge, the object moved toward the west of their position. They pulled overand watched it hover, then move off over the bay and out of sight. mlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2031412] A mini-wave was occurring in Gulf Breeze. On the evening of April 11, severalresidents watched a red light move toward the southwest and then out into theGulf of Mexico before winking out. Some witnesses thought they saw clusters ofballoons associated with the light, while others disagreed. On the followingnight, two witnesses saw a bright red light hovering over Little Sabine Island.It stayed there for several minutes, then blinked out. On the 13th, the samewitnesses saw another light to the west of Gulf Breeze. It hovered for a fewminutes and disappeared. The witnesses were experienced in the use of flares,and were convinced that this was not the explanation. During the same evening,at least five other witnesses saw a red light to the north of Gulf Breeze. Thelight hovered for a few minutes, then shot up when an aircraft approached. Afterthe airplane passed the location, the red light reappeared for a while, thenshot straight up again and vanished.On the 14th, at least seven people reported a red light to the north of GulfBreeze. It approached from the east at a very high speed and came to a deadstop. It hovered, moved back and forth several times, then ascended out ofsight. A second group of people saw another red light north of Gulf Breeze hoverfor a few minutes and then disappear. Yet a third red light was seen bywitnesses at the south end of the Bay Bridge. It approached from thesouth-southeast, passed nearly overhead, and then moved toward the northeastover the East Bay where it promptly blinked out. MUFON Florida State SectionDirector Rex Salisbury believed that at least three red lights were in the areaat about the same time. More red lights were seen in Gulf Breeze on April 17 andthen on the 18th a red light was seen moving at a speed between 35 and 45 mph,according to Bruce Maccabee’s triangulation based on visual and photographicdata, although the wind speed was only 6 mph and was almost across the path ofthe light.Analyzing the spring sightings, Salisbury conceded that pranksters might havebeen responsible for some of the events, but also believed that the multiplesightings in different locations at the same time and moving in differentdirections would have posed tough problems for a hoaxer, to say nothing of thevery high speed achieved in the case of one of the objects. mliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2031600] Hoaxing was certainly the idea that Philip Klass believed to explainevents at Gulf Breeze. On April 28, 1990, an advertisement was placed in thePensacola News Journal stating: “Warning: Hoax ‘UFO’ balloons being flown nearGulf Breeze by unknown persons are an ILLEGAL HAZARD to civil and militaryaircraft, and thus to persons on the ground.” The ad requested anyone withinformation on the parties responsible for “this illegal and potentiallydangerous activity” to call a phone number listed in the ad. When two UFOinvestigators independently called the number, they reached Klass. He wasattempting to build a case that provided a prosaic explanation for the GulfBreeze sightings. mliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2031811] Dirty Tricks: The Gulf Breeze “Model”Despite the proliferation of Gulf Breeze witnesses of UFOs, Ed Walters continuedto be the lightning rod of media interest. In January 1990, his book on GulfBreeze received a positive commentary from Kirkus Reviews . mlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2032021] However, anypositive media coverage he garnered was damaged by a June 10, 1990 article byCraig Myers in the Pensacola News Journal announcing that a UFO model had beenfound in the attic of his former residence. mlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2032197] The model caused many to question Ed Walters’ credibility, but it quicklyraised a problem of another sort. The key was that it was made from foam platesand a strip of Walters’ blueprint paper. Incriminating, indeed, except for onething: the paper was from architectural plans Walters developed in September1989 for a home he was planning to build. When the project fell through, hethrew the plans in the trash. By this time, however, Walters no longer lived inhis old residence – he had moved in December 1988. Thus, Walters could notpossibly have built the model while living in his prior residence. He haddeveloped the plans after moving out of his old house. The paper used for theGulf Breeze model, therefore, had to have made the journey from Walters’ newhome to his old home, and then been placed in the attic. There is no otherpossibility.Since it defies all reason that Walters would have planted the model himself inhis old home, the only sensible scenario is that someone picked his trash(something of which he had long been complaining), built the model, and plantedit in the still vacant house, presumably to discredit him.The discovery of the model itself is curious. The house remained vacant untilOctober 1989, when the new owner Robert Menzer moved in. Upon moving out,Walters had removed his ice-maker refrigerator, leaving a shut-off valve at theend of the water supply line. In March 1990, when Menzer connected his ice-makerrefrigerator, there was no water in the line. Assuming there was another valvesomewhere along the line, Menzer followed it into the attic above the garage (asearch which Menzer later duplicated for Gulf Breeze investigator, Bob Reid).There, the new homeowner found a crimp in the copper pipe that appeared to havebeen made with a pair of pliers. The UFO model was found carefully tuckedbeneath the insulation, next to the crimped pipe. This location was significantbecause, although the house was locked, access to the garage was fairly simple.In fact, there was even a built-in ladder leading up to the area where the modelwas hidden. Most convenient, indeed. mlvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2032493] On June 4,Menzer was interviewed by Craig Myers of the Pensacola News Journal. Myers askedMenzer three questions: have you seen any UFOs (No), have you seen any UFOphotos lying around (No), and have you found “any models of UFOs, anything likethat?” Apparently a very lucky question, as Menzer then produced the model.The model convinced some that Walters had hoaxed the photos. Gulf Breeze MayorEd Gray announced that Walters had engaged in a grand public deception in thequest for financial reward, but was undone by a “careless error.” mlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2032661] Others werenot impressed by the spectacle. Shirley McConnell, who had seen a UFO with herhusband in 1988, told the newspapers that what they had seen “was not a littlemodel. What we saw looked exactly like Ed Walters’ photograph. There weredefinite differences in the model and what we saw.” Another man, Adam Dye, hadseen a UFO over Gulf Breeze in November 1987, shortly before Ed Walters’ firstsighting. “Seeing is believing,” Dye said, “and I was not looking at a model.”Certainly, an examination of the model photographs shows distinct differencesfrom the object in the photographs. mlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2032870]Craig Myers published a second damaging story a few days later. This concernedTommy Smith, a former Gulf Breeze resident who claimed Walters had hoaxed thephotos. mlx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2033280] Atelephone interview with the young man had been arranged with Mayor Ed Gray,police chief Jerry Brown, television reporter Mark Curtis, and Myers. Smithstated that Walters photographed two UFO models, that his family was in on thehoax, and that he had tried to enlist Tommy’s help.As with the Gulf Breeze model, questions quickly arose regarding these claims.Smith claimed that he was not present during hoaxing of any of the publishedphotos, but stated that Walters told him how some of the photos had beencreated, such as the blue beams in two of the photos (peeling the back of thefilm and exposing it to light, an explanation rejected by several analysts andmanufacturers). Most of Walters’ hoaxed shots, said Smith, were done by using adouble exposure method with the Polaroid camera. This included the muchpublicized photo #19, also known as the “Road Shot,” although Smith could giveno specifics on how the shot was done. 36[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1773938] He added thata circle of dead grass found in a school soccer field behind the Walters home,allegedly caused by a UFO, had actually been made by Walters turning atrampoline upside down and jumping on it for several hours. This claim seemsfarfetched at best, considering that grass did not grow within that circle for18 months subsequent to the event.Generally speaking, it seems odd that Walters would have brought Smith into aninner circle for an alleged hoax, as Smith was not a close friend to anyone inthe family. Complicating the picture was another young man named Hank Boland,whom Smith claimed had taken part in the hoax. Boland, however, fully supportedWalters and denied involvement in any such activity. Needless to say, Walters’wife and son also denied participating in any hoax. mlxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2033568] The controversy prompted MUFON to reopen its case on Ed Walters. InJuly, Walt Andrus selected Rex and Carol Salisbury to investigate Tommy Smith’sclaims and determine whether the model had been used in Ed Walters’ photographs.Later that summer, Rex Salisbury released a provisional conclusion to the localpress, stating his belief that a hoax had indeed occurred. Yet Andrus continuedto wait for Salisbury’s final report. After repeated requests, Andrus askedMUFON investigator Gary Watson to assume the investigation. Watson presented hisconclusion, “Ed Walters is telling the truth,” at the 1991 MUFON symposium. Thisleft Andrus open to the charge that he replaced the Salisburys because he didnot like their conclusion (which he finally received from them in 1992). mlxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2033790] The confluence of evidence against Ed Walters generated more heat thanlight, as well as widespread suspicions that the evidence against him wasessentially fraudulent. Added to this was a demonstrably false picture fromearly 1990, created by a New York City photographer, of a Gulf Breeze-type craftthat was supposed to be flying near the Chrysler Building in New York City.mlxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2034201] WillySmith, although knowing it was a fake, promoted the picture as if it were realin his attempt (unsuccessfully) to lure Ed Walters into the trap of using thefake photo as proof that his were real. It certainly could appear todisinterested parties that machinations were afoot to discredit Ed Walters.Sightings by Gulf Breeze residents, including Ed Walters, continued into the1990s. Between November 1990 and July 1992 a group of people who carried out anightly skywatch recorded nearly 200 sightings, including red lights, rings oflight and other shapes. Researcher Bruce Maccabee was witness to a strange ringof lights in September 1991. mlxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2034484] The Soviet UFO of March 21, 1990The Soviet Union continued to spiral into oblivion. In January 1990, MikhailGorbachev was in Lithuania, which the previous month had voted for independencefrom Moscow. Gorbachev tried to compromise while somehow preserving the SovietUnion. Meanwhile, far to the south, the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan was besetby rioting and civil war between Muslims and Christians. In early February, theEast German government proposed a reunited and neutral Germany. Gorbachevgrudgingly accepted this, although Soviet hardliners were displeased. Then, onFebruary 5, Gorbachev proposed that the U.S.S.R. become a multiparty democraticstate. In March, Lithuania formalized its declaration of independence (whichGorbachev said was “illegitimate”), Estonia voted for independence, and Hungaryheld its first free elections since 1945. Preserving the U.S.S.R. had become alosing battle.Meanwhile, UFOs continued to make the news. On February 22, Rabochaya Tribunapublished a report by Soviet militiamen in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk whoclaimed that two disc shaped UFOs had followed their patrol cars, one of whichlanded on a nearby hill and “harassed them” with rays of colored lights beforeflying away. mlxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2034840] Another newsitem described fast and silent objects near Moscow on March 12 that could stopsuddenly and dart in different directions. Many residents spent their night onthe rooftops to watch. mlxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2035109] The greatest Soviet UFO sighting of the year took place on March 21, 1990, eastof Moscow. That night, between 8 p.m. and midnight, unknown objects were seenover a wide area encompassing Pereslavl, Zalessky, Novoselye, Zagorsk,Yakovlevo, Ploshevo, Dubki, Kablukovo, Fryazino, and Kirzhatch. Radar stationsand aircraft were placed on alert. Residents phoned authorities, describingflashes of white light that followed one another after two or three seconds. Allhad difficulty in describing the appearance of the objects. In one area, anobject was said to hover low, illuminating the ground below. Members of a watchpost in Zalessky stated they saw an object with red lights approach from thewest at 9:19 p.m. at a speed “much greater than that of any plane.” Fifteenminutes later, this object had “disappeared” but was followed by a similarobject with white lights, which would occasionally be lost from view.Two Soviet interceptors were dispatched that night. One of them was scrambled at9:38 p.m., flown by pilot Colonel A. A. Semyonchenko. At the time, the unknownwas above Pereslavl-Zalessky at an altitude of 2,000 meters. At 10:05 p.m.,Semyonchenko saw the target’s two white flashing lights, ahead and slightly tothe right. He tracked it on aircraft radar, distinguishing it from nearbycommercial traffic. By radio, he ordered the target to identify itself; insteadit only changed its speed and altitude. Semyonchenko then turned steeply andnoticed something like the aurora borealis in the north and northwest. Here-approached the UFO, passing above it just 500 to 600 meters away. He saw thetwo flashing white lights, and briefly saw the silhouette of the object againstthe background of the city. “It was difficult to determine its nature orclassification,” he stated, “due to the limited lighting.” He was then orderedto return to the airfield.The personnel in Zalessky observed this encounter. When Semyonchenko approachedthe UFO, they noticed that it would disappear. They also saw the unknown objectmake a turn and approach the jet “at a very high speed.” The object thendisappeared, only to reappear behind and above Semyonchenko’s jet. It playedcat-and-mouse games like this for a while longer, before it finally disappearedand Semyonchenko was ordered to return.A number of Soviet military witnesses got a better view of the object than didSemyonchenko. Captain V. Birin said “the object looked like a flying saucer withtwo very bright lights along the edges.” Judging by its shining lights, heestimated its diameter at between 100 and 200 meters, or between 300 and 600feet, certainly rather large. He described a less intense light, “which lookedlike a porthole,” between the two bright lights. He noticed a relationshipbetween the speed of the object and the speed of the flashing lights: “the moreoften they flashed, the faster the speed of the UFO, and vice versa. Whilehovering, the object extinguished its lights almost completely.” At 10:30 p.m.he saw the object depart toward Moscow. He enclosed a drawing of the craft forhis superiors.Captain V. Ivchenko said he “clearly saw two lights flashing with a definiteperiodicity.” The UFO, he said, carried out an “S-turn” flight. Captain N.Filatov said the object’s light sources appeared to merge and divide; itsbrightness was far greater than for signal lights of ordinary aircraft. He alsodescribed its movements as an “S-turn, horizontally and vertically.” Otherwitnesses saw the red identification lights of two aircraft accompanying themain UFO.Deputy Minister of Defense Ivan Tretyak spoke about the matter. While he refusedto acknowledge the UFO or speculate what it was, he said the pilots refrainedfrom attacking it because it might have possessed a formidable capacity forretaliation. The key statement about the event came from General Igor Maltsev,Chief of the Soviet Air Defense Forces. Maltsev acknowledged that several radarstations had tracked an unknown object, over 100 visual observations were madeby military personnel, and two photographs of the UFO were taken. Based on allthe data, he said the UFO was a disc approximately 100 to 200 meters indiameter, able to perform an ‘S-turn’ flight horizontally and vertically, aswell as hover and then fly “with a speed exceeding that of the modern jetfighter by 2 or 3 times.” All the while, it had been silent when doing thesethings. Maltsev commented that these objects were “completely devoid ofinertia.” Whoever was operating them, “they had somehow ‘come to terms’ withgravity.” Although he refused to speculate on the identity of the object, hesaid that “at the present time, terrestrial machines could hardly have any suchcapabilities.” mlxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2035298] The event was soon reported in full detail in the Soviet newspapers andtranslated by the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), anddetailed accounts were soon published in the MUFON UFO Journal and theInternational UFO Reporter . The CIA’s reaction appears to have beennoncommittal, although copies of its Foreign Press Report were sent to the JointChiefs of Staff, the FBI, Navy, and elsewhere. mlxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2035559] The Night of the Belgian TrianglesFor the previous six months or so, much of Europe had experienced a wave of UFOsightings. In terms of sheer drama, the climax occurred over Belgium andnorthern Germany on the night of March 30-31, 1990. At 10:50 p.m., the NATOradar station at Glons received a telephone call from a policeman in the city ofWavre who reported three unusual lights forming an equilateral triangle. Fifteenminutes later, a police patrol confirmed the observation and soon reported a newset of lights. Meanwhile, the radar screens at Glons detected an unknown targetmoving at the slow speed of 40 kph. For the next two and a half hours, otherpolice officers and civilians observed strange maneuvers of up to three sets oftriangular lights in the outskirts of Brussels. The lights were substantiallylarger in appearance than stars, often accelerated, and sometimes glowed red.Some witnesses claimed that the lights were attached to the underside of a hugetriangular craft, readily visible when it hovered at low altitudes. Itsvariation in speed was remarkable, from slower than an automobile to faster thana jet.NATO radar stations at Glons and Semmerzake tracked these unexplained blips. At11:56 p.m., the NATO Air Defense Sector Commander authorized the scrambling oftwo F-16s, which were airborne just after midnight. The two aircraft quicklyachieved radar lock-ons to their targets. However, an odd thing occurred: eachtime they got close, the radar lock was broken and the object took evasiveaction. Ground witnesses also reported that the object’s lights dimmedcompletely when the F-16s arrived.The object being pursued employed exceptional evasion tactics. During the firstradar lock-on, according to the report issued by the Royal Belgian Air Force,the UFO’s speed immediately changed from 150 knots to 970 knots and dropped itsaltitude from 9,000 to 5,000 feet. It quickly returned to 11,000 feet, thendropped again to close to ground level. The pilots then lost radar contact withit. In fact, the UFO had dropped its altitude by nearly one mile in a meresecond, a simply astonishing maneuver. This event was tracked on Air Force radarwhile amazed ground witnesses saw it. Another radar lock-on was obtained, butthen broken by what the report called “a jamming signal on the screen.” Theobject also exploited inherent weaknesses in radar tracking capability. When itdipped to an altitude of 200 meters from the ground, all five radar screens(three ground-base and two airborne) lost track of it. In addition, since theradars filtered out slow moving or stationary targets (on the assumption thatthey were not jets), the pilots could not close on the object whenever it sloweddown or stopped. The pilots were never actually able to see the objects. After75 minutes of futility, the intercept chase was called off.On the ground, military and police continued to observe “four white luminousspots forming a square” until around 1:30 a.m., when the four lights dimmed andseemed to depart in four different directions. The weather conditions on thatnight were very clear, allowing ground witnesses to observe the objects indetail, as well as the pursuit by the F-16s. A final estimate placed the numberof witnesses in Belgium and northern Germany at well over 2,000. On the nextmorning, newspapers reported the F-16s “came home with an empty bag.” mlxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2036305] The Belgian Air Force TalksThis was not true, however. On May 19, 1990, following an analysis of its data,the Belgium Air Force Headquarters announced that five different military radars(two on the F-16s and three radar stations) had detected unidentified echoes atthe same moment and in the same place as indicated by witnesses on the ground.Moreover, the data all confirmed that the objects had moved at incrediblespeeds. The “Report Concerning the Observation of UFOs During the Night of March30 to 31, 1990,” authored by Belgian Air Force Major P. Lambrechts of the AirForce General Staff in Brussels, included a full chronology of the events, aswell as many enclosures with eyewitness descriptions from several policeofficers and other data.Belgian Air Force analysts had examined and rejected many alternative hypothesesfor the UFOs, said Lambrechts, including “optical illusions, confusion withplanets or other meteorological phenomena ... weather balloons ...meteorological inversions ... holographic projections.” More significantly, “thespeeds measured at the moment of the change of altitudes, exclude the hypothesisthat the UFOs observed could be confused with aircraft.” This even included thenew stealth aircraft such as the B-2 or F-117, as well as remotely pilotedvehicles, ultra light aircraft, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS), oranything else known to fly. There were many puzzling features of the unknownobjects, said Lambrechts. For example, why was no shock wave created by theUFOs, even though several times it surpassed the sound barrier? In Lambrechtswords, “here, no explanation can be given.” mlxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2036961] Another Belgian Air Force figure who spoke about the events wasMajor-General Wilfried de Brouwer, Deputy Chief of the Royal Belgian Air Force.His statements were blunt. The dramatic changes of velocity and altitude takenby the object, he said, including a 2,000 meter drop within the space of onesecond, involved a fantastic acceleration equivalent to 40 g-forces, or fivetimes what a human pilot can withstand. Moreover, the F-16 had no chance ofkeeping up with the speed of the UFO when it approached ground level, due to thegreater air density. “There was a logic behind the motions of the object,” hesaid. De Brouwer later added that “the day will come undoubtedly, when thephenomenon will be observed with technological means of detection and collectionthat won’t leave a single doubt about its origin.... But it exists, it is real,and that in itself is an important conclusion.” mlxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2037219] Sightings of triangular craft continued in Belgium through April and afterward.Sometime in very early April, a young man took a photograph of the allegedtriangle above the city of Petit-Rechain. The image is of among the mostspectacular UFOs ever captured. With light enhancement, it shows a perfectlytriangular aircraft with rounded edges, white lights at the corners, and a redlight in the center. The object appears to be moving, and a pulse of some sortis visible behind the object. The Belgian Air Force Academy analyzed the image,found no evidence of a hoax, and said the picture appeared to be authentic. Belgian UFO: OpinionsMany mainstream sources were quick to throw cold water on all this silly UFOnews. The Financial Times of London focused on “the UFO-obsessed Belgian media,”how some sightings “resemble a lamp-post more closely than a UFO,” and how“surprising” it was that the Belgian military should take UFOs seriously. In thetraditional manner of British establishment press, analysis of an extraordinaryevent was replaced by glib sarcasm: Belgium may not have found its UFO, “but ithas found a nice new use for its air force now that its services are needed lessand less by earthlings.” mlxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2037438]Many explanations centered on the stealth fighter and bomber. The triangularshape of the UFO did seem to be a rough match with these newly unveiledaircraft, but in fact their performance was no different than most othersubsonic military aircraft; what made them special was their extremely low radarcross section. A memo from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency 37[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1774701] also statedthat the Americans privately confirmed to the Belgians that “no USAF stealthaircraft were operating in the Ardennes area during the periods in question.”mlxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2037643] Ofcourse, the wording of that memo was legalistically careful: “no USAF stealthaircraft” could still leave open other possibilities. A few years later, NickPope, who was employed at the British Ministry of Defence’s “UFO Desk,” alsolearned from his contacts in the Belgian government that the answer did notappear to be American aircraft. “They had no idea what the object was,” wrotePope, “and would dearly love to find out.” mlxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2038053] The Belgian UFO research organization SOBEPS obtained access to theBelgian Air Force reports and radar data, as well as 25 different videotapesmade during the sightings. Possessing a respected team of scientists, includingLeon Brenig, a nonlinear dynamics theorist at the Free University in Brussels,and Professor August Meessen, a physicist from the Catholic University atLouvain, the organization was well positioned to perform an independent analysisof the events of March 30-31. Several of SOBEPS senior officers andinvestigators were among the many witnesses to the object. SOBEPS membersconsidered the conventional culprits: ultralights, military aircraft,astronomical mistakes, holograms, lasers, and temperature inversions. Theirconclusion: “none of these hypotheses make any sense.” The radar tape, analyzedby Professor Meesen, was considered to be hard evidence of an extraordinarycraft with nonterrestrial performance characteristics. mlxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2038217] Dr. Jean-Pierre Petit, who was an aeronautical engineer, a cosmologistspecializing in plasma physics, and a Director of France’s National Center forScientific Research (CNRS), also studied the data. In an interview, he arguedthat the Belgian Triangle was not manmade:Given the speed of those machines, more than 1,800 kilometers per hour, theycould not have been weather balloons. Given the trajectory, it could not havebeen a meteorite or any satellite in the re-entry phase of space flight. Giventhe meteorological conditions, it could not have been either natural phenomenaor false radar echoes. Given the accelerations that were measured – 40 Gs – thiscould not have been an airplane. Let’s recall that one of the machinesaccelerated in one second from 280 kph to 1,830 kph.... There is at this momentno man made machine that is capable of performing at mach 1.5 close to theground because of heating due to the high air density.... To manufacture such amachine would require that the engine develop an amount of power equivalent tothat of a large nuclear power generating plant. And if there is anything notamenable to miniaturization, it is a nuclear power plant. Conclusion: themachines seen in Belgium are not of terrestrial origin. mlxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2038396]Petit added that the data derived from the recent military reports providedscientists with hard data that could enable a true re-evaluation of theseriousness of the UFO phenomenon. He was right about the data, although there-evaluation did not occur.Not all investigators believed an extraordinary event had occurred. Wim VanUtrecht disagreed with the Belgian Air Force and maintained that the radarobservations were not in good agreement with the recorded visual sightings. Hismain argument, however, concerned the photograph taken in early April, which hesuspected was a hoax. The photographer had kept the image slide in a drawer formonths, said Utrecht, despite the event being major news all that time. Hebelieved that statements given by the photographer contradicted certain claimsof his girlfriend, who was with him at the time. Moreover, the exact day of thepurported photograph was unknown, and the image contained no backgroundinformation to allow verification of the object’s actual size and distance.Utrecht also claimed to have duplicated the picture himself. mlxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2038638]No matter what the answer to the Belgian mystery – to say nothing of the greatSoviet sighting of March 21 – it is obvious that the F-117A or B-2 were not it.Yet, the triangles of 1990 did have similarities with the objects reported inthe previous decade in the Hudson Valley of New York and Connecticut, to saynothing of the triangular UFOs seen in Fyffe, Alabama, the Antelope Valley, andelsewhere. Ruling out conventional aviation technology as the explanation forthe sightings of 1990, could an even deeper, blacker, technology be responsible– one made not by extraterrestrials but human beings?One vocal proponent of this position was Tony Gonsalves, a researcher from EastProvidence, Rhode Island, who been a jet mechanic and plane captain for the U.S.Navy. He argued that the boomerangs of the Hudson Valley and the BelgianTriangles were “American made UFOs,” most probably a modified covert version ofthe B-2 stealth bomber. Gonsalves believed this craft had been fully operationalsince the early 1980s, and that the official B-2 bomber unveiled in 1988 was adecoy. This does not mean extraterrestrial technology was irrelevant. Gonsalvessuggested the American made UFO could well incorporate alien technology obtainedfrom UFO crashes.There is much to be said for this, whether or not one credits such stories aboutreverse engineering alien craft in Nevada’s S4, or accounts of the AlienReproduction Vehicle. Assuming the evidence is sufficient of a UFO crashretrieval on even a single occasion, one must assume that all efforts would havebeen made covertly to understand and – to whatever extent possible – replicatethe technology. How far could secret efforts have gotten by 1980? 1990? A fewmonths after the Belgian sightings, the aerospace publication, Aviation Week &Space Technology, nearly let the proverbial cat out of the bag. Its October 1,1990 edition focused heavily on unconventional technologies and aircraft thatwere rumored to be under development and possibly operational, including a“large, triangular wing-shaped aircraft” being tested out of the Nellis AirForce range in Nevada and the Tehachapi Mountains in California. It mentionedseveral sightings of “triangular-shaped aircraft,” and quoted Air Force sourceswho stated that diamond and triangular-shaped vehicles were “the trend now.” Italso mentioned unconfirmed reports that some of these aircraft were designed tofly at Mach 10 or higher.But 1990 is receding farther and farther into the past. As of this writing,there remains no hard evidence that the U.S. military has used anything like thetriangle that was seen over Belgium, nor anything like the Hudson Valleyboomerang. When we consider that a triangular craft definitely flew in 1990 –and has not been seen in any military campaigns since – if it is of terrestrialmanufacture, then its use must be secret. Since 1990, expensive and protractedwars have been fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, during which such aircraft wouldsurely have been very useful. Why would such incredible weapons be held backwhen they could well have ended two wars that hemorrhaged the U.S. economy tothe point of catastrophe?One reason might be that they were designed to deal with the extraterrestrialpresence on Earth, a scenario that might be so overwhelming that all otherconsiderations would become seen as irrelevant. If it were decided that theextraterrestrial presence had to be kept secret at all costs for as long aspossible, then the need for a secret infrastructure becomes self-evident. Onewould have to secure massive funding to build and maintain a covert air forceand space program, cultivate research and development programs that would feedoff of the mainstream world but not contribute conspicuously to it, and controlthe key points of the media and political process at an international level.Another likelihood to consider is that the control of the UFO cover-up movedfurther away from official offices such as the U.S. Presidency. Consider thefirm control held over the Presidencies of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, RonaldReagan, and George Bush by such internationally based groups such as theTrilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and the Council on Foreign Relations(the last of which is formally an American group but entirely globalist inoutlook). The subjugation of the Presidency to such groups has hardly beendiscussed within academic circles, either because those circles are themselvesunder the sway of such groups or (among the lower levels of academia and media)for fear of being labeled a “conspiracy nut.” Yet the world has become a globalvillage almost without any formal acknowledgment of the fact, and it can trulybe said that the 1980s and 1990s witnessed the death of the nation state inseveral key respects. With private, international power showing such prominentsway over the major directions of the domestic and foreign policies of nearlyall nations, how hard is it to conceive that practical control over UFOtechnology and related secrets also migrated to levels higher than the U.S.Presidency?In reviewing the Belgian Triangle sightings, a final question might be: why1989-1990, and why Belgium? Several possibilities present themselves. First,Belgium was and remains the headquarters of NATO, containing many bases andnuclear facilities. It is also one of the leading economic centers of theEuropean Union, which was ready to be born in 1992. At a time when the BerlinWall had come down and the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, perhapsthe UFO activity was related to the sudden transformation in the worldgeopolitical structure.All of which still begs the question: whether the Belgian Triangles wereextraterrestrial or human in origin, what was the technology that enabled themto perform as they did? Can this technology be used by the rest of humancivilization? If it were to become available, what results might we expect?Soviet UFOs – AgainUFOs continued to be reported throughout April in the Soviet Union. Many ofthese made the newspapers and were duly collected by the CIA. Among thehighlights were reports of multiple UFOs hovering over power lines along theTallinn Highway in Estonia on April 5. mlxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2038824] On April 10, atriangular UFO was seen for ten minutes over the Siberian city of Abakan. mlxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2039097] On the 15th ofApril, Rabochaya Tribuna published a report from Major V. Stroynetsky who saidthat he and several hundred other witnesses had repeatedly seen low-flyingtriangular UFOs over the Yaroslavl Highway near Moscow. These objects flew atgreat speeds, made sudden stops, and suddenly accelerated dramatically.Information came to the newspaper’s office that Air Defense forces near Moscowhad tracked one of these objects on radar. mlxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2039278] Perhaps not surprisingly, on April 16, Moscow television announced theestablishment of a new Soviet organization for the study of UFOs, 38[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1774985] and mentionedthat the Soviet Union’s Ufological Commission was receiving reports every day ofSoviet UFO sightings, as well as 10-15 daily from around the world. mlxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2039598] On April 26, 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev was visiting the Uralmash plant inSverdlovsk when he was asked, “does the USSR government study UFOs?” It is thefirst documented instance in which the Soviet leader was asked about this topic.His answer was as nondescript as they come: “I know that there are scientificorganizations which study this problem.” mlxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2039793] This, ofcourse, was already known to be true. Gorbachev avoided discussing anything elseof substance on the matter on that occasion, but is reported to have made a moredirect statement on May 4, 1990. A Riga newspaper contained a full page articlestating that during a recent meeting with Ural workers, Mikhail Gorbachev said“the UFO phenomenon is real and we should approach it seriously and study it.”mlxxxiii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2039980] Ufological history was made, of sorts, on May 21, 1990, when a jointSoviet and Chinese endeavor to study UFOs was initiated in the town ofDalnegorsk; essentially, agreements were made to exchange video and photographicmaterials on new sightings. Dalnegorsk, in the eastern Soviet Union, was thescene of significant UFO activity during the late 1980s. It was also close toChina, where similar incidents had been reported. mlxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2040286] A Chinese UFOreport from March 28, 1990 was collected in U.S. Defense files. An unknown,silent, object had been seen about 25 miles north of Chongqing at 11:20 p.m.local time. It was about 65 feet long, with orange and pale green lights, andflew silently toward the northeast at the very low altitude of about 150 feet.Large blocks of text were blacked out of the U.S. memo. mlxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2040541]American Technology AscendantBy the end of the Cold War, American military technology had hit overdrive.Stealth, of course, was a major development that rendered much, if not most, ofthe Soviet air defense system obsolete. But by 1990, other developments addedgreat momentum toward making America the sole true superpower in the world.A hint of something extraordinary took place early in 1990, when the SR-71(Blackbird) reconnaissance aircraft – officially speaking, the world’s fastestaircraft – was retired from service with no stated replacement. It was said thatadvances in satellite technology meant that the Blackbird would no longer benecessary. mlxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2040779] The odd thingwas that there was no word of dissension within the military over this. Aviationwriter Bill Sweetman pointed out that “never in its history had the Air Force... walked away from a manned mission, however mundane, without a fight.” Thealleged annual savings of $300 million was insignificant. Analysts pointed outthat satellites, while useful, simply could not perform the types of missionsfor which the Blackbird was perfect. mlxxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2040940] A suspicionwithin the aviation and aerospace community was that there was a secretreplacement for the Blackbird, something better. That several have since beenrecalled to active duty in subsequent years could mean that the Bushadministration made a genuine mistake, or it could mean that the Blackbird’sreactivation was necessary to provide cover for its replacement. mlxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2041132] It was at this time that Aviation Week and Space Technology first brokethe news that the alleged hypersonic aircraft, “Aurora,” was inadvertentlyreleased in the 1985 U.S. budget. This was as an allocation of $455 million forblack aircraft production for fiscal year 1987. In other words, for buildingaircraft, not simply R&D. By 1990, people in the vicinity of Edwards AFB inCalifornia were hearing extremely loud aircraft seemingly “ripping” the sky.Observers saw and heard a distinctive aircraft flying over the Mojave desert athigh altitude and speed, leaving contrails described as “doughnuts on a rope.”mlxxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2041296] Wasthis the Blackbird’s replacement? A trans-atmospheric vehicle?Meanwhile, satellite capabilities continued to improve. Although the greatpublic demonstration of new space technology was the deployment of the HubbleSpace Telescope on April 25, 1990, a more significant space deployment hadoccurred just a few weeks before. On March 1, the space shuttle Atlantislaunched the first “stealth satellite” for the National Reconnaissance Office(NRO), called “Misty.” Little is known about it, except it reportedly had visualand radar stealth characteristics, making it difficult to detect (and thuspredict when it would fly overhead). mxc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2041546] Incidentally,the very existence of the NRO was not publicly acknowledged for several moreyears, despite the fact it had existed since 1961. Journalist James Bamford hadexposed the NRO in a 1985 New York Times article, but the agency remained aclassified secret until 1992. Officially, the NRO’s function is to build andmonitor spy satellites. However, considering its extreme secrecy even amongAmerica’s officially acknowledged intelligence agencies, the NRO could well havetaken on other missions, such as those related to UFOs. Indeed, its capabilitiesmake it ideally suited for this.Interesting weapons were also being developed, including those with significantspace applications. The Shiva Star, connected to the SDI program, could fire a‘plasma bullet,’ described as a doughnut shaped ring of ionized gas, at 10,000kilometers per second. Capable of tremendous energy, its stated purpose was todestroy incoming nuclear warheads, although once again the UFO connection wouldseem to be a logical possibility. mxci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2042013]It is also known that anti-gravity was being studied, although no breakthroughsseemed to be in the offing. In 1990, the NATO Advisory Group for AerospaceResearch and Development (AGARD) published a study regarding gyroscopes whichconcluded that they could in theory counteract gravity. Unfortunately, anyanti-gravity force produced by known gyroscopic machines was too weak to bepractical. The defense group BAE Systems was also conducting trials onanti-gravity in 1990, one of which appeared to indicate success (although theresults could not be repeated). Later that year, the Air Force published an“Electric Propulsion Study” as part of its efforts to learn whether any theoryexisted that might permit the engineering of an anti-gravity device. mxcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2042232] Such studies and activities of 1990 show very great strides in America’smilitary capabilities. Yet they also show serious limits, if we are to look tothese for explanations of the UFO phenomenon. Consider the latest and greatestaviation developments of 1990. One of these was the X-31A, an “enhanced fightermaneuverability” demonstrator, designed to prove technologies that would allowclose-in aerial combat beyond normal flying parameters. The aircraft couldexecute a fast minimum-radius, 180-degree “J-turn” turn, well beyond theaerodynamic limits of other conventional aircraft. Of course, it looked nothinglike a triangle, and could not match the performance of the Belgian triangles.mxciii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2042393]Meanwhile, Grumman was in the process of rolling out the F-14D “Super” Tomcat.It had improved radar, an airborne jamming system, Infrared Search and Track(IRST), and much more. Still, as capable as the fighter was, Secretary ofDefense, Dick Cheney called it “1960s technology,” and was pushing hard for anAdvanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) variant. mxciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2042610]The ATF was a term for what the USAF considered to be an “air superiority”replacement for its excellent but increasingly outdated F-15 Eagle. The idea wasto incorporate emerging technologies, such as advanced alloys and compositematerial, advanced fly-by-wire flight control systems, higher power propulsionsystems, and stealth technology. By 1990, there were two such aircraft incompetition for the contract. The losing bid was the Northrop/McDonnell DouglassYF-23A “Black Widow” prototype, while the Lockheed YF-22A won the bid in 1991.This became the F-22 Raptor, considered by many to be the most outstandingfighter jet ever built. Yet the Raptor would require many years before it evensaw service. Indeed, it did not formally enter USAF service until December 2005.In 1990, neither of these prototype aircraft were even close to being ready formass production. mxcv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2042840]Such is an incomplete but general picture of the state-of-the-art Americanmilitary technology circa 1990. Certainly very impressive, and well beyond thecapabilities of any other nation, including the Soviet Union. Yet, it is alsoclear that the above weapons and technologies were not equal to the objects seenfor decades – objects known as UFOs. Even the F-22 Raptor of the 21th centurycannot duplicate the maneuvers of the Belgian triangle or hundreds of other UFOsthat have been tracked by the militaries of the world.Yet something was obviously going on at deeply classified levels. In May 1990,George Knapp, who had recently broken the Bob Lazar story, interviewedjournalist and investigator James Goodall for Las Vegas’ KLAS-TV. With Knapp,Goodall told his story of having talked with an engineer at Lockheed Aircraft’sAdvanced Systems Division (better known as the Skunkworks) which tested machinesat Area 51. When Goodall asked about UFOs, the engineer replied “Absolutely,positively without a doubt, they exist.” Goodall also spoke with a mastersergeant with three tours of duty at Groom Lake who told him “the United Statesgovernment and the military has things that are out there – you can’t describethem as airplanes – that are literally out of this world. And he says they arealien to anything that you’ve ever seen.” Goodall pressed for more detail, buthis source replied he had said too much already. KLAS-TV also interviewed BenRich, who said the technology at Area 51 was “just good American ingenuity.” Ofcourse, Rich had not long before written privately to John Andrews about hisbelief in both manmade and extraterrestrial flying saucers. mxcvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2043051] Crop Circle ExplosionCrop circles, a fascinating mystery in their own right, are sometimes seen asconnected to the UFO phenomenon, sometimes not. There are valid reasons for bothpositions, but the main reason to think “yes” is quite simple. Both phenomenahave certain difficult cases that do not seem explainable by natural or manmadereasons. In the case of some crop circles, the size, complexity, and precision,especially when taking into account the suddenness with which they appear, begfor a credible explanation. Many individuals have taken credit for creating cropcircles, but none have been caught “in the act,” unless to provide a publicdemonstration.Crop circles have reportedly been around for centuries in Britain, which iswhere they still most frequently appear. For a long time, however, they were aperipheral phenomenon, not appearing in large numbers until the 1970s. Then,each summer, a certain number of mysterious circular patterns began to appear inthe fields of southwestern England. In 1985, there were 17 reported circles, and17 again the following summer. A major upswing occurred in 1987, with 75reported circles. 1988 was higher still, with 110, and there were 305 formationsreported during the summer of 1989. In 1990, the crop circle phenomenon trulyexploded with more than 1,000 reported circles that summer.The patterns had become much more complex, too. The circles of the late 1970sand through most of the 1980s were just that: circles, usually appearing alone,within which the stalks were usually laid down in a spiral pattern. From thebeginning, a fair portion of media coverage assumed that pranksters had secretlycreated patterns by means of rope and planks of wood. The problem with thisexplanation is that most English farms at that time did not have the hallmarktractor lines that in later years famously crossed the fields in parallel linesevery 60 feet or so. With the tractor lines, a hoaxer could walk along suchpaths so as not to leave an obvious footpath. Without the tractor lines, this isdifficult, as the stalks of wheat are typically brittle and easily break. Yetsuch traces were not in evidence with these early circles.An early scientific explanation was offered by physicist Dr. Terence Meaden, whoargued that the spiral patterns in crop circles were the result of atmosphericphenomena. Meaden suggested that wind currents were manipulated by surroundinghills to create whirling air currents and ionized plasmas, very much like a dustdevil or tornado, which created the patterns. 39[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_015.html#filepos1775202] His mainhypothesis was that a previously unknown type of “plasma vortex” created thecircles. The idea of plasma may have merit, as several investigators believethat some kind of light energy is a factor in creating the circles. mxcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2043287] Meaden,however, presented his theory in terms of purely natural causation. This waseasier to defend as long as the circles remained relatively simple.The problem was that they did not. In 1988, the first “quintuplet” formationoccurred, in which a large circle was surrounded by four smaller circles at asignificant distance, each smaller circle aligned to one of the cardinal points.The formation was remarkable for its precision. In 1989, the famous “swastika”formation occurred, not really a swastika so much as a circle divided into fourquadrants, within which the stalks were laid down exactly according to one ofthe four magnetic compass points. Even more remarkable, the stalks at the centerwere rotated and counter-rotated in three distinct movements. At the boundaryedge, a thin band was rotated clockwise with stalks weaving over and under thestalks in the quadrants. It was extremely complex, and a fatal blow to Meaden’sweather-based theory. If it was a hoax, it was one of unprecedented complexity,which would have to have been done in the middle of the night, silently, andperfectly. Given the circumstances, many felt that a hoax was therefore out ofthe question.Of course, other naturalistic explanations were out there: magnetic anomalies,seismic events, sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, or cosmic radiation. Noone suggested that any one of these was adequate to explain the totalphenomenon. Explanations of the more mystical type were also prevalent. Asizable number of crop circle students began to wonder if there was a link withthe many ancient stone sites across the English countryside.1990 brought crop circles to a new level altogether in terms of both quantityand complexity, and media coverage became major. Of the many extraordinarypatterns created that year, one truly stood out as exceptional. This was an 80meter (260 foot) long pictogram in the small Wiltshire town of Alton Barnes, andwhich became a national sensation after its discovery on July 11. Thousands ofpeople made pilgrimages to see and experience it. Once again, as with allprevious formations, it appeared overnight, without a hint as to who created it,or (just as interesting) how it was done. But a UFO connection was madeexplicitly that month, when Steven Alexander filmed a shiny, metallic object bythe pictogram, clearly looking as though it were under intelligent control.mxcviii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2043492] That summer, a year before the “confession” of Doug Bower and DaveChorley, a 59-year-old man named Fred Day told the media he had been creatingcrop circles since he was a boy. The British press, already preparing to labelthe circles as hoaxes, jumped on this as an explanation for many of theformations. Hoaxing was becoming more high profile and increasingly muddied thewaters. mxcix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2043724]However, experienced circle students (known as cereologists) such as ColinAndrews, Pat Delgado, and others pointed out that circles created by pranksterstypically lacked a precision that “genuine” formations typically had. Even by1990, several additional distinguishing features were apparent. Within genuinecircles, stalks were bent but not broken, essentially undamaged – hoaxed circlesalways showed residual damage from trampling, and usually a good deal of mud.Increasingly, the genuine formations showed incredible refinement, includingsharp edges and multiple layers in different directions. Some formations weremade very lightly, with the stalks pressed down only a little, and with no signof footprints or other disturbances, making a hoax explanation exceedinglydifficult. Some formations had very narrow rings surrounding the circles,sometimes just a few inches wide and impossible to see at ground level withoutwalking through and damaging the crop – again, with no signs of this havinghappened. Also, in general, the scope and precision of the large pictograms werebecoming truly awesome, presenting substantial challenges for any covertLeonardo Da Vincis wandering through the fields of southwestern England. Matterswere more complicated still, if one considered the testimony of some people whoclaimed to see the creation of the circles. They typically said it looked asthrough an invisible force was pressing down the crop. mc[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2043882]By 1990, crop circles were being reported worldwide, although England was alwaysthe “place to be” for any serious cereologist. Perhaps copy cat hoaxersexplained some of this, but the real difficulty was in explaining how some ofthese formations were created at all. mci[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2044068] SummaryThe most striking feature of the UFO history in 1989 and 1990 is its volatility.The UFO research community was beset by controversy, betrayals, and admittedpenetration by the intelligence community. Paranoia among researchers continuedto rise. Area 51 went from being completely unknown to being a household term.The UFOs over Gulf Breeze continued to amaze. An alien abduction case appears tohave taken place before multiple witnesses in lower Manhattan. Crop circles cameinto their own as a truly mystifying phenomenon, possibly related to UFOs.Extraordinary UFOs were seen over Belgium, culminating in the failedinterception by two F-16s of one or more triangular objects which were trackedon multiple radars and observed by ground witnesses. Residents of the SovietUnion witnessed a wave of UFOs as their nation entered its final phase ofexistence. The United States wasted no time in becoming the world’s onlyhegemonic power, manipulating its media, flexing its muscles, and invading thenation of Panama. The technology at the disposal of the U.S. military wasclearly superior to that fielded by any other nation in the world. Yet, Americanweapons, despite their excellence, were clearly not at the level of any of thewell-documented UFOs.There was, however, reason to believe that a secret program existed to createmanmade UFOs. The money was there, properly covert and laundered. The technologywas there, via crash retrievals of prior UFOs. The time by now had been fairlysubstantial: more than four decades in which to study and replicate. The secrecywas there, via an enormous black budget combined with dominant control over thepress, Congress, and other governments. And the motive – in the form of real,actual UFOs below the waters, in the skies, and beyond Earth’s atmosphere – wascertainly strong enough.The real question is whether, by 1990, matters had progressed sufficiently towhere a secret program operated by the Majestic group (or whatever name it mayhave taken) had made a “breakthrough” enabling it to fly some of the UFOs beingreported, objects such as those seen over Gulf Breeze, Fyffe, Moscow, orBelgium. Objects displaying capabilities clearly beyond that of any aircraft of1990, or for that matter of the 21st century. If any of those UFOs were “ours,”we must ask seriously what the mission of such craft would be. Their totalabsence in all theaters of war suggests the answer. These manmade UFOs – ifmanmade they be – were designed for missions explicitly related to “true” UFOs.That is to say, for dealing with the problem of aliens. Logically, since manyUFOs are tracked in the upper atmosphere, Earth’s orbit, and beyond, we canassume that any manmade UFO program would also deal with matters that are“off-world.”Surely the situation would be complex no matter how one looked at it, but in1990, matters became more complicated still. With the end of the Cold Warlooming, one of the foundational reasons for secrecy was undermined. Thequestion facing thoughtful members of the Bush administration was, do we attemptto end UFO secrecy? If so . . . how? Chapter 9 False Dawn1990-1991 Out of these troubled times . . . a new world order can emerge.― President George H. W. Bush, September 11, 1990. Among black programs, further distinction is made for “waived” programs,considered to be so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reportingrequirements to the Congress.― 1997 U.S. Senate Report on the black budget. The [UFO] program was transmogrified and became private, just as many, manyother projects become private.― Senior U.S. intelligence source, speaking confidentially to the author. The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gainground.― Thomas Jefferson The Structure of UFO SecrecyAt this stage, let us describe a probable “big picture” scenario of the UFO andsecrecy situation circa 1990.Since the Second World War and (especially) its immediate aftermath, there hadbeen a decidedly confrontational attitude between the militaries of the worldand at least some of these UFOs. In particular, the U.S. military had a nearlycontinuous relationship with these unknown objects, a relationship consisting ofattempted interceptions, most or perhaps all ending in failure. Responsiblemembers of the national security establishment had taken the matter of UFOs veryseriously.A few key military memos, mostly obtained through the Freedom of InformationAct, make these facts obvious. The 1947 secret memo from USAF General NathanTwining described these objects as “real, not visionary or fictitious ...circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top.” He added thatthey were silent and demonstrated outstanding maneuverability.Subsequent documents provided yet more information. A 1949 FBI memo referred toUFOs as “Top Secret;” a 1950 document from the Hanford Nuclear Facilitydescribed violations of its airspace by circular objects; a 1952 memo to theDirector of the CIA stated that sightings of UFOs over U.S. defenseinstallations “are of such nature that they are not attributable to naturalphenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.”Other reports and memoranda describe a host of sightings, radar trackings,aerial encounters, attempted interceptions, and even a few UFO landings, such asone which occurred in 1966 at Minot AFB in North Dakota. In 1967, nuclearmissiles at Malmstrom AFB inexplicably went offline while a glowing red UFOhovered above. Documents from the 1970s and 1980s continued to emphasize thegravity of the UFO situation. The 1975 events across the northern U.S. and intoCanada demonstrated that unknown objects flew unmolested over military bases andeasily evaded interception attempts. The 1976 Iranian jet fighter incident,described in U.S. DIA documents, underscored this many times, as did the 1981memo by USAF Colonel Charles Halt and DIA documents on the 1990 Belgian UFO.Other countries experienced much the same thing. By 1990, it was obvious thatthe Soviet Union and China had their own tumultuous histories with these strangecraft, as did European, South American, Middle Eastern, and African nations.Australia had a long and dense history of encounters, and the remote land of NewZealand had several extraordinary events. This was, in fact, a global phenomenonaffecting nearly every nation on Earth.And yet, these dramatic encounters worldwide were being withheld from publicview or discussion. There was trouble in paradise, but it was being hidden. Wecan create a reasonable scenario of how this was possible, as long as weremember the facts along the way.Let us assume President Truman was informed at some point during the 1940s notonly that intelligent alien beings were here on Earth, but that – howeverimprobable it might seem – one or more of their craft had come down and had beenrecovered by the military. At that time, the U.S. was unwilling to share itsnewly acquired atomic technology with the rest of the world, a significantpublic issue during the late 1940s. It would seem obvious that the Presidentwould similarly decide to withhold knowledge of technology that was even moreexotic, more revolutionary, more powerful. Perhaps just as important, thePresident would need to know just what he was dealing with. Were these otherbeings friendly? Hostile? How much panic was likely? Would major industrial orfinancial interests be threatened? For all these reasons, secrecy would seem tobe the safest option, at least for the immediate term.The most logical action would be to gather a team of top individuals, each witha particular specialty, to decide on plans for the short and long term. The veryexistence of such a group would have to be deeply secret, even from Congress,and certainly from the American people. For once the rest of the world learnedof America’s possession of such awesome technology, it would only be a matter oftime before such technology would be shared. Meanwhile, all the myriad otherimplications of such an overwhelming disclosure would also have to be studied.Not only is this a logical scenario, but the testimonies from Eric Walker, Ph.D., Robert Sarbacher, Ph. D., and other insiders support it.Secrecy could well have had public-spirited reasons behind it, but secrecy has away of maintaining its own raison d’etre . For secrecy breeds not only power,but private gain, and it surely appears that much of the UFO secret wentprivate. Consider a piece of alien hardware in the possession of the U.S. Army.The Army wants such technology studied carefully and ultimately replicated tothe greatest extent possible. Who gets the job of studying it? There are manybrilliant minds employed by the U.S. defense establishment, but when somethingneeds to be built , private contractors are the answer: General Electric,Lockheed, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, SAIC, E-Systems, Hughes, Raytheon, BellLaboratories, Bechtel, and other companies who could incorporate exotictechnologies into new weapons and applications.Thus, at some point, a form of joint custody over alien technology would takeplace – the “military-industrial complex” that President Dwight Eisenhowerwarned about on January 17, 1961, in his final address as President. Inevitably,the lawyers would work out the details, which would most probably entail somelevel of “ownership” passing to the corporations. Indeed, why not? All throughthe 20th century, the U.S. government had been dominated by the leaders ofindustry and finance. The President’s senior advisors were all members of theCouncil on Foreign Relations, the powerful political organization specificallyby and for those leaders. Moving matters “private” also helped with secrecy, asprivate interests would be much more impervious to public requests forinformation.Still, the research would be expensive, and the money would need to be hidden.One way to provide covert funding was through classified federal spending; i.e.the “black budget.” This evolved over the years into a system of Special AccessPrograms (SAP); from these grew “unacknowledged” and “waived” SAPs, whichofficially do not exist – except that they do. Better known as deep blackprograms, a 1997 U.S. Senate report described them in this way:Among black programs, further distinction is made for “waived” programs,considered to be so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reportingrequirements to the Congress. The chairperson, ranking member, and, on occasion,other members and staff of relevant Congressional committees are notified onlyorally of the existence of these programs. mcii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2044857] The Senate report noted that persons involved in unacknowledged SAPs wereordered to deny that their program existed, even to superior officers. Saying“no comment” was not good enough. Physical security for the program typicallyincluded “elaborate and expensive cover, concealment, deception, and operationalsecurity plans.” Such a summary offers a glimpse of the incrediblycompartmented, labyrinthian, and Byzantine system of Pentagon spending andsecrecy.One well-placed source, with upper level connections to the CIA, told thisauthor that early in the 1980s, if not before, “the [UFO] program wastransmogrified and became private, just as many, many other projects becomeprivate.” Another source, equally well placed, told this author that enormoussums have been spent on a deep black program to study extraterrestrialtechnology, providing the interesting fact that security for the program wasseven to eight times more expensive than the science. The source held a strongopinion that private contractors had taken the lead role in the secrecystructure. Two other insiders known to the author also arrived at this judgment.Such was also the conclusion of Bill Sweetman in what was possibly a uniquestudy on Special Access Programs. mciii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2045244] Sweetmanestimated there were approximately 150 SAPs within the Pentagon at the close of1999, many of which were unacknowledged. They often had completely independentsystems of classification, with total control exercised by the program manager.Most interesting, Sweetman concluded, was that most of SAPs were dominated notby Defense personnel, but by private contractors. He said he had no idea howthese programs were funded.In this vein, the story of Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson is relevant. During thelate 1990s, Wilson was Chief of Intelligence of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, aposition known as J-2. In 1997, Dr. Steven Greer, leading a UFO “disclosure”initiative, was able to obtain an audience with Wilson – he was able to do sobecause accompanying him was Apollo 14 astronaut, Dr. Edgar Mitchell. They hadexpressed their concern about the “rogue” nature of certain Special AccessPrograms connected to the study of alien technology; that is to say theirconcern that these programs were dominated not by government personnel, but byprivate contractors, possibly as runaway programs beyond formal governmentcontrol. According to claims later made by Greer, as well as personalinvestigation by the author, Wilson did look into the claims of these two men.After two months of investigating, he found that the claims were true. When hewas finally able to get a meeting with a representative of the SAP (not theprogram manager but its attorney), Admiral Wilson was informed in no uncertainterms that he lacked a need to know. Not only this, but the only reason he wasgranted a meeting at all was to find out how he learned of the program.In attempting to validate this story, the author communicated with Dr. Mitchell,the office of Dr. Greer, and a third source well connected to this matter. Allthree sources confirmed the above sequence of events. The author also contactedMr. Wilson himself, who (understandably) attempted to deny everything afterinitially stating that his memory was “foggy.” He eventually recalled themeeting after the author made it clear that he had multiple confirmations aboutit. Yes, conceded Wilson, they had a meeting, only because he was curious why aman of Dr. Mitchell’s stature would be interested in such a matter. However,Wilson maintained that everything else described by Greer was “poppycock.” Hethen abruptly ended the phone call.It would be unfair to have expected Admiral Wilson to say otherwise. To supportGreer’s claim would not only have jeopardized his security clearances, but wouldhave constituted a near-revolutionary act. It would have been an admission ofthe highest order, an acknowledgment that the U.S. government had been hijackedby private corporate interests regarding the possession of extraterrestrialtechnology.Nevertheless, the cumulative information the author has received on this matterconvinces him that it is true."},{"pageContent":"It is likely that a great deal of missing money has gone into this program. In1994, a law was passed requiring the federal government to account for its moneyin a business-like way. After this, several reports described the loss of notbillions but trillions of dollars. mciv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2045563] The mostperplexing of these claims came from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld onJuly 16, 2001, when he spoke to the House Appropriations Committee regarding thePentagon’s Fiscal Year 2002 budget.. . . the financial systems of the department are so snarled up that we can’taccount for some $2.6 trillion in transactions that exist, if that’s believable.mcv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2046716]The amount of $2.6 trillion seems incomprehensible, especially when consideredin relation to the Pentagon, which at the time of Rumsfeld’s statement had anannual budget of roughly one-eighth that amount. Lest one believe this was asimple mistake, members of Congress discussed the amount, and the Pentagon’saccounting office later amended it to $2.3 trillion. The number was clearlyoffered as legitimate.Secretary Rumsfeld could make such a statement because it was part of the fiscalmess he inherited from the Clinton administration, so it was not a politicalliability to him. Still, the number is so far beyond anything that makes sense:how is it possible to lose track of seven or eight times one’s annual budget?How long had this problem been developing?For a very long time, it appears. Considering the obvious importance of the UFOphenomenon, the need for a secret infrastructure to deal with it, the leakspertaining to secret facilities and reverse engineered objects, a detachedanalyst can assume that some of this lost money went to deep black programsconnected to UFOs. Moreover, through a combination of leaks, logic, andobservation, we can gain a reasonable idea of what “the program” is all about.In the first place, it has been about trying to make a flying saucer. Testimonyregarding the recovery of crashed UFOs, statements from Brad Sorensen and thecontroversial Bob Lazar regarding the existence of a back-engineering program,the insider who told James Goodall that “we have things out there that areliterally out of this world,” and the many eyewitness accounts of UFOs overGroom Lake and Antelope Valley all support this hypothesis.“The program” also appears to be about studying alien bodies and conductingrelated biotech research. Less information exists on this, but at least one ofLeonard Stringfield’s sources described it. Such a program would be obvious ifany alien bodies were ever recovered.Yet another feature of the program seems to involve activities in space, whetherthis be covertly in Earth orbit or even the Moon and beyond. There is goodevidence of anomalous activity being observed and recorded in space. RonRegehr’s collection of DSP satellite data makes it clear that “fastwalkers” aretracked with regularity. If these anomalies are genuine, they are by themselvessufficient motivation to develop a secret space program. It would be necessaryto interact with that phenomenon in some way, whether through observation,communication, or hostilities. For this reason, there is every likelihood thatthe SDI program initiated during the Reagan years had a covert component relatedto UFOs. mcvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2046954]We may then ask, who has been in charge? To what extent has the office of thePresident been involved in the UFO cover-up? Such a question leads us to examinethe evolving structure of global power. During the 1950s, American sociologistC. Wright Mills described a “power elite” in the United States comprised ofcorporate, military, and government elements. It was a radical analysis at thetime. Over the decades, however, it has become clear that corporations – or moreaccurately, transnational corporations – attained a dominant role in thisrelationship.By the late 1980s, they were poised to begin a global transformation whichfuture historians will undoubtedly recognize as the death of the nation state.The birth of the Internet, coinciding with the impending end of the Cold War,opened new opportunities for corporate visionaries, primarily in the way ofaccess to cheap labor. The goal became to create an international legalstructure to facilitate this process. For many years, the U.S. Presidency hadbeen beholden to transnational-oriented entities such as the TrilateralCommission, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Bilderbergers. Now, at theCold War’s end, the members of these groups, on behalf of the corporations theyowned, set about on an agenda.One facet of this was the promotion of the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA). Their leading spokesman, President George H. W. Bush, predicted thecreation of new American jobs created by “free trade.” The actual result was thedismantling of the U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. Lest one attribute thepromotion of NAFTA as simply an honest mistake, consider the judgment ofCatherine Austin Fitts, who served on the Bush cabinet at the time as AssistantSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In a privateconversation, Ms. Fitts told the author that “it was an explicitcorporate-political policy of the Bush administration circa 1990 to export theU.S. economy to China.” Her clear implication was that the goal was to dismantleand export the U.S. manufacturing infrastructure to places where the labor wasso cheap as to be practically free.It seems incomprehensible that an American President would willfully undertake anationally suicidal strategy, unless one understands that he does not representthe interests of “the people” so much as multinational corporations. Suchentities have no national loyalties, but are driven by need to grow sales,reduce costs, increase profits, and promote shareholder value.Other enforcers of the new world order were the International Monetary Fund(IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and World Bank, the last of which wasdescribed as a “tool for takeover” by its one-time Chief Economist, JosephStiglitz. Throughout the 1990s, it implemented a basic “four-step plan” fordebter nations, ostensibly to correct archaic economic policies and promoteglobalization, but which were, in reality, designed to result in their completeownership by international finance. The WTO did much of the same work,consistently promoting privatization of natural resources (such as water), anddeeming environmental, health, and food safety laws of nations to be barriers totrade.In a situation where the elected office of the U.S. Presidency had become fairlyhijacked by such interests, it may very well be that UFO secrecy also gravitatedto groups beyond the U.S. governmental structure. They would continue to use theU.S. military to manage the problem. To the extent that the various Presidentshave been involved in this issue, their actions have furthered the aims anddesires of their controllers.Furthermore, it is not even clear that all U.S. Presidents are briefed on thissubject. It is well known that Presidents are not briefed on most black budgetprograms until they absolutely need to know about them. A second, perhaps lessinteresting reason, is that there is simply not enough time to brief them on allsuch operations. One of the author’s sources said that he had “professionalknowledge” that Presidents Reagan and Bush (senior) were briefed on the matterof UFOs and extraterrestrials, and that he believed that President Carter hadbeen briefed. He was less certain about President Clinton, and felt confidentthat President George W. Bush was not briefed.Thus, by 1990, it looked as though at least some UFOs were operated by entitiesnot of our human civilization; confrontations had taken place with variousnational militaries; the secrecy on this was maintained through extremecompartmentation and control of the world’s major media sources, siphoning offenormous sums of public money for the purpose of replicating alien technologyand developing a secret space program. Furthermore, the entire processundermined the formal political system in favor of powerful private entities, aprocess that accelerated from the mid-1980s onward.The world was going through a silent revolution. Just who exactly was in chargewas not a matter of public discussion, but they were creating a new globalstructure of power. To all appearances, this structure included control over theUFO secret. Invasion of KuwaitOn August 2, 1990, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, precipitatingOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and ushering in what President Bushwould call “the New World Order.” The invasion is a study in the duplicity ofgeopolitics and the mass media.After the invasion, Saddam was quickly portrayed by President Bush and the restof the western establishment as the new Hitler. Forgotten in the din were someuncomfortable facts. Until recently, Saddam had been on good terms with Kuwait,which had loaned Iraq $40 billion during the bloody Iraq-Iran war of the 1980s.The war was ruinous for both sides, enriching international arms dealers andleaving Saddam’s regime hard pressed to repay. Kuwait would not pardon the debt,so Saddam sought to raise the price of oil through production cuts. Not only didOPEC block this, but Kuwait increased its production, further driving down theprice of oil and worsening Iraq’s situation. Kuwait’s actions cost Iraq some $14billion annually. Such “economic warfare” (in the opinion of Saddam) wasaggravated by accusations that Kuwait was using advanced drilling techniques toextract oil from Iraq’s share of the Rumaila Field, a technique popularly called“slant-drilling.” All Iraqis remembered that oil-rich Kuwait had not long agobeen part of their country, broken off by Britain when Iraq was powerless tostop it.Throughout the Iran-Iraq war, which lasted from 1980 until 1988, U.S. policy hadbeen openly pro-Iraq (although quietly supporting Iran as well via theIran-Contra initiative). George Bush had intervened many times on behalf ofSaddam Hussein with financial aid and access to high-tech equipment critical fornuclear and chemical weapons. Even after that war ended, Bush’s support for thedictator continued. mcvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2047188] It seemsGeorge Bush represented interests trying to take control of Iraq’s oil supply,which was then under Iraqi state control. For example, in June 1989, adelegation representing Kissinger Associates Ltd., Bankers Trust, Mobil,Occidental Petroleum, and others met with Saddam in Baghdad. This group washeavily connected to David Rockefeller (with whom Saddam had also met severaltimes during this period). Before supporting any infrastructure improvements,they insisted Iraq’s national debt be paid and the oil industry be privatized,at least in part. mcviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2047488] Saddam refusedto sell off his country’s cash cow. He began to realize that he would not getwhat he wanted from the Rockefeller clique.George Bush continued to court Saddam, however, approving another $1 billion innew aid in late 1989 – critically important, as international bankers had cutoff nearly all loans to Iraq. Bush’s decision was opposed by the FederalReserve, the Treasury Department, and the Commerce Department on the groundsthat Iraq was not creditworthy and was developing plans for weapons of massdestruction. mcix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2048114] As late asApril 1990, the National Security Council overruled such concerns. mcx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2048492] ThroughoutJuly, as Iraq’s diplomatic crisis with Kuwait reached its climax, the Bushadministration continued to try to finance Saddam. By July 15, Iraqi troops weremassed at the Kuwaiti border; the U.S. said nothing.Finally, on July 25, Saddam sought advice from the U.S. on his intentions toreclaim Kuwait. He met with the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, who toldhim:I have direct instructions from President Bush to improve our relations withIraq. We have considerable sympathy for your quest for higher oil prices, theimmediate cause of your confrontation with Kuwait... I have received aninstruction to ask you, in the spirit of friendship not confrontation, regardingyour intentions: Why are your troops massed so very close to Kuwait’s borders?Saddam stated that while he was ready to negotiate his border dispute withKuwait, his design was to “keep the whole of Iraq in the shape we wish it tobe.” This was a bold statement, especially in the language of diplomacy. Afterall, why would the “shape” of Iraq be on the agenda when the dispute was overoil and monetary reparations? Saddam obviously meant to change Iraq’s shape sothat it would once again include Kuwait. When Saddam asked for the U.S. opinion,Glaspie replied:We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts, like your dispute with Kuwait.Secretary [James] Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction, firstgiven to Iraq in the 1960s, that the Kuwaiti issue is not associated withAmerica.April Glaspie then left for her summer vacation, and then an extended publicsilence. It would not be until long after the Gulf War ended that the worldlearned of her conversation with Saddam. mcxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2048749] Over the next few days, Bush said nothing about the Gulf situation,although the CIA managed to warn the Kuwaiti ruling family, which fled thecountry with its most valuable possessions. After Iraqi troops invaded on August2, Bush mobilized a U.N. force and declared Saddam to be the next Hitler. Saddamsuddenly found himself in an untenable position. Kuwait had to be liberated, itsruling family restored. mcxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2049011] The allegation that the U.S. gave a “green light” to Saddam Hussein hasreceived little mainstream support. Instead, the standard argument is that Bushgrossly misunderstood Saddam’s intentions. An examination of the facts, however,shows how pathetic this claim is. The international situation was clear in lateJuly. Thousands of Iraqi troops were massed at the Kuwaiti border amid a majordiplomatic crisis. A simple statement supporting Kuwait’s sovereignty would havesufficed to defuse it; instead, the U.S. explicitly turned away. It is not astretch to interpret this as tacit permission from Saddam’s longtime supporter,George H. W. Bush, to allow the Iraqi dictator to seize what he felt wasrightfully his. Whether or not Saddam was truly “suckered” into invading Kuwait,his action was a godsend to the American military establishment and thefinancial establishment that supported it. He provided them with a perfectreplacement enemy, now that the Soviet Union had ceased to be viable in thatrole. The money could keep pouring in.Within the U.S., matters became surreal. The man who had invaded the sovereignnation of Panama just one year before now told the world that “America standswhere it always has, against aggression, against those who would use force toreplace the rule of law.” The media and educated classes largely supported suchOrwellianspeak. Talk of a “new world order” followed. On August 23, NationalSecurity Advisor Brent Scowcroft, a protégé of Henry Kissinger, said they were“creating the beginning of a new world order out of the collapse of theU.S.-Soviet antagonisms.” mcxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2049185] On September11, 1990, President Bush told the nation: “Out of these troubled times ... a newworld order can emerge.”First with Panama, now with Iraq, a key feature of this new world order wasbecoming obvious: that the U.S. would invade and spin as it saw fit in order toremake the world on behalf of the international private interests that itrepresented. In other words, to engage in the age-old game of imperialism andtheft. Greifswald LightsIn the early days of August 1990, many witnesses by the Baltic Sea, near thecities of Rostock, Greifswald, and the isles of Ruegen and Usedom, reportedseeing what appeared to be groups of luminous spheres. They displayed unusualbehavior contrary to airplanes, balloons, luminous ammunition and atmosphericalphenomena. They accelerated very rapidly and abruptly. One witness, GeraldSchwab, told a German newspaper that the lights “stood there for three minutesbefore they accelerated rapidly forward.” mcxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2049420] Then, on August 24 at 8:35 p.m., just six weeks before Germany’s reunification,many hundreds – perhaps thousands – of witnesses saw a formation of sevenluminous objects over the Baltic Sea. The objects hovered for nearly 30 minutesnear Peenemunde (the former Nazi V-2 construction site) and the nuclear powerplant at Griefswald. Five people, including nuclear physicist Dr. LudmillaIvanova, videotaped the event, enabling researchers to triangulate the lightsand reconstruct their position. The combination of eyewitness reports, supportedby video and photographic evidence, makes this a particularly strong UFO case.A German UFO organization, MUFON-CES, obtained six videos and 11 photographsfrom different individuals, and also interviewed more than a dozen witnesses.The team concluded that the phenomena was in fact two groups of luminous sphereswhich hovered nearly motionless for about 30 minutes over the Pomeranian Sea.The brighter and closer group formed a circle of six luminous spheres. Thesecond group formed the shape of a ‘Y.’ One group of witnesses observed that theobjects in the Y-formation performed individual movements; some of them movedback and forth between the two groups of lights. They were able to moveextremely fast, estimated by one witness as “supersonic velocity,” and were ableto come to a dead stop upon reaching the formation. One witness was heard to sayon video, “I don’t believe in UFOs and such nonsense, but I have never seenanything like this in my whole life.”Some skeptics argued the lights were signal flares fired by the Russian orPolish Navy, although the lights were clearly over German seas. Any militarymaneuver so shortly before the German reunification would have been consideredan aggression and caused major diplomatic protests. The Russian and Polishnavies both denied any maneuver at the time in question. Actually, the Sovietsby this time had closed all nearby military installations and were no longeractive in the area.No scientific explanation has been determined for the lights. mcxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2049562] Soviet UFO AcknowledgmentThe Soviet Union continued to be the scene of many UFO reports, a portion ofwhich were misidentifications of ordinary objects, such as balloons or Kosmosspace launches. mcxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2049992] Late onSeptember 2, for instance, residents of the northern city of Murmansk saw alarge illuminated ball above the sea. It was very high up, gave off noelectronic signals, and moved slowly toward the shore. Soviet Air Defensethought it resembled a large airship. The area was too densely populated to firea missile at it. By the early morning hours, it was well over the peninsula, andthe order was finally given to destroy it. It turned out to be an enormousweather balloon. mcxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2050142] For suchreasons, it is not surprising that some establishment Soviet scientists wereannoyed by the proliferation of UFO reports. Vladimir Migulin, a member of theUSSR Academy of Sciences and UFO skeptic, told the media he was “extremelyirritated” with the deluge of UFO reports in his country, pointing out that someforeign journals such as the Skeptical Inquirer were discussing the “paranormalbabble” in the Soviet Union. mcxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2050395] Other stories were dramatic but questionable, such as an event reportedfrom September 13, 1990. A radar unit in the Volga-Ural military region trackedan approaching object that apparently caused the equipment to malfunction and goblank. Coming outside, the operators saw a flying black triangle giving offthree bright rays. It landed nearby and gave off more bursts of energy. Theywatched it for more than an hour, and two sentries allegedly disappeared thenreappeared without realizing they had been gone. The case was investigated by amilitary reporter who was told by the regional chief that nothing of the sorthad occurred. mcxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2050547] A much more solid Soviet UFO case took place on September 27, 1990, inEarth’s orbit. Cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov were aboard theMir space station. While Strekalov was looking down at Newfoundland through aclear atmosphere, he saw a glittering, iridescent, perfect sphere appear beforehis eyes. He called Manakov, and together they studied the object. Strekalovsaid “it shone like the balls that hang on trees at Christmas, greenish in colorand all shimmering. It was impossible to take your eyes off it.” The two agreedthat it could not have been a natural phenomenon: it appeared to be 20 to 30kilometers above the Earth, was enormous, and had “an absolutely even shape.”They watched it for ten seconds, when it disappeared as suddenly as it hadappeared. Unfortunately, they did not get to a camera quickly enough to capturean image. Choosing their words carefully, they told Mission Control that theyhad observed “a kind of unusual phenomenon.” Later, they confessed to having noidea what it was. “Perhaps an enormous, experimental sphere or something else...” mcxx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2050738]A Soviet military encounter with two UFOs reportedly took place on October 8,1990. Unfortunately, the article in Rabochaya Tribuna did not give a location,only details about how the object was tracked on ground radar screens,apparently blocked airborne radar, but then was seen visually by theintercepting pilot. “Suddenly,” he reported, “something made me turn my head. Tothe rear and to the right I saw two cigar-shaped objects of considerabledimension. The length of the first one was approximately 2 kilometers and thesecond about 400 meters.” He saw these clearly, he said, against the backgroundof a clear sky. They were too distant to make out details or structuralfeatures, and when he began to close on them, both targets disappeared from hisfield of vision – although ground radar continued to track them for some time.mcxxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2051118]If Soviet UFO skeptics found all of these UFO reports distasteful andembarrassing, the Soviet Deputy Minister of Defense, Ivan Tretyak, found himselfmore than willing to discuss the matter. Tretyak’s credentials were mostimpressive; he was Commander in Chief of the Air Defense Forces, General of theArmy, and the boss of General Igor Maltsev, who had investigated the March 21,1990 UFO encounter near Moscow. On November 9, Tretyak spoke with LiteraturnayaGazeta , a large weekly newspaper with a national circulation.Tretyak confirmed that fighter-interceptors had encountered UFOs in Soviet airspace. The “unidentified flying machine” of March 21 was photographed byinterceptor pilots and gave off optical and thermal signals, although it hadsome “stealth-like” capacity that blocked airborne radar. It was definitely notan airplane, Tretyak said. Still, it was premature to say that UFOs wereviolations of Soviet sovereignty. Most of them, he said, were explainable asnatural phenomena, rocket launches, satellites, or other conventional events.Admittedly, some pilot reports showed UFOs to be of artificial origin, but theirreal nature remained unknown.Tretyak understandably hedged his statement about UFOs. He openly stated thatsome were “real,” and at one point seemed to consider an extraterrestrialexplanation. Elsewhere, however, he denied believing in extraterrestrials. “Ibelieve something else,” he said. “That modern science and technology arecapable of creating such spacecraft that could appear above us. . . . You haveto believe in man’s ingenuity.” If so, then he gave a very curious answer as towhy no order was given to shoot down the object of March 21. “It would befoolhardy,” he said, “to launch an unprovoked attack against an object that maypossess formidable capacities for retaliation.” mcxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2051311]In other words, one of the top defense officials of the Soviet Union admittedthat unknown objects with (apparently) vast superiority to Soviet aircraft hadviolated his nation’s air space and paralyzed its military. Did Tretyak believethese were American craft? Something else? Only during the final days ofglasnost could such statements be made. The Soviet Union was a very differentplace in 1990 than it had been at any other time, or would be in the future.While the country continued to break apart, openness enabled more and moreinformation to reach the outside. In the parlance of the day, a “window ofopportunity” was being exploited. Dreamland becomes LeaklandSince the late 1980s, residents of the Antelope Valley in California, as well asthe UFO-watchers gathering outside Area 51, had been observing strange aircraft.In the Antelope Valley especially, people were seeing large, quiet, triangularobjects that maneuvered extremely well. Although the Air Force would neitherconfirm nor deny such reports, by the fall of 1990 they were being covered bythe Associated Press and Aviation Week and Space Technology. The speculation wasthat the triangles represented secret advanced-technology warplanes. mcxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2051684]The real bombshell came with the October 1, 1990 issue of AWST. Of particularinterest was an article by senior engineering editor William Scott, entitled“Multiple Sightings of Secret Aircraft Hint at New Propulsion, AirframeDesigns.” Scott, a former flight test engineer and graduate of the U.S. AirForce Test Pilot School, analyzed 45 daylight and nighttime sightings of strangecraft over the southwestern desert. Some of these described objects moving asslowly as 20 mph, then accelerating to supersonic speeds. Scott concluded thatthere were “at least two – but probably more – types of vehicles” beyond theF-117A and B-2. One was a “triangular-shaped, quiet aircraft seen with a flightof F-117A stealth fighters several times since the summer of 1989.” Another wasa “high speed aircraft characterized by a very deep rumbling roar ...” A thirdwas a high altitude, high speed aircraft, typically observed as a bright,pulsating light, moving much faster than other aircraft, giving no engine noiseor sonic boom. Scott believed the second and third aircraft might be the same.mcxxiv [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2051860] He also wrote of “exotic” propulsion systems being used in new aircraft,and came very close to stating that these might be anti-gravity units. When UFOresearcher William Hamilton spoke privately to him about this, he said thatScott stated his opinion that anti-gravity was indeed being used. mcxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2052254]While establishment voices like AWST were just beginning to discuss suchmatters, other researchers and journalists were going further. By the early1990s, for example, journalist George Knapp had spoken with perhaps twenty Area51 insiders who corroborated various parts of Bob Lazar’s claims. None werewilling to talk publicly, however, and many were later pressured into silence.One source, who claimed to have seen a disc under a tarp at Groom Lake, agreedto do a limited interview as long as his face was blackened out. On the morningof the scheduled interview, he saw a car parked in front of his house; insidewere two men, one of whom was speaking into a radio. They followed him to work,and then home. That was enough to frighten him into canceling. Another ofKnapp’s sources worked for a defense contractor. She told him that she hadattended discussions between her employer and the military regardingextraterrestrial “wreckage” from Roswell that had been taken to Area 51. On theday of her interview, she was visited by her former employer who reminded herthat she was still under oath. “We know you do a lot of traveling,” she wastold. “We’d hate for an accident to happen to you or to your family.” She, too,backed out. Yet another informant, a man who prepared tax returns for people atArea 51, phoned Knapp at the TV station to arrange an interview. The followingday, he was visited by men claiming to be from the secret service and pressuredinto silence. There were gaps, to be sure, but a picture was definitely formingof acquired alien technology and human efforts to replicate it. mcxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2052477] Journalist Norio Hayakawa, of Nippon TV, similarly looked into deep blackprojects. One source told him of a new type of craft, called the “Pumpkin Seed,”being tested at the Papoose Lake Facility, a few miles south of Groom Lake. Thiswas quite possibly one of the objects seen by Brad Sorensen at the“secret-famous” November 1988 exhibition, mentioned earlier. It was adiamond-shaped craft using pulse detonation propulsion, which can operate fromsubsonic up to hypersonic speeds. Hayakawa suspected there were deep blackprograms even beyond this, possibly involving anti-matter. He began leadinggroups of “Area 51 watchers” who were often harassed while taking legal photosand video.Beyond those investigators working for media companies, many independentresearchers undertook their own investigations, developing their own sources orjust shooting their own video. By 1990 and 1991, Area 51 was positively leakingout of Nevada.Linda Moulton Howe was one of these researchers. While working as SupervisingProducer and Original Concept Creator for the Paramount Studios and FOX-TVspecial, UFO Report: Sightings , she heard from a retired U.S. military officerwho told her enigmatically, “the alien technology is so advanced and the beingsare so strange that no one would believe it. Keeping the public and media awayfrom what’s really happening isn’t difficult. It’s a story that no one wants totell, that no one knows how to tell. The truth is stranger than fiction. mcxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2052659] Wendelle Stevens, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, was anotherresearcher delving into Area 51. He interviewed Derek Hennesy, who claimed tohave been an S4 security guard and described at least four underground levelsthere – only two of which military personnel could enter. Security measuresincluded biometrics such as retina scans and hand prints. Alien bodies andflying discs were kept there, although technicians had not learned how tooperate the crafts. Levels three and four were off-limits, but Hennesy heardthat live “EBEs” were there, completely identical to each other in appearance,as if cloned. Stevens had heard similar rumors elsewhere, and believed Hennesywas truthful. mcxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2052856]Another source of leaked claims came from Bill Uhouse, a military mechanicaldesign engineer. Uhouse had previously worked on aircraft simulator projects,then was asked to join a simulation project involving flying discs. He said thatno human could fly one of “theirs,” but scientific data was provided by thegreys. According to Uhouse, “we took their avionics and transferred them to ourscience and technology, and used the avionics we know.” His description of discswas similar to Bob Lazar’s. Unlike Lazar, however, Uhouse said he was introducedto greys that were associated with the project, perhaps up to ten times. mcxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2053041]In addition to the stories were the video cameras – still primitive by thestandards of later years, but common enough by now. Whatever was flying out ofArea 51 appeared to be reaching Las Vegas, as evidenced by the video of acylindrical grey object maneuvering over the city, captured by Roger Beard onChristmas Eve, 1990. Others were videotaping equally strange objects, such as ahighly maneuverable “ball” flying low over Las Vegas, or two metallic-lookinghat-like objects zipping around the Vegas skies. mcxxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2053224] Sean David Morton began going to Area 51 and recorded severalinteresting objects. Early in 1991, he and a friend taped a glowing disc-shapedobject which came to within a few hundred yards. It glowed so brilliantly thatthe men thought it might explode. Several times, it shot straight up, thendescended with a falling leaf motion. They returned with burned faces and mildradiation poisoning. Morton later took more video showing glowing objects withextraordinary acceleration and maneuverability. Alleged insiders soon contactedhim, including someone who claimed to have transported large, disc-like andbell-shaped objects which he considered to be alien. He spoke of numerousunderground levels, had seen living aliens, alien bodies in tanks (suspended inliquid), and even several humanoid aliens allegedly from the Pleiades. mcxxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2053405]Similar snooping was going on in the Antelope Valley. Bill Hamilton had beenlooking into this area for some years by now, but now so were others. It hadbecome obvious that the sites operated by the Northrop, McDonnell Douglas, andLockheed corporations had substantial underground facilities. There were alsorumors of covert military activity associated with these installations, evenalien activity, abductions, and missing time episodes.The Northrop facility was nicknamed “The Anthill,” and located near theTehachapi Mountains, 25 miles northwest of Lancaster, California. It was said tohave as many as 42 levels, with tunnels linking it to other facilities, and wasbelieved to be involved in electronic or electromagnetic research. The McDonnellDouglas facility was located northeast of Llano, and the Lockheed installation afew miles north of Helendale. Each had large radar or microwave dishes andstrange looking pylons to which various objects could be attached, perhaps tosend out electromagnetic radiation. These pylons rose up from underground out ofdiamond-shaped openings in the middle of long paved surfaces that resembledaircraft runways, but which were not used by aircraft.Strange objects were seen near these installations, including glowing spheresand discs, boomerangs, and triangles, some of which were very large. One ofHamilton’s witnesses, a pilot whose flight plan took him over the TehachapiMountains, saw four white rectangular objects hovering over the Northropfacility. Another person, who claimed to be a paint contractor who worked onunderground tunnels beneath the Anthill, told Hamilton and Linda Moulton Howethat the tunnels had round openings below, force fields instead of doors, andlights for identification and entry. His job was to spray a “self-illuminatingsurface on the walls and ceilings.” He said he took an elevator from the groundlevel down for several minutes before the door opened into a tunnel complexwhere they worked. Most fantastic, he described tiny globes hovering in thetunnels that followed him and his crew around. He thought these were sensors inuse by the Air Force. The first time one of the glowing, levitating, orbs cameinto the space where he was working, it startled him. No one had briefed himabout such a thing – and he sprayed it with his spray gun. Whatever it was fellto the floor with a “plop” sound, and he could see a solid spherical shapebeneath the paint. Within seconds, black-garbed security people with guns raninto the space. The contractor was warned never to interact with the orbs in anyway, but no one explained to him what they were. On one occasion, he observed aflying saucer emerge from inside the Northrop perimeter fence, and then fly off.Clearly, some of these technologies seemed incredible in 1990 – but could theysimply have been ahead of the rest of the world by a few decades? Mostextraordinary of all, the contractor claimed that on another occasion, he wasspraying near a crack in a wall that he knew was a sliding door. Suddenly, thedoor opened. A few feet away on the other side was “a 7-foot-tall, mint green,non-human in a white lab coat talking with a short, Oriental-looking man.” Soonafter that, the contractor lost his clearance and job. mcxxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2053587] The Gulf WarFrom August 1990, events in the Persian Gulf and Washington led inexorably towar. Operation “Desert Shield,” designed ostensibly to protect Saudi Arabia froman Iraqi attack that was neither planned nor feasible, quickly went into action.Soon, hundreds of thousands of coalition soldiers were in the Middle East. TheGulf War was a world-changing event, but three aspects will suffice here:technological considerations, propaganda vs. reality, and interesting UFOstories.Operation Desert Shield became Operation Desert Storm on January 17, 1991. Thiswas a “war” in the loose sense that two armies opposed each other. But it wasthe most lopsided in modern history, greater than Hitler’s blitzkriegs or eventhe U.S. invasion of Panama. The sheer quantity of firepower brought into theGulf by (primarily) U.S. and British forces was beyond anything previouslyundertaken. The Iraqi forces were completely unequipped for this. Within 24hours, their command and control system was destroyed, the nation’s electricalproduction was shut down, and its surface-to-air missile sites and antiaircraftbatteries were nearly crippled. As in Panama, stealth aircraft played a dominantrole, constituting less than 3 percent of all fighter and attack aircraft, butattacking 31 percent of the targets on the first day of fighting. Thiseffectiveness depended on America’s dominance of space, in particular its GlobalPositioning System. As military historians George and Meredith Friedman pointedout, had the Iraqis been able to destroy the GPS satellite system, most of theallied advantage would have dissipated. “For the first time in history, thecenter of gravity of a military operation was located outside the earth’satmosphere.” mcxxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2053897] Another element of the coalition’s success was precision-guidedmunitions (or “smart bombs”) and Tomahawk cruise missiles. They were effectiveand also made great propaganda, considering that more than 90 percent of allordinance dropped against the Iraqis were the old-fashioned “dumb bombs.” Theresult was tremendous carnage. The official U.S. totals for Iraqi civilianskilled was 2,278 (with 5,965 reported wounded). mcxxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2054129] This number iswildly off from other estimates, some of which exceed 100,000. mcxxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2054393] Years afterthe fact, the statistic remains so politically charged that one wonders how thetruth can ever be reached.Whatever the actual total, there can be no question that the American public wasshielded from seeing the destruction, thanks to vastly improved media control bythe military. A Pentagon document entitled “Annex Foxtrot” described the newpolicy. mcxxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2054657] Journalistswere forbidden from visiting front lines or interviewing soldiers without priormilitary approval. Once approval was given, they had to be accompanied byofficers and subjected to censorship. As a result, most of the information aboutthe war came from military briefings. Ostensibly, this was to prevent sensitiveinformation from being revealed to Iraq. Considering how Iraq was overmatched inevery way, the deeper motivation seems clear enough: control of public opinion.mcxxxvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2054846] Astonishingly, not a single photographic record of actual combat evermanaged to be made by journalists. The sole western journalist who disobeyedU.S. military orders to leave Bagdad prior to the assault was Peter Arnett ofCNN, a former Pulitzer Prize winner. Arnett’s reports on civilian damage weresharply criticized by the military and the Bush White House. On January 25,1991, the White House claimed that he was a tool for Iraqi disinformation; CNNeven received a letter from 34 members of Congress accusing Arnett of“unpatriotic journalism.” mcxxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2055026] Kuwait was officially liberated on February 27, 1991; Iraq surrendered thefollowing day. The rapid and total military victory by the coalition forces, andthe minimal casualties they suffered, made a dramatic impression of Americanglobal hegemony.Yet a few mysterious encounters by American pilots, very reminiscent of theWorld War II foo fighters, may raise some questions as to whether any other“group” was operating over the desert skies. There are very few publiclyrevealed UFO stories associated with the Gulf War, but the combination of thewar’s brevity and the unprecedented control over information make this easy tounderstand.UFO researcher Joel Carpenter of the UFO research organization “Project 1947”found an interesting reference to this subject in a government collection ofGulf War military encounters. According to the study, several American F-111“Aardvark” pilots reported being intercepted by Iraqi aircraft that approachedthem, illuminated them with searchlights, but never fired on them. Themysterious flyer was nicknamed “Baghdad Billy,” and the subject of a homespunballad penned by an American pilot. mcxxxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2055214] The documenteven stated that an F-111 crashed on one occasion when its pilot attempted toescape from one encounter – far more serious than the foo fighter incidents, ofwhich there are no known cases of aircraft being lost. mcxl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2057437] Perhaps theIraqi air defenses were not shut down as completely as had been thought,although this seems odd in the context of the coalition’s total air superiority.There is another interesting Gulf War UFO story known to the author, obtainedduring a personal interview with a U.S. army captain who served in the war.During Operation Desert Shield, this individual was stationed in the Iraqidesert with his unit, “with nothing but sand for hundreds of miles in anydirection.” On one occasion, he was informed by a superior command that his unitwas not to fire on any objects that might appear within a particular, ratherrestricted, sector of the sky. “Sure enough,” said the captain, “a few nightslater, we saw something.” In the sky were several bright objects maneuvering inan extraordinary fashion. “We could not have shot them down if we had tried,” hesaid. When asked what he and his soldiers thought they saw, he initially offeredno opinion. When asked whether they wondered if these were UFOs, he said,“absolutely. Of course!” The story is intriguing. It would seem to mean that theUFOs seen by the American soldiers were “made in America,” unless one were toargue that the U.S. military had advance notice of alien operations, whether viaopen communication or other intelligence gathering techniques. Or, the U.S.military-industrial complex was collaborating with one or more alienintelligences.The Gulf War was a watershed in modern history, marking the true turning pointfrom the old to the new. America had exhibited unmatched dominance not just inthe field of battle but in control over information. Moreover, in the greatestmilitary action since the end of World War Two, the Soviet Union had been littlemore than an afterthought. Although it would continue to exist until the year’send, the final nail in the Cold War’s coffin had been driven. The New WorldOrder had arrived. Aerial Encounters in 1991Throughout late 1990 into 1991, the U.S. had three ongoing UFO hotspots: GulfBreeze, Area 51, and the Antelope Valley. Elsewhere in the world, most of theinteresting UFO reports were coming from Europe, particularly Great Britain.During the last few months of 1990, there were dozens of reports of strangeaerial objects in Britain and Europe. mcxli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2057740] An interestingcase occurred over the North Sea on November 5, during a Boeing 737 BritishAirways flight from Rome to London’s Gatwick Airport. The pilot and copilotnoticed a large silver disc-shaped object. They brought two crew members intothe cockpit to observe it with them before it went out of sight. Ground radarfound nothing unusual. The same night, in the same area, a patrol of RAFTornados over the North Sea was overtaken at high speed by what the pilots couldonly describe as a large aircraft of some sort. It appeared to come so closethat they took violent evasive action. mcxlii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2057911]"},{"pageContent":" There were several more commercial aviation encounters during the springof 1991, each over a different continent. On the evening of March 6, 1991, aglowing turquoise cigar-shaped object crossed the path of an airliner overKingston, Ontario, Canada. mcxliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2058130] On March 18,over Kunshan, China, the pilot of an airliner saw a ring-shaped object, tworectangular objects moving back and forth, and a red blaze of light coming fromthe ring. mcxliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2058315]On April 19, an event took place in the Soviet Union that, although not anaerial encounter, was still startling. In the Kazak city of Alma-Ata, twomilitiamen on patrol noticed a kind of fire at the top of Kok-Tyube mountain.They watched flames go up and down, and then saw an array of red beams of light.They drove to within 200 meters of a hovering UFO. At that point, they said, “afew rays swept across the car and it stopped dead.” The object then dimmed itslights and disappeared. The men made it back to the police station, but couldnot recall how they did so. Radio tapes concerning the UFO were recorded.According to a newspaper account, there were “impartial witnesses” to the event,the account of which was collected by the CIA. mcxlv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2058495] A near-tragic aerial collision with a UFO occurred on the evening ofApril 21, 1991, when an Italian airliner was on final approach to HeathrowAirport. Just off the coast of Romney, Kent, the pilot saw a grey object crosshis path less than 100 feet away. Although he could not get a clear image of itsshape, describing it as either round or missile-like, the event was confirmed byradar. The airliner had nearly been blown out of the sky. Nick Pope, soon afterhe took the job of investing UFO reports for the British Ministry of Defence,investigated the matter. He learned that the army denied firing any missiles,nor could it have fired missiles to that height. The British CAA concluded that“extensive enquiries have failed to provide any indication of what the sightingmay have been.” Nick Redfern noted that the description of the UFO wasconsistent with a pilotless drone of the type used for defense practice. Eitherthe Ministry of Defence admitted that a UFO nearly caused a midair disaster, orit was using UFOs as a smokescreen to hide its mistakes. One must agree withRedfern’s assessment: either way, the case deserved further investigation.Unfortunately, it was never solved. mcxlvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2058735]Through the spring of 1991, Britain was scene to unexplained sightings. On May22, a husband and wife in Nottingham saw an array of lights in an “elongatedtriangle.” This same object was seen 15 minutes later by another man in thearea. He said it was about 1,000 feet high and gave off a low humming noise.mcxlvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2059010]Through the next month there was heavy UFO activity reported in Nottingham,including many triangular sightings. People often described two separatetriangular objects flying in close formation, each with very bright lights thatwere much larger than those of any known aircraft. Throughout, the Ministry ofDefence was silent about it. mcxlviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2059183] The most compelling UFO case of 1991, however, occurred not in Europe or theU.S., but in Paraguay. This was a radar-visual case which was reported by thepilots of two airplanes. It involved an object hovering over a runway,electronic failures, astonishing departure speeds, and an officialinvestigation. Fortunately, it was investigated thoroughly by MUFON’srepresentative to Paraguay, Jorge Alfonso Ramirez, who interviewed many of theprincipal witnesses and obtained an official report from Paraguay’s Ministry ofDefense.On June 8, Cesar Escobar, pilot of a Cessna Model 210, took off from a farm nearthe city of Concepcion at about 6 p.m. Shortly after being airborne, aninteresting conversation came over his radio between the traffic controloperator at Silvio Petirossi Airport and a Lineas Aereas Paraguayas (LAP)airliner. This was LAP Flight 702, enroute from Asunción to Miami. The pilot ofthe LAP advised the control tower that another aircraft was traveling towardhim. The tower then asked him if he could see the object. “I have it just infront of me,” came the nervous reply. Airport radar was able to confirm thisobject’s presence – something surely was there. The Paraguayan controllers askedtheir counterparts in Bolivia if they knew anything about the unknown traffic:the answer came back negative. The object then flew straight toward the LAPairliner and passed over it at an incredible speed, an event that Escobar heardbeing described as it happened on the radio.Just a few minutes later, Escobar saw a UFO. A strong, bluish-white light to hisright attracted his attention. “It all happened so fast,” he said “that Icouldn’t understand what was going on.... I began to be concerned when my twopassengers asked me what that object was and why it was flying so close to us.”Airport radar control radioed him to ask if he had traffic on his right. Yes, hereplied, he certainly did. For the next 25 minutes, the UFO accompanied hisaircraft. Its light was so intense that he could not distinguish any otherfeatures. At times the object closed on his position, causing his instruments togo wild (and frightening him considerably). To Escobar, the object seemed to beunder intelligent control, causing him to believe that its operator was toyingwith him. “I’ve never been so afraid in all my life,” he said. “I didn’t believethese things existed.”The object stayed with him until he descended toward Asunción at 7:22 p.m. Radarcontrol informed the tower duty operator, Anibal Gavigan, that Escobar’s planewas preparing to land, accompanied by a strange object. Gavigan immediately sawit: a luminous object flying next to Escobar’s plane. After Escobar landed,Gavigan ordered the field’s lights to be shut off, then on again, in order tohave a better idea of the object’s position. While the lights were out, he andother witnesses saw the object hovering motionless over the field about 600meters away, a sighting confirmed by radar. Gavigan watched the object for fiveminutes, sometimes through binoculars. It was completely still, with a strongreddish light. Then something spectacular happened. The object shot a bright rayto the western horizon. Although it lasted for just a fraction of a second,during that brief moment, it was “a perfect yellow line going as far as youcould see to the west.” After this, the object left instantly at an astonishingspeed. Gavigan told Ramirez, “the speed of that object was incredible. I wasshocked. I’ve never seen such a thing in my life.”The radar operators also tracked the object’s departure, which was too fast tomeasure. The radar made one revolution every five seconds with a range of 150nautical miles, and the object disappeared from the screen during onerevolution. Thus, that would have to be at least 26 miles per second, whichtranslates to over 1,500 miles per minute, to the unbelievable speed of morethan 90,000 mph.Jorge Ramirez had some difficulty reaching LAP representatives, who told himthat the flight reports had been destroyed according to company rules. After twomonths, he was finally granted an interview with a copilot on the LAP Flight702, Colonel Angel David Farina. Farina told him that he and several members ofthe crew saw the object. He confirmed the flight altitude as reported in therecords and said the observation lasted for about thirty minutes while they flewpast the Paraguayan city of Filadelfia. He confirmed Escobar’s account of whathad been heard over the radio, and added that the object had a strong reddishlight and an oval shape. “It was very, very close, no doubt.” mcxlix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2059357] UFOs Over MexicoDuring the afternoon of July 11, 1991, a solar eclipse occurred over the world’slargest city, Mexico City. This was no ordinary eclipse. Before it occurred,some Mexicans were talking about an ancient Mayan prophecy known as the “DresdenCodex.” Despite a gulf of 1,200 years, the prophecy was believed to havepredicted that the 1991 eclipse would usher in major earth changes and greatercosmic awareness, specifically from encounters with the “Masters of the Stars.”With such a cultural buildup, thousands of Mexicans were ready for the event andwatching the skies. Many of them had camcorders. They were not to bedisappointed; indeed, they saw much more than they ever expected.For more than half an hour, several bright objects were seen hovering over theregion. Video was recorded as far south as the cities of Puebla and Oaxaca, thelatter of which was more than 200 miles away. Skeptics claimed that this was theplanet Venus, visible during the period when the sun was blocked. But the fulleclipse lasted just under seven minutes, and this object was seen for more thana half hour before, during, and after the event.Afterwards, Mexican television journalist Jaime Maussan, host of the televisionshow “60 Minutos,” received a videotape of the UFO. It showed an object hoveringin the sky, looking not like a star at all, but rather like a silver disc.Intrigued, he asked his viewers to share any unusual sightings they may have hadduring the eclipse. Fifteen videotapes soon arrived, each one taken by a witnessfrom a different location within the broad region of the sighting. Maussanenlisted the technical help of his television station’s video experts fordigital enhancement and enlargement work. The quantity and quality of thesevideos, combined with the analyses performed on them, made them especiallyimportant and compelling. They showed solid, metallic-looking objects thatreflected light. Maussan’s team checked into possibilities such as balloons,helicopters, or other conventional aerial phenomena, but came up empty.The objects were not astronomical objects. They moved as if by intelligentcontrol across the sky while other heavenly bodies remained stationary bycomparison. Digital enhancements of the images revealed a “hockey puck” shape,not anything resembling a star or planet. The clincher was that many of theobjects moved in front of passing clouds.This mass sighting signaled the beginning of a UFO wave over Mexico that lastedthroughout the 1990s. Just why this began on the date of the eclipse, and justwhy it seemed to be connected with a Mayan prophecy, can only be a matter ofconjecture. Once the Venus argument became untenable, skeptics argued that theUFO (or UFOs) were simply “anomalous” objects – which indeed they were – andshrugged off the connection to the Dresden Codex. But two things are clear.First, the objects recorded on so many videos were unlike anything that wassupposed to be in the air. Second, a major series of UFO sightings followed intheir wake. mcl[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2059579] The Military Abduction QuestionAs if alleged abduction by aliens were not controversial enough, by the dawn ofthe 1990s a new twist in this phenomenon was being experienced andresearched. This was the alleged abduction of people by completely human,military groups who sought to extract as much information about the alien agendaand related matters as possible. The pioneer researcher of these “militaryabductions” (MILABs) was Karla Turner, an Oklahoma resident who had earned aPh.D. in literature and taught at Texas University.In 1988, while Karla and her husband were in counseling to learn why they werefeeling physical symptoms of stress, she read two books about alien abduction:Missing Time and Communion . She soon recalled having seen an odd light in thesky as a girl, and began to dream about UFOs. Having learned hypnotic relaxationtechniques from her therapist, she regressed her husband, whereupon heremembered several childhood encounters with grey aliens.Several nights after that regression, Karla awoke to sounds of clicks and bumpsin the house, followed by disembodied voices in her bedroom. She laterremembered a nightmare from childhood in which an insect-like being held herhand and told her it was her mother. Soon she and her husband underwentregression by an Oklahoma UFO researcher. Her own regressions produced accountsof repeated abductions since childhood, and evidence that her whole family wasinvolved. After one session, Karla, her husband, and a third person saw alighted disc-shaped craft hovering over them. Two weeks later she again heardvoices in the night and loud knocking sounds. She woke to find small punctureson her inner wrist and three white circles on her abdomen. Through the remainderof 1988 and into 1989, more body marks appeared on Karla, including a solid redtriangle on her arm, puncture wounds, scratches, and bruises. Poltergeistphenomena also occurred. The Turners began to notice a white car parked neartheir house, and unmarked helicopters seemed to follow them. They began tosuspect the U.S. military was monitoring them. The account of all this appearedin her 1992 book, Into The Fringe. mcli[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2059825]Turner continued to investigate. She was disturbed to learn that at least tenpeople close to her seemed to have a pattern of alien intrusions anddisturbances. Soon she was meeting with more abductees and published anotherbook in 1994, called Taken . It included the accounts provided by eight women,none of whom knew each other, all of whom consciously recalled a large portionof their experiences without the aid of hypnosis. mclii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2060037]Many details were widely shared, such as UFO sightings, missing time, “virtualreality” scenarios, telepathic communication, and human-alien collaboration.They described a variety of alien types: greys, insectoids, reptoids, humanoids,blue humanoids, and dwarves. Several of the women described not only hybridnursery rooms (something described in earlier abduction literature), but also“cloning rooms,” in which living but inert humans – as many as 20 identicalspecimens – were suspended in liquid-filled cylinders. There were accounts ofaliens apparently taking human souls and placing them into a box. One aliengroup appeared to harvest “negative emotional energy.” Not all experiences wereharmful or exploitative; some women claimed to have had miraculous healings byaliens. Still, Turner suggested that this did not make aliens humanity’sbenefactors. If they cared for humans, she suggested, it could well be the way afarmer cares for his cattle.Four of the eight women featured in Taken described being abducted by humanmilitary personnel. Some of these recollections were quite clear, and theydescribed being taken not to an alien craft, but a very human, military-lookingfacility, often underground. Human and alien workers were sometimes described asbeing there. The abductees remembered being questioned by military types whoasked such questions as “what do you know about the alien agenda? What have theytold you? What implants did you receive? What procedures have they carried outon you?” A number of medical problems developed, apparently related to theabductions: sudden-developing cancer, depression, post-traumatic stressdisorder, sexual dysfunction, suicide, and more.The phenomenon of military abductions caused Turner to argue that “a revolutionhas taken place,” and that a hidden power structure unknown to most people had“appropriated the UFO phenomenon.” Ordinary politics had nothing to do with thiscover-up. Although she did not use the term “shadow government,” this was whatTurner meant. One thing that perplexed her was why – if there was indeedhuman-alien collaboration – military groups would need to interrogate abducteesabout alien intentions. She did not have an answer to this. Of course, if onehypothesizes the existence of multiple alien groups, the problem might make moresense. One or more of the human groups could have allied itself in some way withone or more of the various alien groups. There could be a web of complex andcovert relationships. mcliii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2060245] In 1991, MILAB research was in its infancy. Throughout the 1990s, people suchas Kathy Jordan, Leah Haley, and Melinda Leslie described their own experiences.Soon after Karla Turner died of cancer in early 1996, another researcher, HelmutLammer, followed up on the growing body of MILAB testimony. He also focused onthe probable technologies involved in these experiences.Like Turner before him, Lammer found that a typical MILAB experience wasdistinct from traditional accounts of alien abduction. Instead of feelingparalyzed, MILAB subjects were usually tied to an examination table or agynecological chair, given a strong drink that contained drugs, and interrogatedabout their alien encounters. Doctors or scientists in white lab coats examinedor removed alien implants, sometimes performed gynecological examinations, andsometimes placed their own implants into the individual. Lammer noted thegrowing numbers of accounts of human-alien collaboration, humans in clear tanks,and bizarre genetic experimentation. mcliv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2060467] The question of mind and memory control becomes evident. It is one thingfor technologically advanced aliens to be able to wipe a person’s memory (atleast mostly), but was this within the realm of human capability? Lammer’sanswer was yes. As far back as the 1960s, Professor J. Anthony Deutsch of NewYork University showed that an excess of the chemical acetylcholine in the braincan interfere with memory. He found that this excess could be artificiallyproduced through either drugs or radio waves – the latter process being calledElectronic Dissolution of Memory (EDOM). Memory creation could be inhibited ordistorted for as long as the radio signal continued, and time-orientation wasdestroyed. Lammer argued that EDOM appeared to be the method of choice usedagainst MILAB abductees, leaving the victim with no memory of what hadtranspired. At least, this was the case most of the time. Mind controltechnologies remain imperfect, people are not all the same, and memories canoccasionally be retrieved. mclv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2060710] Another technology of interest to Lammer was the creation of what Turnerdescribed as Virtual Reality Scenarios (VRS). Many MILAB victims described vividimages being flashed inside their minds. Here, too, argued Lammer, humantechnology was up to the task. Specifically, the implanting of an intracerebraldevice might enable its operators to send images and even memories into thebrain of abductees. As far back as the 1960s, important work was done alongthese lines by Dr. Jose Delgado, Dr. Joseph Sharp, and Dr. Allen Frey. The lasttwo pioneered the transmission of spoken words directly into the audio cortexvia pulsed microwaves, known as the Frey effect. Such was all within the openliterature on the subject: what might have been accomplished secretly in theblack world, especially during the funding bonanza of the 1980s? Of course, ifimages and memories could be somehow implanted into a person, could this meanthat some of the information coming from MILAB abductees were cover storiesinduced by the hypno-programming of military psychiatrists?The technology of implants themselves had been solved by 1990. Already by then,millions of animals worldwide had been implanted with small transponders,passive radio frequency identification tags, the smallest of which was the sizeof an uncooked grain of rice. A similar biochip for humans had been designed anddeveloped by Dr. Daniel Man, who in 1989 received a patent for a homing devicethat could be implanted in humans – its stated purpose was to find missingchildren. He advised that the best location for his implant might be behind theear. Coincidentally or not, several MILAB subjects claimed to have had implantsplaced behind their ears. mclvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2061097] The theory of military abductions found very few supporters. Skepticsargued that such wild stories were nothing more than fantasies and fabrications.mclvii [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2061378]Traditional abduction researchers tended to ignore the claims, which representeda small fraction of their research and were difficult for them to assimilate.Mind control researchers found the MILAB phenomenon perfectly credible, exceptthat most of them (not believing in UFOs) concluded that the entire “alienabduction” phenomenon was staged by the intelligence community as a cover forits illegal experiments. mclviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2061577]Certainly, all possibilities, including the last, had to be considered, butthere were problems with neat solutions. Why did MILAB reports surface so latein the game? After all, mind control technology was surely better in the 1980sthan during the 1960s – one would think there would have been more MILAB reportsduring earlier years, before the technology had been perfected. Another problemwas that the mind control literature contained many cases of victims with noconnection to UFOs or alien abductions. And why should the military beinterested in gynecological examinations of female abductees? Lammer and Turner,unfazed by the skeptics, both argued that the most logical scenario was thatmilitary abduction developed in response to a genuine alien abductionphenomenon.Thus, by the early 1990s, a variant twist to the UFO phenomenon must beconsidered. A deep-black program could well have existed, operating beyond theboundaries of the open legal system, possibly beyond the boundaries of thestandard military system, working for unknown superiors, which usedextraordinary means and technology to take humans for testing and interrogation.If we also consider the possibility of covert breakthroughs in propulsiontechnology, and the “off the grid” nature of the deep-black world itself, wecome to the possibility that we are dealing with, in effect, a “breakawaycivilization.” One with loose connections at various points to the opencivilization of humanity, but with great independence, secrecy, and a monopolyof certain key scientific secrets. The history of the Cold War showed thatseparate infrastructures could, to some extent, evolve. Western politics,economy, science, and culture developed along paths that were very differentfrom those in the Soviet Union or China. Important breakthroughs occurred insecrecy – stealth being a prominent example. Granted, the level of separationimplied for a breakaway civilization would be vastly greater than any Cold Warexamples. In principle, however, such a development is possible, and responsibleresearch must consider the strength of supporting evidence and clues. The Abortive DisclosureWhat follows is only alleged, not proven. It was introduced in Robert Collins’and Richard Doty’s book Exempt from Disclosure in 2004, but received additionalconfirmation by someone closely connected to the events in question, and who wasinterviewed by the author. Until others openly come forward, this will remain amatter of uncertainty and debate. Even with this caveat in place, however, thereis reason to believe it may have happened.According to the account presented by Collins and Doty, the person known as“Raven” (in the terminology of the Aviary) entered the UFO disclosure picture in1991. This person’s public identity remains unknown, but he is said to have hadlong-time experience with Los Alamos National Laboratory and MJ-12, andapparently believed that the time had come to consider the end of UFO secrecy.During the summer of 1991, Raven set up a meeting in which key members of theBush administration were briefed on the UFO reality. Although Bush himself wasnot thoroughly briefed on this occasion, it is said he was told that there was amovement to determine whether disclosure was feasible, and that he gave hispermission to explore the possibility of moving ahead.Attempts were then made to gain support from agency heads for UFO disclosure.One meeting took place in a vault room at Kirtland AFB, allegedly attended byRaven, Senator Claiborne Pell (D-RI), and others. mclix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2061808]Representatives of the President wanted to ensure that the information wasrevealed with the proper spin so as to minimize government bashing. They alsowanted television programming that portrayed the “Ebens” as non-hostileexplorers, and emphasizing that any military aircraft lost during encounterswith them had not been due to hostile action on their part. The Aviary’sproposal “was received very well” and taken back to Washington.A great deal apparently hinged on the confirmation hearings of Robert Gates forthe position of CIA Director. Senator Pell reportedly said, “if Gates does notget in, there is no way in hell this thing is going forward.” Meanwhile, thebriefing of agencies continued, with several conducting their own researchregarding the likely impact of UFO disclosure and relevant costs. Some favoredthe idea; many more opposed it. NASA was said to favor disclosure on theassumption that it would liberate money from Congress for future space projects.Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Dick Cheney was said to be stronglyopposed, feeling that the administration had “nothing to gain” and would need torespond to a massive influx of FOIA requests. The Justice Department also wasopposed, recommending that the President keep the matter strictly covert. TheAuditor General’s office worried that the government might face enormouslawsuits from angry citizens. The most vivid image presented was that ofoutgoing CIA chief, William Webster. When he was briefed, he reportedly wentinto a rage. He kicked a chair and yelled, “you can’t do this to me! I’ve hadSenators and other high level people sit in that chair and I’ve told them thereis nothing to this!”The confirmation hearings of Robert Gates were delayed through July 1991. AsAugust progressed, proponents were concerned that the briefing process wastaking longer than expected. Even so, a meeting was scheduled to present theentire matter to President Bush at his retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine onWednesday, August 23, 1991. In addition to Bush, it was supposed to include somefifteen leading government officials. Raven thought perhaps the meeting mightsucceed, that there was a chance a consensus could be achieved which wouldenable Bush to “green light” some form of disclosure. Schedule conflicts,however, forced the meeting to be pushed back for the following weekend,presumably the 26th or 27th.But the meeting never happened. The Soviet military coup of August 19-21, 1991caused the disclosure plans to be aborted – specifically by whom is not known.mclx [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2062283]The story is impossible to verify for now, but perhaps in time it can be. Theauthor spoke to a senior official who, while not directly involved in the eventsrecounted above, knew the main individuals concerned and was aware at the timethat such an attempt was being made. He added further that such discussions tendto occur “every five years or so.”There are two interesting side notes regarding Senator Claiborne Pell. First,his longtime friend and aide, C. B. Scott Jones, indicated that Pell – despitepublic protestations to the contrary – did have a strong interest in UFO/ETphenomena. However, he was already politically exposed by his known interest inpsychic phenomena. Therefore, not wanting to give his critics and futureopponents any more ammunition to use against him, Pell accepted Jones’ssuggestion that he refer to his UFO interest “as being in consciousnessresearch.” Indeed, as a member of Pell’s staff, Jones visited China and theSoviet Union to study “consciousness research.” What he learned apparently drewinterest from some elite circles. According to Jones, one of Pell’s very closefriends, Hans-Adam, Prince of Liechtenstein, had a very strong interest in allmatters relating to UFOs. Whenever the Prince visited the United States, Pell’sstanding order was for Jones to tell the Prince everything he had learned in hisinternational travels about UFOs."},{"pageContent":"While this is surely interesting, it does not answer the question as to whetheror not Pell was briefed on UFOs, or whether there was an attempt at disclosurein 1991. In the end, Jones felt that Pell “very well may have” received a formalbriefing on UFOs. However, he had no information on any disclosure effort from1991. mclxi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2062482] A second intriguing “UFO-connection” to Claiborne Pell is that heattended the 1987 MUFON International Symposium, which took place at AmericanUniversity in Washington, D.C. During a break period, some of the attendeesapproached him and asked why he was there. One of the attendees was PeterRobbins, who reported that “Pell responded with a smile that he was alsointerested in the subject – in his capacity as a private citizen, of course.”This might make Pell the only American Senator ever to have attended a publicconference dedicated to UFOs. mclxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2062662] It should not be surprising that the end of the Cold War would prompt freshdiscussions on the viability of a long-term UFO cover-up. The Cold War had,after all, been a leading reason for the establishment of UFO secrecy, and forhalf a century remained an important factor in the equation. Over the years,however, UFO secrecy dug in like a tenacious plant, developing a vast rootsystem that went far beyond its original domain. It turned out to be far moreentrenched than the Cold War itself. The Soviet Coup and AftermathAll through 1991, morale among Soviet leaders was as low as it could be. Theyear opened with riots in Lithuania and Latvia, culminating in “Bloody Sunday”in Vilnius on January 21, when 14 Lithuanians were killed by Soviet troops.American dominance in the Gulf War further demoralized Soviet leaders. On July1, 1991, the Warsaw Pact formally disbanded. From the vantage point of theCommunist Party, Perestroika was reaching a very unhappy conclusion.The result was a coup against Gorbachev by old guard Communist, Army, and KGBleadership from August 19 to 21, 1991. An “Emergency Committee” announced thatGorbachev was too ill to rule and placed him under house arrest. However, thecoup never gained popular support and its leaders soon lost heart. In Moscow,many people refused to obey orders from the new group, and Moscow Mayor BorisYeltsin rallied support for Gorbachev. A dramatic scene followed in whichYeltsin and his supporters were surrounded by troops and tanks. In the midst ofthis, Estonia and Latvia declared their independence, while Lithuania reaffirmedits declaration from 1990. On the 22nd, Yeltsin sent a plane for Gorbachev whileseveral plotters committed suicide. Gorbachev quickly learned that the Communistleadership had been behind the attempt.Events then moved like lightning. Within two weeks of the failed coup, Gorbachevresigned as leader of the Soviet Communist Party and disbanded the CentralCommittee, the Soviet Communist Party dissolved itself, the Baltic Statesachieved recognition from the U.S. and Soviet governments, and the Sovietrepublic of Georgia severed its ties to the Soviet Union.Gorbachev also moved quickly to dissolve the KGB, completing his task byNovember 1991. mclxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2063001] In theprocess, many coveted files found their way abroad, particularly to the CIA.This included the KGB’s UFO files, the infamous “Blue Folder,” which werereleased in October upon request of the famous cosmonaut Pavel Popovitch. Thefiles were quite a bonanza, repeatedly confirming the reality of UFOs in the airand on the ground, seen by Soviet military personnel and registered on theirradar screens. In time, western journalists had the opportunity to examine thefiles. One was ABC correspondent David Ensor, who studied them for severalmonths during 1995. Ensor interviewed dozens of Russian military personnel,government officials, and scientists, and learned of some 40 major incidents –one of which prompted fears of starting an accidental nuclear war. Although thefiles were clearly not complete, they provided something of a counterpart to thecache of American files that had been previously released through FOIA. In bothcases, the files were released as a result of political crisis. In the case ofAmerica, the dual crisis of Vietnam and Watergate led to a resurgence ofCongressional authority and a strengthening of FOIA. In the case of the SovietUnion, it was the breakup of the nation itself. mclxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2063311] Faking Crop CirclesThe crop circles continued to amaze. Some 600 new circles, ever more complex,appeared in 30 countries around the world during the summer of 1991, from farmsin southwestern England to wet rice paddies in Japan. The most astoundingformation was discovered on August 12, 1991, in a wheat field near Ickelton,about ten miles south of Cambridge, England. At 124 feet in diameter, its sizewas substantial enough. Its design, however, was extraordinary. This was a“Mandelbrot set,” a design that had first been generated on a computer and wasnamed after Benoit Mandelbrot. Mandelbrot, a mathematician of genius, haddeveloped the field of fractal geometry, used to study chaos theory and itsapplications to patterns of growth in the natural world. Natural objects thatapproximate fractals to a degree include clouds, mountain ranges, lightningbolts, coastlines, snowflakes, and seashells. The Mandelbrot crop circle wasbrilliantly done, laid to perfection. Like all the other formations, no one sawit being created, and it appeared overnight. Once people realized what they wereseeing, the general reaction was one of astonishment. Whoever was behind thesecircles was taking them to an entirely new level. mclxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2063630]This and other impressive formations received tremendous press worldwide. Thencame the deflating news from two pensioners in their sixties named Doug Bowerand Dave Chorley. On September 9, 1991, they told the British press that theyhad hoaxed some 250 circles in the region. They began, they said, in 1978 andwere disappointed that it took two years for the world to notice their work.Their method was to use planks to flatten the crops in conjunction with ropesattached to a central pole, although they said their formations had becomeincreasingly elaborate over the years. Indeed, some of Bower’s and Chorley’srecent work was good enough to have fooled circle expert Pat Delgado intopronouncing one of their creations to be “genuine” – that no human could havebeen responsible for it. Just a month later, another crop circle analyst wasfooled. This was Terence Meaden, who promoted the vortex theory of crop circles.After pronouncing one particular circle to be genuine – on British television noless – a group called the Wessex Sceptics claimed it as their own creation. Itbecame evident that some hoaxed circles were quite good. If an expert could befooled by even some of these, how could one be sure if any were truly anomalous?The upshot of all this was a flurry of press coverage proclaiming that the cropcircle mystery had been solved. There was no mystery, after all, just somepranksters and copycats.Nothing is as simple as it seems, however. Soon after their confession, Bowerand Chorley gave a demonstration of their work. Their noticeably slipshod circlefailed to impress. They could provide no evidence of their handiwork other thantheir own anecdotal testimony and a few diagrams. Not only this, butcereologists had long been pointing out that, although some hoaxed circles werewell done, many were easy to identify. It was the circles of extreme precisionand complexity that had not been explained, they said. Thus, despite the mediasaturation claiming to have “solved” the mystery, many observers continued tobelieve that hoaxers could not have created all of the thousands of circlesshowing up in southern England, to say nothing of other regions of the world.mclxvi [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2064048] As the 1990s continued, cereologists arranged for scientific studiesthat detected measurable chemical and biological effects within the plant stalksof “genuine” crop circles. For instance, soil and plant studies conducted bybiophysicist W. C. Levengood from 1991 to 1993 showed a number of distinguishingcharacteristics of affected plants, including “cell pit” changes to the stalks,evidence of rapid heating to the nodes of stalks (identical to that created bymicrowave radiation), dramatic changes in seed growth, bent and cracked growthnodes, and ion transport in bract tissue. Levengood argued that rapid andintense energy had produced cell changes in the affected plants. These effectswere not significantly found in samples from known hoaxed circles. Whatever wascreating true crop circles, concluded Levengood, was “affecting the fundamentalbiophysics and biochemistry of the plants.” mclxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2064736] Studies by Levengood and others did not sway the scientific or mediaestablishments. Although many of them appeared to have been conductedcompetently, they were private endeavors with no institutional backing. As such,they carried little weight within the scientific community. In the realm ofpublic opinion, they were handicapped by the long durations required toundertake a proper study: by the time an analysis was complete, the circle waslong gone and attention was focused on other matters. As far as the mainstreammedia was concerned, the Doug and Dave episode made crop circles safe andprosaic. No matter how questionable some of their claims were, a safety rail nowexisted for all doubters. Of course, the London Times , New York Times , 60Minutes and other august investigative media did not tempt fate by examining thematter on their own. When the story did come up, the wrong questions were beingasked. It was not so much the who that mattered as the how . Lost in the generaldiscussion was how the most complex and perfect formations were createdovernight without detection or any sign of human activity. UFOs in Space: STS-48For years, anomalous events had been noted during many American and Soviet spacemissions. The most famous of these took place on September 15, 1991, during theNASA Space Shuttle Discovery mission known as STS-48. NASA’s cable channelprovided live broadcasts of the shuttle flights, and Donald Ratch of Dundalk,Maryland, recorded it on the downlink provided by a local community college. Hisvideo recorded a truly bizarre-looking event. The shuttle was 355 miles abovethe Earth, its camera trained on the planet’s outline, when a bright objectentered the frame from the top right, seemingly from deeper space. It movedsteadily toward Earth’s atmosphere. Within seconds, a flash appeared from thelower left portion of the screen and the object performed an about-face. As thisoccurred, another object shot out from the lower left portion of the frame,looking every bit like a projectile of some sort, and seemed to just misshitting the original object. For a few seconds more, the camera continued totrack the original object moving off into space. Adding to the mystery, thecamera ceased broadcasting about 65 seconds after the encounter. mclxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2064934]Common sense gave an obvious interpretation: this was an altercation in space,the firing of an unknown weapon at an unknown object. The question is whether ornot common sense was correct in this instance.Ratch sent the video to his congresswoman, Helen Bentley. He also contactedVincent DiPietro, a NASA engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center, who inturn contacted his congresswoman, Beverly Byron. Byron sent a copy of the tapeto George E. Brown, Jr., Chair of the Congressional Committee on Science, Space,and Technology. Brown and staff were told by NASA that the objects were probablyurine ice particles released from the shuttle. They believed the apparent changeof the original object’s direction was most likely due to the firing of one ofthe shuttle’s attitude adjustor rockets, known as the Reaction Control System(RCS). They suggested the bright flash at the lower left portion of the screenwas in fact the firing of the RCS. Martin P. Kress, an assistant administratorfor legislative affairs at NASA, concurred with this theory, and James Obergwrote an analysis arguing this position. NASA computer records later indicatedthat the shuttle’s RCS jet did fire at the time in question, although critic LanFleming argued that NASA’s time stamps on the video were “phony.” mclxix[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2065182]"},{"pageContent":" Dr. Jack Kasher, a professor of physics and astronomy at the Universityof Nebraska, disagreed with NASA’s ice particle theory. “To the best of myknowledge,” he said, “the individuals who suspected ice particles merely watchedthe videotape and did no further scientific analysis.” Kasher, who was a NASAconsultant and also a member of MUFON, performed a detailed analysis of theSTS-48 tapes. He argued that there were at least a dozen or more distinctevents, each different from one another and not commonly seen on other shuttletapes. When he requested more technical information to assist in his analysis,NASA refused. Kasher interpreted this refusal to mean that the subject hadnational security implications. mclxx[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2065617] Regarding theanomalous objects themselves, he concluded that they behaved oddly for any typeof particle, whether ice or otherwise. Assuming their change of direction wascaused by the firing of a shuttle rocket, their directional paths should havetraced back to a single source. They did not. Moreover, one of the particlesappeared to remain motionless for almost half a second, a great oddityconsidering that any acceleration in space should have been continuous. Equallyodd were streaks of light that appeared to pass through the space vacated byboth objects. Kasher demonstrated five proofs that discounted the ice particletheory. “It’s hard not to think that the objects were some kind of spaceship ata considerable distance from the shuttle, and although it’s only speculation,the streaks of light look like missiles fired in their direction.” Depending onthe exact distance from the shuttle – assuming a distance between one mile and1,710 miles – the velocity of the second object would have been between 250 mphto 430,000 mph. “There is just no way,” he stated. “The evidence stronglyindicates they can’t be ice particles.” mclxxi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2065793] Jeff Challender, who spent many years prior to his untimely death in 2007collecting and studying anomalous data from space missions, pointed out that thedistant object diverted 135 degrees and sped out into space. Challender rebukedNASA’s claim that the relative motion of this object was caused by the RCS jetfiring. “The RCS jets,” he wrote,. . . are mounted on the extreme nose and tail of the Shuttles. They firevertically, and in the vacuum of space, the exhaust plume expands upward in ateardrop shape. The aft thrusters are some 20 to 25 feet away from the camera,and even further away [from] the debris field. Objects nearer than thecontroversial one are barely affected. The RCS gas plume could not have greatlyinfluenced our anomalous object at the distance it MUST be from the jet plume.Therefore, I conclude that the object must be independently propelled. mclxxii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2065991] Some analysts could not explain the speed of the projectile that wasfired. Challender pointed out that it could not be a laser or particle beam,both of which move at the speed of light. The streaks had to be something otherthan energy weapons, yet he knew no missile technology capable of moving at thevelocities observed in the video. mclxxiii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2066315] Actually,however, some of the weapons developed under SDI did fire projectiles that couldreach speeds within the range of Kasher’s estimates. The “Kinetic EnergyWeapon,” for instance, developed under SDI during the 1980s, could fire a tinyprojectile at a velocity of over 15,000 mph. Undoubtedly other more deeplyclassified weapons could well have done the same. mclxxiv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2066499] A few other individuals claim to have had evidence that the objects inthe STS-48 video were truly anomalous. Harry Jordan, a former radar operator onthe USS Roosevelt, said he was listening on a ham radio during the time of theflight and heard the astronauts saying they had a “UFO” – which they thendescribed as “the alien spacecraft” – under observation. “It just stunned me,”he said. Jordan stated that afterward he received visits and surveillance from“guys in suits” whose vehicle was registered at an air force base. He was alsovisited by an Air Force intelligence officer who wanted to see his ham radioequipment. mclxxv[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2066777] Sam Sherman, amovie producer who had previously done work for NASA, claimed to have digitalvideo copies of the NASA master tapes of the STS-48 event. He took them to asophisticated video studio for analysis and stated that when he asked thetechnician to enlarge one of the objects to the limits of the system’sresolution, it took on a disc shape with a dome protrusion. mclxxvi[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2066940]"},{"pageContent":"One other intriguing dimension may have been part of this event. It is possiblethat the Space Shuttle Discovery was accompanied by another American-made craftduring its STS-48 mission. According to former NASA space craft operator (ScO)Clark McClelland, it was almost certainly in September 1991 that two NASAastronauts told him to watch the passage of the shuttle very carefully, as “thenext space shuttle” would be following some distance behind. Sure enough, thatnight McClelland saw the space shuttle flying overhead in a clear night sky.Soon thereafter he saw the “new” craft in orbit, trailing the shuttle. It cameoverhead and, to his great surprise, abruptly turned to the left and completelydisappeared. A few weeks later, one of the astronauts gave him a sly grin as ifto say, “I told you, Clark.” McClelland did not speculate whether the trailingobject was an alien craft, but was “almost certain” the astronaut would not havedisclosed an object if it were anything other than an advanced technologicaldevelopment by the United States. He later decided that he had either seen thecraft called Aurora or the X-43A, NASA’s hypersonic, unmanned, experimentalvehicle – although the latter was not supposed to have flown until the 21stcentury. mclxxvii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2067119] Whatever the truth of the STS-48 event, it is interesting that soonafter the controversy arose, NASA decided to delay all broadcasts of itsmissions. Henceforth none would broadcast live. The most reasonable conclusionis that someone at NASA became responsible for analyzing images prior tobroadcast. Presumably, too, the NASA hierarchy felt that censorship might benecessary from time to time. mclxxviii[The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_016.html#filepos2067390] Creating the New World OrderAs the Cold War ended, a new world was forming. On December 8, 1991, three corestates of the Soviet Union – Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus – signed a pact endingthe Soviet Union’s existence and creating the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS). Most tellingly, they informed George Bush about it first, then Gorbachev.Although Gorbachev denied that they had the authority to do this, the Russianparliament ratified it anyway. Within days, so did nearly all the other Sovietrepublics. The Soviet military also signed on, supporting Yeltsin and the CIS.Gorbachev had no choice. He announced that all Soviet central structures wouldcease at the year’s end. In fact, the end came a week early, on Christmas Day.At the Kremlin, the Red flag was lowered for the last time, and Gorbachevresigned from his non-existent office. Many people had played their part to endthe Cold War, including Presidents Reagan and Bush, but Gorbachev had been theone indispensable man.The collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the world’s solesuperpower. Invincible on the battlefield, overwhelming economically, it waspoised to lead the world into a true “American Century.” President Bush spokeseveral times of a peace dividend, the savings gained from dramatically reducedmilitary spending. The world was coming to be a “kinder and gentler” place. Thenight had been long and dark, but now came the dawn.It was a false dawn. America’s decline was swifter than anyone could haveguessed. By the early 21st century, a new geopolitical power structure hadarisen, a multi-polar world in which Russia had regained much of its old status,and China had risen to the rank of a major power. More significant was the clearassertion of transnational organizations and international financial groupswhich wore away the old concept of national sovereignty. Added to this weresystematic policies, running across Presidential administrations, that erodedAmerican manufacturing strength. Finally came the ruinous foreign policydecisions to engage in wars during the 21st century that simply could not bepaid for. Within a mere two decades of its victory in the Cold War, the UnitedStates found itself in the midst of a financial crisis and with itsinternational stature vastly diminished. But that is a story for another book. SummaryUfologically speaking, the years 1990 and 1991 brought more strange cases ofunknown objects in the skies and orbit of the Earth. Some of the events, such asthe UFOs that appeared over Mexico, were as brazen as they were inexplicable.Others, such as the Greifswald lights or the various aerial encounters of theperiod, continued the long history of impossible, yet all-too-real technologiesdemonstrating that some group – whoever or whatever it might be – had surpassedthe level of our open, officially constituted, human civilization. The STS-48encounter provided unsettling evidence that a secret war could well have beenunderway, whether between humans and aliens, or even between groups of aliensseeking influence over the beautiful blue marble of our solar system.UFO research entered new, equally disturbing, areas. The idea that aliens wereabducting people was bad enough, but if it were true that elements of themilitary were also doing this, it would mean that a grave breach in the rightsof citizens had occurred. And yet, the claims were beginning to build, slowly atfirst but there all the same. Meanwhile, the investigation of Area 51 broadenedand deepened. Although the U.S. government continued to deny its existence, itwas obvious to anyone with an ounce of reason that the place was real. Theclaims of Bob Lazar were far from the only reason to consider that truly alientechnology was housed there. Faced with government stonewalling, researcherssimply gathered what evidence they could, none of which received officialconfirmation. Nonetheless, they gathered a great deal by the end of 1991.That the U.S. government refused to discuss UFOs openly with the public wasnothing new. From the point of view of those groups holding any secrets ofvalue, there always seemed to be more to lose than to gain by revealing whatthey knew. Yet the end of the Cold War may well have prompted a fresh discussionon all this. Opportunities to start over do not come often. The collapse ofSoviet power presented just such an opportunity, practically offered on a silverplatter. Among a few, scattered people within earshot of President Bush, theinevitable philosophical questions must have arisen. How long should UFO secrecylast? Is this the time to end it? Can humanity truly move into a new and betterera, brightened by the light of truth?In the end, it was not philosophy but pragmatism that ruled the day. The briefattempt to discuss the end of UFO secrecy, an attempt that appears to have beenundertaken during the summer of 1991, died because it was too big for theAmerican government.Which begs the question of who was actually “in charge” of the UFO secret?Clearly, the President of the United States, to the extent he could know aboutthe topic, would have to have dealt with it in the most secretive fashionpossible. Considering the exceedingly public nature of the American Presidency,this seems next-to-impossible. Perhaps the President retained some measure offormal authority over the matter, but in practice the operational aspects of theUFO secret had to have devolved elsewhere, undoubtedly someplace very “black.”By the end of the Cold War, the structure of UFO secrecy had moved far beyondany laws authorized by Congress, the federal judiciary, known Presidentialdirectives, or anything in the Constitution itself. In other words, UFO secrecyhad become an agent that undermined the U.S. government. That this was neverdiscussed in the open made the change so much more ominous. By the Cold War’send, it looked as though the center of gravity regarding UFO secrecy had shiftedaway from the official toward the unofficial . Perhaps it had always been so.Private power brokers like the Bilderbergers had exercised dominant king makingability for many years, and U.S. domestic and foreign policies had longreflected the interests of financial elites. Yet it is conceivable that controlover “the secret” became increasingly international and private as the yearswent by. Such is the tone of the few credible leaks on the matter, and thiswould conform with the general trend of global politics and power during thelate 20th century. In other words, it is conceivable that by the end of the ColdWar, the UFO problem had gone beyond the control of the U.S. President.Only a full and open review of the history can allow us to know whether such aturn of events is true, or was inevitable. If the UFO reality, however,portended something dangerous, or something that threatened the social fabric,it is not hard to see how a covert arm of the government would be seen as anecessity. If secrecy were truly of paramount importance, such an arm could intime become separate from its creator – perhaps even independent, like coloniesbreaking away from their mother country.It was not only the human power structure that had secrets. The intelligencesbehind the UFOs themselves clearly were not interested in announcing themselves.Divining an alien agenda from the mass of UFO reports has not proven to beparticularly fruitful, but reports through the early 1990s made at least twothings clear: that secrecy was important to the UFO operators, and they wereactively engaged about their own business. Indeed, it would appear that theEarth did not have visitors so much as long-term residents, presumably with asubstantial infrastructure. By the end of the Cold War, the available evidencepointed not so much to the existence of aliens arriving from outer space(although elsewhere in the universe remains a reasonable point of origin) as toan alien civilization living here on Earth, whether permanently or with somelong-term goal. Conclusion It is curious to note the old sea-margins of human thought. Each subsidingcentury reveals some new mystery; we build where monsters used to hidethemselves.― Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The most important scientific revolutions all include, as their only commonfeature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another ofprevious convictions about our centrality in the cosmos.― Stephen Jay Gould The evidence is conclusive: an intelligent UFO phenomenon beyond the control ofour civilization existed during the period under review of this study.Documented military encounters alone ran into the hundreds, many of which havebeen included here. Hundreds more “fastwalkers” were recorded by the DefenseSupport Program (DSP) satellite system, including an exact match with the famousTehran incident of 1976. Regardless of the actual source of the UFOs themselves,it is undeniable that they triggered a significant response by military agenciesaround the world. This fact alone warrants the most meticulous scrutiny byresponsible researchers.The military dimension was only one side of it, however. Vastly greater numbersof ordinary people had experiences for which their concept of reality had notprepared them. In the face of such overwhelming shocks, comfortable certaintiesquickly broke down. Whether it was a car passenger screaming in terror, a personhaunted by nightmares from an apparent abduction, a disillusioned citizen wholearned that her government was indifferent to her unexplained encounter, orsimply the lasting shock to a witness from something that was supposed to beimpossible, the UFO phenomenon forced people to pick up the pieces of theirshattered worldviews.Unfortunately, they were usually constrained to do so privately. No matter howdramatic their experience or disturbing the aftermath, disbelief and ridiculeaccompanied anyone indiscreet enough to talk about their experience in public,often with negative professional repercussions. So it was that ordinary peoplewho had undergone the most incredible and sometimes traumatic event of theirlives were left to cope in the most unsatisfactory, atomized, way possible.That the major institutions of society have not fought for the truth on thismatter seems at first baffling. However, if one considers the awesome nature ofthe phenomenon itself, the transformative power inherent in the knowledge ofsomething so vastly different, and the probable disruption to establishedinstitutions that would occur in the event of its disclosure, perhaps it is notso surprising, after all. On the contrary, it is easy to see how exceptionalmeasures would be deemed necessary to deal with it. In a relatively open,republican system of government, it posed a serious problem. A way had to befound to keep the system alive while creating another, increasingly separate,system that would be empowered to deal with the extraordinary intrusion of“others” into our world. This would be especially so if human authoritiesdetermined the “others” were manipulating global geopolitics for their ownnon-human agendas, a possibility that any responsible government would need toinvestigate.In such a circumstance, only one of two things can happen. The President, orsome other legally constituted authority, would make a statement informing theworld of the reality of UFOs and “aliens.” The world would then go through itsobligatory baptism by fire. Various governments would need to explain not onlythe whys of UFO secrecy, but the hows . This would undoubtedly get into mattersof the construction and funding of the black budget, and very likely would leadinto areas in which citizens might wish to engage in legal actions of all sorts.The implications for the petroleum, steel, and electronics industries could wellbe catastrophic, assuming that better versions of each are inherent in the UFOmatrix of reality. No doubt many other major industries would be similarlyaffected. Thus, the short-term repercussions would be a problem of the greatestmagnitude.The other scenario would be an ever-deepening code of silence. If it weredecided that the post-disclosure ride would be too rough, the outcome toouncertain, then absolute secrecy would have to be maintained. But how? In aworld in which free inquiry ostensibly reigns, where thousands of majoruniversities, newspapers, and news media outlets compete to inform the generalpublic, could long-term secrecy be possible? The answer is that it could be, ifthe right relationships were established with leading academic and mediasources. Key figures within those industries would serve as the sheep dogs,charged with keeping the rest of the herd together. Meanwhile, with virtuallylimitless black budgets and little meaningful oversight, the secret surroundingUFOs could go deeper and deeper, developing into a strict policy of denial onall ET-related matters in the interest of national security. Lies could evenbecome operational priorities, while truth becomes a threat.It looks as though the UFO secret involved more than mere knowledge of thepresence of aliens of some sort. During the 1970s and 1980s, researchers made astrong case that alien artifacts were recovered and studied by the U.S.military. Conceding that such exotic technology would be vastly ahead ofanything developed by human civilization, how long would it take before someclever team of humans scientists developed major new insights that mighttransform existing technologies, or even create new fields of study altogether?It is not evident that all black world developments would eventually becomepublic. On the contrary, it is entirely feasible that some breakthroughs wouldin turn lead to other breakthroughs, and so on in the manner very typical ofscience, in which successes build upon each other with ever greater speed andeffectiveness.Thus, there exists the possibility of what I have come to call a “breakawaycivilization.” This would entail a situation in which black world science andtechnology has reached a sufficient level beyond the “official” world, in whichits foundational areas of knowledge are so different (understanding ofnon-terrestrial intelligences, spacetime, dimensionality, etc.), that it canfairly be called a separate civilization. Throughout human history, multiplecivilizations often existed simultaneously, possessing disparate levels oftechnology and operating on vastly different assumptions of the world. There isno inherent reason to doubt that something like this can happen again – or hasalready happened.Indeed, the 1988 demonstration of the “Alien Reproduction Vehicle” (ARV) pointsto the existence of such a major breakthrough. Supporting this even further isthe complete absence, even two decades later, of anything like the ARV in thearsenal of the U.S. military. The object was reportedly described as having goneinto space on many occasions, and even to have explored the solar system. Theperson who carefully observed it and described it to friends noted that itlooked as though it had been in service for a long time. This would indicatethat the mission of the ARV had nothing at all to do with U.S. militarymandates, at least not in any conventional geopolitical sense. Just as clearly,its mission would logically have something to do with the presence of non-humanintelligences. It would be, in effect, humanity’s homemade “UFO” designed todeal with extraterrestrials. In such a situation, the ARV would never bedeployed to wars among Earth’s nations. Its off-world mission would be tooimportant to compromise by sending it off to fight in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq,or elsewhere.In all likelihood, secrecy relating to UFOs was a logical course of actioninitially that became an addiction the longer it continued. The longer it wasmaintained, the harder it was to reveal, and the greater the gap betweenofficial and black-world societies. One might therefore think that this secrecy,which continues to this day, is bound to last indefinitely.Such a conclusion would be logical and perhaps even seem to be inevitable. Yetit would be wrong. Under normal circumstances, it is true that perpetual secrecywould be the desired outcome by elites in relation to UFOs. By the end of theCold War, such circumstances still applied, despite the confusion created by thecollapse of the Soviet Union. This is because even then, although the world’sinfrastructure showed signs of strain, it remained in place. Energy remainedsufficient to meet humanity’s growing needs, adequate supplies of fresh waterwere declining but still available for much of the world, ecosystem degradationwas severe but not yet at a universally widespread point of crisis. Well intothe 21st century, however, it is now evident that the path on which humanity hasbeen traveling cannot continue much longer.Consider something as basic as human population. In 1900, it was still less thantwo billion people. It took sixty more years to reach the total of threebillion. Then, within the next thirty years, two billion more had been added, sothat by 1990 more than five billion people were living on planet Earth. Now,less than twenty years later, the world is fast approaching a total of sevenbillion. All these people need more than simply a place to live. They needresources, and here is the problem. Without new sources of energy, ways ofobtaining more fresh water, and a halt to the rapid degradation of the globalecosystem, a crisis of unprecedented dimensions threatens the human race.Already it has become a breeding ground for political and financial crisis, asad fact of life in the early 21st century.Humanity’s situation, then, is most surely not business as usual. If itcontinues to worsen, the matter of unexplained advanced technologies beingoperated by unknown agencies could well become a final, unavoidable avenue toexplore as a way of getting out. It would not come without a heavy price, and itis for this reason that those ‘in the know’ will surely wait until the eleventhhour, when no other options are available, before they move ahead with anythinglike a “disclosure.” It may well be that revelations on this matter will notcome from official pronouncements anyway, but perhaps from a major, public eventthat, for some reason or another, cannot any longer be denied. The world was notat that place by 1991, but it may well be there soon.Still, the path toward understanding the UFO phenomenon – and its associatedcover-up – took major strides during the period under review. I subtitled thisbook, “The Cover-up Exposed” because it was during the 1970s and 1980s that theUFO cover-up was shown to have existed beyond any reasonable doubt. Prior to theage of FOIA, government denials about UFOs could not as easily be refuted.Undoubtedly, good research had been done in the 1950s and 1960s thatdemonstrated the UFO reality and the likelihood of a cover-up. But it was onlyafter thousands of pages of government documents were released under the Freedomof Information Act that researchers could prove with an overwhelming avalancheof data that military and intelligence agencies had taken the matter withextreme consideration and care. UFOs were proven to be serious business,regardless of their ultimate origin.The cover-up was exposed still further by the growing number of leaks that beganto occur during the late 1970s. Some were more persuasive than others, but allpointed to the existence of UFO crash retrievals and the existence of aback-engineering program. By 1980, it looked as though luck might favor thoseresearchers seeking to end the cover-up. Although this did not occur, it isstill true that many aspects of UFO secrecy were attacked and revealed duringthe 1970s and 1980s. Despite the arguments, controversies, and evendisinformation that pervaded the field at times, progress was made.As the world transformed, so did ufology. The advent of the Internet immediatelyand profoundly changed the nature of research into this subject. Manyresearchers were not happy with these changes, but the wide-open nature of theinformation highway brought many new opportunities to share data and ideas. Italso made implementing the cover-up more problematic, at least until bettercontrol over it could be achieved by political and corporate elites. This is astruggle that continues to the present day, the final outcome of which has yetto be determined.Perhaps the most important development of the period under review is how ufologyturned its attention to the aliens themselves. It was one thing to studyspecific UFO sightings in an attempt to find patterns and understand thetechnologies involved. But what happened during the 1970s was the beginning ofthe first focused attempt by the human race to understand the beings behind thephenomenon, while making proper exception of course for those black-world peopleand groups who had (probably) already been trying to do this secretly. It wasthe moment in which the object of study – that is, humanity – attempted to turnthe situation around and understand just who or what was studying it. The momentwas a significant one not simply in the history of ufology, but of humanconsciousness. Such efforts were only the beginning, of course, and years latermuch still needs to be done.Understanding the intelligences behind the UFO phenomenon remains the greatchallenge of the subject. Developing the necessary insight will require a changenot simply to our social, economic, and political world, but to ourconsciousness itself. Whoever and whatever these beings are, they appear toexist and act in ways that most humans are not prepared or able to match. In aworld in which billions go hungry, and billions more spend their waking hours inrepetitive jobs, mindlessly surfing the Internet, playing video games, orwatching the television, it is safe to say that most people are not ready todeal with the existence of an alien race that may be of exceptionalintelligence, and may well be telepathic – if numerous claims of abductees andexperiencers are to be believed. Nor of an alien race that surely has an agendaof some sort.But ‘not being ready’ has never yet prevented something from happening. The paceof history will force change to arrive soon enough. People will not be ready andthe shock will be great, but the opportunities will be vast. People, beingpeople, will learn to cope and thrive. All the efforts of those keeping thismatter secret will be in vain, for the end of secrecy will come as a terribleswift sword. Destiny will not be denied.

In 2000, he published UFOs and the National Security State: An UnclassifiedHistory, Volume One: 1941-1973 (republished two years later as UFOs and theNational Security State: Chronology of a Cover-up, 1941-1973 ). That 500-pagehistory provided detail not only about the major UFO cases of the early Cold Warera, but the attitudes and policies toward UFOs by the military and intelligencecommunity, as well as the fascinating development of the citizen movements toend UFO secrecy. Richard has written many articles and spoken at conferences around the world onthese and related themes. He has also done a great deal of television work,having appeared on many documentaries for the History Channel, Sci Fi Channel,BBC, and elsewhere. In 2006 he was host to a six-episode series for the Sci FiChannel, called SciFi Investigates . With the completion of Volume Two of his historical study, Richard is writing athird volume which will take the history of the UFO reality and cover-up to thepresent day.

On the Internet, the reader is directed to thebalanced description in Wikipedia, athttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Walton. In addition, Jerome Clark’s accountin The UFO Book , p. 627-653, is possibly the best sympathetic description ofthe case. The primary skeptical accounts are Philip J. Klass, “The Travis WaltonAbduction,” The MUFON UFO Journal , July and August 1976; Philip J. Klass, UFOs:The Public Deceived (Prometheus Books, 1983); and “The Klass Files” in TheSkeptics UFO Newsletter , available athttp://www.csicop.org/klassfiles/SUN-50.html. Robert Schaeffer’s The UFOVerdict: Examining the Evidence (Prometheus Books, 1986, p. 19-20) also offers abrief description of the Walton case from the skeptical viewpoint. Travis Waltontells his own story in Fire in the Sky: The Walton Experience (Marlowe andCompany, 1996).

A fifth sphere was found six years laternear Eiffelton, New Zealand. Probably from Soviet Cosmos 482, launched 31 March1972, part of which reentered 2 April 1972.” Thus, there is only mention of oneof the spheres from 1978. Moreover, the U.S. DoD estimate was that at least oneof the objects was determined to have fallen recently.ccclxxxix [The_Cover-Up_Exposed%2c_1973-1991_split_003.html#filepos591052]Basterfield, Keith, “New Zealand Radar-Visual and Film Cases,” MUFON UFO Journal, 11-12/78; Maccabee, Bruce, “New Zealand Film Report: II,” MUFON UFO Journal ,6/79; Bowen, Charles, “Spanners in the Works,” Flying Saucer Review , v24, n5,3/79; “Round-Up Item: N.Z.

An earlier sighting was said tohave occurred during Reagan’s Hollywood years, presumably the 1950s or 1960s. Asthe story goes, Ron and Nancy showed up a half hour late for a dinner party withsome friends. They arrived very upset and said they had seen a UFO coming downfrom the coast. According to one version of the story, as told to the author byan anonymous friend of former President Reagan, they said the craft had in factlanded on the road ahead of them. Of course, Reagan’s several explicitreferences to aliens during his Presidency is well known.

In 1895, for instance, when a greatfinancial panic gripped the U.S. and the Federal Treasury was nearly out ofgold, President Grover Cleveland allowed financier J.P. Morgan to create aprivate American and European syndicate to supply the U.S. Treasury with $65million in gold, floating a bond issue that restored the treasury surplus.
