Many who are currently on Earth have always fe lt as if they did not really belong here. Maybe you, too, have always felt \"different\" and wondered why you were here. Many have had trouble accepting Earth traditions, religions and beliefs, even in childhood. This leads to a life long search for many; reading books, s eeking answers to questions, and trying to understand the feelings they have within. Ev en though many have had a deep innate knowing that things were not “right” on Eart h, and that there was much more than was taught in standard Earth teachings, it has been difficult to find these answers. What is the “more” that I seek? Why do I feel so different, so out of place? Many have been drawn to teachings of reincarnation, spiritualism, as trology, numerology, channeled teachings and psychic “readings” in their search. While some questions have been answered by these, for many there is a frustration or lack of ability to “put it all together” in a way that feels right. In the current time period, new information is being made available on the planet. This is due to the approach of planetary transf ormation or ascension, and the need to prepare for this by the raising of planetary and person al frequency. This is done through acquiring and spreading knowledge, self empowerment, and self understanding. In these ways, spiritual growth and development can occur on a wide spread level. Creating planetary ascension through the development of each wh o chooses a pathway of spiritual growth and development is the primary goal of Family of Light. This is to be done through self development, creating awareness, activating abilitie s, and learning to actively use the spirit connection within each of you. One of the most accurate tools for self und erstanding is Planetary Origin. All beings first experienced physical life somewhere. By understanding yourself and your planet of origin, you gain not only a deeper level of se lf understanding, but also a deeper sense of spiritual connectedness. A deeper realizatio n of who you are, where you are from, and a knowledge that you have been in many other re alities before coming to Earth, and will visit many other realities after leaving Earth reality. Who you are in this lifetime on Earth is only a small part of who you are as an overall being. Originally, all were a part of the God Force, or Prime Creator, and were created in large groups of souls. Each group was composed of souls who were very close in frequency. These groups were called oversouls. Within this group, or oversoul, those who were the closest to you (or most like in energy) could be called twin flames. The ones who were next closest could be called soul mates. Those who would be called soul mates, or twin flames, would therefore be of the same planetary origin. When each soul was created it was very po werful, as it was fully connected to the God Force. As these oversouls began to desire ex pansion and growth, they chose to experiment with and develop their abilities of creation. Th is was done originally simply by thinking and intending, using the combined energies of thos e of the oversouls. Many currently refer to these groups as creator gods or co-creators. Th ese groups of souls or cre ator gods stayed close"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 2 to those who were of like energy, and chose to work together to develop their creation abilities. As they did this, they moved furthe r away from the God Force, or Prime Creator, and began to develop individual abilities. After a period, they began to create physical realities: universes, planets, and then life forms upon the planets. This was done as Pr ime Creator intended and according to his plan and desire. There were twelve universes created in all. Each universe was created under the guidance of the God Force and with his help. Each universe has its own plan and design, and each was somewhat different. The universe in which you reside is a fr ee will universe. This was the fourth universe to be created. Being a free will universe means all experiences are allowed and all have free will. All experience and knowledge gained by ea ch soul created, in all universes, is returned to the God Force, eventually. The God Force le arns and grows through the experiences of all creation. There is no judgment of any experi ence, as learning and growth occur through all types and varieties of experience. The first physical planets of this universe were created with life forms by these oversouls or creator gods. There were twelve planets or groups of planets in the beginning. These were the first planets upon which all experi enced physical life, as the individual spirits which composed the oversouls physically inca rnated first upon the planets which were created by the oversouls from which they came . Many of you were among those who helped to create these original twelve planets. Your planet of origin is the planet on which you first experienced physical life. Those of you on Earth can benefit from understanding your planetary origin and heritage. This is like the \"blueprint\" of the soul. The energy of th e planet of origin remains constant through all following lifetimes and experiences, and d oes not change. Some of you, through your history of physical incarnations and experience s, acquired what could be called a secondary planetary origin. This occurs when an indivi dual spirit incarnates numerous times on a planet, or group of planets, other than its plan et of origin. This is often done due to one’s developing a fondness for certain planetary rea lities, or changes which may occur within a spirit through its growth and development. Knowing your planet of origin he lps you understand yourself, your personality, habits, and relationships. As you learn to understand yourself, you learn to love and appreciate yourself. This opens you to be mo re able to learn to understand others and allow yourself to interact with others with pure in tent rather than self interest as you release expectations based on personal need. Understa nding brings in light, light is knowledge and knowledge allows the flow of unconditional love . Operating from unconditional love allows one to flow freely in universal energy. This is not astrology. Astrology and ot her Earth tools change with each lifetime. The planetary origin is something which remains wi th you throughout each lifetime. In various lifetimes, the spirit essence chooses various role s and scenarios to experience. Although the spirit essence is the same, the different roles, lives, and situations create varied personalities and areas of growth. The variety of factors chosen for each lifetime, such as time and date of birth, sex, the parents who are chosen, and the geographic location one chooses to experience, all work to create the different learning scenarios which are desired for growth. By understanding where one is from, or the planetary origin of the spirit, you learn of the energy you bring to this rea lity. You can begin to understand one another and use this to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"   3 learn to work together. It is a tool to help with understanding your reactions and emotional responses to one another and can help you learn to work with the energies of others, instead of attempting to force them to be molded into your view of reality. You should realize that the qualities expr essed on Earth by one originating on other planets are not what all are like on that planet , but simply what is manifested in the Earth density when one from that planetary origin incarnates into Earth reality. Understanding the qualities which manifest on Earth, in those of various planetary origins, will be very useful. Relationships can be understood more thoroughly when one works with knowledge of the various energies and personalities which manifest on the Earth plane. Know at all times that regardless of wher e you originate from or where you currently are, all are equally important and equally loved. All originate from the God Source, will eventually return to the God Source, and ha ve the power of the God Source within. We support you in Light and Love We are the Teachers of the Universal Mind Through Jo Amidon "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 4 Chapter One A Brief History of Creation There are many names for the God Force. Th is force is known by all beings on all planets, by one name or another. The name by which you refer to the God Force is not important. In this message, we will refer to it as the God Force or Prime Creator. The God Force is not of a sex or gender, but is all. All physical beings are part of the God Force. There are simply various degrees of awareness of the connection. In the beginning there was only Prime Creato r. Prime Creator was ever knowing, ever growing, expanding, always changing, questioning, thinking and being. At some point, Prime Creator began to think heavily upon one thought. Prime Creator had always existed. There was no remembered beginning, and no end to th e existence of Prime Creator. Questioning induces growth and change, and Prime Crea tor began to question his existence and beginning. This led to a decision to expand furt her to enhance growth and learning potential. To best do this, Prime Creator decided to divide into many parts. Ea ch part would remain connected to Prime Creator. Each part would have full communication with Prime Creator. At the same time, each new part would have fu ll freedom to grow and explore whatever path was attractive to it. This would allow Prime Cr eator to grow and learn at a more rapid pace, because each part would be separate, yet one. The experiences and knowledge gained by each part would in time come back to Prime Creator, when that part had completed a ll it desired to learn and experience. Each part would be called an oversoul. As each was a part of the God Force, it would have ability and power to create, as long as it kept its connection with the God Force. Prime Creator began the separation of parts of himself, lovingly and joyfully. There were great expectations, and excitement at th e variety of knowledge and experiences which could be available! New parts were formed fr om all areas of Prime Creator, as there were many variations of activity, questioning, and types of energy within Prime Creator. Those first created were group energies, or large ener gy portions called oversouls. There were many oversouls. Each would eventually develop into a number of individual spirits, or souls which were like in energy, interest, and being. The pa rts, or individual spirits, which were created of energy closest to one other were of course th e most alike, even within the oversoul. The oversoul groups tended to be composed of indi vidual spirits who were similar in what they desired to learn, and how they wanted to go about learning. At first, the oversouls simply were. They learned that they were capable of independent thought, of communicating with Prime Creator, and with each other within th e oversoul, and with other oversouls. They began to realize that they were capable of mo vement and change. They realized that they could create thought forms and experiment with them and that was one method of learning. Prime Creator decided to create physical lif e, and physical forms, to allow new levels of experience and growth for all parts of the God Force energy. It was decided that twelve universes would be created. These would be created with intent for the oversouls to go to these to learn, grow, and gain many experien ces. Each Universe would have a special"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 5 emphasis, to create a certain type of knowledge. The oversouls would be free to go to the Universe that most appealed to them, and there they could work together to create whatever physical forms appealed to them. They could learn and experience all that they wished. Each Universe would exist until each oversoul or individual spirit portion of each oversoul had learned and experienced all it wished to learn in that universe. When all knowledge was experienced and compl eted by all in that universe, it would return to Prime Creator. Prime Creator would then possess all knowledge contained within that universe. Twelve Universes were created by Prime Creator. At the point in “time” where you currently exist, one universe has compl eted and returned to Prime Creator. This could be considered the first Universe, as the first created was the first completed. The Universe we will now focus on is the one that you live in, which will be called the fourth Universe. This is a free will Universe. This means that all is allowed. In a free will Universe, there is no judgment, no good, no bad ...all is experience, all is learning. There were no rules or restrictions placed upon those in that universe by Prime Creator. There would be no control or judgment of choices or decision s made by them as to areas of growth or experience desired. As oversouls were drawn to the Universe s which had most interest for them, many oversouls found themselves being drawn to th e same areas in the same universes. They decided to work together and learn to create to gether. This is how many of the planets and star systems in your universe were formed. With the help of Prime Creator, and his blessing, many planets were formed. On these planets, many different life forms were then created. As the oversouls learned to create, severa l things began to happen. The oversouls began to act, think and exist more as individu al energies within the group energy than as group energy. Portions of these oversouls, indi vidual spirits, began to think of themselves very highly...not as a part of Prime Creator, but as superior to Prime Creator. Some were excessively proud of the abilities to create and a llowed themselves to lose the realization that all power comes from the connection with Prime Creator. These began to separate from the oversouls, and become individual beings. They began to drift away from the connection with Prime Creator. Some consciously decided that they could learn more alone, without the connection to the oversoul. These became individual spirits and found themselves changing as they lost the connection with Prime Creator. They no long er had the abilities to create life as they had before. They began to forget the abilities they once had and gravitated to planets they had created, or helped to create. Many of them t ook up residence in some of the life forms which they had helped to create on these planets. As life forms were created on many di fferent planets, many oversouls began to experiment with physical life themselves. This required a separation of energies into separate spirit energies, to allow each the oppo rtunity to experience physical realities. In time they came to consider themselves more the “physical” self than the spirit self. This was all allowed and encouraged, as all is growth an d experience. Others of the oversouls stayed close to Prime Creator and continued to create beautiful planets and life forms of very high frequency. Thus, there were a great variety of planets and life forms of many types created in time. The majority of oversouls, at some point in their development, chose to experiment and learn from physical life and all that could be learned through physical life."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 6 As many planets and galaxies in your Un iverse were created, Prime Creator watched the creation and the development of the oversouls. It was evident that much experience and growth was occurring rapidly through physical experience. With this knowledge, it was decided to begin a special project. A group of oversouls were selected from all areas of the universe. Representatives of each of these overso uls were called to help with this project, if separation into individual spirit portions ha d occurred, but the connection to Prime Creator maintained. For those oversouls that had not yet separated, and were chosen to help with the project, that entire oversoul energy was calle d upon. From these selected energies, Prime Creator asked for the creation of a very special pl anet. This planet was to be of great beauty and variety. Samples of the DNA of life forms that had been created on each planet in the entire universe were to be brought to this plan et to create similar life forms. These life forms would all exist on the one planet. The planet was to be called Terra; although later it became Earth. It was to be a happy place where oversouls, spirits from this universe and other universes could visit. It was to be similar to what you now know as a lib rary. A living Library. A spirit could visit the planet, watch the life forms, choose one to experience, and enter the physical form. The experience could be as long or as short as desi red. When the life form had been experienced, another could be chosen to experience. Thus, you could experience being a frog, a cat, an elephant or a tree, and see what the reality is like for each. At any time you would be free to leave, and to return at any time. Human forms were designed to be caretakers of the planet. They were also to be used by spirits, to allow that form to be experienced briefly. A special type of ego, which would be responsible for the physical function and life “support” of the human form was created. The ego was to be responsible for ta king care of the human form and care of the planet, when the form was not in use by a visiting spirit. Wh en being visited by a spirit, the ego was to continue body maintenance, yet allow the spir it to control all else. All life forms were planned to be peacefully coexistent. All did not go exactly as planned. Many oversouls and visitors became very enamored of physical life on this planet, the wide variet y of physical forms available for experience, and the variety of physical terrain and environments available in different areas of the planet. They began to forget that they could leave the ph ysical forms, or to choose not to leave. More began to stay in the forms, especially the hum an forms, which were very well liked. Many began to forget their connection to the Go d Force, and began to consider themselves Eartheans. There were other unplanned for considerations . Due to the large variety of life forms and creation that had occurred on the planet, there was a large amount of freely available creation energy, or universal life-force. Therefor e, it became a very popular place for many “visitors” to come to work with and develop thei r skills of creation. Many of the original life forms were altered and changed dramatically, not only physically; the energies they had been originally given to allow them to peacefully coexist were also changed by experimenting visitors. When created, Terra was ninth dimensional, of higher frequency than many planets in the universe. This was due to the original inte nt for the planet to remain a pure center of learning, to be shared by all. All physical form s were created to be eternal, with no life cycle needed, due to their original purpose. As ch anges occurred with life forms, such as spirit"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 7 attachment to the forms, and their sequential lack of willingness to leave the planet, the frequency of the planet was lowered. The plan for the planet was altered according to need. This meant that a decision was made to allow th is to be a planet for physical life experience and life cycle experience. The name was changed from Terra to Earth, and frequency was lowered to a sixth dimensional level. Over time , as a result of many changes which followed, it eventually was lowered to a third dimensional level. Many other changes were added at the time of the first lowering of frequency. The addition of a life cycle and cycle of reincarnatio n was made to allow for greater experience. It was felt that greater growth would occur thro ugh the reincarnation cycle already being used on other planets of the universe. It was felt th at through this cycle, there would be a greater likelihood of eventual reconnection to the God Force, and it would also allow greater opportunities for others to partake of the experi ences available on Earth. Sleep, the need for food intake for survival, the creation of male and female gender, reproduction through sexual intercourse, childbirth, and the death experience were among the additions. The creation of higher selves, addition of spiritual guides, and adding of the use of multidimensionality also occurred then for thos e who had not previously developed in these ways. Those who had previously experienced physical life on other planets had already begun to work with higher selves, spiritual guides, and multidimensionality. There were many who had not began to experience on this level; for those these additions were made. After these changes, a large number of beings from other planets began coming to Earth to form settlements. The majority came for research and exploration of creation abilities, or for learning about the developing Eartheans. Some came to have the opportunity to influence and affect the development of the new planet Earth. This continued for much of Earth’s history. The adding of these outside energies, genetic structures and changes which these added influences brought, and the wide variety of planetary teachings and cultures which would then affect Earth and the beings that lived upon her, changed much. The original plans were allowed to be altered, and the planet was watched to see what developments would occur through allowing free will exploration of all involved. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 8 Chapter Two ANDROMEDA Personality Characteristics Those who originate on the planets of Andr omeda seek freedom. This is a deep inner desire and thirst which leads them to search during their lives. Many Andromedans change homes, jobs and sometimes relationships in thei r attempts to find freedom. At some point, they realize that the feelings of being “trapped” which they often have are a result of being in third dimensional reality, and may not be due to the actual home, relationship or career they find themselves in. The true freedom they seek comes only from within . This is found by developing self love and the spiritual inne r self. The mature Andromedan has realized this, and works with this knowledge to create a reality which allows these needs to be honored, while allowing continued growth in all areas. Andromedans must work with issues of self love and confidence. These areas may be obvious in their need for development, or they may be disguised. When self love and self confidence are developed, freedom will be fo und within.....where it has always been, if the trust and faith in oneself were present which wo uld allow them to see it. As the Andromedan develops spiritually and learns to be strong in self love and confidence, the connection between self and God becomes strong. This allo ws past life memory to flow freely and many old talents begin to awaken to be again used. Many Andromedans discover they have much to offer others on a spiritual path and become known as teachers and healers. Much of this comes from finding the freedom within, from which all else flows. Andromedans should seek to be in career or relationship situations where they are respected, allowed the freedom to be themselves , and use their many talents. They love to travel and thrive on experiencing the many vari eties of life and reality available on Earth. There are early desires to visit past life homes. This is expressed as interest in traveling and visiting certain areas, for no seeming reason. There may be a fondness for speed, such as driving fast, or enjoying flying in airplanes, as this tends to bring fond memories of “home”, although these would be subconscious in most. Andromedans tend to create dramatic learning situations and scenarios for themselves. This is due to their tendency to be self critica l and not take themselves seriously. This may cause them to disregard smaller growth or learning opportunities, and create a need of attracting more dramatic situations to le arn from. As Andromedans mature, they may recognize this pattern, and end the need for such drama by beginning to notice, and take seriously the smaller hints at approaching growth opportunities. This allows them to react quickly, deal with situations, take responsibility as needed and offset any probable development of drama. Andromedans often have healing and communi cation abilities which are felt early in childhood. These may be ignored or discoura ged by family members and must later be retrieved. Andromedans are sensitive, cari ng individuals who have much compassion and ability to put themselves in someone else’s posi tion and truly sympathize. There is often a"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 9 desire to work with healing the physical or em otional pains of mankind and to ease the pain of others. The Andromedan tendency to be self critica l often leads them to expect others to be critical of them. They are often surprised at finding how well they are liked! Many Andromedans are outwardly confident, capable and outgoing. They are commonly very developed in their abilities to communicate well with others. They may be well suited for teaching, health care, or careers which include travel. Many may learn to combine the attraction to drama with writing or acting and express themselves in these ways. As children, Andromedans should be allowe d freedom to explore individual interests and abilities. Past life memories should be enco uraged. If this is done, Andromedan children may lead others to many fascinating learning experiences through their flair for making learning fun, when allowed freedom. They ar e very imaginative, and quite talented at combining learning with “make believe”. Many times, what may be thought to be “make believe” is simply memories of other realities and other lives. These children have strong leadership abilities, if given encouragement an d positive reinforcement during their periods of self doubt and questioning. If they are ex posed to heavy criticism and control, they may develop very poor self esteem and block much of their natural curiosity and fascination with learning. They may retreat into inner worlds of imagination, and on the surface appear to be very quiet and withdrawn. As parents, Andromedans who focus on remembering themselves as children and recreating the ability to combine learning and imagination will find parenthood to be a shared adventure with their children. It is i mportant, however, to allow the children freedom to be the guiding forces in choosing the areas of focus, rather than falling into Andromedan patterns of wishing to be the lead er. It is also important to avoid the tendency to be critical and expect of children what you have expected of yourself. Allow them freedom to develop themselves as individuals, and honor their uniqu e desires and needs. View parenthood as an opportunity to recreate your own childhood in a more positive way, and create strong healing experiences for both parent and child. A History of Andromeda and Earth In the early history of Earth, several grou ps of beings from various planets of the Andromedan group came to Earth to colonize. There was great interest in the opportunity to work with creation abilities on Earth, and the wide variety of life forms on the planet. The first colonizers settled on a Pacific Is land, where there were no Eartheans, but in time they began to venture out to nearby islands which were inhabited by Eartheans. Many of the Pacific island cultures have legends bas ed upon the Andromedans. Later colonizers settled areas of west and south Africa. The Andromedans were fascinated with bird life forms. This was likely due to the many flyi ng beings, including winged horses, upon the planets of Andromeda. Many of the brightly colored, tropical birds resulted from their creation experiments and attempts. They loved addi ng bright colors to plain earth birds, and developed methods of communicating with thes e birds. Andromedans enjoyed experimenting with and altering life forms which had alread y been created upon Earth. Many animals whose DNA originated on other planets was mi xed with Andromeda DNA to create new and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 10 different life forms. Some of th ese are present only on Earth, due to this mixing of DNA, and alterations which occurred only on Earth. Certain legends were formed when Andromedans chose to begin to develop relationships and to interbreed with humans. Mates were chosen for desired qualities such as physical strength, youth, humor, and curios ity, as well as future compatibility. Often those who were chosen were willing and eager. Others around them did not understand and often were afraid for them, and feared that they were being taken by force or through coercion. The Andromedans traveled from island to island by their ship s, which they kept on Earth for a long period. Their arrivals and de partures were often witnessed by Eartheans. Many interpreted this as “Gods” arriving an d taking humans, and feared that they had angered the Gods. This began a tradition of o ffering human sacrifice to the Gods, these were taken to the areas where ships were often s een landing, usually in the mountains, near volcanoes or large rock formations. For many years, these were considered to be sacred areas. Many times, when proble ms arose in their villages, they felt these were caused by the Gods, and offered young, attracti ve sacrifices to appease the Gods. These sacrifices were left in these areas, and were usually taken by the Andromedans and cared for, as it would have been considered an insult if they were not taken and would likely have created more fear among the Eartheans. Due to this, the original Andromedan intent to mix peacefully with Eartheans, learn more about them, and work with creation and experimentation was somewhat changed. It was somewhat gratifying to be honored as Go ds, and the situation was allowed to remain without clarification. They did take this hono r seriously, however, and attempt to use this title to teach the Eartheans in simple ways, whenever opportunity allowed. After many years of interbreeding with human s, the black race was created. This was due to the combining of the color of the human form, which was originally quite colorless and the Andromedan form, which was a beautiful glow ing dark brown in males and a dark indigo blue in females. In many of these areas of early coloniza tion there are tales of Gods from the sky coming and taking loved ones, then returnin g them with child. Those who were formed through this interbreeding had added abilities and talents. In many situations they were given special treatment when they returned to the Earthean groups. Many of those created through the interbreeding returned to the Earthean groups to help with creating understanding and clarity among the Eartheans as to the true purpose of the Andromedans. This led to eventual understanding being reache d and a shift to working together on a more equal level. After a long period the Androm edans were themselves changed, and became very much as Eartheans themselves. This wa s due to a combination of interbreeding and becoming more deeply into the illusion of Earth reality. Currently, contacts with Andromedans are ra re. They watch with interest from afar, but do not interfere with free will or attempt to effe ct influence. This is very much due to the determination to avoid any misunderstandings or repeat any of the previous problems with Eartheans. Occasional contacts are made th rough channeling, normally with volunteers who originated on Andromeda or those who have ha d lifetimes on Andromedan planets, or those who are physical descendants of the original settlers from Andromeda.

There is an outer smooth, loving energy...yet they carry an aura of e xcitement or anticipation. They love to travel and find new experiences. If it is not poss ible to travel, they may find other ways to change their views and surroundings, such as moving often, redecorating or finding new and different hobbies and activities to keep life excit ing. There may be a tendency to get bored easily and to dramatize events to create excitement and variety if they feel it is lacking. Apollonians love to learn and add to their many ta lents. There is often interest in taking varied classes and developing many abilities . There is a deep questioning nature to Apollonians that leads them on a search for answers and fulfillment. This may result in a number of careers or interests in a lifetime as the y seek to constantly add to their repertoire of knowledge. They may at times feel somewhat like “sponges” as they soak up many different bits of knowledge. They may appear to ot hers as professional students, or give the appearance of being unable to make up their minds a s to what they wish to do. This is not the case. It is simply that Apollonians do not all ow themselves to be limited to any one role, or definition of who and what they are. Any attemp t by others to limit them, or label them, is very strongly and instantly resisted. This is o ne instance where the normally calm Apollonian will show a dramatic reaction. There ma y be situations where the Apollonian may feel that others are making attempts to limit, restrict or label them....regardless of the truth, if a situation creates this feeling, there w ill be a strong reaction. There is a deep desire to be self sufficient and a void the need to depend on others, financially or emotionally. They may need to remin d themselves at times to enjoy life and take time for pleasure as they tend to be rather se rious. This can be very obvious if they are focused on a pathway of learning or achievement. I t should also be noted that even the rare Apollonians who choose a pathway of pleasure seekin g and play rather than serious learning, are just as deeply and fully focused on t hat pathway.  Many from Apollonia have work to do as Earth heale rs and feel a deep connection to the Earth and her needs. There is an early recognit ion of energy fields, auras, spirit friends or angels which leads them to be drawn to spiritual learning as a means of finding answers and explanations. These abilities of energy use ma y lead them to do healing work at some point in their lives, either with the planet, anima ls, or people. There is often an attraction to children or a desire to help children or those w ho are helpless or in need. This could be as a parent, teacher, counselor, or simply an interest ed friend. There is a strong ability to empathize with others and use that ability to help others to heal and release emotional pain and fears. Ther e is a strong love of beauty and nature. Apollonians often rely on the beauty and peace of n ature to heal themselves and find peace within themselves. There is a strong sense of intu ition and spiritual connectedness. Those from Apollonia may have often considered themselves exotic or taken pleasure in being different."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 16 As children, those from Apollonia may have reacted to the feeling of being different in two ways. If honored by the parents and others imp ortant in their lives, they will normally thrive and develop psychic and energetic abilities at a very early age. They will become avid students who enjoy learning and studying, and do be st in quiet peaceful surrounding during study times. They are likely to develop telepathic abilities easily and may use these abilities to aid them in learning and acquiring kno wledge. If the parents are judgmental, or attempt to restrict and create boundaries for these children, they will likely become very critical themselves, with much unexpressed anger. In this situation there is likely to be open rebellion and defiance as they grow older. Th ey may have invisible playmates that become a source of comfort to them, as their abilit y to see and communicate with other realities can be used in these ways. These may be k ept as ‘secret friends’ if the parents are not open and allowing. As parents, it is important for Apollonians to rea lize first that all children do not have the same thirst for learning, and ability to focus on a pathway as they have had. It is important to allow their children freedom to play, explore Earth reality and simply be children. There may be a tendency to be disappoint ed if children do not have the same abilities which they themselves had as children. T he importance of honoring each individual, and developing the abilities of each se parately, should be understood. Parenthood may also be a time when many old issues which have not been dealt with will arise for Apollonians. It is good to focus on the healing which can be found by playing with children, and the total ability of children to be l oving and accepting of all without judgment. Some Apollonians may have issues surrounding parent hood which will need to be worked through prior to the experience, such as fears that having children will limit their freedom, or limit their ability to learn and explore new are as of knowledge. Often, a decision is reached that will conclude that parenthood will ins tead open new doorways of learning and opportunity for growth which could not otherwise be fully experienced. A History of Apollonia and Earth Apollonia was originally a group of eight planets located near Alpha Centauri. Apollonians were very peace loving, although techni cal, and focused on developing knowledge in many areas. At the time when Earth wa s being colonized by those from other planets, Apollonia was experiencing difficulty with the beings that inhabited Alpha Centauri. This was the nearest group of planets to Apollonia , therefore contact with these beings had been established long before. Attempts at creating good relationships with them had not been successful. Eventually there developed a long period of war between the two groups. Those who lived on Alpha Centauri were cal led the Alphadrons. The Alphadrons were warlike and wanted to control the planets of A pollonia. After a number of attempts by the Alphadrons at taking over the Apollonian planet s, this war was entered into, although the Apollonians deeply disliked any type of physica l violence. This is something which would be entered into only in self defense. During this period of war, which lasted many years , two of the planets of Apollonia were destroyed. This led the Apollonians to make a n agreement with the Alphadrons. The Apollonians would be left in peace upon the largest remaining planet, while the Alphadrons"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"     17 would be given the other planets in return for agre eing to never again interfere with Apollonia. This was agreed to out of the desire to end the existence of fear and hate upon their planets, and to avoid the loss of other plane ts and those who lived upon them. They were allowed to evacuate all Apollonians from the f ive planets which were surrendered to the Alphadrons. Due to these events, one planet of Apollonia remains at this time. Currently, the planet of Apollonia is occupied in layers of dimensional reality. There are layers of 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th dimensional rea lity which occupy the planet independently. In this way, there are no problems with population or living space. This was the focus of development through technology after t he agreement with the Alphadrons, which left them with less “physical” space for the Apollonians to inhabit. During the period of war with Alpha Centauri, several groups from Apo llonia were sent to Earth, along with several other planets, to colonize and ensure the s urvival of their planetary heritage, should the total destruction of Apollonia occur. These were friendly colonists, partially due to t heir awareness that this must become their new home, and the realization that their true home might be destroyed. Apollonians also strongly remembered the manner in which they w ere treated by the Alphadrons and were determined to treat Eartheans with integrity. There were three groups who came to Earth. One co lonized Europe, in the area which is now France. The second colonized North Am erica, in the area which is now Colorado. The third colonized areas of Australia. In the three locations, Apollonians tended to interact with Eartheans out of intent to help an d were willing to share large amounts of knowledge. Much healing knowledge was shared, alon g with knowledge of energy use. They were quite looked up to, honored, and respecte d by the early Eartheans. In time they began to interbreed out of fondness and love for on e another. There are legends referring to their arrival by s hip, as Eartheans witnessed their arrival upon the planet, and shared these tales thr oughout history. Much of the Apollonian technology which was shared with Eartheans revolved around the use of crystals and stones, working with the energies of nature, and communicat ing with the animals of Earth. There are currently a small number of volunteers f rom Apollonia on Earth. This is due to the desire to help the Earth regain its form er frequency and glory. Much of the current contact with those from Apollonia is to ree stablish contact with those who originate from Apollonia. This could either be descendants o f the original settlers (this would refer to being the reincarnated spirit of the original settl ers) or volunteers who came from Apollonia to help Earth. Those from Apollonia are very tall, normally 7 to 8 feet, shades of blue to blue green and have a triangular shaped head (male) or rounded head (female). They communicate telepathically and often work physicall y with those who are contacted, such as with healing and physical rejuvenation. Appollonian DNA Bits of DNA brought to Earth from Apollonia during the period of creation were used to create a number of animal, plant, and stone life forms.

There is a deep inner strength, a knowingness within. On the surfac e, when viewed by others, they appear strong, capable, and powerful. There is often a fee ling from childhood of having an important purpose or mission in life, although ther e is no knowledge of what that might be. There is a feeling of seeking and searching for this mission or purpose, which will lead to spiritual development, if this purpose is to be found. If this purpose or mission is not found, there may be an inner feeling of dissatisfac tion or unhappiness without full understanding of the cause of this. Arcturians are very creative. Many Arcturians are writers, artists, designers or use their abilities to create in other ways. Arcturians are often good public speakers, have a good sense of timing and humor, and are often the \" life of the party.\" They enjoy making others laugh. They are loving and like to travel. They may tend to get bored easily and seek new experiences to avoid boredom. If they do get bored they may create dramas--just to stir things up or create excitement. This can sh ow up in a tendency to create big problems out of little ones, or to drag out situati ons, or dramatize situations to get attention. Arcturians may seem hard to get close to or distan t at times. They may not have many close, intimate personal friends, although the y will have many surface friends, or casual acquaintances. This is because they do not easily share their deepest inner feelings and thoughts. If an Arcturian accepts you as a clos e personal friend, and shares on this personal level, know that you have been carefully c onsidered before being accepted. Arcturians seem to attract people and find that ot hers often come to them and find comfort in telling them their personal problems. Co mplete strangers are drawn to the Arcturian energy, magnetism and charisma. Arcturian s are good advice givers and their aura of being strong within makes it appear to othe rs that they are very strong and complete. With some Arcturians, this may be an imag e they enjoy, and tend to cultivate. Often others are surprised to find that Arcturians have problems and feelings just like everyone else. There is often a wide circle of acqu aintances that depend upon their Arcturian friends for advice and guidance. Althoug h willing to listen and give advice. Arcturians may tend to be impatient with those who they feel are not willing to put forth the needed effort or are not really trying to accom plish what they seek. There is impatience with \"whiners\". Those who seek advice but are not w illing to use the advice may lose their Arcturian mentor when this is realized. Arcturians have much energy, both physical and me ntal. They may jump from one place to another or from one subject to another. Th ey do not like sitting still and being quiet, but need to feel that they are accomplishing something. They tend to be very enthusiastic and optimistic. When this energy is fo cused and used well, there is little that cannot be accomplished. When it is scattered, or wi thout purpose or focus, there will likely"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 21 be many projects begun, with few completed. Due to this energy, Arcturians often have a habit of suddenly ending a discussion or leaving a place quickly. This may give others the impression that something is wrong, or that they ar e angry. This is just the Arcturian energy, and sudden need to do something else to avo id boredom. When an Arcturian feels that something is complete, they see no reason to c ontinue it! This is true whether it is a conversation, a visit with friends, or even a relat ionship. In love relationships, Arcturians are only comfort able if allowed personal freedom within a relationship. They will feel trapped in a relationship that they feel to be restricting or binding. They need time alone, time with friends, and to be able to do this freely and without guilt. Arcturians usually enjoy company of friends of both sexes, and all pathways of life. Those in a relationship with an A rcturian should understand this, to avoid jealousy. There may be a need for reminding t he Arcturian that the freedom they desire must apply to both parties involved. It is important for Arcturians to realize that the treatment they need themselves should also be e xtended to others in their relationships. Arcturians tend to react to situations which stir deep emotions with anger, rather than willingly expressing emotions. Expressing deep emotions is something Arcturians tend to avoid. They normally prefer laughter, and may create humor, arguments or another diversion to avoid open discussions of thei r own emotions. The ability to express emotions openly is something which must be develope d in relationships with an Arcturian, if it is to be lasting and strong. Arcturian children should be worked with to help t hem learn that emotions can be used in a positive manner, and to help them learn p ositive expression of emotions. Parents are the best example of use of emotions, as these c hildren will likely copy parental actions and traits. Arcturian children who do not learn po sitive emotional expression may appear to be overbearing and critical, to the point of app earing as a bully to other children in extreme situations. This would be especially true w hen parents do not give these children the deeply needed appreciation and attention. Arct urian children need attention in large amounts. If it is not received, they will create si tuations to get attention of any kind. Negative attention is better than no attention to t hese children. These children have very high energy levels, and should not be forced into q uiet classroom environments as this will often create problems. Arcturian children need rul es with gentle guidance and enforcement, large amounts of love and encouragemen t, and freedom and encouragement to develop their natural abilities. As parents, Arcturians must work first with slowin g themselves down to give their children the necessary attention! This is at times difficult for those very focused on their own freedom and flexibility. They must learn to loo k beyond the standard and obvious needs of the child, to see the spirit within. When this is done, there will be a strong ability to communicate with the child at an early age on a spirit level. This will strengthen the bonding process, and aid in creating pleasure and e njoyment in daily care. It is good for Arcturian parents to realize that often the best te achers for them are their own children. When they allow themselves freedom to play with the ir children, at the child’s level, Arcturians may find themselves reconnecting with ma ny lost childhood memories and abilities of their own. This will allow much healin g, releasing of old emotions and patterns, and the freedom to create new positive patterns of interacting with others."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 22 A History of Arcturus and Earth Those who originate from Arcturus may often dream of flying and remember being winged, as the original \"bird people\" one hears of in Earth legends were the Arcturians. These were among the first settlers of Earth. Thes e were winged beings, and fascinated Eartheans with their ability to fly. There were ve ry few, however, who actually stayed on Earth for long periods of time. They would instead visit for a number of years, live at the established Arcturian colonies, and then return to Arcturus and allow others to come in their places to visit. There was concern and awaren ess of the likelihood of losing oneself in Earth reality if one was to stay overly long in tha t reality. However, there were a number who chose to stay on Earth for entire lifetimes, an d due to this did indeed become totally Earthean over a number of lives. This was done at t imes by choice, and out of liking for the Earth reality and those who inhabited the planet. Arcturus is a name used for a group of planets. T he majority of these planets are 5th and 6th dimensional in frequency. To the Arctu rians, there is little importance attached to physical appearance. The mind is felt to be much more important than the appearance of the body, which is only temporary any way. Due to this, their body forms often closely resemble one another. Many of the ph ysical life forms on their planets are created for sturdiness, practicality, usefulness, a nd survival benefit rather than for physical beauty. The Arcturians that currently communicate with cer tain Eartheans, primarily through channeled messages, have silvery, gray skin with a shiny appearing skin texture. These are small in stature, usually less than five feet tall. There are currently a number of “walk-ins” or “spi rit transfers” from Arcturus coming to Earth, as well as a sizable amount of cha nneled information being given to Eartheans. This is due to the concern and interest which Arcturians have for Earth. At various points in the history of Earth, groups of A rcturians were involved with those who affected Earth reality in ways which were not posit ive, and led to increased control. This leaves many Arcturians currently feeling a need to help Eartheans recover much of the knowledge and information which has been lost to th em throughout Earth’s history. We would stress that any decision made as to anyone be coming a “walk-in” will be made on a higher self level. This is not something which wou ld be decided on a conscious level, as it would be preplanned before a lifetime. Therefore, if any being should approach anyone with a proposition such as this, we would urge utmo st discernment and care to be taken.

They are very determined and focused in their beliefs, whatever those beliefs may be. It may be very difficult for someone to convince one from Maldeck of the validity of new beliefs, as there are always many questions which must be answered to their comf ort before accepting new possibilities. They often have deep leadership abilities, al though these may be quietly expressed. Those from Maldeck are very intelligent, technical minded and de tail oriented. They are often knowledgeable in a wide variety of areas. They may have several careers or one career with strong interests outside the field th ey chose for career. Th ey seek to understand what is below the surface of people, things, and events. Du e to this, they seldom accept simple explanations or easy answers. Th ey tend to analyze ev ents, experiences and interactions with people and believe there is al ways more than what is apparent on a surface level. Those from Maldeck ar e individuals who usually will know quite a bit about any subject which may be brought up in conversation. Often they are reserved, an d may appear to be distant or hard to approach to those they do not know well. They are very cautious and skeptical about whom and what they trust with their innermost selves. If one is accepted as a friend or in an intimate relationship, they are very loving, honorable and trustworthy companions. They may often be disappointed in relationships as others ma y not return these qual ities equally. They expect from others what they themselves are will ing to give. It is ofte n surprising to others to find such deeply felt belief s, opinions and emotions in one who appears on the surface this quiet and reserved. Only with th ose they trust fully do they open themselves emotionally, but when this trust is present they are very capable of, and en joy sharing themselves on all levels. Maldeckeans have a st rong capability to be supportive and understanding of partners in relationships, providing their partner is eq ually willing to open themselves fully, and discuss all elements of their needs and desires. Once mutual understanding is achieved, there will be a willingness to do whatever is needed to help those they love achieve their goals and dreams. It should be expected and understood that because of the Maldeck questioning, it may take many discussions fo r this to occur. Mald eckeans have a strong loyalty, and have little problem with commitm ent whether it is to a relationship, friendship, career or ideal. They do expect the same in return, and will be quickly disillusioned if it becomes obvious to them that this is not so. Th is would be one of the rare occasions when a Maldeck temper would be seen. Those from Maldeck love challenges, myster ies, and the unknown or unexplainable. They are often fascinated with “magic” and the use of energy to creat e and manifest. They often have an early interest in astronomy, the planets and exploring the universe. They may love tales such as King Arthur and the knights of the round table, Merlin the Magician, and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 27 others of that era. These combin e the qualities of magic with th e loyalty and hono r that is so important to them. As children they will be quietly determined to follow an individual pathway. There will be a strong focus on lear ning, but a trend toward science, logic and technology in the area of interest which is strong est on an individual level. Th ere may be an early attraction for Wicca, or other ol d Earth traditions which focus stro ngly on rituals, ceremonies, and working with Earth energy. Maldeckean children will appear obedient on the surface, while on an inner level there is a de finite independence. These ar e not children who will have temper tantrums, or open rebellion. They will listen, appear to be in agreement or understanding, and then proceed to do what they feel is right for them. They have an early inner guidance, which creates often a strong knowing within of what they should and should not do. It is important to work with Maldec k children early in learning expression of emotions and needs. If this is an area which they are restricted in, or made to feel that sharing of emotions is bad, a strong impact will be made upon their ability to share themselves emotionally when adul thood is reached. Th is is very much due to their innate tendency to honor pare ntal teachings, even if they do not fully agree with them. As parents, it is important for Maldeckeans to practice patience an d tolerance. Due to their strong perfectionism, it is easy to de velop patterns of being critical and overly demanding with others, especially children. It is good to honor each child’s inner being and need to develop in ways which may be very different than what the Maldeckean himself wished to experience or explore as a child. It is also important to avoi d allowing themselves to be hurt and disillusioned wh en their high expectations of others are not met, as often occurs in parenthood. It is best to focus on simply enjoying watching the development and growth of their children, and rememberin g to give love and attention freely. A History of Maldeck and Earth Maldeck is a planet which was on the other side of Mars. It no longer exists, and current remains of the planet are what appear to be an asteroid belt. The problems on Maldeck which led to its eventual destructio n were primarily of control, power, and difficulties within the planet itself. Many originally fr om Maldeck came to Earth as volunteers, while many others ca me to Earth and formed colonies, as a refuge when the end of the planet was approaching. Many also went from Maldeck to live on nearby planets such as Mars, Venus, Neptune, and Ju piter. These were beings of fourth, fifth, and sixth dimensional frequency. The end of the planet was forewarned by dramatic planetary cleansings, which gave opportunity to those who wi shed to leave before the final destruction. In its history, Maldeck was known for the work with what on Ea rth would be called magic; working with and using planetary energy was a strong focus in their reality. Many from other planets went to Maldeck, either thro ugh visitation or by incarnating there, to study and learn more of these ‘arts’ which were taught an d explored on Maldeck. Much of the work with planetary energy involved mani pulation of planetary energy for creation, teleporting, time manipulation, and altering ph ysical forms upon the planet. This eventually resulted in changing and alteri ng the natural state or composit ion of the planet itself. The energy used for these types of work was drawn upon from the planet. This led to weakening of the structure of the planet. This planetar y weakening, combined with the power struggle"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 28 of various groups of Maldeckean s, led to the final destruction of the planet. There were those upon Maldeck who encouraged the type of wo rk which they knew wo uld weaken planetary structure. This was done in thinking that they ha d the capability of repairing and healing the damage when it reached a point where they could gain control of the planet. This was not successful, as their knowledge was not as great as they thought, nor was there willingness by other Maldeckeans to give them control when the point was reached where it was widely aware that planetary destructio n was approaching. Those who came to Earth from Maldeck as settlers brought much of their knowledge of energy manipulation. There were settlements in Europe, in the area which is now Spain, and in the African area which is now Sudan. Many of the Maldeck beliefs, traditions, abilities, rituals, and ‘magical ’ talents were taught to Eartheans in these and other areas over time. Care was taken by the Maldeck settlers to teach and share only those things which were felt to be safe, and which the Earth people were capable of handling. Agreements were made between those coming to Earth from Ma ldeck to take great care in avoiding sharing knowledge which would be harmful to their new environment. Maldeckean DNA Bits of DNA brought to Earth from Maldeck during the pe riod of creation were used to create a number of animal and plant life form s. There were no DNA particles brought from Maldeck to create stones on Earth due to the knowledge of the inner structural weakness of the planet Maldeck. Alth ough it had been created partially through the energy manipulation practiced there, it was not thought to be wise to add to Earth’s planetary structure any DNA that mi ght be ‘weakened’ or likely to be affected in a ha rmful way by any future energy manipulation on Earth.

Orions may be recognized by the many questions they ask! There is a strong drive to seek to understand the reasons and inner meanings of all things. They tend to analyze people and events in their need to understand. This may be frustrating to those around them, as there may be a sensation of be ing scrutinized. This is due to the tendency of most Orions to operate on a mental level, ra ther than a feeling level. This is not due to a lack of feeling; it is simply not the primary manner of the i nner workings of an Orion. Those from Orion want others to respect their opinions and may get into arguments attempting to gain the respect of others and convince others of the validity of their opinions. There is a need to learn to balan ce the drive to understand with gentleness and sensitivity to the needs of others. The mature Orion has learned that in explaining their views and opinions, having them accepted as va lid and considered by others is what they seek, it is not necessary to ha ve others in agreement. Orions have a deep inner thirst for knowledge and may be frustrated with those who do not share this thirst. There is interest in becoming knowledgeable in a wide variety of fields. It will be obvious when conversing with an Orion that ei ther a subject holds great interest for them, and they are quite knowledgeable, or there is no interest at all and they know almost nothing of that area. Although the desire for knowledge and understanding is strong, there is also strong skepticism and difficulty in accepting new beliefs or knowledge without thorough evidence and proof of va lidity. This is due to their mental and intellectual focus, and need to ‘make sense’ of things logically before accepting them. Orions have a tendency to be critical of others, and of themselves. This is because Orions expect and seek perfection. They have a keen eye for details and notice things which others do not. There is a tendency to point out these things to others, especially when they feel there are things in need of attention or correction. This can be upsetting to those not used to the Orion personality, and th ey may take it as personal criticism when this occurs. It is good to realize that Orions are very sensitive to balance, and often feel physically upset or ill in situations where th ey are affected by imbalance. This creates a strong inner desire to correct imbalance when it is sensed. This sensitivity can be to a number of types of imbalance: this can be emot ional imbalance, which is sensed in others or themselves, or an outer physical imbalance. Orions are also very sensitive to their surroundings. They need beauty and a balanced flow of energy in their surroundings to feel their best on all levels. Due to this sensitivity, when imbalance or flaws are noticed, there is a strong need to see these corrected, to allow them to again feel balanced. In relationships and in dealing with emotio ns, those from Orion react to emotions intellectually, and may surprise others by their reactions. The drive to understand is much stronger than the emotional reaction. It is very important for them to understand the reasons behind a situation, to aid in thei r ability to accept and understand. In an"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 31 emotional situation, a typical Orion response is to ask questions, although the quiet Orion may do this within. Orions are often uncomf ortable dealing with emotional situations unless they know those around them well enou gh to feel free to ask the questions within, to seek the inner understanding. Those from Orion have a strong sense of self, need privacy and time alone to recharge, learn and develop the flow within. They often learn best alone or in small groups, and do not feel comfortable in large classroom settings. There is a high energy level, which combined with the questioning na ture, makes Orions intolerant of classroom learning when they feel the teaching is being done improperly, or is not meaningful. Many Orions make excellent teachers, due to thei r ability to see many details, and angles of presenting learning materials which can make learning more interesting for the student. Orions enjoy making others laugh. There is usually a strong sense of humor and desire to tease and play. However others may notice th at the change from being playful to being critical can be very fast, as the Orion mind no tices all details and reacts quickly to much others may not see. There is an early awareness of communication with spirit, and strong development of psychic abilities. As Orions grow on a spiritual pathway, they find their largest challenge to be that of developing higher levels of trust and faith. Th is is due to the many aspects of spirituality which must be accepted simply on faith. Orions are deeply ingrained with the need to question, seek proof, answ ers and affirmation before accepting beliefs. This can create difficulty and a strong inner struggle for many Orions, as they learn to combine the technical mind with the spiritual self. However, it is also for these very reasons that those from Orion have the capability of being important collectors of information and knowledge which can later be shared with others. Orions remember being more powerful than they are on Earth and may have a fascination with those who have great physical strength. They identify with heroes and warriors and thrive on physical activity, particularly outdoor activity. As children, Orions do best in classrooms which allow them freed om to move around, work ‘hands on’ with learning tools, and to be able to choose what they wish to learn. Orion children tend to daydream or rebel at basic textbook learning. They find it boring and routine. They learn best and fastest when they can physically pa rticipate by using learning manipulatives. They flourish when they can see, touch, feel, and move around the elements involved. Then they will enjoy reading the information co ncerning what they ha ve worked with, and will quickly grasp the concepts involved. Orion children are very good at recalling concepts, theories, and information that has been learned in this way. As parents, Orions may need to work wi th their tendency to criticize and give advice. They should remember that although children’s play is a learning method, it should be fun, and allow them freedom to alte r rules and use imagination and fantasy. It may be difficult at times for Orion parents to remember to treat children as children, and have lower expectations for children than for themselves. When this is done, they will enjoy playing and participating in games with their children. They may find themselves sought after as playmates or game organizers by neighborhood children. This is due to their ability, when relaxed, to become childlik e themselves and the pleasure they find in playing outdoors."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 32 A History of Orion and Earth Orion is a group of planets, all of whic h are inhabited. Three of these are large population centers, and are the primary power centers of the Orion group. The others are more sparsely populated. Due to the many pl anets, and large population, there is a wide variety of types of beings on Orion, and much diversity among the beings of Orion. Orion is known as a system of power throughout the Universe. Of those who live there, one portion could perhaps be considered “dark” in nature, with the major portions being considered “light”. Approximately one third of the planets of Orion focus upon scientific development and exploration of known and unknown realitie s. These would be seeking the development and accrual of knowledge above all else. The la rger portion of Orion would be known for its focus upon early and intense education of th eir children, and the ability to combine study with pleasure. They focus strongly upon combining family, education, and research. Orions are known throughout the universe for their playfulness and humor combined with their scientific knowledge and thoroughness to detail. Two groups from Orion were sent to co lonize Earth in the early history of the planet. Of these, one colonized the area which is now Sedona, Arizona, and the other that which is now China. These groups were brough t to Earth by ship, however the ships soon returned to Orion, leaving the groups on Earth to focus on development of colonies, exploration, and work with a number of projec ts. Arrangements were made for others from Orion to return to Earth periodically to view progress, and give aid if necessary. Both groups immediately built homes and began development of the land. There was immediate contact with early Eartheans, on a friendly level. Although the Eartheans were a bit frightened at first, there was soon realization that these were simply “different” beings with many abilities and powers. Their humor was soon appreciated, and aided in their winning acceptance easily. In the area which is now China, Eartheans who were willing to learn were invited to work with the Orions. They were taught much of planting food, and growing food in a pu rposeful way. Before this ti me, most Eartheans simply ate what grew naturally. Although the original intent was to research, understand, and learn about these Eartheans, the Orions found themselves becoming quite involved and attached to the Eartheans. Therefore, inte rbreeding was a natural development and began to occur without the careful planning and resea rch which had been originally a part of the schedule set for their developments on Earth. Over a period of fifty Earth years, the Orions and Eartheans became much closer. The Orions were very respected and became highly revered teachers, not only of planting and food developing, but of spiritual concepts and the need for care and understanding of the food which was grown. Orions taught those in the Eastern area much of their love for plants and many new and different plant forms were developed in their experimentations. Many of the current physical characteristics of the Asian or Oriental races come from interbreeding with the early Orion settlers. Those who colonized the area which is no w Sedona, Arizona, concentrated on the creation and development of energy vortices, and the placement of these to make travel and exploration possible. This was a special area of research which they had been assigned. The original intent was to create an energy form of transportation or portal"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 33 which would make direct travel between Earth and Orion possible. This was not found, although many unplanned for discoveries were made. These were discoveries such as parallel realities and other dimensions of Earth. They found that interaction with these other realities was possible from Earth. These realities were completely different than those that had been worked with on Orion, as they existed in and of Earth energy rather than Orion energy. This led to the development of much knowledge and greater understanding of parallel realities, dimens ional travel, and transportation between realities. While these areas of research were being explored, other Orions were working with DNA research and developing their creation abilities. This was done through experimenting with many Earth life forms, altering them through DNA changes, and working with life forms which had been brought from the planets of Orion to be adapted to Earth. Due to this focus, there are currently many animal and plant life forms which were created through Orion DNA experimentation. As these groups combined with Earthean s, over a period of many years, they became more and more like the Eartheans. They lost many of their original abilities, knowledge, and focus on research and deve lopment. They became more focused on the Earth reality, and the families which had been created with Eartheans. In time, the energy vortexes and portals which had been cre ated came to be considered dangerous. Many relocated to nearby areas to avoid these high energy areas, as the portals were still used by those from other dimensions and realities for travel to Earth. Many of the current contacts with Or ions are with those on Earth as light volunteers, or of Orion origin, or with the cu rrent incarnations of the original settlers’ spirits, many of whom are still in an Earth cy cle of incarnations. Many from Orion have an interest in helping the planet, and they feel much was learned through early Earth colonies. Very few physical sightings or contacts with Orion ships occur. They prefer to communicate through channeled messages, spirit travel or dream co mmunication. Much of these contacts are simply to give guidance, although at times technical information is given. They do not intend to interfere with free will and only contact those who are at a level of spiritual and personal development to choose freely and with knowledge to participate in communication.

They have a deep, abiding desire for peace and happiness for all. If one from Pleia des were asked, “What do you really want out of life?” They would probably say \"to be happy. \" Pleiadeans have pleasant smooth energy which others enjoy being near. They are emotional a nd loving, but tend to repress much due to their desire to please others. They are very sen sitive and react quickly to criticism. They tend to sacrifice personal needs and wants wh ile attempting to please others. This can cause inner resentment. Rather than expres sing resentment or anger openly, Pleiadeans may use passive-aggressive behavior in h opes that their feelings will be noticed and responded to without the need for discussion. T hey must learn to realize that others whom they seek to please would usually prefer to he ar their feelings and needs. Pleiadeans can become physically ill in situations with anger, open tension, or arguments around them, as they absorb emotions of others in an unconscious effort to mediate and smooth situations. The tendency to repress their own emotions, and the emotions absorbed from others can form energy blockages if not released over a period of time. This leads to eventual physical illnesses. A large part of the learning experience for Pleia deans is to learn to allow others to experience what they have chosen, and not become pe rsonally involved. They will learn to be aware of their desire to make others happy, and rea lize that one can only be responsible for one's personal happiness and self development. They must learn to allow others to be responsible for themselves, their growth and learni ng situations. They must learn that they cannot decide when others are happy, or what others need to do to be happy, and instead focus on creating their own happiness. As true res ponsibility is accepted for self and personal happiness, they will flourish and the phys ical body will respond with radiance. Pleiadeans must work to develop communication skil ls on a third dimensional level and to develop self esteem. It is important for th em to reclaim personal power, learn to communicate freely, and become strong within. At t imes, it may appear to others that Pleiadeans are overly reserved and distant. This i s due to their tendency to criticize their thoughts to the point of not sharing them and the s elf esteem problems many Pleiadeans have. Often they feel that their thoughts are not worth sharing, and must work in this area also. Pleiadeans are very strong on faith and trust. Th ey have a strong sense of purpose from childhood, a feeling of knowing that there is a God connection, purpose, and plan even in the darkest hour. There is a deep inner desire to seek spiritual answers and to find the inner connection to the God Force. As they begin t o seek and learn, growth begins. As they begin to realize the God connection and to love the mselves as the perfect beings that all are, many of the old feelings, emotions, and self doubts fade."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 40 As children, most Pleiadeans like having rules and boundaries established. They are most comfortable with a clear understanding of what is expected of them; they will then do their best to accomplish this successfully. It is important to work with these children, teach them the importance of communication, expression, a nd learning to be responsible for themselves rather than others. This includes helpin g them choose areas of learning which interest them, and not others they may desire to pl ease. Pleiadean children often enjoy reading and other such third dimensional pursuits, for the temporary escape they offer. This should be encouraged, but not to the point whe re it becomes their energy focus. Pleiadean children who have not learned self expres sion may develop a pattern of seeking escape from standard reality through whatever means are available. As parents, it is important for Pleiadeans to reme mber to allow their children freedom to develop naturally. This includes allowi ng them to occasionally be hurt, make mistakes, and be wrong. Pleiadeans must remember t hat they cannot learn for their children, nor be responsible for their happiness, b ut must allow their children the learning experiences they need. They are normally very lovi ng, caring parents who deeply enjoy the process of parenthood. They tend to be very involv ed in all areas of their children’s lives, and must work with detaching and allowing the child ren independence as they grow up. Pleiadians release through crying. Due to their t endency to repress emotions, these usually build to a point where releasing must occur . This may result in sudden crying which appears on the surface to be an overreaction to the situation. Instead, this is a reaction or releasing of much more than the current situation. Due to their communication issues, many Pleiadeans experience various types of releasing in the throat chakra. This could be freq uent physical problems or speech difficulty, such as hoarseness or coughing. This wi ll no longer occur when confidence and free communication of emotions, feelings, and needs are learned and used in daily life. A History of Pleiades and Earth Early in the period when Earth was being colonized by many planets, Pleiadeans also came to colonize Earth. Pleiades is a name used fo r a group of planets which are all inhabited. There were three groups who came from a variety of the planets of Pleiades to settle on and work with Earth. Of these three groups, the largest settled in the area which is now Egypt. The two other groups settled in what is currently Greece an d Peru. Pleiadeans overall are a group which takes much pleasure in the beauty and comfort of their surroundings, therefore a large amount of time was spent by the early Pleiade ans in working with animal and plant forms and creating changes in those which were pres ent. This was done with intent of creating a more ‘homelike’ atmosphere. Many new an imal forms were created also using Pleiadean DNA as there was much pleasure found in e stablishing life forms, learning to communicate with these life forms and then sharing and exchanging knowledge. Early Pleiadeans were instrumental in sharing abil ity and knowledge which was used in building many of the early temples and pyra midal structures. They were often looked upon and considered to be ‘Gods’ and figure as such in many tales and myths. A number of Pleiadeans allowed this and enjoyed the t reatment and power which was given to them as gods."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 41 A number of Pleiadeans currently feel somewhat res ponsible for this misleading and allowing of misrepresentation of early Eartheans, a nd therefore feel a strong interest in the current situation of Earth. Although in truth this type of misrepresentation was done by a number of early interplanetary settlers, the Pleiad eans as a group have developed into a very responsible culture that seeks to make amends for past misdeeds. There is currently a wide amount of contact with physical Pleiadeans and Eartheans through primarily channeled information, occasional physical contact, and a large amount of spirit level communication. Pleiadean DNA DNA was brought from Pleiades to Earth to be used in creation of life forms.

There is a strong sense of humor and desire to be the focus of attention. These are often the \"life of the party\" or \"class clown\" types. There may be a tendency to go too far with teasing and humor, sometimes at the expense of others. There is a need to learn compassion and gentleness in dealing with others. This is not done with an y intention to hurt, simply from a tendency to become carried away with impulses of the moment. Pvilans should realize that the aura of power they project to others can give the impression of being unbending and unapproach able. This can be somewhat unsettling, especially to those who are insecure or have low self-esteem. At times, others may have trouble understanding and coping with Pvilans , as they can come across as being a bit egotistical and overbearing. Often it is necessa ry to work with modifying behavior patterns, and softening the approach used in interactions with others. It is good for others to look beyond the strong forceful exterior , to allow the kindness within to be seen. When this is done, there will be an understanding that Pvilans are very caring, and will do much to help those they f eel are true friends and are deserving of their aid. In fact, at times they may tend to do t oo much for these, and may need to step back and allow others their own learning experiences. For those who become close to Pvilans, they will find them to be very loyal, devoted friends wh o easily overlook the shortcomings and flaws of those who are friends. In others, however, th ey may be very quick to judge or label these same shortcomings or flaws. It is helpful for Pvilans to learn to step back and detach from the self, as they tend to become so engrossed in their personal lives th at they may exclude others. This can be a problem with those in personal relationships, as they may feel neglected when this occurs. One of the lessons many from Pvila have chosen to work with in this lifetime is the control of ego, and learning to balance care for ot hers with care for personal needs. There is a drive to collect information, de tails, knowledge, and a desire to explore and understand everything. They possess a photogra phic type of memory. Pvilans have many careers or many possible careers, and may have se veral active careers at once as they do not like to limit themselves. They are usually kn owledgeable on many different subjects and normally ask many questions in seeking inform ation and details. There is often frustration or intolerance with those who do not seek to learn and understand with the same diligence. It is good for Pvilans to work with developi ng tolerance and understanding of those who do not share this thirst for knowledge. Pvilans are very determined and focused upon whatever their path may be any time. This path may change frequently, as they move from one pathway to another with ease. To others, it may appear as if they have difficulty in making decisions, or maintaining a focus. This is not true; they simply have a number of focuses at once with changing levels of priority! Along with their different careers, they may have a number of hobbies and areas of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 47 interest. Areas of interest will come and go as the desire for new knowledge leads them to seek ever onward. There is an ability to retain what is learned for future recall in graphic detail. Pvilans make good teachers, lecturers and authors, or may work with technical or scientific knowledge due to the ability to colle ct and retain knowledge, and the love for sharing this knowledge with others.  In relationships, those from Pvila need respect and freedom. They should seek those whose personal power and security is strong, so that they will not be intimidated. Pvilans must have time alone to reconnect and find peac e within. There is a strong need for privacy and quiet times. They balance well with others who share this need for freedom and privacy. There is an attraction to those who have softer energies. It is important that they be with others of equal intelligence, as this creates th e challenge and excitement Pvilans so enjoy. This allows energy balancing, yet maintains the intellectual stimulation that is so important for Pvilans. The mature Pvilan has learned to balance eg o needs, demands, and love for others, to care for the physical body as well as the mind, and to nurture the emotional needs of self and others. This comes with the realization that there are many forms of knowledge and worth, and the development of tolerance and patience towards those who are different. As children, Pvilans need to be given freed om to learn and explore, allowed to take many classes, visit learning centers, and be strongly supported in their desires to develop their abilities and knowledge. Patience may ofte n be needed, as there will be many questions to answer. It is important to be honest when answers to these questions are not known, and work together to find these answers. It is very important for Pvilan children to feel that parents deserve their respect; otherwise they ha ve a tendency to rebel early. If there is respect for the authority figures in their lives, they will be very supportive of these authority figures. They are very demanding of those they choose as role models, as they tend to be somewhat idealistic and easily disillusioned. As parents, it is important for Pvilans to work with strengthening patience, tolerance, and understanding. There may be a tendency to expect their children to be equally as curious, or as focused on learning at an early age as they themselves were. They must learn to honor many different types of personalities and learning characteristics. This is one of the most me aningful growth experiences for Pvilans-- the challenge of parenthood. By being with thei r children often, many Pvilans learn the joy and pleasure which comes from simple plea sures and children’s games which they may not have fully enjoyed when children themselves. It is good to simply relax, and enjoy this important period of time when it is possible to simply play. A History of Pvila and Earth Pvila began as a group of planets; only one of those remains. Pvila is in an area of the universe just beyond Pleiades and Sirius. The planet itself has a large amount of yellow and red in its appearance. It is inhabited by a vari ety of physical life forms. It is primarily 4th and 5th dimensional with a number of 6th dimensional beings in residence. Pvilans are focused on practicality and pu rpose rather than beauty or physical appearance. Few plants, stones, and animals we re brought from Pvila to Earth.

Pvilans have been much more focused on scientific exploration rather than creation of physical forms. They feel that when life forms are created which function well, and serve the desired purpose, it is best to move to other areas of learning than to continue working with the same type of expl oration. If changes are needed in life forms, they prefer to adapt and improve those already created rather than creating new life forms. When early Pvilans came to Earth they es tablished a colony in the area which is currently New Zealand. There was very little interaction with Eartheans for a number of years. After a number of years contacts were begun with those in the surrounding areas, to explore possibilities of Pvilans and Eartheans workin g together and developing relationships.

It is very difficult to change the m ind of one from Sirius, but once they have become convinced that a new path is more appropriat e, they become totally focused on the new path and release the old path quickly. Sirians have strong beliefs, ideals, and personal integrity. Sirians make loyal, trustworthy friends, but expe ct the same in return. Often they become hurt and disillusioned when these expectatio ns are not met. Those from Sirius do not share their inner personal self with others. Th ey have difficulty sharing emotions, expressing feelings and needs. To be fully accepte d and trusted as a close personal friend of a Sirian means that you have been carefully scrutin ized and scanned. Sirians may have difficulty in friendships and relationships when th ey expect to be treated in a certain way, but do not share their expectations with the others involved. It is important to work with sharing expectations and ideals, communicating need s and desires to avoid being hurt and disillusioned. This often is a result of lack of c ommunication or lack of mutual understanding and clarity in relationships. Those from Sirius tend to live in the future, some what in the present, and do not enjoy focusing on the past. They may become defens ive if forced to focus on the past by others. This is due to the fact that past pain is held within, denied and repressed rather than being dealt with at the time of occurrence. D ue to this, there may be large amounts of old emotions in need of being released. Those from Sirius do not enjoy confrontations or expressions of anger but if forced into an argument will defend themselves and their beliefs fiercely. This is particularly true if honor of th emselves or loved ones is involved. One of the lessons many Sirians have chosen to work with in th is lifetime is the importance of releasing old pain, forgiving self and others, and moving on. Sirians may be considered dreamers by some. This i s due to their active, vivid inner life. This can cause forgetfulness and a tendency to not notice \"trivial\" third dimensional things in the present. The tendency to focus on th e inner life may be a problem with those in personal relationships, as the day to day detail s of reality and needs of others may be neglected at times. They tend to be a bit messy du e to this focus on private inner life. Details which they consider unimportant are often u nnoticed. The preoccupation with inner activity may seem to others as if Sirians are self centered. They may appear inattentive and unintere sted but in actuality they are simply somewhere else and not aware of conversations and s ituations around them. Often they do not realize that those around them are unaware of t heir inner activity. Sirians may appear very calm, quiet, and reserved on the surface. It is good to be aware that this is only an outward appearance, and much activity lies within. Those in an intimate relationship with one from Sirius should develop independence and str ength to avoid feeling neglected."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 51 The mature Sirian has usually learned to balanc e self, family, and friends and to become focused on the inner life without neglecting loved ones. Those from Sirius often have a deep connection to the Earth and energies of natu re. Many Sirians have had numerous lives as American Indians, and maintain close ties and memories of these lives. These memories will become stronger as spiritual awakenin g occurs. There is often an early ability to see angels, spi rit friends, and devas which is easily accepted and utilized. Sirians are often very visu al, both in their ability to see the things which others do not see, and also in their manner o f learning. Many Sirians have a close connection with stones, crystals, and other first a nd second dimensional beings. Due to their focus on vision, and that which is vi sually seen, Sirians learn best when visual representations are given. Sirius children will do best in schools when there is much use of visual aids, hands-on activity, and when the y are allowed to physically work with models or other learning aids. With the strength o f their inner world, Sirius children need a learning environment which is very stimulating. Th ey do not learn well in a quiet, calm room of children sitting at desks. They will do be st in a room full of colors, posters, and many tables of learning aids where children can mov e freely from one area to another and explore each area as they are drawn to do so. Whil e these children love to learn, and many absorb knowledge thirstily, they must feel interest and desire or they will tend to leave and enter their private inner world. These children ha ve an extremely short attention span if they are not interested, when they become bored wit h a subject or if they feel forced to learn something they do not care about. Let these childr en participate in choosing the areas of study, move around freely, see and touch freely , and they will thrive and amaze others with the knowledge they accrue when allowed to lear n more naturally. As parents, many Sirians truly enjoy reliving chil dhood with their children, especially those who did not have their own needs met and were not allowed freedom to explore as children. For these Sirians, there may be great ple asure in buying and playing with toys, games and sports, both indoors and outdoors. It sh ould be noted, however, that the children should have choice of games, toys, and areas of pla y, not the parent. Both should enjoy this! It is important for Sirian parents to make a specia l effort to step outside of themselves and their inner world to spend time with their children , and truly know them on an inner level. If this is not done, they may find in time, that th eir children have grown up very independently, almost without being noticed, and ha ve little emotional connection to them. A History of Sirius and Earth The planets of Sirius are a large group of small p lanets which are inhabited by many varieties of life forms and civilizations. Groups w ere sent from Sirius to colonize Earth, explore, and work with creation abilities. The are as which were colonized were England, and the parts North America which are now Tennessee and Kentucky. These colonies were formed by two very different groups. Those who sett led in England were responsible for establishing the original Stonehenge. The original purpose of Stonehenge was to help with establishing communication with many of the other b eings who had colonized Earth. It was designed to create a powerful energy vortex and was used for many purposes. When the original Stonehenge was destroyed, it was later reb uilt based upon memories which some of the original Sirians recalled many lifetimes later. Many of the later Earth teachings of those"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 52 who considered themselves “druids” were based upon knowledge the original Sirians had shared with Eartheans. This was handed down through many generations, and much yet remains upon the planet, although not widely known. Those who colonized North America worked with thos e Eartheans who are now called Native Americans. Over many years, much interactio n and interbreeding, the physical form of these Eartheans and Sirians who blended together was altered, such as skin coloring. This group of Sirius beings was of a red skin tone. Much of the Indian folklore, tales, and history are based upon that which was shared or tau ght by Sirius settlers, along with a number of the ancient traditions, rituals, and cere monies. Currently, a number of beings from Sirius are conc erned with the well being and development of Earth and humans. These communicate primarily on a spirit level with those of interest, occasionally share information t hrough forms of channeling but very rarely show themselves physically to humans. Many who are of Sirius origin may meet other Sirians like themselves on a spirit level, during m editation or spirit travel and receive information, guidance, or simply reacquaint themsel ves with old friends in this manner. These are favored ways of communication with those who are on Earth. Sirian DNA DNA from Sirius was brought to Earth at the time o f Earth’s creation to create life forms. These were also added to and changed by som e of the Sirian colonizers.

There is an outer smooth energy with an appearance of st rength and capability. They tend to be knowledgeable in a wide variety of areas an d may be trivia collectors for information concerning their areas of interest. They have a variety of talents and capabilities, are quite creative and often have an ability to combine creat ive expression with intellectual expression. They may be artists, designers, inventors, a rchitects or in current times may work more closely with creativity through new or expanding technologies. Their methods of working with technology will differ from many, as it is based more on “feeling” than on intellectual understanding. They do well at beginning proj ects, but less well at completing them. There may be lessons to aid Vegans in learning self discipline and will power, or they may surround themselves with others who are supportive an d will aid in the completion of projects and ideas. Those from Vega are travelers who seek va riety, challenge, and understanding of the many questions they have within. They may be come bored easily. They tend to analyze, question, and doubt all which they do not under stand, does not meet their belief system, or simply does not “feel” right. Although quite w illing to learn, change, and grow Vegans need understanding to occur on an inner level to allo w opening within for change to occur. This understanding will not be of a practical, logical nature. It will be an inner comprehension which will be more a “feeling” that leads to “knowing” rather than a technical understanding. Most from Vega have a strong sense of responsibility, nurturing, and caring. They may find much fulfillment in working with childre n, those who are ill or in need of care and support. At times however, they may be over ly responsible for others, and may need to remind themselves of the importance of teaching responsibility, as well as being responsible. They may need to work with developing a strong er sense of feeling the integrity of others, as they may find themselves taken advantage of due to their caring nature. They may find others attracted to their understanding energy, and may be approached in many situations by others wishing to share personal problems. It should be noted that few from Vega are themselves willing to share personal details with others, unless trust is established. Vegans have healing abilities, and may have an affinity for stones and crystals. Many from Vega work in caring for others in the area of health care, either physical or mental, or as teachers, or in areas which allow freedom of creat ive expression. They have a strong need for time alone, privacy, and freedom from restrict ions. It is important that they be shown appreciation for what is done for others. Thos e in personal relationships with Vegans may at times be in need of more attention, and ma y be somewhat neglected, due to their many interests and areas of focus. They may become so involved with caring for others, that they neglect personal needs and personal relationships. Vega children will learn best in surroundin gs which combine a structured learning environment with creative stimulation. Any le arning activity which stimulates and allows"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 59 them to use the very active “imagination” will see them enjoying learning. Writing stories, songs, plays, and inventing games are some areas which will greatly appeal to the Vegan child. Allow them to imagine a story or play in a historical time period and these children will enjoy doing research and exploring time peri ods. There is likely to be a resistance to structured traditional learning which simply requires memorization of “facts”. These children are apt to be perfectionists and expect mu ch of themselves and those they love. It is important to teach them tolerance, patience and to honor the differences among all. As parents, Vegans may need to work with being a bit more relaxed with parenting. In the beginning they are likely to expect th emselves to be the “perfect parents”, and to expect “perfect children”. Of course this is not possible, and will lead to frustration with themselves, their partner and their children. Th ey will discover a need to be discerning as their children grow older, due to their tendencies to idealize their children. Children may take advantage of this, and learn manipulation through emotion by playing the roles they are expected to play. Overall, Vegans tend to trea t their children as friends as they grow older, and to have good communication with them. A History of Vega and Earth When Vegans first came to Earth, they settled in the area which is now Austria. There was one original colony in that area. The Vegans were dedicated explorers who had many colonies on planets around the universe. Their colonies were focused on learning as much as possible about many varied realities, survival in these realities, and peaceful co- existence with the beings who inhabited these planets being settled. At that time, there were many uninhabited planets in this universe. There were also many lightly inhabited planets which had beginnings of settlements by a number of groups who realized that there was much to be learned through exploration, and colonizing of new planets. The Earth settlers from Vega quickly ad apted to life on Earth. Rather than attempting to teach Eartheans and share knowle dge they preferred to alter their ways to blend with those which existed upon the planet already. In their contacts with nearby Eartheans, they chose to appear as “normal” as possible and asked be taught Earth ways. Although their physical forms were differe nt, this was quite common, and much more acceptable in the early days of Earth than it would currently be. They had capability of using their higher energy levels to ease any feelings of distrust Eartheans might feel due to the physical differences. There was awareness among the original Vegan settlers that in time, they would become as Eartheans and incarnate in that re ality for long periods. It was known and planned that these Vegans who acted as settl ers, and became as Eartheans, would be monitored and watched over. This would be done to allow exploration of patterns which would develop in these beings, and the effects up on them on a spirit level. It was planned that at a certain point, contact with these would be established, and aid given if needed. There are number of contacts with those fr om Vega in the current time period. These are most often contacts with Earth people who originate from Vega, have worked with Vegans in previous lives, or are the current in carnation of original Vega settlers. These are often people in healing professions, as Vegans have a strong interest in teaching and aiding Earth people in learning. Channeled informatio n is given at times by Vegans, although they"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 60 often do not identify themselves by planetary origin, but would be more likely to simply use a name in communications. Beings from Vega ha ve a strong sense of humor, compassion, lack of ego, and patience with the Earth people they work with.

The many differences among all beings add to the availa bility of experiences. There is no good, no evil, simply varying levels of experience. As l ong as each being learns from the experiences it encounters, and growth occurs as a r esult, this is as intended by Prime Creator. Many experiences which you on Earth consi der problems, painful or bad, are necessary growth experiences. In any total being, there are aspects of everythin g. There is no being physical on your planet, or any other planet, that is of total good or of total “evil”. It is simply that one chooses to manifest a certain energy type or person ality type in a given situation or lifetime. Each of you can recall many times when f aced with decisions and choices, you have felt distinct differences within the aspects o f yourself and varying desires to react in different ways. Know that this is so in all beings . Regardless of the choices made in a given lifetime, there are always aspects of self wh ich have desires for other actions and choices. In this book, the terms “light” and “dark” are used for purpose of making a differentiation between types of energies. It is n ot a judgment, but for those who are physical, a lesson in discernment and knowledge. For most who will read this, you have chosen to be of light nature, to focus on spiritual growth and to serve Prime Creator by anch oring light. Being of this energy, it is important to have an understanding not only of your self and others of light but also those who are of opposing energy. In this time when the focus of light workers is planetary transformation and ascension, there are many of dar ker energies who oppose this and attempt to alter the work of those of light. The Darker Planets and Their Associations with Eart h ZETA The beings who originated on the Zeta planets, of w hich there are many, are called the Reptilians. There are many branches of this fa mily. These beings have long been associated with Earth. In the times when Earth was colonized by many groups, and these groups had begun to blend with Eartheans to the poi nt where much of their powers had been lost, the Reptilians began to visit Earth. Th ese visits were different in that there was no desire to colonize, or live on Earth to learn ab out Earth reality. They instead planned to use Earth very much as a laboratory to experimen t with genetic manipulation with these Earth beings. This was done in manners which did not honor free will, and which were aimed at creating eventual control of the plan et. The branch of the Reptilian family which is most w ell known on Earth in the current time period, and which affects Earth realit y most strongly, is the branch which"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"   63 originated on the planets of Zeta Reticuli. There are five planets in this group, and the appearance varies slightly with each. These beings are commonly called the Greys. Their experimentation with genetic structure and manipula tion has led to their own genetic alteration. They have been altered to a point wher e they feel no emotion and do not need a physical food supply. Instead they nourish themsel ves though certain frequencies that are emitted by humans. These are the frequencies that are emitted when certain emotions are felt, such as: anger, fear, jealousy, and any varia tions of these. The Greys are currently very popular in Earth movies and books, as those wh o have been manipulated and abducted by them are coming forward. However, many of these humans do not have full understanding of what has happened, and what is hap pening with these beings. They are strongly attempting to affect planetary history, ev ents, and population. The Greys and Reptilians have done much in the way of manipulation of human genetics and DNA, although others also participated . They are focused totally upon technology and advancement, with no concern for spi ritual development. Those who incarnate as these beings often do so to experience that type of reality. They are very capable and have much highly advanced technology. The Greys are one group who have agreements with some of the Earth governments, and have shared some minor technology with intention of establishing relations and contro l abilities. There are others of the Reptilian family who inhab it areas of the inner planet Earth, on what they consider Earth bases. These have been told of in many tales, fables and myths and appear as “lizard people” and “snake peop le”. Theirs are the ships sighted often entering or leaving the oceans of the planet, as mo st of their bases are deep below the oceans and can only be entered by them, using their technology. These also feed upon negative type frequencies and often work with the G reys. They are often seen together during abductions. Some who are abducted from Eart h are taken to these bases for purposes of experimentation and genetic transplanti ng. These are usually not returned and if returned have no conscious memory, but a cha nged personality would be apparent. Both Reptilians and Greys work heavily with implan ting those who are contacted. There are many types of implants. Some of the most common are used for tracking, communication, propaganda, recording, and activatin g body cycles. While some are activated at the time of implantation, others are d ormant until activated by a certain frequency at a chosen time. The implants used for propaganda or public relations by these are used to help them create interest among humans for greater willingness and desire to be abducted. A number of those who are implanted a re used for this purpose. These are given a happy and positive experience or memories, and used to spread positive imagery throughout the population. When the implants are a ctivated, they give the person a strong desire to share their experiences with other s. Many are also given misleading or false information to share with others. Others who are implanted by the Greys are used for a process of reseeding, or the rebuilding of their race, which they are working wi th. Their experimentations with genetic alterations have resulted in their own inability to physically reproduce among themselves. Through a crossbreeding process using human genetic samples, they are attempting to create a new branch of Greys who will be capable of reproduction. There is also a process of seeding two other planets in preparation for the possible loss of Earth as a food supply."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 64 This is in the event that Earth planetary ascension should occur. They intend to prevent this from happening, but are aware that many are wo rking to make this occur. The crossbreeding with humans occurs during many a bductions, either through the taking of samples of human sperm or ova. When sper m samples are taken from a human male, it is done through use of tools during a medi cal type of examination or through simulated sexual intercourse with a female Grey. Th e sperm samples are then blended with genetic material from a Grey chosen for this p urpose and grown in a specialized laboratory type area of certain ships. If an ovum is taken from a human female, it is blended with a sample of genetic material from a ma le Grey and returned to the female body after fertilization occurs. After a period of growth, usually three months, a return visit is made and the embryo is taken from the womb . Growth is completed in the special area of a ship used for this purpose. Occasionally , parents of these mixed children are later taken and allowed to meet these children and bond if the parents are willing. This is encouraged as it is found that some of these childr en need or benefit from the emotions and affection that humans need, but Greys are not capab le of feeling. The visits are brief and occasional, but seem to be important for the growth and health of this new race. It is important to know that these beings cannot a ffect nor have power or control over you unless you allow this. Through doubt, fear , feelings of unworthiness and expectation many allow themselves to be used in thi s way. While there is little concern with individual feelings or free will, the Greys mu st respect power and light. If any, by claiming personal power and right, deny them access and demand to be left alone, they will be left alone. This demand and claim must be done with confidence and power, as the frequency transmitted by fear, doubt and self-lack are interpreted by the Greys as a giving up of power. As those of you on a spiritual pathwa y work with raising planetary frequency, personal frequencies, and becoming more empowered beings of light, this lessens the amount of available food source for the se beings. Due to the large amount of awakening and spiritually focused beings on Earth c urrently, other methods are being used to create the frequencies they need for energy supply. Some of these include many of the television shows and movies which create and st ir anger, fear, and a tendency to violent behavior in many. Some who have implants a re forced to act in ways which create fear in others, such as violent behavior. This information is given to create knowledge and awareness. Remember always that light is knowledge, and knowledge brings power . Through deepening personal empowerment you aid in the process of bringing ligh t to Earth. Zeta DNA A small amount of DNA was brought to Earth from t he planets of Zeta during its creation and used to create life forms, these would be the following: Animals Scorpions Slug Snail Tarantula "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"   65 Plants and Trees Birch Poison ivy Nettles Stickleburrs Stones Stibnite LYRA There are a number of beings who originate from the planets of Lyra. Those who are to be discussed in this chapter are those who affec t Earth reality most strongly. There are two basic types of Lyrans interacting with Earth cu rrently. The control figures physically resemble an Earth praying mantis, but are much larg er in size. The more average Lyran is of a more humanoid form, with large eyes much like those of a Grey, but having an insectoid-like appearance. Some females have hair, and can be attractive to Eartheans. There would be a “feel” to their energy which could make others uncomfortable or feel that they are somewhat insectlike. There are some Lyrans who work with the Greys, and are seen on ships and remembered as soothing and calmin g abductees. The Lyrans are quite scientific, but have a strong interest in learning about and observing human emotions. Through time, experimenta tion and genetic exploration, they have bred out the majority of the emotional capabil ity of their race. This was done intentionally, but led to a realization that lack o f emotion also results in a lack of focus and drive at times. Eartheans are being studied and exp lored as the Lyrans are currently attempting to correct and alter this characteristic without becoming themselves as highly emotional as Eartheans. They consider humans to be fascinating due their wide variety and capability of experiencing emotions. Lyrans have the ability to temporarily alter their physical appearance. This allows them freedom to physically visit Earth realities an d interact with humans. There would not be a visible difference, although an energy dif ference would be apparent to those sensitive to energies. If encountered they appear friendly on the surface, interested in activities and eager to learn. Lyrans are especially focused on the activities of Light workers in this time period, due to their openness. This allows the Lyrans to a ttempt to slow the process of planetary ascension. There are also strong attempts being mad e now to send misinformation through channeling to light workers due to this same openne ss. There are strong abilities to access information within humans by establishing these typ es of contacts. Due to this, much of the information shared is very padded in light term inology and must be carefully felt to discern the true intent within the information give n. This is often deceptive information. A primary difference between Greys and Lyrans is the observance of free will. Where this is"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 66 observed by Greys, it is not with Lyrans. Their fas cination with human emotions leads them often to experiment with manipulation of human emotions through these interactions. Lyrans are like Greys in that they also work with implanting humans and abductions, but do not allow conscious memory in th e majority of these situations. The exceptions would be when memory is allowed. These a re given good memories and led to think of themselves as very special for being conta cted in that way. Lyran DNA Some of the life forms on Earth which originated f rom DNA from the planets of Lyra include the following: Animals Bat Praying mantis Dodo bird Rat Earthworm Tapeworm Hookworms Termite Lizard Walking sticks Octopus Weasel Pinworm Worms Plants Amanita Mistletoe Baobab Seaweed Cubeb Trillium Linden Valerian Mesquite Stones Cinnabar Pyrrhotite Muscovite Talc Opal ALPHA CENTAURI There are several types of beings from Alpha Centau ri. Those who will be discussed here are the ones who affect Earth reality most str ongly in this time period, these are called Alphadrons. The Alphadrons have long been k nown as a warlike group of beings with a military-like focus. They were known throug hout the universe in this way, through tales of the many planets they had conquered. The A lphadrons are somewhat humanoid-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"   67 insectoid in appearance. Their eyes appear much lik e those of bees or flies on Earth. This type of body form has a humanoid torso and legs, wh ile the arms would be insectlike. They are somewhat like the Reptilians in their int erest in technology, but are of a much more military attitude. There is no interest i n spiritual development, but strong interest in discipline, control, ruling order, and manipulation of certain aspects of Earth reality. They have a strong interest in the oil ind ustry of the planet and are based primarily in the inner Earth Middle Eastern area. They also have had strong interest throughout Eart h’s history in areas such as Stonehenge and other power centers, as they are att racted to areas where high technology is being developed. In early times of Earth, there were tales in many of these power areas of the Alphadrons and the human sacrifices given to them by Eartheans who feared them. This was done in attempt to appease the Alphadrons, as in the early Earth times, the Alphadrons were more open in their taking of humans . These sacrifices were not killed, but left in areas where the Alphadrons were known t o live, such as caves and caverns. The Alphadrons have highly developed methods of cr eating holographic constructions which allow them to temporarily assum e human form, or appear to be human when viewed. Using these, they interact with Eartheans when desired. The length of time, and type of holographic images used is monitored and controlled by others at their bases. This type of disguise is used duri ng abductions. This allows abductions to be done without calling attention to themselves. T he primary difference in the abductions of Alphadrons, and those of Greys and Lyrans, is th at those who are abducted by Alphadrons do not return. They are most often kept , either for breeding or for food supply. The abductions of the Alphadrons do not appear to b e UFO related or extraterrestrial at all, as this is not the appearance they desire to g ive. On the surface, these abductions would appear to be kidnappings or situations where disappearances occur with no clues or reasons behind them.
